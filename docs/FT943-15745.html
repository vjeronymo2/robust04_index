			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Ailing dollar driven lower The dollar lost more ground against both the D-Mark and the yen yesterday as markets assumed that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged for the time being, writes Motoko Rich. The US currency lost about 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close in London at DM1.5685 from DM1.5826. Against the yen the dollar ended above the session's low of Y97.70 in London at Y98.125, down from Y98.825. In New York, however, it rallied to finish at DM1.5778 and Y98.90. Germany's currency remained strong in Europe as investors continued to pressure the Swedish krona, Belgian franc and Italian lira while markets focused on these countries' budget deficits. Sterling followed the dollar down against the D-Mark, hitting a 15-month low against the German currency. As South African President Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic policy would remain unchanged under new finance minister Mr Chris Liebenberg, the financial rand held steady against the dollar. As the markets awaited an announcement on the final day of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve Board, investors bearishly assumed that a dollar support package was not forthcoming and pushed the US currency down to a 14-month low against the D-Mark. Markets were not expecting a rise in US interest rates, and when the Fed added reserves to the banking system it signalled no monetary policy changes. In late trading the dollar came off the session's lows as analysts suggested that the Fed could be waiting to make an interest rate move tomorrow when the US employment figures are released. Hopes for concerted intervention or the emergence of co-ordinated interest rate pol-icies to rescue the dollar collapsed when German economic minister Mr Guenter Rexrodt indicated that the Bundesbank had been opposed to the most recent round of interven-tion on behalf of the dollar. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, said Mr Rexrodt could be playing a psychological game and setting a bear trap. 'But I do not think the German administration or the Bundesbank are overly concerned about the level of the dollar against the D-Mark,' he added. The dollar rallied slightly after Mr Lawrence Summers, undersecretary of the US Treasury for international affairs, said the US currency would be discussed at the G7 economic summit meeting which begins tomorrow in Naples. In addition to benefiting from the dollar's weakness, the D-Mark performed well as it continued to play the safe haven currency for investors repelled by gaping budget def-icits in Sweden, Italy and Belgium. The Swedish krona sagged to SKr5.004 from SKr4.955, breaking through the psychologically important barrier of SKr5.00 against the D-Mark as jittery markets took a negative view of Sweden's raised budget deficit forecast. The Italian lira was also flirting with an important level of L1,000 against the D-Mark as the markets waited for today's publication of Italy's three-year plan, in which the government will need to address its budget deficit. In London the lira closed at L995.5 from L993.8. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Belgian franc weakened quite sharply against the D-Mark by Belgian standards, as it normally trades within very narrow margins. 'There is a growing concern that the budget will not be settled in a satisfactory way, and that the political coalition is breaking down,' he said. The Belgian franc finished in London at BFr20.67 from BFr20.63. Sterling fell to a 15-month low against the D-Mark, mirroring the sickly dollar and further depressed by a rumour that an unnamed UK official said the Treasury would be indifferent even if the pound fell to DM2.00. Mr Tony Norfield, economist at ABN/Amro, said sterling performed poorly against the D-Mark in spite of good industrial production figures. UK industrial production rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent in May after 1.6 per cent in April. Analysts said these figures indicated a healthily steady industrial recovery. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 217m liquidity at established rates after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 850m. The Bank gave late assistance of Pounds 590m. The markets held their ground with the financial rand as Mr Nelson Mandela reassured businesses that economic policy was on course after the resignation of Mr Derek Keys as finance minister. Mr Mandela said Mr Chris Liebenberg, who replaced Mr Keys after he resigned on Tuesday, would 'follow government policy'. The rand finished in London at R4.84 against the dollar from R4.845. The December short sterling futures contract closed at 93.67 from 93.73. The December Euromark contract finished at 94.97 from 94.95.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolai Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The parliament's Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb said he was  ready to assume the responsibilities of the head of state if for  some reason the Central Election Commission recognized invalid  the presidential elections on June 23.    He said at a press conference in Minsk on Tuesday [21 June]  that in accordance with the Constitution the powers of the  president would automatically go to the parliament's speaker if  the elections failed to take place.    Hryb avoided prognostication of the results of the coming  elections and refused to say for whom he would vote.    Hryb said that the future president must concentrate on  achievement of accord in the society. "No prosperity and  well-being for the people can be achieved without accord," he  stressed.    Certain media editions blamed the Central Election  Commission  for the particular attention attributed by Belarusian television  to the election campaigns of some of the candidates for the  presidency.    Tens of foreign monitors have arrived in Belarus in order to  control the elections. Hundreds of journalists from the CIS and  other countries will be reporting on the presidential elections.    However, the poll conducted by the Institute of Sociology  under the Belarusian Academy of Sciences on Tuesday showed that  about 80 percent of Belarusian voters would not come to ballot  boxes. All the same, this does not mean that the president will  be elected in the first round, experts said.</p>

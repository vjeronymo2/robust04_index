			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / People: Davison departs A 'disappointed' Gerald Davison, the motor trade veteran who first made a name for himself knocking Honda's UK sales network into place as director of operations in the early 1980s, has departed as chairman of motor distributor Keep Trust. The move follows Keep's sale by its Dublin-based parent group Fitzwilton to dealer T Cowie for Pounds 40m. Davison took on the Keep job in 1990 on the basis that it would be built up and floated at an appropriate time - 'so its disposal has been something of a disappointment.' Early warning that Fitzwilton was deciding to step out of motor business - its Pounds 500m turnover is provided largely by cash and carry, light manufacturing and luxury goods sales - came at the end of last year. At that time it sold off its Norfolk Finance car leasing subsidiary - chairman Gerald Davison - to US giant AT &amp; T. Davison, 50, who briefly stepped out of the motor trade in the mid-1980s to run Jersey's Evening Post publishing group, says he will being looking for 'another challenge' in the motor industry - but he will not do so until he has finished the final polishing of his second book on Chinese art.</p>

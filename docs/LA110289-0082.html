			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINDOW OPENS FOR W. HOLLYWOOD CONDOS;  </P> <P> HOUSING: A NEW POLICY WILL LET OWNERS OF ILLEGALLY CONVERTED CONDOS WHO BOUGHT  THEM BETWEEN DEC. 17, 1986, AND JULY 13 OF THIS YEAR SELL UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN  IMMOBILIZED IN LEGAL CROSS-FIRE.  </P> <P> Hundreds of West Hollywood condominium owners trapped in a legal battle between  the city and developers accused of illegally converting apartments to  condominiums have won two victories that may spring them free.  </P> <P> City officials announced Tuesday that they would issue substitute permits that  would legally designate units as condominiums if they were bought between Dec.  17, 1986, and July 13, 1989, from developers who made illegal conversions. The  permits would allow owners to sell units that have been immobilized.  </P> <P> "For all intents and purposes, we are allowing these units to be considered as  condominiums," said City Atty. Michael Jenkins. "We are doing this because we  think it is the right thing to do."  </P> <P> "It sounds like this should take care of the problem," said condominium owner  Steve Sapunor. "But they have yet to write the ordinance, the actual language  on permits."  </P> <P> The city's announcement is the latest action on the West Hollywood law  preventing the conversion of apartment buildings to condominiums without city  approval. The state Supreme Court last Thursday agreed to review a July appeals  court decision upholding the law.  </P> <P> The ban on condominium conversions has been a legal bouncing ball since West  Hollywood, upon its cityhood in 1984, placed a moratorium on the conversions.  </P> <P> In 1986, the city strengthened the ban, adopting an ordinance prohibiting the  conversion of rental units without obtaining city permits.  </P> <P> Building owners went ahead with conversions, citing permission granted by Los  Angeles County before West Hollywood's incorporation, and the city went to  court to attempt to halt the sale of former apartment units as condominiums.  Los Angeles Superior Court judges ruled against the city on three occasions.  </P> <P> The city was victorious in the most recent round, when a state Court of Appeal  in July directed a lower court to issue a restraining order barring future  conversions.  </P> <P> City officials interpreted the July decision as giving them complete control  over what will happen to 26 buildings with nearly 600 units, at least 300 of  which were sold to individuals whose property rights were called into question.  </P> <P> Residents who had bought the units between the 1986 ordinance and the July  decision suddenly found their ownership of the units called into question.  Because they were unable to obtain the proper city permits designating the  units as condominiums, many owners who wished to sell were unable to do so. In  addition, realty agents had been steering potential buyers away from the units  while they floated in legal limbo.  </P> <P> Mayor Abbe Land said the city had been negotiating a solution to the problem  long before last week's announcement by the state Supreme Court.  </P> <P> "We found . . . that some people were kind of stuck," Land said. "It has never  been our intention to hold people from doing what they want."  </P> <P> Under the city's plan, expected to be formalized at the Nov. 6 City Council  meeting, qualified owners will be able to fill out simple forms allowing them  to have their property legally declared condominiums.  </P> <P> Permits will be automatically granted to those who show they bought their  disputed units within the specified time period. Those buying condominiums  after July 13 would be subject to individual scrutiny, Jenkins said.  </P> <P> Land said there would be no fees for the permits.  </P> <P> Condominium owners took cautious heart in the city's announcement, but some are  still skeptical.  </P> <P> "I only doubt it from past experience. They have made promises before," said  owner Eric Pearl. Pearl became embroiled in a heated exchange with Jenkins on  Tuesday when he questioned the sincerity of the deal. "It is also three or four  months too late. Property values have dropped; it's now a buyer's market. And  people are still afraid to come look at the buildings."  </P></p>

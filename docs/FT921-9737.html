			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Blast at Grangemouth docks kills workman A workman died and at least three others suffered multiple injuries yesterday after an explosion and fire at Grangemouth docks on the Firth of Forth in eastern Scotland. Police feared there could be more casualties. The explosion, at 5.05pm, appears to have occurred during the filling of a BP oil storage tank under construction at the dockyard. Eyewitnesses said there was a loud bang and they saw flames shoot into the air. BP Chemicals said: 'There was some protective sheeting being used in the construction work and there has been a fire in that sheeting.' The fire was still burning two hours after the explosion. Thick smoke covered the Grangemouth area and was drifting across the estuary to Fife. Police advised people to stay indoors. Grangemouth docks are close to a large BP chemical complex, but the company said it was not affected.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Building site safety hangs by a thread: Diane Summers on an initiative to reduce accidents in construction AN EVIL-looking hook is dangling from a piece of frayed rope. The contraption is supporting a plastic dustbin full of building materials which is being hauled by workmen up and down the outside of a three-storey building in north London. A short distance down the road, Mr Tim Small, Her Majesty's Inspector of Factories, is observing the scene from his car. 'This is a fairly typical set-up,' he says. 'It's cheaper to use old dustbins but they're not designed to be loaded like that. The work is close to the pavement - if the dustbin gives way, a member of the public could be seriously injured. We'd better take a look.' The work in progress is a re-roofing job, involving the addition of an extra storey to the building. Such work is among the most dangerous: one in five of all deaths in construction occurs during roof work. About three workers a month are killed falling off roofs and numerous passers-by are hit, sometimes fatally, by falling materials. Those figures are for the UK alone. Europe-wide, construction provides just 8 per cent of total employment but accounts for 16 per cent of serious accidents. Fatal accidents in construction occur at three to five times the rate of industry generally. EC directives aimed at tightening up site safety are on the way and this year has been declared the year of safety, hygiene and health protection at work by the European Commission. As part of the initiative, the Health and Safety Executive is 'blitzing' building sites involving roof work in an inspection campaign across the country. The campaign will not mean any more inspectors on the streets, but Mr Small and his colleagues will be concentrating their efforts on roofs during the next four months, the busiest period in the roof work industry. Outside the north London building, closer examination of the hook supporting the dustbin shows it to be an improvised job, fashioned out of a bent reinforcing rod. 'We'll have to put a stop to them using that straight away,' says Mr Small, leaping up a couple of ladders and some scaffolding in search of the workmen. At the top of the building he looks down for evidence of 'bombing'  - debris thrown into the garden. This practice is strictly verboten, says Mr Small, except on sealed-off demolition sites. Thankfully, no bombing seems to have taken place. Back at ground level, a labourer grumbles that it is not his day: 'First the van's wheelclamped, now you lot. I've never even seen a factory inspector before.' Yes, they would have preferred to have used a proper chute instead of the dustbin, but the boss didn't want to spend the money and they were cutting corners all round on this job. No, they didn't have any hard hats but, as it happened, the boss would be around with some later. The boss arrives (no hard hats) to find out what is going on. Mr Small delivers a lecture on the dangers of improvised hoisting gear. He is told of a fatal case involving a falling bucket of boiling bitumen and a member of the public. A legal notice is served forbidding the further use of the dustbin-and-hook arrangement. The boss's attention is caught by the phrase 'fine of up to Pounds 20,000' if the legal notice is ignored. Mr Small promises to send a safety information pack. 'I don't expect he'll read it, but if there's an accident in future at least it'll be on file that he's had it. If there's a prosecution, we could bring that to the court's attention.' It is the sixth time in the week that he has served a legal notice at a construction site. He says it is good to keep the batting average up  - everyone is impressed if you can point to an increased number of notices served and more prosecutions than in the previous year. But he has reservations about the time consumed in bringing cases to court and the paltry fines that often follow. 'It's not always the best use of time,' he says. 'There might be a Pounds 150 fine for not wearing a hard hat and the magistrate asks why you're picking on the guy. When you're in the office preparing paperwork for a case, you're not out there where you should be, stopping the things that are dangerous.'</p>

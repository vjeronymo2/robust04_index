			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLD FRONT MAY SPARK RECORD USE OF ELECTRICITY  </P> <P> Cold weather coupled with the holidays is expected to set another record for  electricity use this weekend, just days after San Diegans broke the old record,  utility officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Last Sunday morning, the demand for electricity reached almost 1,500 megawatts  -- nearly 1.5 billion watts of electricity, said Fred Vaughn, spokesman for San  Diego Gas &amp; Electric. On an average day, usage is about 1,200 megawatts at  that time.  </P> <P> The temperature Sunday was 36, a record for that date, according to the  National Weather Service in San Diego. The previous low for Dec. 23 was 37  degrees in 1891.  </P> <P> Cold air is coming south like an express train from the Yukon, forecaster  Wilbur Shigehara said.  </P> <P> The front brings with it a 20% chance of rain and snowfall today, but skies  will turn clear and cold through New Year's Day, Shigehara said. Temperatures  in downtown San Diego will approach record lows in the upper 30s on Sunday and  Monday nights, he said.  </P> <P> No overflow damage is expected, but the highest high tides in 17 years are also  expected Monday, he said, adding that tides will peak at 7.8 feet at 8:14 a.m.  Monday. Beach-goers should be wary of waves that can come in by surprise during  high tide, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> Temperatures at the beaches today should range from 60 to 65, 58 to 62  Saturday, and 52 to 56 Sunday and Monday. The surf is 2 to 4 feet, and the  water temperature is a nippy 57 degrees.  </P> <P> Coastal temperatures will hover between 59 and 65 today, 55 to 60 Saturday, and  53 to 58 Sunday and Monday, Shigehara said. Nighttime lows of 40 to 50 are  predicted tonight, falling to 35 to 45 Saturday, and 30 to 40 Sunday and  Monday.  </P> <P> In the inland areas, highs will range from 62 to 69 today, drop to 57 to 62  Saturday, and 54 to 58 Sunday and Monday, Shigehara said. Nighttime lows will  dip to 38 to 48 tonight, 30 to 40 Saturday and 26 to 36 Sunday and Monday, he  said.  </P> <P> In the mountains, temperatures will hover in the 40s today, fall to 35 to 45 on  Saturday, and to 28 to 34 Sunday and Monday, Shigehara said. Not much snow is  expected, but winds that can make temperatures feel colder may be a problem.  Nighttime temperatures will drop to 28 to 35 tonight, hover in the 20s  Saturday, and fall to 12 to 22 Sunday and Monday, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> In the deserts, gusts up to 35 m.p.h. are expected over the weekend.  Temperatures will hover in the 50s today, and range from 45 to 55 through  Monday, according to the forecast. Nighttime temperatures will dip to 35 to 45  tonight, drop to the 30s Saturday, and fall as low as 25 to 32 Sunday and  Monday, Shigehara said.  </P></p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Dorrell promise on M-way charging Mr Stephen Dorrell, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday told the Commons transport committee that the government intended to proceed with direct charging for motorway use, probably through electronic pricing. He could not, however, put a date on when charging would be introduced or how much it could be expected to raise. He said the charges would be in addition to existing taxes. The hope was that the money would be ring-fenced and spent on motorways. A green paper issued by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, earlier this year said that direct charging for motorways could raise Pounds 11bn a year but this would depend on the level of tariffs. Mr Ian Wilson, a Treasury official, said transport taxes raised Pounds 22.4bn a year, far more than was spent on motorways, but it went into an integrated budget.</p>

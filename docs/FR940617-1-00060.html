			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The general safety aspects of povidone-iodine that concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 1234 to 1236) are addressed elsewhere as follows: (1) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of povidone-iodine on wound healing. Based upon submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data, the agency concluded in the first aid antiseptic segment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rulemaking that non-surfactant iodophor products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (povidone-iodine) do not delay wound healing. See comment 42 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that document (56 FR 33644 at 33662). Also, the Advisory Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panel on OTC Antimicrobial II Drug Products reviewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> povidone-iodine's effect on wound healing in its report on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> topical antifungal drug products and concluded that the drug did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not affect wound healing (47 FR 12480 at 12545). (2) The effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of povidone-iodine on thyroid function. In comment 41 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products (56 FR 33644 at 33661), the agency discusses studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that indicate that topically applied povidone-iodine does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause thyroid dysfunction. (3) The proposed warning about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interaction of starch-containing products with iodophors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting in serosal adhesions and other undesirable effects,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.e., ``Caution: Do not use this product in the presence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> starch-containing products. Starch can adsorb iodophors and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting complex can cause serosal adhesions (abnormal union of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the serous membranes) and other undesirable effects in the body''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (43 FR 1210 at 1221). The agency has reevaluated the proposal and decided that the warning is not supported by the data. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section I.I., comment 16.) (4) The agency's concern regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molecular weights of povidone-iodine greater than 35,000 daltons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not being excreted by the kidney and causing lymph node changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In section I.I., comment 18, the agency discusses a previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed warning regarding this subject and determines, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more recent data, that larger povidone-iodine molecules are not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk when the product is limited to the topical uses included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this tentative final monograph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency's concern about the need for expiration dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (not to exceed 2 years after manufacture) because of the lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stability data for several iodophor preparations, which relates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the effectiveness of the product, can be satisfied by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the current good manufacturing practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations (21 CFR parts 210 and 211). These regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include, among other things, requirements regarding stability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing and expiration dating (see &sect;&sect;211.137 and 211.166).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, as discussed in comment 40 of the tentative final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 33661), data on the stability of povidone-iodine and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed 2-year expiration date are no longer considered needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this rulemaking proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second agency concern relating to effectiveness was the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate of release of ``free'' iodine from the complex and whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there was evidence of germicidal activity over a period of time in clinical application (43 FR 1210 at 1235). As discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tentative final monograph for OTC topical acne drug products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (comment 5, 50 FR 2172 at 2173), iodine is released from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> povidone-iodine complex within milliseconds, thus resolving this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the effectiveness of health-care antiseptic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses subject to this rulemaking, the agency has reviewed the data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and information on povidone-iodine's germicidal in vitro and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antiseptic in vivo effectiveness (Refs. 1 through 19) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concludes that the data are sufficient to reclassify this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredient from Category III to Category I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A series of in vitro controlled studies (Ref. 1&hyph;C133,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volume 1) included a broad spectrum of test micro-organisms which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were associated with between 40 to 60 percent of the nosocomial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infections in the urinary tract, surgical wounds, pneumonia, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bloodstream, reported by the National Nosocomial Infections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Surveillance System (NNIS) for the period from January 1985 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 1988 (Ref. 2). In most instances, these test micro-organisms, as proposed in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii) (see section I.C.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment 6), were killed after 0.5 to 5 minutes exposure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> povidone-iodine. A minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 1&hyph;C133) using 30 cultures, both American Type Culture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Collection (ATCC) and recent skin isolates, was also included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this series of in vitro studies. The results indicated a range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for MIC from 87 parts per million (ppm) to 492 ppm for dilutions of povidone-iodine solution and 83 ppm to 476 ppm for dilutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of povidone-iodine surgical scrub depending on the test micro-organism. Tests with controls, neutralizer, and organic load  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using a serial dilution method were included in the study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gocke, Ponticas, and Pollack (Ref. 3) evaluated the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> susceptibility of 230 clinical isolates from blood, urine,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sputum, and wound cultures to the bacteriocidal activity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> povidone-iodine. These clinical isolates contained over half the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organisms included in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii). Results indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that 106 of the 230 organisms tested (46 percent) were killed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when 1 mL of a standardized suspension containing 108 organisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was exposed to a 10 percent povidone-iodine solution for 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seconds. Povidone-iodine showed its highest activity against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gram-negative isolates, with 72 of the 94 isolates (75 percent)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being killed after a 15-second exposure. Only 34 of the 134 (25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent) gram-positive isolates were killed under the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions. However, further testing of organisms not killed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after a 15-second exposure indicated that increases in exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time to 120 seconds killed all of the previously ``resistant''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> isolates. The study design incorporated the use of a neutralizer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

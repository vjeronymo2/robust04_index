			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 16 Apr (MENA)--Ending a 20-year rift, the  Coptic Orthodox Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church have  agreed to normalize relations, according to a source at the  papal seat of the Coptic Church.    The Coptic synod, led by Pope Shanudah III, approved a  protocol regulating relations between the two churches. The  protocol was prepared by a joint committee and discussed by both  sides. The protocol will open a new chapter in relations  between the two churches, stressing their amity, proximity, and  common traditions of faith, according to the same source.</p>

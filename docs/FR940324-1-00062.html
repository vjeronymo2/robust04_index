To qualify, the occurrence should be declared a disaster by the President of the United States and shall have a positive finding determination made by the Federal Highway Administration. If the road repairs in an area may be considered for authorization under the Emergency Relief Program, records and photographs of the damage sites and of initial repairs and closures to assure public safety shall be kept by the BIA for possible reimbursement under this program. Those initial repairs may, as an emergency measure, be charged to any available program under the control of the line official. Reimbursement will be made from Emergency Relief Funds after approval, or from road maintenance funds if approval is denied. Careful analysis of program fund usage shall be made considering the temporary charges made to a program whose authority may terminate with the fiscal year. (Specific procedures to be followed in the Emergency Relief Program are contained in 23 CFR part 668.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;170.22  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Bridges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The existence of a flood plain encroachment by a proposed structure shall be determined by technical study. An analysis of the hydrology and the hydraulics of the site shall be performed in accordance with established Executive Order 11988 as implemented in 23 CFR 650.111.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) All existing bridges on the BIA road system shall be inspected periodically for structural condition and functional adequacy, in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 144 and 151. These field inspections shall be conducted in accordance with the National Bridge Inspection Standards. The following measures shall be taken in accordance with recommendations of the inspecting engineer in the field inspection report, as amended by a technical review by the BIA Division of Transportation and the Area Road Engineer, in order to protect the safety of the travelling public:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The erection and maintenance of load limit and safety warning signs and other maintenance work;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The construction or installation of safety enhancement appurtenances such as traffic delineators, bridge railing and approach guardrailing; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The rehabilitation or replacement of deficient structures. (23 U.S.C. 144 (g)(4)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Current data obtained from the bridge inspections shall be maintained in a computer inventory file. The inventory data shall be used to produce a biennial bridge inventory report and an annual bridge sufficiency rating report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The National Bridge Inspection Standards require each State to maintain an inventory of all bridge structures subject to the Standards, which includes all bridges on public roads. Therefore, the required inventory and inspection data for all IRR bridges must be submitted to the State for inclusion in the State's bridge inventory file. The data shall include all items contained in the current ``Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal of the Nation's Bridges.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Bridges that are identified on the bridge sufficiency rating report as being deficient shall be prioritized and programmed for closure, maintenance, rehabilitation, or replacement. Correction of the deficiency shall be accomplished expeditiously after the deficiency is first identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;170.23  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Airports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Airports, including heliports, which provide service to Indian reservations shall not be constructed or improved with appropriated road construction or road maintenance funds. Public airports and heliports may be maintained with road maintenance funds in accordance with appropriations and tribal priorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;170.24  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Public Law 93&hyph;638 road maintenance and construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To assist tribes in compliance with the requirements of Subchapter M_Indian Self-Determination, the BIA shall develop guidelines and model contracts for road construction and maintenance, modify those contracts as necessary for local conditions, and provide technical assistance to the tribes in developing capability to meet contract conditions, maintain adequate records, and prepare required reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

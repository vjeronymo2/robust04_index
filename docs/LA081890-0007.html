			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PALO ALTO;  </P> <P> MARKET INTRODUCES CARTS FOR PINT-SIZED  </P> <P> A grocery store has introduced pint-sized shopping carts for children, causing  a sensation among the toddler-and-older set who tag along while their parents  shop. Miniature speedways may not be exactly what the owners of the Whole Foods  Market had in mind when they bought a dozen of the sturdy, 2 1/2-foot-high wire  replicas of full-sized shopping carts, but so far the carts are drawing in  customers.  </P> <P> "Now I can't get her to another store," said Barbara Perkins as her 2-year-old  daughter, Vanessa, zipped toward the blue-corn tortilla chips. "As long as I  can steer her away from the ice cream, we'll be fine." The Whole Foods chain  has had the carts in its Texas stores for two years, and East Coast  preschoolers have been enjoying life in the fast lane for several years. "They  were such a hit, we decided to bring them here," said Renee Weller, Whole  Food's marketing manager. Five-year-old Aaron Zonka sees the produce aisle of  the local market as his own personal speedway. "It's little, just like me,"  Aaron said of the mini-cart. "Vrrrooooom." A store clerk reported a slightly  higher rate of breakage where bottles are within reach of groping hands, and  some parents said they have gotten home with items they don't remember pulling  from the shelves.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1990S: THE GOLDEN DECADE;  </P> <P> EDUCATION;  </P> <P> CHINESE LANGUAGE IMMERSION CLASSES HELP MELD 2 CULTURES  </P> <P> No longer are they dragged to Chinese lessons on Saturdays or after school,  while their friends get to watch cartoons and play. Learning Cantonese is a  no-fuss process at the West Portal Chinese Immersion Program in San Francisco.  </P> <P> In the nation's only public school Chinese immersion program, about 150  students get Cantonese, along with the usual math, history and science. About  40% of the students are "ABCs" -- American-born Chinese -- while the rest are  Anglos, Latinos, blacks or of mixed ethnicities. They come from throughout the  city to the program in West Portal School in the Sunset District.  </P> <P> The school district started the program six years ago, spurred by parents who  wanted their children to learn Chinese without the headaches of hauling them to  lessons outside of school.  </P> <P> Ling-chi Wang said that his wife was pregnant, and "I decided not to put my  third child through what my two older children had to go through -- 10 years of  after-school Chinese."  </P> <P> Now the third child, 6-year-old Wei-ying, is steeped in Cantonese and English,  and "it's not a fuss that she has to (learn) both," said Wang, a professor at  UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> Parents were also backed by reports of the success of French immersion programs  in Canada and the fact that San Francisco had set up a Spanish immersion  program the year before, said Winnie Tang, a parent and a staff development and  instructional administrator for the school district.  </P> <P> The program has grown along with its children, adding a grade every year so  that it now runs from kindergarten to fifth grade. Next year, sixth grade will  be offered at a middle-school campus, along with intensive Spanish and Japanese  courses.  </P> <P> The idea is not to translate but to teach Cantonese, along with content. In the  immersion's kindergarten, for instance, the teacher explains in Cantonese what  sinks and what floats, demonstrating with a tub of water and then asking the  class questions in Cantonese. The children pick up a scientific concept, as  well as words such as "sink," "water," "sponge" and "rock."  </P> <P> Instruction in kindergarten is 80% in Chinese and 20% English, which tapers to  50-50 by fifth grade, Tang said. She said her fifth-grade daughter in the  program speaks Cantonese "somewhat fluently."  </P> <P> The immersion pupils join the 400 regular-classroom students at West Portal for  recess, field trips and special projects, principal Jeanne Villafuerte said.  Last fall, the program offered 33 kindergarten seats instead of the usual 30,  but even so, seven parents had to be turned away.  </P></p>

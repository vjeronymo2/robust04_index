			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT HOME: FONTANA SHEDDING ITS STEEL TOWN IMAGE;  </P> <P> NEW SUBDIVISIONS ON THE OUTSKIRTS ARE A SHARP CONTRAST TO OLDER PARTS OF THE  CITY.  </P> <P> Like many newcomers to the multiplying suburban sprawl of inland Southern  California, Ingrid Galeano Morrison didn't know one city from the next. She  certainly didn't know Fontana until she, her mother and sisters bought a house  there a few months ago.  </P> <P> And now there are times when she wishes she had done a little more homework  before being lured by some of the best housing prices east of Pomona.  </P> <P> "If I had known the city looked like this . . . , " she mused, while tending  the front lawn of the family's new, four-bedroom, two-bath home. Morrison  doesn't finish her thought. The $130,000 price tag on the family's dream house,  she knows, makes up for a lot.  </P> <P> And she has absolutely no complaints about her immediate, spanking-new  neighborhood. It's just the south-central part of town that depresses her.  </P> <P> This old-time section of Fontana, which stretches north from Valley Boulevard  just out of the shadow of the shuttered Kaiser Steel mill, seems to be home to  half of the world's auto repair shops and a good number of its Confederate flag  retailers. And long blocks close to the old downtown are spotted with  debris-littered lots and dilapidated buildings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Population Has Doubled  </P> <P> "It's tacky, very, very," Morrison said. "But, maybe I should be grateful.  People tell me it used to be worse."  </P> <P> Indeed. Fontana is changing.  </P> <P> In the last five years, the city's population has nearly doubled to 80,000 as  thousands of young and largely upwardly mobile families have decided to trek  even farther inland in search of housing bargains.  </P> <P> They find pay dirt in Fontana. New, detached, single-family homes can be  purchased for as little as about $110,000, and nothing costs more than  $250,000. The average price of a new home, according to the city's housing  division, is $128,052.  </P> <P> And there is a wide selection from which to choose. No fewer than 18 new  subdivisions are under construction; another 20 are under review by the city's  planning staff.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More House for Money  </P> <P> Many of Fontana's new residents are first-time homeowners. And just as many are  move-up buyers seeking to get more house for their dollar than they can in Los  Angeles and Orange counties.  </P> <P> But although these families are willing to give up their old neighborhood ties  and commute longer distances to their jobs in exchange for their housing  bargains, they seem loath to abandon community values and expectations shaped  by other areas of Southern California.  </P> <P> The result has been a bit disconcerting.  </P> <P> As in so many other fast-growing older communities, a schism has developed  between the established working-class residents who liked Fontana for the steel  town that it was and the new families who would mold it into something with a  bit more style, charm and pizazz.  </P> <P> One story that circulated widely several years ago was told about two young  housewives who had moved into Southridge Village, then the city's newest  planned community.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Culture Clash  </P> <P> The women were apparently so concerned about the negative image of Fontana that  they refused to use it as their mailing address, substituting "Southridge  Village" as their hometown. Through the miracle of ZIP codes, they still got  their mail.  </P> <P> This culture clash was, in many ways, inevitable. Unlike the entirely new  residential communities that are springing up throughout Southern California,  such as Moreno Valley in Riverside County and vast stretches of Orange County,  Fontana is an established city with thousands of longtime residents.  </P> <P> As the onslaught of new home buyers continues, the differences between old and  new becomes more apparent.  </P> <P> "Whether people realize it or not, Fontana is becoming a segregated city," said  Rudy Cruz, a 35-year-old RTD bus scheduler and father of three who moved from  San Gabriel into a new home in the city's emerging northwestern quadrant last  year.  </P> <P> "It's not segregation by race, but by economics. It's the old residents versus  the new."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'One Whole Big City'  </P> <P> Fontana's city leaders downplay the importance of such comments, noting that  virtually all communities undergoing population explosions suffer growing pains  and temporary imbalances until the growth pace slackens and the new residents  have been absorbed into the city's mainstream.  </P> <P> "In another 10 years, we'll be one whole big city," says Chamber of Commerce  director Meredith Watkins. "Until then, there's bound to be some isolation of  the new residents. It's normal; it's geography. And it will change."  </P> <P> John Anicic Jr., a Fontana resident for nearly 20 years, says newcomers aren't  the only ones affected by the changes brought on by growth.  </P> <P> There's more traffic and the city is more crowded," he explains. "This town  used to be like a country farming town. Now things are more spread out."  </P> <P> But Anicic, the manager of Foothill Builders Mart, a lumber and hardware store,  isn't terribly concerned about the city's new residents. "They don't have ties  to town yet, but they're slowly getting involved. It takes time."  </P> <P> Establishing civic pride has not come easily for Fontana. And the burgeoning  growth, which city leaders have courted as a means of erasing the past and  capitalizing on the future, hasn't completely wiped out remnants of Fontana's  history as a rural community that was home to thousands of lunch pail-carrying  steel workers.  </P> <P> Fontana traces its roots to the early 1900s when A.B. Miller, the first of the  two men who would forever shape its economic course, arrived.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Built Steel Plant  </P> <P> Miller envisioned a planned rural community on the 28-square-mile expanse of  sagebrush and established the Fontana Farms Co. to develop the land into farms  that produced everything from grain and walnuts to eggs and hogs.  </P> <P> Henry J. Kaiser, arguably the city's most influential business leader, arrived  in the early 1940s with plans to build the nation's first West Coast steel  plant.  </P> <P> In 1942, he began transforming Miller's hog farm into what was to become the  Kaiser steel mill, a plant that operated at breakneck pace through World War II  and the postwar expansion until changing economic conditions forced its closure  a few years ago.  </P> <P> Still, the Kaiser name and influence lives on; Fontana is home to one of the  largest Kaiser Permanente medical facilities in Southern California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Image Consideration  </P> <P> But to many Southern Californians, the steel mill made Fontana synonymous with  smoke-belching heavy industry. And still others remember Fontana as the  birthplace of the Hells Angels motorcycle outlaws and the site of periodic  outbursts from members of the Ku Klux Klan.  </P> <P> Some developers, recognizing that this old image could harm their potential,  have aimed their projects toward Interstate 15, the Devore Freeway, and the  surrounding undeveloped acreage, rather than toward the city's established  corridor along Interstate 10, which takes travelers past the old steel mill and  through the city's older sections.  </P> <P> Many of the city's new subdivisions are located in its two largest planned  communities, Southridge Village and the Village of Heritage.  </P> <P> Heritage, which recently opened in the city's northwest quadrant, features rows  of stately palms and blocks of dusty-pink homes with terra-cotta-colored roofs.  </P> <P> Rudy Cruz moved into Heritage Village in March, paying $150,000 for a  four-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath house on a street filled with youngsters and young  families.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Park, Shopping Center  </P> <P> Pointing to the area just a few blocks away where developers are planning  quarter-million-dollar homes, Cruz believes his house has already appreciated.  "I definitely got more house for my money than I could have back in L.A.," he  said.  </P> <P> At completion, Heritage Village is expected to have about 4,000 homes, a  community park and neighborhood shopping centers. However, for the time being  just a smattering of new subdivisions have been built.  </P> <P> Southridge is by far the larger and the older planned community. Located just  south of Interstate 10 and east of Interstate 15, Southridge is expected to  have about 10,000 homes at completion. About 3,500 homes have already been  built and new neighborhood shopping centers are just now starting to sprout.  </P> <P> City officials have designated land adjacent to Southridge as the site of a  future regional shopping center, Empire Mall. Officials say they expect the  center will be built in the mid-1990s on a site near the intersection of  Interstate 10 and Sierra Avenue.  </P> <P> That's the event chamber director Watkins is waiting for. When the mall opens,  Watkins predicts Fontana will be known less as the birthplace of the Hells  Angels than the home of a regional shopping center.  </P> <P> "They'll say: 'Fontana. Yeah. That's where the mall is,' " Watkins said. "And  the rest will be forgotten."  </P> <P> </P> <P> AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> 1989 estimate: 100,159  </P> <P> 1980-89 change: +57.5  </P> <P> Median age: 30.1 years  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix  </P> <P> White: 64.7%  </P> <P> Latino: 26.5%  </P> <P> Black: 5.5%  </P> <P> Other: 3.3%  </P> <P> Annual income  </P> <P> Per capita: $10,169  </P> <P> Median household: $28,492  </P> <P> Household distribution  </P> <P> Less than $15,000: 25.9%  </P> <P> $15,000 - $30,000: 26.7%  </P> <P> $30,000 - $50,000: 29.8%  </P> <P> $50,000 - $75,000: 13.5%  </P> <P> $75,000 + 4.2%  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Trade Minister Eijiro Hata  said Tuesday [7 Jun] that the Japanese economy has been showing  some bright signals and predicted there is little chance of it  sagging again.    Hata, minister of international trade and industry, told a  regular press conference after a cabinet meeting that he is  paying especially close attention to consumer-spending-related  economic indicators such as sales at department stores and  supermarkets.    Hata's remarks followed the latest official economic  diagnosis issued by the Economic Planning Agency earlier in the  day, which said some bright signs are visible in Japan's economy  despite overall sluggishness.</p>

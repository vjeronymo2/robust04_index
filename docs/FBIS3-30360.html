			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Center Accord leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski by </F> Igor Zalewski and Piotr Zaremba; place and date not given: "We  Will Not Stop Getting Rid of the Vestiges of the People's  Republic"]    [Text] [ZYCIE] Bronislaw Geremek [Democratic Union  parliamentary chief] has said that he will sit down at the same  table as other Solidarity groups in order to discuss a joint  presidential candidate. Would you sit at the same table as  Geremek?    [Kaczynski] Unless we want the present ruling camp to win  the presidency, a Solidarity candidate must have the broadest  possible support. It would have to be someone who appeals to  both the anticommunist community and to those voters who are not  fundamentally anticommunist but who nevertheless appreciate our  values. I have in mind the Democratic Union and  Liberal-Democratic Congress electorate. I do not know if the  candidate will be recognized by everyone.    [ZYCIE] You have lost hope in Walesa?    [Kaczynski] Yes. It is not true that I have changed my mind  about him, as the mass media suggest I have.    [ZYCIE] What are the principles that join Center Accord  [PC], the Christian-National Union, Peasant Accord, and the  Movement for the Republic into one bloc?    [Kaczynski] Christian values, national traditions, the  belief in a market economy, and mutual agreement as to the  methods of safeguarding Poland's security and its pro-Western  orientation. Just like Western right-wing parties, we have no  intention of concealing our differences. The German CSU  [Christian Social Union] consists of avowed traditionalists and  liberals.    [ZYCIE] How much is the idea of decommunization still  realistic? After all, the heirs of communism won the last  elections.    [Kaczynski] I do not know how many votes they will have next  time, but we are certainly not going to stop getting rid of the  vestiges of the People's Republic. It does not matter what kind  of label one attaches to the ruling coalition. Are we to accept  the increasing autonomy of the Interior Ministry, the increasing  distortions to the banking system, and the lack of equal  opportunities? To change the administration, one can use  various methods, such as promoting young people, who are not  burdened by communist practices.    [ZYCIE] But in a few years' time, the personnel  relationships you are criticizing will be so firmly rooted that  it will be impossible to remove them.    [Kaczynski] Yes, it will be more difficult to combat them,  especially because we do not accept revolutionary methods of  struggle. But does that mean we have to accept a system that  erodes our cultural standards?    [ZYCIE] You say that the Pawlak Government is not only bad,  it is also in favor of recommunization.    [Kaczynski] The Polish left wing is really not interested in  changes. The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] is backed by red  capital, which is eating away at the state budget. But,  fortunately, the electorate is in favor of maintaining the  present economic and social structures. Whatever Mr.  Kwasniewski [leader of the SLD] tries to do, he cannot act  against the interests of the electorate.    [ZYCIE] What does recommunization involve?    [Kaczynski] Among other things, it involves making local  government bodies dependent on the wishes of the parties that  form the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Suchocka fired good  PC provincial governors because they belonged to the  parliamentary opposition. We condemned this action, but what is  happening today is quite different. Local bodies of the Social  Democratic Party of the Republic of Poland or the Polish Peasant  Party [PSL] are actually recommending candidates for various  posts. That signals the return of a classic nomenklatura.    [ZYCIE] The right-wing bloc has formed its own  constitutional commission. What kind of principles will the  right wing's draft constitution enshrine?    [Kaczynski] Christian and Polish values, strong guarantees  of ownership rights, and democracy.    The Senate's draft constitution of 1991 was not supported by  the PC. Any drastic increase in the president's powers is the  first step toward a dictatorship, and not only with Walesa as  president. Other public institutions are simply too weak. A  strong presidency would turn everyone into the Belweder's  clients.    Even the comparatively weak provision in the Small  Constitution, whereby the foreign, interior, and defense  ministers are appointed on the president's recommendation, means  that these ministries are dependent on the president. Does the  Pawlak government control these ministries? I do not wish to  defend the interests of left-wing parties. However, it is worth  noticing that, even with their huge parliamentary majority, the  SLD and the PSL are incapable of gaining control over these  ministries. They are taking part in an opportunistic political  contest with the Belweder, but at the same time they know how  weak they really are.</p>

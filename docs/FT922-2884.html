			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Management: Designer-clad career women put on the style in Paris Some Anglo-Saxon phenomena are acceptable in France. Others are not. The 'style consultant' is definitely in the latter category. France is, after all, a country where eight-year-old girls are dispatched to the local ecole de beaute to learn how to apply make-up in their school holidays, where Chanel is a national institution, and where taxi drivers can tell at a glance not only what you are wearing but how much you paid for it. Whereas high-powered women in the US and UK tend to worry that, if they look good, they will not be taken seriously, French women know that they are expected to be both intelligent and personable. Edith Cresson, fresh from her short career as France's first woman prime minister, once said it would be impossible for a woman to succeed in French politics unless she was attractive. Cresson herself appeared day after day smiling for the TV cameras with well-coiffed hair, clad in signature high heels and a suit from Torrente, her favourite couturier. You only have to glance at the designer-suited career women poring over their power breakfasts in the Louis XVI restaurant of the Hotel de Crillon, or at the women cabinet ministers perching on their gilt chairs at the Paris haute couture shows to realise that Cresson is not an exception. French working women may be better dressed than their British counterparts, but they are no less conservative in taste. It is only in the Paris art scene or the media that you see women wearing the seriously fashionable clothes of funky young designers. Otherwise, one label dominates the power wardrobes of Paris - Chanel. The classic Chanel suit, complete with short skirt and snappy jacket with shiny buttons, is the uniform for French working women. It is a sell-out in Paris season after season. The career women who are not (yet) quite high powered enough to afford anything from Pounds 1,250 for an original go to one of the dozens of dressmakers who make a living churning out copies.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television Public Eye: Cautionary Tales (BBC2, 8.00). The policy of cautioning criminals for so-called minor offences, intended to stop reoffending, comes under investigation. Is it right that 20-year-old Matt, having been cautioned no fewer than 11 times, can break another man's jaw and not be prosecuted? Tonight is something of an event for gardeners, the first programme of a new and genuinely different kind of gardening series, Plant Life (C4, 9.00). It is perfectly possible to be a skilful gardener without understanding why clay soil is sticky let alone having a clue about photosynthesis. Yet many enthusiastic gardeners would probably do the outdoor jobs better and possibly enjoy the gardening much more if they had a basic knowledge of plant physiology and a clearer understanding of the relationship between the plants and their environment. Animated Arias: From Opera Imaginaire (BBC2, 9.50). The programmes have been very different but also quite intriguing. Tonight the treatment is applied to arias from Gounod's Faust and Puccini's Tosca.</p>

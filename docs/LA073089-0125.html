			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON  </P> <P> Regarding "How Fathers Figure," by Paul Ciotti: If one were stupid enough to  rely on the documented findings of the male psychologists and physicians Ciotti  refers to, one would conclude that boys raised by their mothers are unfriendly,  immature, disobedient, cowardly, intellectually deficient and suffer low  self-esteem. Because Ciotti can't come up with anything deep about fatherhood,  he resorts to mother-bashing.  </P> <P> Shame on you.  </P> <P> BLAKE LATIMER  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

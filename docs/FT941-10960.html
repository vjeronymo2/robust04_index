			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Mixed response for Chiroscience Chiroscience, the pharmaceutical group which is coming to market through a 30m share placing and offer for sale, has received a mixed initial reception from investors. The institutional placing of 16.7m shares priced at 150p a share was oversubscribed about three times. However, Robert Fleming, which sponsored the issue, only received applications for 10.8m shares under the offer for sale, representing just over 80 per cent of the shares available. As a result all valid applications will be satisfied in full, including priority applications for 18,100 shares received from employees.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> OKLAHOMA SCORES 97 (IN 1 HALF ) IN VICTORY  </P> <P> Oklahoma missed four chances at college basketball's first 100-point half  Wednesday night at Norman, Okla., before settling for a record 97 in crushing  U.S. International, 173-101.  </P> <P> The 17th-ranked Sooners got a career-high 31 points from William Davis, who  also had 18 rebounds.  </P> <P> Davis scored 20 points in the first half as the Sooners built a 97-45 lead.  That broke the mark of 94 scored last season by Loyola Marymount -- also  against USIU.  </P> <P> "That wasn't us tonight. Believe me it wasn't," USIU Coach Gary Zarecky said.  "It was worse than a nightmare."  </P> <P> Oklahoma failed to connect on four three-point shots in the final minute of the  first half in an attempt to reach 100.  </P> <P> The Sooners also set an NCAA record for shots in a game with 147, surpassing  the 132 by Illinois against Colgate on Dec. 30, 1948. The 173 points were eight  short of the NCAA record set by Loyola Marymount against USIU in last year's  181-150 shootout.  </P> <P> No. 1 Syracuse 108, Cornell 56 -- The top-ranked Orangemen held the Big Red to  two field goals in the first 10 minutes at Syracuse and handed its Ivy League  neighbor its worst defeat ever.  </P> <P> It was the Orangemen's 21st consecutive victory over the Big Red, as well as  the most lopsided in a rivalry that includes two 41-point blowouts by Syracuse.  </P> <P> Senior Stephen Thompson, who switched from small forward to point guard this  season, scored 22 points for Syracuse, which began pulling its starters just  three minutes into the contest. The Orangemen also got 20 points from Derrick  Coleman.  </P> <P> Cornell's previous worst beating was a 51-point loss to Penn in 1974.  </P> <P> No. 7 Duke 102, Canisius 66 -- The Blue Devils bolted to an 11-0 lead and Phil  Henderson and Christian Laettner paced a balanced attack with 18 points each at  Durham, N.C.  </P> <P> Duke put the game away by outscoring the Canisius, 17-4, over the final 5 1/2  minutes of the first half.  </P> <P> The Blue Devils led, 50-24, at halftime and extended the margin to 42 points in  the second half. All five Duke starters scored in double figures.  </P> <P> No. 10 Michigan 85, Grambling St. 70 -- Sean Higgins scored 16 of his 20 points  in the second half to lead the 10th-ranked Wolverines past the Tigers at Ann  Arbor, Mich.  </P> <P> It was Michigan's first home game since winning the NCAA championship last  spring.  </P> <P> Grambling committed 17 turnovers, and Michigan, after a lethargic start, led  36-26 at halftime. Higgins scored 12 points in the first eight minutes of the  second half as the Wolverines opened a 61-45 lead and coasted the rest of the  way.  </P> <P> No. 11 Arkansas 105, South Alabama 90 -- Todd Day scored 28 points and Lenzie  Howell added 23 to lead the 11th-ranked Razorbacks over the Jaguars.  </P> <P> Day also had nine rebounds for Arkansas, and Lee Mayberry had 16 points and 10  assists.  </P> <P> South Alabama was led by Alex Stanwood, who hit 10 of 11 shots from the field  and eight of 10 free throws for 28 points.  </P> <P> Detroit 108, Duquesne 97 -- Huey Smith scored four of his 27 points in the  second overtime to help the Titans beat the Dukes at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Duquesne's Brian Anselmino forced the first overtime when he made two free  throws with no time on the clock.  </P> <P> Detroit's Bill Wood tied the score as time expired in the first overtime period  with a three-point shot. Wood was off balance and guarded by two players but  was still able to make the shot to tie the score, 97-97.  </P> <P> Detroit took advantage of five Duquesne turnovers in the second overtime and  outscored the Dukes, 13-2.  </P> <P> Wood also had four points in the second overtime for Detroit.  </P> <P> Michigan St. 80, Nebraska 69 -- Kirk Manns scored 19 points and Steve Smith  added 18 at East Lansing as the Spartans beat the Cornhuskers.  </P></p>

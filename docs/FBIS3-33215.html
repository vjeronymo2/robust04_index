Peruvian Javier Perez de Cuellar, former UN secretary  general, said during his inaugural speech that the participants'  purpose in the event was "to encourage the reestablishment of  good sense and equanimity needed to banish war from all corners  of the world as a means of solving political and social  conflicts."    Perez de Cuellar, one of the promoters of the negotiation  process that concluded with the signing of the Chapultepec  Agreement, said: "El Salvador has given Latin America and the  world an example of the participants' political willingness to  find peaceful and negotiated solutions to a conflict."    Meanwhile, Federico Mayor Zaragoza, UNESCO general director,  in his video message seen by all the participants, congratulated  all those who had the sense, courage, and unselfishness to  achieve peace in El Salvador. Mayor said: "I want to  congratulate President Cristiani, the FMLN [Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front], all those who put the force of  reason before the reason of force, those pioneers of the peace  culture, who are convinced that violence and conflict lead to  sacrifice and the death of the causes that deserve to be lived  through education, science, and culture."    Mayor expressed that the participating nations' contribution  of reason and experiences to this forum shall be decisive in  orienting the debate and analysis.    Upon inaugurating the Forum, President Alfredo Cristiani  expressed his happiness and satisfaction that the nation had  been chosen for this period of reflection.    Nevertheless, FMLN coordinator Shafik Handal said before the  event's inauguration: "We believe it is not appropriate to hold  this forum before the elections because it makes the government  look like it is complying with the peace agreements. Handal  criticized UNESCO for agreeing to organize and promote the forum  before the 20 March elections, as this, he noted, gives the  government party a lead.    President Cristiani in this regard said: "It is unfortunate  that Handal, one of the promoters of the peace process, has  expressed himself in this manner."    After the inauguration, Dr. David Escobar Galindo and  current  Presidency Minister Dr. Oscar Santamaria, who were members of  the government commission that signed the peace agreements, each  gave a lecture on "The Nature of the Peace Culture" and "The  Salvadoran Case," respectively.    In addition, the Forum, where 80 nations and 140 domestic  and  foreign organizations assembled as observers, continues today  with the topic "Local and Regional Contribution for the  Installation of a Peace Culture."</p>

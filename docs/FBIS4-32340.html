			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Vladimir Jovanovic: "Dedinje on the Romanija </F> Mount"]    [Text] Serbs are more and more divided on the question of  the future and development of the war crisis in Bosnia. Zoran  Lilic's words uttered the day after the session of the Supreme  Defense Council of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] are  a clear signal to the Serbian war lobby across the Drina. Lilic  said that they cannot "hold hostage" the population on this side  of the Drina.    These words have attracted the attention of observers in  Belgrade. They were said amidst the debate about [Zoran]  Djindjic's initiative and the increased pressure Belgrade is  exerting on Radovan Karadzic and others to accept the proposed  division of Bosnia.  <H5>  The Malcontents </H5>   Our sources claim that nothing happens by chance. Their  interpretation of Djindjic's initiative points out his  ever-increasing and ever more important links with Karadzic,  and, on the other hand, with Cosic and the church. These people  are inclined toward the unitarization of the FRY and toward  creating, effectively and legally, a Serbian national state.  Milosevic and his leftist national wing are allegedly more  inclined toward a "civic state." MONITOR's sources further claim  that Bulatovic's "Herzegovina initiative" represented a simpler  test. Trebinje Leader Bozidar Vucurovic said that he is not  interested in such a project, as his interest is not in a civic,  but a national state.    Three weeks ago, Milosevic received a delegation of the SPS  [Socialist Party of Serbia] from Bosnia. On that occasion, he  told them that he wants them to secure power in the Srpska  republic, that he will help them do so (not publicly and  directly, of course), and that Banja Luka will be the new  capital of the Srpska republic. After this, the SPS of the  Srpska republic held a convention in Banja Luka, traditionally a  stronghold of the opposition against Karadzic (rebellion of a  unit last September, disagreement between the 1st Krajina Corps  Commander General Talic and the central command, and the like).  On the other hand, Karadzic is granted less and less time on  the state television and nobody in Belgrade wants to talk  officially about his political future, although he is being  asked to do the impossible -- convince his top military  leadership and followers to give over 20 percent of territories  presently under their control to the Bosnian Government without  any guarantees that such a division of Bosnia will be  long-lasting.    Karadzic is not standing still: He is trying to activate his  intelligence-police network Tajfun [hurricane] in Belgrade.  Many people claim that the role played in all this by Momcilo  Mandic, former deputy head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who is now head of the Bureau of the  Srpska republic in Belgrade, is also unclear. Moreover,  Karadzic has been closely gathering around himself the  anticommunist nucleus (the Plavsic woman, Krajisnik, and  others); he has also received secret support by the church at  the recent meeting of its top leadership held at the Pec  Patriarchate.    Belgrade, however, assesses affairs within the Serbian  leadership in Bosnia to be "numerous as the sands" and that will  be used as a trump card by the socialists in their election  campaign. What is this scenario like?    Milosevic is counting, or at least was counting, on a  longer-lasting truce in Bosnia, which would enable elections to  be held there. With the support of the police and television --  somewhat in the fashion in which this was done in Krajina in the  case of [Milan] Martic -- Milosevic's candidates would win at  these elections. Karadzic will become an old story. Along with  General Mladic.    Expectations of this kind are still uncertain: The  development of the crisis in Bosnia does not promise a permanent  peace. This suits Karadzic as destabilization is out of  question at the time of possibly decisive battles.    A dispute of a fundamental nature has broken out among the  Serbs. Heated debates are being held about questions connected  with the future and whether it is of any use to continue to wage  war. On the other hand, a tough struggle for power has begun  between the Serbs across the Drina and Belgrade and it is  difficult to predict the final outcome of this clash.    Milosevic is trying to rally his war advisers and aides.  Radmilo Bogdanovic, however, has said: "I am not pleased by  Lilic's statement" -- something that may develop into a tough  conflict.    MONITOR's sources claim that the opinion prevails among the  top Serbian leadership in Bosnia that the war will inevitably  continue. These assessments are probably justified from the  point of view of General Mladic, for instance: He surely  possesses correct reports regarding the intentions of Bosnian  and Croatian generals to carry out a breakthrough in northern  and western Bosnia. This is clear. Belgrade, however, is  prepared to trade with territories, but that is not feasible in  practice.  <H5>  Discontentment </H5>   General Mladic is trying to reorganize his forces. His  intention is to form larger mobile tactical units that would be  able to be transferred from one front to another whenever there  is need to do so. He is also trying to get rid of some officers  he considers to be unsuitable.    At the same time, Milosevic is criticizing the General Staff  of the Yugoslav Army, that is, General Perisic, because of its  support to the top Serbian leadership in Bosnia. By carrying  out certain cadre changes in the army, he is trying to place  under his control this factor that is potentially extremely  tricky for him.    Discontented with the general situation in the Army, he  criticizes General Perisic and others partly for crime in the  Yugoslav Army, unsolved murders (see box), and for Yugoslav Army  officers "unselectively" departing for Krajina and Bosnia.    Through his "exclusive channels," Milosevic is trying to  feel  the situation in the top leadership of the army of the Srpska  republic as well. It seems that he has some serious intentions  regarding General Manojlo Milovanovic, currently head of the  headquarters of the army of the Srpska republic. This tanker who  graduated from high military schools has recently led all  large-scale offensive operations of the Srpska army. His  position prior to the current one was commander of the Drina  Corps of the army of the Srpska republic. An analysis of his  statements, particularly concerning crises around Sarajevo and  Gorazde this year shows that he often corrects and moderates  General Mladic's statements. Satisfied with the mop-up  operations carried out in the belt along the Drina last spring,  Milosevic has personally appointed him to the post of head of  operations of the army of the Srpska republic.    In the meantime, a major piece of "ill luck" befell Mladic.  At the end of May, Bosnians took Elevation 691 on the Ozren  Mount, southwest of Tuzla, that is, the well-known Serbian  stronghold of "Vijenac." Even VECERNJE NOVOSTI admitted that  and reported on the Serbian loss of about 110 fighters. The  article held as responsible the commander of the Serbian "Ozren"  tactical group and the commander of the battalion that was  defending the said stronghold.    The further development of the war crisis might bring more  "ill luck" to Mladic and thereby mar his "fame." People in the  know claim that he has already been offered the post of  commander of the Uzice Corps of the Yugoslav Army, but these  rumors are impossible to check.    Milosevic, Karadzic, Mladic, Cosic -- again! Serbs, it is  said, must "concede" territories in Bosnia. Does this not  resemble the haggling over the Vance-Owen plan? Djindjic has  now fallen into this maelstrom and he is too close to the  Belgrade regime to be able to easily shake off his links across  the Drina. After all, he did not establish those links without  the Serbian president's knowledge.    As a part of Djindjic's initiative, somebody has been trying  to mix up Montenegro into all that. In its announcement  criticizing the honorable Serbian Democrat, a party says: "You  have stuck a dangerous thorn into our people's healthy flesh.  That has motivated separatist forces in Cetinje. The sentiment  of separating Montenegro from Serbia has been growing," the  warning says alarmingly.    Belgrade sees "Yugoslavia" as a burden. Nobody knows what to  do with it.  <H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5> <H5>  Generals, Death of a Soldier, Crime, Milosevic </H5>   As the song by singer Kemal Monteno goes, "it was some time  in spring," when affairs -- of the kind that usually end with en  masse pensioning off -- begun sprouting. Milosevic is now  criticizing the General Staff mainly because of some cases of  crime, but also unexplained circumstances about the death of  soldier Jugoslav Mihajlovic (19) from Pozarevac. Mihajlovic was  seriously injured in the Surdulica Barracks on 14 May at about  2340 and later died in a Nis hospital. The Information Service  of the General Staff harshly reacted to a report on this case  carried by a Belgrade daily. However, assertions in the article  have not been denied.    On the other hand, crime in the Yugoslav Army has spread so  much that General Perisic himself had to deny its existence,  speaking before about 100 journalists last week. There is no  smoke without fire, people say.    Milosevic, however, uses criticism with a view to exerting  additional pressure on the top military leadership, something  that is confirmed by at least two things:    a. The situation in the Yugoslav Army is so rotten that even  the commander himself has to talk about it, at least by denying  it, and the problem is made much worse by the fact that what is  mostly talked about is crime.    b. Tension is growing between Milosevic and the generals.    Again?</p>

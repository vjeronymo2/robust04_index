			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Dofasco losses grow to CDollars 73m DOFASCO, Canada's biggest steelmaker, reduced operating losses in the second quarter, but after special restructuring charges it reported a final loss of CDollars 72.6m (USDollars 60.5m), or 92 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 31.3m, or 47 cents, a year earlier, writes Robert Gibbens. Sales were CDollars 549m against CDollars 557m. Before the special items totalling 81 cents a share after tax, the operating net loss equalled 11 cents a share against 31 cents. The domestic market for flat rolled steel remains weak, Dofasco said, and imports are running abnormally high. The first-half loss was CDollars 96.9m, or CDollars 1.23 a share, including the special charges, against a loss of CDollars 26.8m, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales were little changed at CDollars 1bn.</p>

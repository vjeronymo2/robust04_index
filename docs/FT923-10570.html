			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Latin America Debt Crisis: 'Fear brings people together' - William Rhodes / The Key International Personalities / Ten years ago next month the Latin American debt crisis broke - and threw the world financial system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed the story for the Financial Times from the outset analyse how the crisis was handled. And they pose the question: Is there life after debt? 'IF GREED often drives people apart, fear often brings them together.' So says Mr William Rhodes, now vice-chairman of Citicorp, who led the international banking community's response to the debt crisis, writes Alexander Nicoll. With Citibank the biggest lender to Latin America, Mr Rhodes was chairman of advisory committees - formed by banks to lead their negotiations - for Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Uruguay. Recalling the IMF meeting in September 1982 in Toronto being compared to rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic, he says a sort of partnership swiftly developed among central bankers, heads of international institutions and commercial banks. 'The resulting co-operation ultimately overcame the widespread fear that the international system would collapse.' Mr Rhodes attributes the containment of the debt problem to this co-operation, and to political leadership in Latin America. Also important was the approach to debt problems on a case-by-base basis, and the fact that no solution was imposed on banks. Economic reforms by Latin American governments are useful examples for other developing countries: 'The formula entails a strong head of state, a viable economic plan, an economic team that works together, a belief in the plan by all senior officials involved, and - this is most important - a method to convince all levels of society of the benefits of economic reform.' However, in retrospect, Mr Rhodes feels that the return of Latin American borrowers to the markets might have been accelerated if structural reform - such as privatisation, deregulation, and improvement of trade policies and tax systems - had been attempted sooner.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Toyota says it will increase US car production by 25 per cent Toyota said yesterday it would increase its US car production by about 25 per cent this year to 300,000 units. The move comes as Japanese motor groups struggle against a depressed domestic market, but demand in the US market appears to be recovering, Paul Abrahams reports. The company is the second Japanese group to announce a substantial increase in US production. Earlier this week, Honda said it intended to raise its output 18.4 per cent to a record 597,000 this year. Toyota's planned US production increase is in sharp contrast to its domestic production last year, badly hit by the recession. Output of cars, trucks, and buses fell 9.4 per cent to 3.56m.</p>

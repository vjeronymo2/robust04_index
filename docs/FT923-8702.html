			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / International Company News: Aberfoyle into administration Aberfoyle Holdings, the agriculture and security products group, is being placed into administration and had its shares suspended at 2 1/2 p last Friday. The majority of operations are in Zimbabwe. The company said its financial position had 'deteriorated to the point where it had insufficient sterling funds to enable it to continue to trade'. Last November a group of dissident shareholders won control of the board, and promised to put the company back on its feet. But Mr Kojo Owusu-Nyantekyi, one of the dissidents and now a member of the board, and whose private company Crescent Africa holds a 26 per cent stake said at the week-end: 'This was all foreseen last year. The cost cutting exercise was not enough. I am very disappointed'.</p>

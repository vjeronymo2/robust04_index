			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Japanese plant in Wales to close Star Micronics, a Japanese manufacturer of dot-matrix printers, is to close its factory in south-east Wales with the loss of nearly 200 jobs. More than 40 Japanese companies have set up in Wales since the early 1970s. This is the first Japanese plant to close. Mr Shuku Masui, UK managing director, said yesterday: 'The reason for the closure is purely commercial.' The company set up at Tredegar, Gwent, in 1988 but has faced severe competition from other types of printer. The plant's turnover fell from Pounds 58m in 1990 to Pounds 20m last year, when it lost Pounds 1.3m and cut 76 jobs.</p>

Girault, who visited the German embassy here, did not hand  over an invitation to Kohl, but one for ambassador Juergen  Sudhoff after the two held a meeting, an embassy spokesman said.  [passage omitted]    Speaking on RTL radio later, Girault said he could not  officially invite Kohl, but still wanted the chancellor to  attend. He said Sudhoff had accepted the invitation, on  condition the Bonn government approved it. [passage omitted]    An opinion poll in the French Christian weekly LA VIE said  57  percent of the French favoured a German Government presence at  the D-Day ceremonies.</p>

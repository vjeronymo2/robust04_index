Herzl, who resides in  Riga, also represents Israel in Latvia and Estonia. The two  widely discussed newspaper articles, especially in the American  press, such as "Lithuania's List" in THE WASHINGTON POST last  week, accusing Lithuania of rehabilitating persons involved in  genocide against Jews.    Justas Paleckis, the Lithuanian president's foreign policy  adviser, said Brazauskas emphasized that several hundred people  were denied rehabilitation. He added that a number of Nazi war  criminals were put on trial in post-war years when it was quite  difficult to "slip past." The Lithuanian leader said Lithuania  is prepared to help investigate genocide against Jews,  Lithuanians and other nations. Herzl said she is satisfied that  persons convicted in post-war years are not rehabilitated  automatically.    The president and the ambassador also discussed bilateral  relations between their countries. Brazauskas said Tel Aviv is  always at the top of the list when creation of new Lithuanian  Embassies is discussed. Paleckis quoted Herzl as saying that a  top-ranking Lithuanian official is expected to visit Israel this  year.</p>

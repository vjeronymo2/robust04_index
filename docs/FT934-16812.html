			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Fresh arrest in Japanese 'bribes' case JAPANESE public prosecutors yesterday arrested an executive of Taisei, a leading construction company which had denied its head-office officials were involved in a widening political bribery scandal. Mr Takashi Hashimoto, 57, a vice-president of Taisei, was arrested for his alleged role in the bribery of a local governor who, prosecutors say, accepted Y20m (Pounds 122,600) from the company on the understanding it would be awarded public works contracts. Taisei said last week that two provincial managers arrested for the alleged bribery of Mr Shuntaro Honma, the governor of Miyagi, north of Tokyo, had acted without the approval of head office, apparently prompting the prosecutors to take aim at the company again. The company yesterday apologised for the embarrassment caused by the case, though it insisted that executives had merely given a political donation to Mr Honma, whose resignation was accepted by the Miyagi prefectural assembly yesterday. Executives from five of Japan's largest contractors have been arrested in the past three months, and the scandal has forced the government to review the selection process for public works contracts. But Construction Ministry officials say the unfolding scandal could slow the award of construction projects commissioned under the government spending packages intended to stimulate a weakening economy. Prosecutors appear to be shifting their investigation to national politicians with close ties to the construction industry, particularly members of the Liberal Democratic party and ex-members of the party who joined the government coalition of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa.</p>

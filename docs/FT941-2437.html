			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / On trial for dangerous dealing: The impact of derivatives on financial market stability is unknown. Tracy Corrigan asks if regulators should worry There is a new breed of bogeymen in the financial markets - hedge fund managers, who make large bets on price movements using private clients' money. They have been demonised, in particular, for driving bond prices down sharply last month by suddenly withdrawing bets on European bond markets. They had taken fright at the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates for the first time in five years. The Bank of England is now investigating the activities of hedge funds - pools of money which are switched between financial markets to exploit short-term opportunities. Regulators worry that excessive lending to hedge funds could leave banks vulnerable to heavy losses. But there is an aspect of the hedge fund industry that strikes greater fear into the hearts of regulators: their heavy use of derivatives. These are sophisticated financial instruments such as options and futures, which give investors the right (options) or the obligation (futures) to buy securities, currencies or commodities at a set price at a later date. Swaps (agreements to exchange interest rate or currency liabilities) are bilateral deals conducted 'over the counter', while futures and some options are listed on exchanges. Derivatives are already widely used by banks and securities houses; but the emergence of hedge funds - most of them unregulated - as significant players in the derivatives market worries market supervisors. The notional value of futures contracts traded on world exchanges is about Dollars 140,000bn a year. One aspect of derivatives is that, for a small downpayment, the purchaser can control a larger portion of the market. For example, Dollars 10,000 could buy a contract to purchase Dollars 100,000 worth of bonds later. Such leverage means potential gains or losses are magnified. To address their concerns about these instruments, US and UK securities regulators last week agreed to share information on derivatives trading. The move reflects an awareness that derivatives regulation is outdated - and possibly ineffective. In most countries, regulators supervise specific types of companies - banks, insurers and securities houses, for example. But the derivatives market spans a range of financial institutions and national borders. Regulators have two main concerns about derivatives. The first is that poor management or a lack of understanding of these complicated financial instruments could cause companies to incur heavy losses. For example, a trading subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft, the German oil and metals company, faces final losses of Dollars 1bn on dealings in the oil derivatives market last year. The second is the broader impact on other financial markets, particularly whether derivatives increase price swings and have a destabilising influence. Banks and securities houses welcome volatility as it increases their opportunities to make money, either through trading their own capital or by charging fees to buy and sell on behalf of clients. But non-financial companies - and less sophisticated investors - do not like large price swings which could leave them facing losses. Central banks want to pull all the levers and do not like to feel that they are losing control of monetary policy. Evidence that derivatives destabilise markets is, however, far from conclusive. No empirical study over the past 20 years has yet shown that derivatives increase volatility, and some have concluded they may even reduce it. Most recently, in December a study of the effect of derivatives on the London stock market by Mr Gary Robinson of the Bank of England concluded that 'futures trading has been associated with a significant reduction in volatility of around 17 per cent'. Other observers agree that derivatives markets may dampen volatility. During the sharp bond price falls in February market participants were able to trade bonds via the futures market when dealers became unwilling to quote prices in the underlying bond market. Mr Fred Stambaugh, a vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank, says: 'If there were no derivative markets, and traders had those heavy positions on their books, you would have seen greater movement in the (conventional) physical instruments, because a lot of what happens in the derivative markets is designed to diffuse risk.' But the academic evidence does not always impress market participants. 'Various studies say there is a benign relationship between the two markets, but it certainly doesn't feel like that some days,' observes one UK fund manager. It is not just a gut feeling of traders. There is a case for arguing academic studies have asked the wrong questions, or focused on excessively long time periods, which iron out glitches. 'The sort of tests that have been conducted do not determine whether in abnormal conditions derivatives create volatility,' says one regulator. One theory is that, in periods of volatility, because market participants holding futures have to provide for potential losses, they may have to sell other holdings to generate the extra cash needed. A likely explanation for the divergence of views is that derivatives produce different effects depending on market conditions. Moreover, their impact could vary according to whether they are used mainly to hedge risks, or to speculate on markets. The worrying feature about hedge funds is that - despite their name - the latter is more usually the case. One problem in isolating the effects of derivatives is that they have become an integral part of a fast-evolving world financial system. A decade ago fund managers were concerned mainly with their own domestic stock or bond markets. But the dismantling of regulatory barriers and improvements in the infrastructure of financial markets have allowed investors to gain access to a wider range of products. Derivatives have heightened that trend. Because transaction costs are lower and derivatives are often more actively traded than conventional instruments, it is easier, for example, to switch from the German to the Japanese stock market by using futures rather than by selling a portfolio of individual stocks. 'Derivatives have created much greater linkage between markets, and the leverage involved means that positions can turn much quicker,' said Mr Carter Beese, a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the US securities industry. The trend towards global investment may itself be partly responsible for increasing volatility. When a particular market looks attractive, large amounts of capital flow in from around the world - and out again quickly when fortunes turn. At the same time, there has been a trend towards pooling money - retail investors are now more likely to buy unit trusts or mutual funds. Wealthy individuals may turn to hedge funds. 'The speculative side of the business has been institutionalised and the markets are now driven by the interests of the new institutional speculators,' says Mr Hunt Taylor, managing director of Reynwood Trading Corporation, a New Jersey-based hedge fund. The risk regulators face is that the rapid evolution of the world's financial markets may have created a potentially dangerous cocktail of aggressive traders, specula-tive investors, and highly complex financial instruments which users might not fully under-stand. In the US, where memories of the cost to taxpayers of bailing out the troubled savings and loans industry in the 1980s are still fresh, efforts are being made to monitor derivatives across a broader range of users. A working group on financial markets, with representatives from the relevant US regulatory bodies, meets regularly. Such co-operation between regulators, not just in the US but elsewhere, seems an obvious way of identifying the risks which derivatives may be creating. That thinking lay behind last week's agreement between the SEC, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission and the UK's Securities and Investments Board. Such an approach may be needed in other financial markets, anyway, given the trend towards internationalisation. Beyond that, it may be necessary to accept that markets have become liable to big swings, which can have a knock-on effect across continents and time-zones, and that they are the result of the liberali-sation of financial markets heralded since the start of the 1980s.</p>

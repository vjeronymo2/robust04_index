			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Salomon sets up triple-A rated derivatives unit SALOMON Brothers has set up a separate subsidiary, with a triple A credit rating, through which to channel swaps and options business, in a move which other US banks and securities houses are expected to follow. The declining credit quality of many US financial institutions has proved a severe handicap in the lucrative derivatives market, since many potential clients are unwilling to deal with institutions rated less than double A. Salomon, like a number of other US banks with single A ratings, has been struggling to maintain its market share against triple A rated entities like Morgan Guaranty and Union Bank of Switzerland. 'We believe separately-capitalised subsidiaries are the wave of the future,' said Mr Myron Scholes, co-head of fixed income derivatives at Salomon in New York. Lehman Brothers, Continental, Chase Manhattan and Kidder Peabody are among the institutions known to be considering this route. The first such separately-capitalised unit was created by Merrill Lynch 14 months ago. In assessing the Salomon Brothers structure, the credit rating agencies have relaxed the initial capital requirement because the amount of capital will be adjusted according to the level of credit risk. All market risk is assumed by Salomon Brothers, which then provides extra capital to Swapco. The Salomon unit, Salomon Swapco, will have equity capital of Dollars 175m, compared with the Dollars 350m capitalisation of Merrill Lynch Derivative Products. Swapco can deal with any investment grade - or high-quality but unrated - clients, while MLDP can only deal with clients rated double A or better. According to Mr Flavio Bartmann, a managing director of Merrill Lynch, Salomon has 'obtained extra flexibility and half the capital requirement, but that is somewhat at the expense of the counterparty'. One of the elements of the structure is that certain events, such as the bankruptcy of Salomon Brothers, trigger the termination of Swapco contracts, causing potential problems for clients. Although the unit has been rated triple A by Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch, S&amp;P created a new triple-A category, by adding the subscript 'T' to the rating, drawing attention to the termination clause. 'People want to separate the tremendous economic function of derivatives from the credit risk baggage that comes along with it,' said Mr Richard Stuckey, co-head of fixed income derivatives.</p>

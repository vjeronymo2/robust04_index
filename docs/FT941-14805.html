			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Bundesbank firm on interest rate policy The German Bundesbank yesterday rejected calls for a more aggressive policy of interest rate cuts to promote economic recovery, insisting that its money supply target for 1994 would leave ample room for growth. The central bank also ruled out any early move to a European Union-wide system of monetary targeting as both premature and unjustified. In its latest monthly report, the Bundesbank spelt out in detail the reasoning behind its new target 'corridor' for money supply, which sets the growth of the broad M3 measure of money supply at 4-6 per cent this year, compared with 4.5-6.5 per cent in 1993. As usual, the report was scrupulously careful not to give any indication of the bank's likely decision on interest rates at its next fortnightly meeting, which takes place in Frankfurt tomorrow. 'The Bundesbank will continue to explore carefully its room for manoeuvre in interest rate policy, resulting from the development of money supply and the whole economic environment,' it said. It flatly rejected both 'a forced policy of interest rate cuts to revive the economy' and 'any attempt to solve the German economy's problems through a devaluation of the D-Mark, caused by interest rate cuts'. The bank's analysis concludes that the extraordinary factors which caused money supply to grow well outside its target corridor for the past two years have now been largely left behind. Thus the chances of keeping within the 1994 guidelines are much improved. Those special factors included the effects of German unification, the large-scale interventions by European central banks on the currency markets, the inverse interest rate structure with long-term rates below short-term, and the introduction of a German withholding tax on investment income. 'The long-term relationship between money supply and the movement of prices still exists in Germany, in spite of the problems of unification,' it said. The M3 measure of money supply, including short-term deposits and savings accounts as well as current accounts and cash in circulation, remained the best guide for a policy of monetary stability, rather than the alternative of interest rates and the interest rate structure. The tighter money supply target for 1994 should not be seen as a signal for a more restrictive monetary policy, the report said. It reflected rather a lower forecast for the growth of the production potential of the German economy this year - down from 3 per cent in 1993 to 2.5 per cent. The target is also based on a 'price norm' of 2 per cent inflation, underlining the bank's determination to maintain its medium-term measure for monetary stability. Inflation in east Germany, which has reflected a series of 'administered' price increases in housing rents and other charges, would come much closer to west German inflation this year, it said. On the question of a EU-wide money supply target, coinciding with the start of phase two of European economic and monetary union on January 1, the bank said it would 'lack any firm foundation.'</p>

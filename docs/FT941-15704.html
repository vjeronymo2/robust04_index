			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft puts pressure on its creditors Metallgesellschaft, the German metals, mining and industrial group, yesterday strengthened pressure on its 120 bank creditors, saying if they did not accept the entire proposed DM3.4bn (Pounds 1.32bn) refinancing package the group would declare itself insolvent. The threat was an attempt to crush last-minute resistance to the package. Norddeutsche Landesbank, a large German public-sector bank owed DM239.4m, denounced the bail-out plan this week. Metallgesellschaft's ultimatum was sent to bank creditors and made public yesterday. Deutsche Bank, which is chairing the bankers' co-ordinating committee, said the outcome would not be clear until late today or Friday. Reflecting uncertainty about the group's fate, its shares dropped DM10 to close last night at DM226. Metallgesellschaft argued on legal and business grounds it would be obliged to declare itself insolvent if banks did not accept the DM3.4bn package. The package envisages a DM1.4bn rights issue, coupled with the conversion of DM1.3bn of bank debt into junior convertible stock and the provision of DM700m of new credits. Despite the continuing opposition of NordLB yesterday, other leading banks said they would support the proposals. Bayerische Landesbank, another public sector bank owed DM381m - compared with the DM240m owed to NordLB - said it would back the bail-out package, as did Barclays Bank, the UK clearer owed DM154.5m. Barclays however expressed reservations, saying there were areas of the agreement which 'required future work'. Although many other banks share the concern about the debt-equity conversion, as well as worries about the way in which the deal has been presented on a 'take it or leave it' basis, they have voted in favour of the package in the knowledge that their financial exposure to the group would be greater if it were declared insolvent. NordLB argues the group's capital should be reduced before banks are obliged to exchange debt into equity. Metallgesellschaft said this was impossible as it would deny the group access to international capital markets.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: American Express admits problems at card division MR JIM ROBINSON, chairman of American Express, the travel and financial services group that has been stung by Wall Street criticism and heavy losses in its Optima credit card division, yesterday made a rare public admission of the problems the core card division is facing. In a surprisingly contrite letter to shareholders, Mr Robinson noted that while the American Express brand name was one of the most recognised in the world, 'competitive pressures have arisen in every arena in which we operate'. The embattled chairman told shareholders: 'For years we were able to remain above the fray of credit card competition. But bank card issuers have turned their sights on our primary markets - the affluent households and travel and entertainment spenders.' Last year, earnings from the group's core travel related services division slumped by 59 per cent, to Dollars 396m, after a Dollars 697m pre-tax leap in credit loss provisions. Worse, in terms of image, American Express has had some well-publicised rows with retail merchants such as Laura Ashley of the UK. Mr Robinson acknowledged the dissatisfaction of many retail merchants with American Express fees that were higher than those of competitors such as Visa or MasterCard. 'We want to ensure the card is welcomed - not just accepted - in service establishments that provide the travel, entertainment and lifestyle services our card members want,' said Mr Robinson. 'That is not always the case today, as some of you may have experienced,' he added. Mr Robinson said these problems were 'unacceptable to us' and stressed that American Express was working on the matter. He promised that retailers who signed a contract with American Express and then suppressed the card's use would have their contracts cancelled. The need to strengthen the group's capital structure, as evidenced by the recently announced plan to float up to 45 per cent of the credit card processing subsidiary, was defined by Mr Robinson as a strategic priority.</p>

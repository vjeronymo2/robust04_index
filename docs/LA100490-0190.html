			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRINGLE, REDDING OFF INJURED RESERVE  </P> <P> Former Cal State Fullerton standouts Mike Pringle and Reggie Redding are a step  closer to making their NFL debuts after the Atlanta Falcons shifted them from  injured reserve Wednesday to the new practice squad roster.  </P> <P> Pringle and Redding were placed on injured reserve Sept. 5, barring them from  playing or practicing for four weeks.  </P> <P> Pringle, a running back and sixth-round draft choice, injured his ribs before  the Falcons' first exhibition game, but played in all four primarily as a  kickoff returner.  </P> <P> Redding, an offensive tackle and fifth-round selection, sustained a neck injury  in Atlanta's Aug. 25 exhibition game against the Green Bay Packers.

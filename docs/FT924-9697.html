			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: T&amp;N poised to make acquisition in Germany T&amp;N, one of the leading UK automotive component makers, is at an advanced stage of negotiations to make its first significant acquisition in Germany. It has held talks with three possible takeover targets, but it is understood that the most probable candidate is Goetze, a components maker with a leading world position in the manufacturing of piston rings, an important engine component. T&amp;N, which had a turnover last year of Pounds 1.36bn, is a leading producer of engine components specialising in piston products, as well as bearings and friction parts, but it has lacked hitherto a strong base in Germany, the leading vehicle producer in Europe. Mr Colin Hope, T&amp;N chairman and chief executive, has previously indicated that the planned acquisition in Germany could cost up to Pounds 100m. The company is planning to finance the move through debt rather than a share issue. Goetze, which has its headquarters in Burscheid, near Leverkusen, is still 82.4 per cent family-owned. It had a turnover worldwide last year of DM886m (Pounds 359m) and has a workforce of about 8,000, of which some 6,000 are in Germany. The company has six plants in Germany, including one acquired in Dresden in eastern Germany last year, which also produces piston rings. It also has plants in the US, France and Turkey and minority interests in Austria and India. An acquisition of Goetze would significantly increase the geographic spread of T&amp;N's operations. Goetze last year derived 36 per cent of its turnover from Germany, 29 per cent from other European Community countries, 18 per cent from North America and 5 per cent from Asia. As a privately-owned German company few financial details are published, but it is understood that Goetze's profits have fallen significantly and that it has recently traded close to break-even. German component makers have been coming under a growing financial squeeze as hard-pressed vehicle makers increasingly look for cheaper sources of supply. German vehicle makers are increasing their purchase of components from the UK, where suppliers already had a considerable cost advantage over German producers, even before the recent substantial devaluation of sterling. T&amp;N is seeking to add a strong technology base in Germany, but it believes that a significant acquisition there would also improve its access to supply the country's vehicle makers from its components plants outside Germany.</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Motor licensing agency to close local offices The Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency is to close all its 51 local offices by 1997 with the loss of 1,500 jobs, it announced yesterday. The agency, which earlier this week announced it was cutting 700 jobs at its Swansea headquarters, said that a pilot computer scheme would eliminate any need for over-the-counter services to the motor trade. It said that about 1,000 jobs involved with collecting car tax could go following the decision to collect the tax continuously, whether a vehicle is on or off the road. The work of dealing with specialist registrations such as trade number plates - involving about 500 employees - could be handled at Swansea or dealt with by agents. The annual cost of the district office network was put at Pounds 40m. The agency said that all customers would be given notice of the changes and that alternative sources of service would be in place before offices were closed. Unions and the Labour party reacted angrily. Mr Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary of the Civil and Public Services Association, described the decision as an 'act of butchery' by the government and pointed out that the agency's staff were last year awarded a Charter Mark for excellence in service delivery. He said: 'The government is making two major assumptions. It is assuming that untried, untested new technology will work, and secondly, that legislation to introduce continuous licensing will pass without opposition. 'Over Pounds 130m remained uncollected last year because of vehicle excise duty evasion. The news of the closure of VRO offices will be music to the ears of the tens of thousands of car-tax dodgers.' Mr John Sheldon, general secretary of the National Union Civil and Public Servants, said the cuts had nothing to do with making the agency more efficient or effective. He said: 'The office closures and planned redundancies are a cynical part of the government's preparations for the privatisation of DVLA.' Mr Tony Lloyd, Labour employment spokesman, said the move was 'a devastating blow' to the agency and to employment. Motoring organisations predicted, however, that the changes need not cause serious problems. The Automobile Association said that most motorists already communicated with Swansea rather than with their local office.</p>

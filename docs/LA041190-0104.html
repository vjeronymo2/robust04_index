			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLINICS HELP THESE ATHLETES REACH THE UPPER LIMITS  </P> <P> Anthony Curran had just demonstrated how to vault 11 feet in the air with one  arm behind his back, then flopped off the mat at Foothill High School last  Sunday afternoon and quickly got back into the routine.  </P> <P> "OK, stay relaxed! Have confidence!" Curran shouted to one of his young  students who was charging down the runway. "Drive the arms and . . .  reeeeeeeach."  </P> <P> Gary Van Sluis, a 5-foot 110-pound freshman at El Modena High School, cleared  the height with little problem. As Van Sluis got off the mat, Curran praised  his technique, and sent the beaming youngster down to the end of the runway for  another try.  </P> <P> It's obvious that Curran, a four-time All-American in the pole vault at UCLA,  enjoys the moment as well. Curran, who has held pole vault clinics for the last  five years, has developed an enthusiastic, highly knowledgeable coaching style  that keeps kids from all over Southern California coming to see him each  weekend.  </P> <P> Curran's weekly clinics might be a saving grace for the pole vault, an event  that is on the decline not only in Orange County but across the nation. "What  he's doing is the greatest thing in the world for kids," Edison Coach Rick  Foster said.  </P> <P> At the clinics, at which Curran charges $20 for sessions that run from 1 1/2-2  hours, vaulters warm up and stretch before working into various technique  drills. Then, the bar is raised and the vaulting begins.  </P> <P> "I always start them off as beginners," said Curran, who was one of five  vaulting brothers who competed for Crespi High School in Encino.  </P> <P> "I'll do clinics wherever I'm needed, whenever coaches call me," Curran said.  "When I was in high school I was lucky, I had a coach who understood the vault  pretty well. But there aren't a lot of coaches well-versed in the event. There  are basic technical things they need to know. Some who don't understand the  event, don't want to deal with it. I would be the same way. If I didn't know  anything about croquet, I wouldn't want to coach it."  </P></p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Letter: Classification problems must not hinder growth of warehouse clubs in UK Sir, Jim Lowe (Letters, April 1) sees the American warehouse club 'more as a retail discounter than a wholesaler'. The format's phenomenal success in the US - 600-plus outlets and about Dollars 40bn of sales in just 10 years - has prompted increasingly heated debate on how to classify the beast. It is a debate which, even before the first UK outlet has opened, has already begun to rage over here. One thing is clear - a supermarket it is not. Sixty-five per cent of the clubs' sales are to business members and 35 per cent to group/individual members. The clubs, which are closed to non-business members on weekday mornings, sell 1,500 lines of food on 60,000 square feet compared to 10 times the range on half the space in a typical supermarket. The goods, mainly in bulk packs, are offered with minimal service and in wholesale-type environments to customers who spend, on average, Dollars 150 per trip. Yet supermarket operators in the US have increasingly felt the clubs to be a threat and it is evident that their British counterparts agree. It would certainly be unfair to allow a retailer-in-disguise to trade from 'cheap' wholesale locations when British supermarket operators have to pay such premiums for their sites. However, restricted-access distributors such as Makro have been trading successfully in the UK for many years and all new forms of fair competition should surely be welcome. Whatever classification our planning authorities eventually decide to put on the warehouse clubs, it would be a pity were the thrill of the purchase they so popularly afford in the US to be denied to consumers in Britain.

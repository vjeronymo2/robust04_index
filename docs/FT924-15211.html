			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Arts: Espana - Concert At the Queen Elizabeth Hall last week the BBC mounted 'Espana', a pair of concerts to mark the Columbus anniversary, both of them broadcast on Radio 3. Every schoolchild may know that this is the most specious of all historical celebrations, but it provided an excellent excuse for such a panoramic survey of Spanish music. The BBC's new controller of music, Nicholas Kenyon, had given his personal imprimatur to these bumper, triple-decked concerts. The juxtaposition of the familiar and the arcane seemed a conscious evocation of the Radio 3 invitation concerts of blessed memory, but the user-friendly introductions - discursive scripts delivered to the audience in the hall and radio listeners alike - revealed the new, caring face of the network: Glockian iconoclasm replaced by slick, Kenyon-style packaging. Mainstream Spanish music was included - the Matrix Ensemble under Robert Ziegler gave a robust, warmly expressive concert performance of Falla's El Retablo de Maese Pedro with Adrian Thompson, Matthew Best and the splendid treble Sam Pay, while Rafael Orozco played four pieces from Albeniz's Iberia  -but the real fascination of the programmes came from the ancient and modern elements. On Tuesday ancient Spain was represented by a selection from the wonderfully energetic and inventive Cantigas de Santa Maria, a 13th-century collection of troubadour songs, sung with great pungency by the Dufay Collective. Friday's concert was opened by the New London Consort directed by Philip Pickett with the renaissance Cancionero de la Columbina, a songbook almost exactly contemporary with Columbus's voyage. Contemporary Spain produced the British premiere of Alegrias by the Andalucian Manuel Hidalgo, former pupil of Helmut Lachenmann and now resident in Stuttgart. It was a valuable introduction to a composer scarcely known in Britain, with an evident gift for arresting textural ideas and a tendency towards music that is mysteriously allusive and artfully intent on obscuring any subtexts. This being a BBC promotion, there was Roberto Gerhard on both evenings too. On Tuesday the Matrix Ensemble had given a sparkling account of Leo, one of the most enduring and directly expressive of his late ensemble works, and Friday's concert revived Gerhard's third symphony, Collages, excellently performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Andrew Davis. The symphony, completed in 1960, is not the most convincing of Gerhard's major orchestral scores. There are some striking ideas, vivid concatenations of instruments with the homespun musique concrete of the pre-recorded tape. Yet the elements do not cohere; the continuity, the dawn-to-dusk programme, is unconvincing. Gerhard's music was uneven, splendidly effective at its best, but his zealous champions continue to overestimate his worth. In the context of this thoroughly rewarding mini-series, though, his was an essential voice. Queen Elizabeth Hall</p>

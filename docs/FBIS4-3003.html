			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 14 (AFP)--China said Thursday [14  April] that, while its return to GATT does not depend solely on  the good will of the United States, it would like US support for  its candidacy. "There are 105 contracting parties in GATT and  the United States is only one. While we notice the importance  of the United States, it is also clear that the United States  cannot be equated with GATT," Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen  Guofang said during a weekly news briefing. Shen was reacting  to remarks by US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who said  Tuesday that China must open its market more if it wants to  rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    A founding member of GATT, China left the organization after  the founding of the communist regime in 1949 and requested  readmission in 1986. Beijing wants to rejoin GATT this year in  order to take part in the future trade organization that will be  created in January 1995. China's reintegration is one of the  main topics at the Marrakesh, Morocco, summit where the final  GATT accord concluding the Uruguay round is to be signed.    While implicitly rejecting Kantor's criticism, the spokesman  said, China wanted the United States to support China's  candidacy. "We have also noted that the US government has  repeatedly promised to staunchly support China's re-entry to  GATT. We hope that that United States will make good on this  promise," Shen said.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Signs of upturn in east Germany fail to lift gloom A SLIGHT improvement in business confidence and economic activity in east Germany was reported yesterday, but not enough to allay widespread concern about the slow pace of new private investment, and rising unemployment wage pressures. Chancellor Helmut Kohl joined the fray with a new plea for east German workers to restrain their pay demands to avoid exacerbating the traumatic restructuring process of east German industry in which tens of thousands stand to lose their jobs. He was backed by the German employers' association, which called for new wage deals to be put on ice, for fear that soaring wage costs would deter investors. The unions, on the other hand, called on the government to put pressure on more big industrial concerns to invest in manufacturing in addition to the service sector. The state of the east German economy, where unemployment rose last month by 306,000 to 1.34m with the ending of special subsidies for short-time working, was the subject of continuing concern at a top-level meeting of business, trade union and government leaders in the Chancellor's office yesterday. The greatest worry is on the fate of more than 6,000 former state enterprises still on the books of the Treuhand privatisation agency, which must decide to restructure them or close them down if it cannot find private purchasers. Mr Kohl reserved his strongest words for the wage pressures coming from the workers themselves, warning that a 20 per cent pay increase would add DM10bn (Pounds 3.4bn) to the annual budget of the Treuhand - at the expense of the whole restructuring effort. The Treuhand had to do its job within a limited budget, and he urged both employers and unions to hold back in their pay deals. At the same time, he agreed that conflicting property claims and poor administration were also causing big problems for would-be investors. Meanwhile, the Ifo economic institute in Munich reported a continued very slight improvement in eastern business confidence, although actual levels of activity remain massively depressed. One third of east German enterprises expected improvement, mainly in exports. However, four out of five cited important handicaps to output growth, dominated by marketing problems caused by the wrong product mix, excessive prices, or inadequate quality. Financing was the second largest problem area. For the first time in living memory, employees at Commerzbank in Frankfurt had a choice of only one meal at lunchtime yesterday, writes David Waller. That was possibly the most tangible evidence of the first banking strike in Germany since the war, and the first strike in Germany's current wage round. Yesterday's strike followed the failure of negotiations with employers last week. The unions are demanding a pay rise of 10.5 per cent and shorter working hours. The employers have imposed a flat 5 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Rolf Gustavsson report: "The Parliament Relaxed Its </F> Demands"]    [Excerpt] Strasbourg -- The European Parliament will not  make any strict formal demand which would delay the admission of  new members in to the EU [European Union]. After less than two  hours of debate yesterday the parliament agreed on a statement  which makes it possible -- theoretically and formally, at least  -- to keep to the very tight timetable for the negotiations with  Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria. Nevertheless the  Parliament's position means in practice that the negotiations  must be fully completed by 8-9 March so that the results are  available on 10 March.    The Parliament will then be able to begin discussion of the  matter based on the summary which sets out the results of the  negotiations, but Parliament demands that the final, legally  binding texts of the agreements be submitted to it before it  votes in May -- probably on 4 May.    At that point the Parliament will have to bring together 260  deputies who will vote "yes."    Usually only around 300 out of 518 parliamentary deputies  are  in place here during the parliamentary sessions, and when it  comes to admitting new members the requirement is that a  majority of the parliament's 518 deputies back such a decision.

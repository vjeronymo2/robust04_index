			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Modern banking I HAVE been persuaded by Midland bank to change my old-fashioned current account to a Meridian account which both credits me and charges me with interest on a monthly basis, depending on whether I am in credit or overdrawn. Interest payable is of course not an allowable charged for taxation purposes, but what of interest credited? Can I net these interest items for tax purposes or should I just ignore both credits and debits. The interest debited is, as you say, ignored in calculating your tax bill. The interest credited will be net after deduction of basic-rate tax, so you will only have more tax to pay on it if you are a higher-rate taxpayer. The tax withheld would be repayable to you if your personal allowance etc. had not been absorbed elsewhere, of course. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Foundations laid for investor watchdog SIR BRIAN Hayes, a former permanent secretary at the Department of Trade and Industry, is to head a 14-member committee set up by the Securities and Investments Board to work on the creation of a regulatory watchdog to protect private investors. Other members of the committee include Mr Peter Taylor, general manager of Sun Alliance Life Division, Mr Jeremy Mitchell, director of the International Consumer Policy Bureau, and Ms Barbara Saunders, a consumer con-sultant who specialises in European Community legislation. The creation of a self-regulating organisation (SRO) for retail investment was the main recommendation last month of a report by Sir Kenneth Clucas. Sir Kenneth was appointed by SIB in October last year to examine the need for replacing the present complex and fragmented system of regulation of retail investment by four different SROs, SIB itself and a number of professional bodies. Sir Kenneth suggested in his report that the new self-regulating organisation should include all activities at present regulated by Lautro, the life-assurance watchdog, and Fimbra, the regulator for financial salesmen, managers and brokers, as well as some of those of Imro, the pension-fund managers watchdog, and a few of those from the Securities and Futures Association. Sir Brian said yesterday that the committee planned to keep to a target date of April next year by which the new SRO should be operational. The committee will begin its detailed work at the end of this month. Its terms of reference include designing the constitution of the new SRO and determining the scope of its activities and its resource and financing needs. It will also decide the way in which it would obtain recognition under the Financial Services Act and absorb the functions of the existing watchdogs.</p>

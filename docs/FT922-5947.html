			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The end of the image  -Robert Thomson says that Japanese companies have abandoned fancy gimmickry for old-fashioned selling In the heady days of the late 1980s, when the Tokyo stock market seemed able to defy gravity and GNP was growing at 7 per cent, prospering Japanese companies indulged their advertising fantasies. They hired the likes of Mickey Rourke and Mike Tyson, and embarked on lavish publicity campaigns of 'image-up', as profile raising is called in Japan. Manufacturers queued to sponsor their favourite television programmes and became prominent patrons of the arts. That easy money has dried up. Having grown accustomed to double-digit growth in advertising expenditure, which was up 15 per cent in 1989, television networks are having to adjust to meagre increases, while newspapers, magazines and advertising agencies are coming to terms with the first revenue falls since 1965. Dentsu, Japan's largest agency, reckons that newspaper advertising was down 1 per cent in the first quarter, billing for magazines by 2 per cent, and for radio by 7 per cent. Television programme sponsorship was 1 per cent lower while commercials rose 2 per cent. 'The industries hardest hit by the bursting of the financial bubble, like securities and real estate, have cut their advertising the most. Electronics are also down, but other industries, like cosmetics, are still showing growth,' Dentsu said. Advertising by the securities industry, stricken by scandal and losses, fell almost by half last year. Property-related advertising was 12 per cent lower in the first quarter this year. Hardly surprisingly, the changes in advertising match broader changes in spending patterns: Japanese consumers have put off buying that new television or video, and instead are spending increasing amounts on food - reflected in a near 10 per cent rise in food advertising. Companies are responding to the new frugal mood by shifting away from advertising designed to improve their image and towards product-specific messages. Japanese advertisments are famed for their abstruse imagery, with companies taking up costly television time to convey scenes of tree trunks, sunflower stalks and moss-covered rocks that were distant from their products. But falling income and concerns about the success of new products in weak domestic markets have concentrated their campaigns. The trend is evident in the steep fall in property-related television advertising in the first quarter, as the industry uses newspapers and magazines to market individual properties. Land developers had previously been fond of projecting themselves as environment-friendly, renaissance companies, but now they are more interested in selling houses. Sekisui House, the country's largest builder of houses, said economic downturn has prompted the company to 'review the use of advertising' in an attempt to maximise sales of unsold appartments. 'The most important thing for us now is our products,' Sekisui said. Similar sentiments were expressed by Katsuhiko Muramoto, vice-president of Daikyo, the leading Tokyo apartment builder: 'Advertising is a tool for developing our business, but we have to use it in an efficient manner. We are reducing all kinds of waste.' Nissan Motor, the car maker, said that it, too, is most concerned about enticing customers to buy a car rather than enhancing its corporate image: 'This year our budget is down by 10 per cent, but we can't afford to cut television advertising - it's too important. In total, television and newspapers make up about 85 per cent of our advertising expenses.' Companies have become more conservative in their choice of advertising content. Some are unwilling to change long-running themes that have been successful, but now appear tired. Others are re-using themes that brought them success five or six years ago, and even employing the same actors and actresses. In attempting to cut costs for clients, agencies are searching for themes in which to bundle diverse companies. The Hakuhodo agency suggested a joint campaign for Shiseido, the cosmetic company, and the Mainichi newspaper group, both of which are commemorating their 120th anniversaries this year. The agency also expects an increase in cost-saving product partnerships between companies with shared interests - for example, between Honda Motor and Misawa Homes for television commercials showing a house with a two-car garage, and Japan Airlines and Sony, the electronics company, for a package tour that would not be complete without a video camera.</p>

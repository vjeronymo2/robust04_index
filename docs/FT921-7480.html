			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / (CORRECTED) Former Soviet republics to join IMF by summer Correction (published 25th February 1992) appended to this article. RUSSIA and other former Soviet republics are expected to get the go-ahead shortly for admission to the International Monetary Fund, with the prospect of joining by early summer. Only Uzbekistan may temporarily be excluded due to technical problems over its application. Russia is expected to be given a 2.5 per cent quota of what is expected to be an increased IMF capital, according to diplomats. This would place it on a par with the Netherlands in joint ninth place in the IMF after the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Saudi Arabia, Italy, and Canada. Apart from opening the door to badly needed assistance for its switch from communism to capitalism, admission of the former Soviet Union to the Fund will formally end seven decades of economic isolation. Russia is expected to be given a 3.5bn quota of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) which will entitle it to around Dollars 20bn in balance of payments and other IMF assistance over four years, as well as encouraging alternative sources of public and private finance. But the IMF is only expected to be ready to disburse funds from the third quarter of this year, after elaboration of a binding programme of economic reforms and its approval by the Fund. A draft programme, which is being prepared by Russia jointly with the IMF, is expected to be finalised by the end of March. Other republics less advanced on the path of market reform are likely to qualify for IMF funds later. The combined quota of the 15 republics is expected to amount to 4.5 per cent of the Fund's capital and will be divided on a similar basis to the formula used by eight of the republics to share out the former Soviet Union's assets and liabilities. The decision to grant full membership to the independent states, agreed in principle at the Garden City, New York meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations last month, is expected to be discussed by the IMF executive board next month and then at the annual meeting of the IMF interim committeeon April 27. An IMF spokesman in Washington said yesterday he hoped that all the other steps necessary for the former Soviet republics to join the IMF could be completed by early summer. A stabilisation fund for the rouble, which will be available as early as this summer, is being put together separately by western countries. But they have made granting of Russia's request for Dollars 5bn conditional on its admission to the IMF. The Russian ministry of Economics and Finance has been split, with Mr Egor Gaidar remaining in charge of the economics ministry and Mr Andrei Nechaev in charge of the finance ministry. Correction (published 25th February 1992). Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister, has become finance minister, and Mr Andrei Nechayev has become economics minister, not the other way round as reported in Saturday's FT.</p>

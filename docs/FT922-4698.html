			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Salomon legal chief to step up as chairman MR WARREN Buffett, the billionaire investor who rode to the rescue of Salomon Brothers last summer when the Wall Street securities house was swamped by a bond trading scandal, yesterday promoted the company's chief legal counsel, Mr Robert Denham, to succeed him as chairman and chief executive of the parent group, Salomon Inc. The 46-year-old Harvard-educated Mr Denham will have responsibility for overseeing the management of Salomon Brothers and the group's oil refining and trading operation, Phibro. He will initially work full-time at the company, but is eventually expected to become a part-time chairman, allowing him time to continue his work with the California law firm Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson. The day-to-day management of the securities arm will be left to Mr Deryck Maughan, who was appointed chairman and chief executive of Salomon Brothers last week, just a few days after the firm paid a Dollars 290m fine to the government to settle charges related to the bond trading affair. Yesterday's appointment marks the end of a 10-month mission for Mr Buffett, who was brought in to run Salomon in August 1991 when the previous management resigned over revelations that the firm's bond trading desk had rigged several billion-dollar auctions of US government bonds. Mr Buffett, who steered Salomon through the political storm that erupted in the wake of the scandal, had always pledged to step down once a settlement had been reached with the government authorities. He will stay on, however, as chairman of the executive committee of the Salomon board. The appointment of Mr Denham surprised Wall Street, which had expected a new chairman with no previous connections to the securities firm.</p>

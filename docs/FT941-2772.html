			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (15): Delay has been beneficial Over the past four years, Poland has had five governments and five ministers of privatisation, although one of them, Janusz Lewandowski of the Free Market Liberal Democrats, held the job in two different governments. Now the head of an economic think-tank in Gdansk, Mr Lewandowski, who privatised a rush of state companies in his last months as minister in the government of Ms Hanna Suchocka, is at liberty to compare the Polish experience with privatisation elsewhere. 'Looking back, I think we should have taken more advantage of the first flush of romantic enthusiasm for the free market economy and privatised quickly like the Czechs,' he says. 'But unfortunately we had nothing like the clear political leadership shown by Vaclav Klaus, who as finance minister then prime minister of the Czech Republic, has given a single-minded continuity to Czech economic reforms.' Instead, Poland had a series of weak coalition governments. 'My main problems in the last government were the Christian parties, who were suspicious of capitalism in general, and President Walesa who came up with his own scheme promising Poles that privatisation would make them all Dollars 1,000 richer. That made us vulnerable to suspicion that we were selling off the supposed 'family jewels' of Polish industry to foreigners too cheaply or corruptly. The Czechs had stronger and more committed executive power - and a president, the former playwright Vaclav Havel, who did not meddle in economic policy,' he adds. What is more, neither Hungary nor former Czechoslovakia, nor indeed any other former communist state, had any equivalent to the powerful Solidarity movement and the tradition of worker power it represented. Privatisation in Poland has often been delayed and conditioned by the need to involve the workforce. The Suchocka government's tripartite 'Enterprise Pact', which was heavily influenced by the workerist views of Jacek Kuron, the former labour minister and long-time Solidarity and Worker Defence Movement (KOR) activist, specifically gave an important role to the unions and the management of state-owned enterprises. In spite of the obstacles, including the lengthy bureaucratic procedures, the attempt to twin privatisation with a broader industrial development strategy through complex sectoral studies, and the heavily politicised decision-making process, Mr Lewandowski underlines that privatisation has progressed a long way in four years. 'At an enterprise level Polish companies have adjusted much faster than the more chaotically privatised Czech companies. In the Czech Republic the managerial changes associated with private ownership are only beginning and the investment funds are run mainly by state-owned banks.' The statistics tend to back up the former minister's argument. Polish industrial production and GDP have been rising strongly for two years. The Czech Republic and, especially Hungary, are still on the verge of sustained growth.</p>

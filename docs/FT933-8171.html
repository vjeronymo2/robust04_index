			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Textron to sell stake in insurance unit TEXTRON, the US aerospace group that diversified into financial services during the 1980s, said yesterday that it planned to sell a minority stake in its Paul Revere insurance subsidiary, writes Richard Waters in New York. The intended sale of 17 per cent of the disability insurer signals a plan to reduce the group's involvement in the financial services business and focus instead on its manufacturing operations, Textron said. However, it added that it had 'no present plans' to sell further shares in Paul Revere or any other financial services business. Paul Revere, a leading name in the North American individual disability insurance market, generated insurance premiums last year of just over Dollars 1bn. Its profits are not broken down separately, but Textron said it made a 'substantial contribution' to earnings in 1992. Textron said it would offer 7.5m shares in the insurer for sale, and that an over-allotment provision in the sale could take its holding down to 81 per cent. The proceeds will be used to reduce debt, the company said.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Arts: Les Contes d'Hoffmann - Covent Garden For its fourth revival at the Royal Opera in John Schlesinger's 1980 production - now directed by Richard Gregson, and sponsored by British Steel  -Offenbach's not-quite-opera has last June's heroines (Sumi Jo, Anne Howells and Leontina Vaduva), a new Hoffmann and a new evil genius. Between them they produce enough sparks to keep the production ticking over, but it isn't easy work. Jeffrey Tate conducts in faithful style. A finicky critic might wish that the Antonia-trio had a more passionate undertow, and for the whole Olympia act less gentility, more unabashed operetta-attack. Sumi Jo's Olympia rescues that with aplomb:  she plays (and sings, impeccably) the mechanical doll with deadpan wit, but not one winsome nudge to remind us that she is really a clever, lovable artist - something which we could hardly miss. Anne Howells' Venetian courtesan is too artful and knowing for the flaccid campery of the old production (a transvestite or two, pre-adolescent boys in nappies strewing petals), and anyhow not one step of the clumsy action looks believable. She deserves a more upmarket milieu. William Dudley's cluttered set seems to have defeated even David Hersey's efforts to light it evocatively. Tate hustled the Barcarolle, as if fed up with the languid singalong-status it has acquired over the generations, but Nemesis struck when the offstage chorus made a premature entry with its final reprise. In the last act Dr Miracle's low-budget magicking induces no shudders, and the all-too-solid apparition of Antonia's Mother (Anne-Marie Owens) is a plain mistake. Though the want of sympathy for Romantic spookery here is a real drawback, Miss Vaduva's open-throated Antonia - touchingly vulnerable not only in persona but in pitch - captures the right feyness. Gregory Yurisich's Doctor is as ripely flamboyant as his other villainous incarnations, Councillor Lindorf, Coppelius and Dappertutto; there is an apt touch of the Alexei Sayles in them all, and some international-class singing. In other roles Gwynne Howell, Francis Egerton and John Dobson do their ever-reliable things without stretching themselves much. For the thankless part of the student Nathanael (Prologue and Epilogue only) the tenor Lynton Atkinson finds an unexpectedly sharp character, and Jean Rigby again offers a robust, subtle Nicklaus/'Muse'. As for Hoffmann himself, the American Jerry Hadley is not only hopelessly eager and terrier-like, which suits this besotted anti-hero, but vocally rather elegant in very creditable French.  From April 1 his role will be taken over by Neil Shicoff, and Yurisich's quadruple-act by Samuel Ramey.</p>

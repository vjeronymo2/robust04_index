			<p>BFN     [Text] The Timorese resistance has accused the United  Nations of having double standards. In a letter to the UN  secretary general the East Timor resistance says that the United  Nations has double standards when it comes to defending  universal principles. The letter, dated 31 March, and signed by  Konis Santana, leader of the armed front, was given to  Butrus-Ghali last Friday, the day the Portuguese and Indonesian  foreign ministers met in Geneva. In the letter, revealed by the  LUSA news agency today, the resistance leaders speak of cases  where acts of aggression had failed, such as the Soviet invasion  of Afghanistan, Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait, in order to stress that the Indonesian  occupation of East Timor has only given rise to UN resolutions  which have not substantially altered the situation. According to  Konis Santana, this situation continues because of the  political, economic and commercial geostrategic interests of  powerful nations, which lead the United Nations to use double  standards when dealing with acts of aggression.</p>

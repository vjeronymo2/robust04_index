			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TEAMMATES DON'T TRY HARD ENOUGH, PASCUAL PEREZ SAYS  </P> <P> After two weeks with the New York Yankees, Pascual Perez has concluded that  some of his teammates aren't trying hard enough.  </P> <P> "I don't really like what I see so far," Perez said in today's editions of the  New York Daily News.  </P> <P> "I know it's still early, but I don't like what I see."  </P> <P> The Yankees (4-6) have lost five straight and are last in the American League  East, three games behind the division-leading Toronto Blue Jays.  </P> <P> "When I'm not pitching, I'm on the bench and I'm getting ready to pinch-run,"  Perez said. "I'm ready to do anything. I like to do that. That's part of my  job. But I don't see that here.  </P> <P> "There are some guys who should be getting ready to pinch-hit and pinch-run in  the sixth, seventh or eighth, and they just sit there. You have to know when  you're gonna pinch-hit. You have to stretch, you have to get ready. You don't  be sitting down on the bench. You have to prepare yourself mentally."  </P> <P> Perez (1-1) hasn't allowed an earned run in 11 innings. He's given up five  hits, struck out 10 and walked three.  </P> <P> Perez is known as a free spirit who once got lost on his way to the ballpark in  Atlanta. But he thinks the attitude of the Yankees is too loose.  </P> <P> "There's too many jokes during the game in the dugout," he said. "Too many  funny things. Sure, this is a game, but you shouldn't be having fun if you've  lost five in a row. Bull on the bench is no good, especially if you're losing.  I watch everything. I see.  </P> <P> "You know, now it doesn't seem like a big deal. But late in the season you  think about the games you lost early."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Roseanne Barr, the hefty star of the hit TV series "Roseanne," was slapped with  a lawsuit that claims she paid "thugs" $50 to beat a celebrity photographer as  he took pictures of her. Ralph Dominguez claims in a Superior Court suit filed  last week that he was photographing Barr in her car outside the trendy  restaurant Spago on July 14 when the alleged beating took place. The suit,  which seeks unspecified damages, said several men approached the car Barr was  in and spoke with her. She allegedly paid them $50, after which they began to  beat the photographer, according the suit. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

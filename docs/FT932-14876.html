			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Management: An antidote to high health costs - Increased claims are the latest threat to insurers battling to contain medical bills Cost increases are the biggest potential killer of private healthcare in Britain. Controlling them is now as important an issue for private health insurance managers as generating new business. But just as the insurers were congratulating themselves on their progress in containing hospital costs another problem has arisen. 'Cost increases are not now being driven by rises in healthcare prices, but by the increased frequency with which insured people are having treatment,' explains Arthur Large, managing director in charge of membership at Bupa, the biggest private healthcare group. Last year Bupa's average claim costs rose by 9.6 per cent - 7.2 per cent resulting from an increased frequency of claims. The latest trend is in contrast with the recent improvement which has been made in curtailing actual medical bills. Recent tough negotiations with hospital operators have begun to pay off. Innovations such as procedure pricing - hospitals agreeing to perform all operations of a particular type, such as hip replacements, at a single set price - have broken the traditional pattern of medical costs rising faster than general inflation. Roy Forman, managing director of Private Patients Plan, the second biggest medical insurer, said when announcing his annual results last month that PPP had 'made more progress in the important area of claims cost management last year than we did in the whole of the previous decade.' The striking growth in claims has many possible explanations, not all directly clinical. People with private medical insurance sometimes still use the National Health Service for routine treatment; this seems to be happening less, however, after several years of publicity about waiting lists and funding problems in the public sector. Fundholding GPs, who finance their patients' NHS care from overall set budgets, have an incentive to encourage individuals with private health insurance to use it. Last year's sharp growth in claims will have included some employees who feared redundancy and sought treatment while still members of their employers' schemes. Despite these factors, though, Bupa managed to reverse the industry trend in its corporate business sector - covering bigger companies - where the frequency of claims showed a slight fall. The stabilising of corporate claims reflects attempts by Bupa to persuade client companies to manage healthcare schemes more actively. Companies are advised to appoint a specific manager to administer schemes and handle employees' claims. They are urged to consider levying excess charges on employees - people may think twice about opting for treatment if they have to pay part of the cost themselves. Bupa has now advanced from this package of common sense advice to a more sophisticated Care Support Service for corporate clients and their employees. It offers Bupa a hope of managing costs by discussing possible options with patients before treatment begins. Employees of companies in the Care Support scheme telephone a helpline staffed by Bupa nurses once they have been referred to consultants by their GPs. This gives Bupa the option, in appropriate cases, of suggesting that patients consider day-case surgery, one of the biggest cost-saving measures currently available in hospitals. Day-case surgery saves around 30 per cent on typical costs by avoiding the need to keep patients in hospital beds overnight. Hospital accommodation and nursing charges amount to more than 40 per cent of total insurance claims - a night in a private hospital room will usually cost between Pounds 180 and Pounds 280. When an in-patient stay is necessary Bupa nurses will, with patients' permission, discuss home-care needs with their consultants and organise nursing and domestic support to meet them. Around one-third of large companies insured by Bupa are already enrolled in Care Support. It treads delicate ground - Large and his colleagues know patients want to be sure decisions about treatment are made on medical grounds, rather than to meet the cost-control desires of an insurance company. To help provide reassurance, the scheme contains provision for a second specialist opinion for patients undergoing surgery. But there are prospects of schemes such as Care Support turning everyone into winners. Health managers like day surgery because it is cheaper. Companies will like it if it helps keep premium increases down (premium increases for Bupa's company schemes have been 7 per cent during the past year - half the level of increase for individual customers). Patients like it because it avoids having to stay in hospital unnecessarily. And many doctors say that, for appropriate procedures, day surgery results are better those of conventional methods.</p>

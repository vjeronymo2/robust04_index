			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Russia condemns Nato threat of air strikes: Moscow calls for urgent UN Security Council meeting Russia yesterday called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council in an attempt to head off Nato air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, threatened in a Nato declaration on Wednesday. The council, which is expected to meet today, should examine 'practical ways of demilitarising Sarajevo and introducing direct rule by the United Nations', said Mr Grigory Karasin, Russia's foreign ministry spokesman. Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary-general, had a duty to consult the council before declaring any action, Mr Karasin added. In Washington, however, a senior aide to President Bill Clinton said he saw no need for a Security Council session. He said existing council resolutions gave enough authority to launch air strikes if the Bosnian Serbs refused to pull back their heavy weapons. Another White House official said Mr Clinton had been trying without success to telephone Russian President Boris Yeltsin who, according to a Kremlin spokesman, had retired to his country residence with a cold. The Russian demand underlines widening differences between Moscow and Nato on the question of air strikes. And it threatens to end a broad agreement on the international response to fighting in the former Yugoslavia. Nato's ultimatum requires the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy artillery and tanks surrounding Sarajevo from a 20km zone around the centre of the capital, or place them under UN control. It also calls on the mainly Moslem government of Bosnia-Hercegovina to place its heavy weapons within the same exclusion zone under UN control. In Bosnia yesterday, there were signs the Serbs were already acting to avoid air strikes. Serb forces around Sarajevo allowed UN peacekeeping troops to move into six frontline zones as part of a plan to lift the siege of the Bosnian capital. The troop movements came after Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said during peace talks in Geneva that his forces would implement an agreement to withdraw their artillery and put it under UN control. In Moscow, Mr Anatoly Adamishin, Russia's first deputy foreign minister, challenged Nato's right to make 'threats and ultimatums to use force'. However, he also stressed that Russia shared the horror expressed at the deaths caused by the mortar attack in Sarajevo last weekend, and he saidRussia would agree to 'press for 'peace by force' if if all members of the Security Council agree'. Western diplomats acknowledge that the Russian government is under growing pressure from nationalist forces. But they believe that air strikes would not seriously damage the west's relationship with Russia. Russia's request for an emergency council meeting was due to be discussed at closed-door consultations at the UN in New York last night and be part of a debate already called for by Bosnia and Islamic governments in support of the Nato action.</p>

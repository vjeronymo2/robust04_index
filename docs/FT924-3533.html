			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Monday Interview: Managing director at the Yard - Paul Condon, the incoming Metropolitan Police commissioner, speaks to Alan Pike The new Metropolitan Police commissioner began his career as a constable on the beat in London's east end, where Dixon of Dock Green, that most nostalgic of television series, was set. 'I was never Dixon of Dock Green,' he confesses. 'We may not like to admit it, but he was just part of the mythology of 1950s and 1960s Britain.' Indeed, many realities of contemporary police life, both good and ill, were excluded from Dixon's world. His notebooks were never subjected to scientific analysis to see whether he had falsified evidence. Rioters on neglected housing estates did not fire-bomb him simply because he was a symbol of authority. Terrorism was not a daily feature of police work in his London. But what concerns Paul Condon who takes over the most high-profile post in British policing in February, is the lingering impression that Dixon and his amiable pals at Dock Green police station could solve every crime, catch all the baddies and effortlessly keep the peace. The real police of Dixon's era never managed to do all that, and they cannot today. In Condon London is about to gain a police chief who will be very frank about that reality. 'The notion that a small number of police officers in the community can prevent crime is nonsense. I am not trying to sound complacent. What I am saying is that we must be absolutely clear about how we use our resources, and share with the public what we can do and how they can help.' Condon takes over at a particularly challenging time. The terrorist threat is again rife throughout mainland Britain, as the switch last week of the bombing campaign from London to Manchester showed. There is a recognised need for the police service to repair its image after a series of miscarriages of justice. Both the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice and the Sheehy inquiry into police pay and structure are due to report next year. These could lead to wide-ranging changes, from the way the police interviews suspects to the service's career structure. Commissioners find themselves promoted into the role of national spokesmen for the police service on such issues, as well as having to run the Metropolitan force. And Condon is not only going to run the Met; he is going to change it. He has agreed with Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, that he will serve a relatively long initial term. 'For an organisation of the Met's size to get through the sort of change process I want it to go through will take all of seven years.' The remark will send a shudder around the corridors of the Met's New Scotland Yard headquarters, where there are fears that Condon's top targets for change will be among the force's high command. Recent Audit Commission reports have suggested that the service is over-managed at senior levels, and in his present post as chief constable of Kent Condon has shown himself ready to tackle the problem. At 45, he is the youngest of recent commissioners and, provided he has a supportive home secretary, has a good chance of pushing through substantial reform. Condon is one of the police service's new breed of fast-track, graduate chiefs. He joined the Met when he was 20, was selected for accelerated promotion and won a scholarship to St Peter's College, Oxford. where he took bachelor's and master's degrees in jurisprudence. Condon is very much Clarke's personal choice for the commissioner's job. Although the home secretary is preparing his ground cautiously, he suspects there is substantial inefficiency waiting to be rooted out of Britain's police service, and sees in Condon evidence of a likely ally in the cause. Two aspects of Condon's previous career - the first as a teenager before he joined the police and currently at Kent - illustrate how he is likely to behave as an agent of change. He left school at 16 and, until he was 20, worked for a small industrial publisher. The young recruit spent his last year there managing the company, responsible for between 40 and 50 employees. This sparked an awareness of management issues that has become a central feature of his style as a chief constable. Screens in Kent police headquarters display information, updated every 10 minutes, on the force's state of activity and readiness. Condon talks of performance indicators, output measurements and devolved budgets. Occasionally - in language that would have seemed entirely foreign in Dock Green police station - he refers to Kent police as the business and himself as its chief executive rather than chief constable. 'When I go to the Met I shall have an organisation of 44,000 people and a budget of Pounds 1.5bn. The disciplines involved in running a police force are not dissimilar to those of the private sector,' Condon says. He has engineered a three-stage managerial revolution during his three years at Kent. Stage one was to identify what he describes as the force's core business. Opinion surveys of the customers - the public - showed people wanted a fast emergency response; visible 'bobbies-on-the-beat' policing and compassionate treatment for victims of crime and other misfortunes. Stage two was to organise the force to deliver these core objectives, while stage three consists of rigorous monitoring to ensure that standards are being met. A team of headquarters staff spends all day telephoning victims of crime and other police customers, asking if they were satisfied with the service they received. Condon's stage two is the cause of apprehension among some of his future colleagues at Scotland Yard. Kent's reformed delivery system is based on the devolution of all possible decision-making functions to local police stations. People who run Kent stations, he says proudly, have more freedom than some chief constables. This was achieved, however, by eliminating an entire tier of divisional middle-management and through the early retirement of senior officers at chief superintendent level. 'To take out a whole divisional command structure of very loyal colleagues who have given all their careers to policing, and to change the ground rules around them, is a painful process. Fortunately, the people involved saw why we were trying to change and were supportive.' Kent and the Met are not interchangeable forces, however. The latter has semi-national responsibilities, including the fight against terrorism and protection of the royal family and VIPs, that require central co-ordination. But there is no doubt Condon will repeat his experiment in the devolution of responsibility for basic policing in London, and equally no doubt that the Met's command structure of high-ranking officers is in line for thinning out. Colleagues say Condon, an opera lover and sports enthusiast who is married with three children, is a relatively private man. He recognises that the high media profile and public image of the commissioner's post will intrude on his family life. and acknowledges that there may be worse to come. 'I really mean this - I would not have felt a failure if I had ended my career without being Metropolitan Police commissioner. Having been given the enormous challenge of taking it on, I will do the job to the very best of my ability. In doing that, I know it will make me vulnerable to personal criticism. Any commissioner who tries to change things is vulnerable to dirty tricks campaigns, rumour and innuendo.' In spite of the bad publicity the police service has received in recent years, Condon is convinced that it has become a far better trained, better equipped, higher quality organisation since he joined it 25 years ago in the real Dock Green. 'One of the great tragedies is that as all these improvements have taken place the image of the service has dropped.' This has arisen, he says, from more critical and questioning attitudes to public services in general; from the police having tried to do too much, failing miserably in some areas; and from miscarriages of justice such as those leading to the release of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six. 'I feel a tremendous obligation to try to build the image up again,' he says. 'We cannot stop crime, but if you are in trouble we can help you very quickly. You will see police officers on reassuring patrol. We will take care of you if you are a victim of crime. The new moral high ground for the police service is around these issues.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1947     Born in Dorset. 1967     Joins Metropolitan Police. 1972-75  St Peter's College, Oxford.

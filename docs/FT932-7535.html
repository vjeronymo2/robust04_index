			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Travel Focus (Touring Europe): Just one vaporetto . . . - The grace and charm of the Veneto SOME GILDED cages are hard to escape, even in the sultry, seething months of high summer. Could there be a more blissful way to start the day than to be slowly awakened by the rhythmic slop of water against moored gondolas, the cries of gondolieri - even the grinding gears of a vaporetto? To muffle up in a thick bathrobe and linger over breakfast on a fifth-floor balcony surveying the Grand Canal as it stirs into life in the milky, early morning light? The idle are amply rewarded by the industry of others. Chugging motorboats, the life-blood of Venice, criss-cross the Grand Canal. A maritime greengrocer pulls in at the jetty below. After perfunctory negotiation, out come boxes of neatly packed pale verdura, ranks of gleaming peppers, aubergines, lemons, plums. Look up from this lush bird's-eye view and there are the gigantic snail volutes of the church of Santa Maria della Salute staring you in the eye. Tempting though it might be to linger, the time has come to do what privileged Venetians have done for half a millennium: exchange their Venetian palazzo for a Veneto villa. The Veneto is the other face of the Most Serene Republic. Mercifully, the hordes who pound Venice ever further into her patient watery grave rarely make time to explore the blue distant landscapes and fortified hill-towns that are depicted in their favourite altarpieces by Lotto and Giovanni Bellini. Stand in the first-floor salon of the Villa Barbaro at Maser, now an hour or so's drive from Venice, and you understand the point at once. The villa was built as a summer retreat for two Venetian brothers around 1557-58 by Andrea Palladio. He gave them living quarters in separate wings which meet in a suite of airy reception rooms frescoed by Veronese. With the balcony doors open and the blinds up, light floods in and enlivens every square inch. In contrast, even on the brightest day Venetian palaces seem cavernous and gloomy. From the balcony, the eye follows the sweep of the formal garden and soars towards the open fields beyond. Veronese extends that landscape indoors, confecting romantic vistas beyond trompe l'oeil marble balustrades and rustic scenes reflecting the four seasons. Allegorical figures celebrate the pleasures of music. Vines garland the ceiling. The mood is light-hearted, the visual puns legion. Dogs peek around make-believe columns. Shoes and a brush seem to lie discarded on a marble ledge. A huntsman and his hounds burst through an imaginary door. A fair gentlewoman in pale silks, her maid and lapdog, look down from the faux balcony above. At Maser, the aristocratic and learned Barbaro brothers played (seriously) the gentleman farmer. The rooms behind the long, ochre arcades at the ground-floor level of each wing housed farm equipment, labourers and animals. The farm provided the brothers with welcome additional income but the villa is, first and foremost, a man-made Arcadia, an evocation of an unreal world, informed by an essentially urban, sentimental view of the countryside. Our palazzo in Venice, the stately ocean-linerish Hotel Bauer Grunwald, had been relinquished for a 16th century villa at Asolo that was once home to Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. As the Hotel Villa Cipriani it is both haven and perfect base for exploring the villas of the Veneto - and Palladian Vicenza - and the small towns that fringe the luxuriant foothills of the Monte Grappa. Asolo may have become self-conscious about its charm and its famous residents (from the Brownings and Eleanora Duse to Freya Stark), but some 500 years after the Venetian republic ceded it to Caterina Cornaro, Queen of Cyprus, Jerusalem and Armenia - in return for Cyprus  - the town retains something of the spirit of her cultivated humanist court. Miraculously, Lorenzo Lotto's Madonna in Glory is still to be found in Asolo's small cathedral. Similarly, Conegliano boasts a fine altarpiece by Cima, Vittorio Veneto an even more impressive Previtali. Castelfranco has even succeeded in hanging on to its Giorgione altarpiece, albeit shown behind bars. The museum at Bassano del Grappa is crammed with works by generations of the da Ponte family, notably Jacopo, who more or less established the genre of the pastoral landscape. It is an extraordinarily handsome town, graced with a breathtaking site, sharp mountain air, a famous covered bridge designed by Palladio - and equally celebrated grappa. An almost surreal contrast to the gentle, accommodating landscape around Asolo is provided at Possagno where the great neo-classical sculptor Antonio Canova built a gipsoteca, or studio, behind his family home and a massive, Doric-columned marble temple that acts both as mausoleum and parish church. The gipsoteca contains the models and plaster casts of nearly all his inventions, some camp, some astoundingly erotic, but most faintly ridiculous to modern sensibilities. In their austerely classical, all-white interior, the life-size icing-sugar heroes, seated matrons and simpering nudes sit like props awaiting curtain-up on a long-unfashionable play. The region's rolling olive- and cypress-clad hillsides have often been likened to Tuscany. Perhaps that partly explains the English love affair with the Veneto. One crucial distinction is that the food - and the wines - here are far, far better. For foodies with long pockets there is Da Lino at Solighetto. For fungophiles, a short season in September offers seventh heaven, with the local delicacies of finferli and chiodini, or 'little nails.' To acclimatise to the idea of returning to the big city, take an hour or two to inspect Treviso. Sample its bitter red chicory, the variegated, wild radicchio rosso, and the chapter house of the monastery of San Niccolo where, in his frescoes of 1351, Tommaso da Modena gave us our earliest surviving representation of someone wearing spectacles. Susan Moore travelled to Venice and returned from Treviso with Italian Escapades, which offers holidays to Italian cities and resorts tailor-made at most price levels.

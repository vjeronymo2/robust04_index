			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Renault to sell control of loss-making Argentine unit RENAULT, the French government-owned car maker, plans to transfer control of its loss-making Argentine subsidiary to three Argentine and Brazilian investors. Renault says it has signed a letter of intent with a group of investors led by Mr Manuel Antelo, head of a leading Argentine components maker, who will together own 67 per cent of COFAL, a Luxembourg-based vehicle created to hold Renault's former 72 per cent stake in the subsidiary. Renault will still hold 33 per cent of COFAL, cutting its share in the subsidiary to 24 per cent. The remaining shares are held by the public. Renault would not disclose a sale price or indicate how the buyers were financing their acquisition. However, Renault is listed on the Buenos Aires stock exchange where it has a market capitalisation of Dollars 841.5m, valuing the sale at about Dollars 408m. Renault's retreat is taking place against a background of increasing competition, government demands for greater investment and economic integration with Brazil.</p>

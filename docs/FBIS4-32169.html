			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 17/6/1994 -- Commenting in a  press conference on Friday, 17 June, on the letter sent to  Romanian President Ion Iliescu by the leaders of the opposition  parliamentary groups on Thursday [16 June], whereby the  president was being asked to attend the joint session of the two  chambers of parliament in order to deliver some explanations  about a recent statement he made, presidency spokesman Traian  Chebeleu stated: "We are bewildered by the unconstitutional  character of the means by which the parliamentary groups of the  opposition are trying to bring the president in front of  parliament. The president has not been elected by the  parliament and cannot be summoned to answer for his acts at the  initiative of several parliamentary groups who have involved  through this invitation the whole parliament without previously  consulting the whole parliament."    Reiterating the essence of the president's statements made  during a visit in the country [in Satu Mare] with regard to the  issue of the nationalized houses, the presidency spokesman said  that the statements were perfectly legal and in concordance with  the presidential prerogatives and therefore "the president has  nothing to retract."    The very fact that the president would not follow a  procedure, considered to be unconstitutional, of coming in front  of the legislative, does not exclude the president's readiness  for dialogue with any political formation on the basis of mutual  respect, said the spokesman.    "The president will come in front of parliament any time it  is necessary, but only if the constitutional provisions are  observed," said presidency spokesman Traian Chebeleu.</p>

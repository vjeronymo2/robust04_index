			<p>BFN     [Text] A member of Parliament has described as selfish  political motives suggestions by some opposition members that  Zambia should change electoral rules to provide for two voters'  rolls, one for the rich and another for the poor.    Kafulu member of parliament Dr. (Yusuf Dadat) said yesterday  that the proposed idea was pathetic and [word indistinct] on  some political figures trying to fulfill their selfish  ambitions. Dr. (Dadat), who is on a tour of his constituency,  told a public meeting that it was surprising that when the  concept of one man, one vote was acceptable the world over, some  people wanted change only to suit their selfish interests.    He said the MMD [Movement for Multiparty Democracy]  government should not allow a situation whereby the privileged  determined the destiny of the majority.</p>

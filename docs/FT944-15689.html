The Commission, which is sifting through more than 2m claims totalling nearly Dollars 160bn, will focus on damage to individual property and compensation for those forced to flee Kuwait. Most claimants will have to wait for their money until the UN lifts its ban on Iraqi oil sales. Russian economy: An International Monetary Fund mission starts talks in Moscow on Russian economic reform, the government's budget and possible financial assistance for a stabilisation programme. World trade: Trade ministers, officials and business executives begin a week in Colombus, Ohio, to discuss cutting the costs of doing business abroad.

Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, announces its 1994 first-half results.

FT Surveys: Business Schools: An A-Z Guide and International Telecommunications. 18 TUESDAY Turkic states hold summit Leaders of Turkey and the five Turkic states of the former Soviet Union meet in Istanbul for their second summit (to Oct 19). The group was set up in 1992 at Turkey's instigation, to draw together Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The two-day meeting is likely to be dominated by the crisis in Bosnia, the Middle East peace process and unrest in the Caucasus, especially the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Turkey's grandiose aim of creating a Turkic federation, floated at the inaugural conference two years ago, has faded. Russia's continued strong presence in the region overshadows all talk of unity.

Dynamic economics: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is to hold a high-level informal meeting for participants from OECD member countries and nine Dynamic Non-Member Economies (DNMEs) at a hotel in Tokyo.

Diplomats say the rubber-stamp legislative body is convening about a month earlier than usual because the communist leadership wants to tackle economic issues such as inflation and the growing budget deficit before the year is out. Trade negotiators meet in Geneva for two days in a bid to thrash out a new Gatt code of fair trade practice for civil aircraft. With the US and the European Union far apart, hopes are dimming that a deal can be reached by the year-end deadline. Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani visits India - a few weeks after Iran received Farooq Ahmad Leghari, president of its ally Pakistan. Iran hopes to build a gas pipeline through Pakistan to India, but Rafsanjani has said economic co-operation between the three states is being held up by tension between India and Pakistan.

But many deputies remain furious about the whole affair and may bring the vote forward to earlier in the week. CIS summit: Leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States are due to meet in Moscow to debate economic union - formally agreed last month but not yet in place. Russian-Ukrainian relations will come up again; resolution of such thorny issues as the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's debts to Russia is still distant. German M3: The September figures for the erratic M3 broad measure of the money supply are due for release.

UK economy: There have been tentative signs, notably the August fall in manufacturing output, that the pace of UK economic growth slowed in the third quarter. Today's first estimate of gross domestic product growth is expected to reveal a 0.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter rise, down from 1.1 per cent in the previous three months. 22-23 WEEKEND Kyrgyzstan referendum The Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan holds a referendum on Saturday on the future shape of the Kyrgyz parliament. The former parliament, a hangover from the Soviet period, dissolved itself last month.

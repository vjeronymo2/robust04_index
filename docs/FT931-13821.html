			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Air France slips to FFr3.2bn loss AIR FRANCE, the French state carrier, yesterday announced a consolidated loss of FFr3.2bn (Dollars 597m) for last year, but said it expected to halve this loss in 1993. Mr Bernard Attali, president, last month warned that his company's 1992 loss would be around FFr3bn. In 1991, the airline made a FFr685m loss. After a board meeting yesterday, Air France said its hope for a reduced 1993 loss was based on the assumption that it would carry 6 per cent more passengers and 7 per cent more freight than it did in 1992. Last year, it saw an 8.7 per cent rise in passenger traffic. Mr Attali has complained to the European Commission that its competition directorate has favoured his arch-rival, British Airways, to Air France's detriment. He has also warned Brussels against rushing deregulation in a way that could weaken European airlines financially as it has in the US. To counteract this, Air France will slim its workforce by a further 1,200 this year. But some new jobs related to the servicing of aircraft from Sabena, the Belgian carrier in which Air France has an important stake, will be created. Last year, Air France reduced its payroll by 1,900, including some forced redundancies for the first time in its history.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Alberto Ronchey: "Three Men in a Boat and a </F> Middle Course"]    [Text] Since the 12 June elections [Northern League  Secretary] Bossi seems to be increasingly on a collision course  with [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi. This, because he can  see the League's electorate being encroached on by his pushy  ally, with his image as the first businessman to head a  government, and his government by television penetrating  everyone's homes. Perhaps the inventor of Forza Italia will not  demolish the League's base in the deep north. But, as some  sociologists have pointed out, it is focusing on the urban  services sector and industry in the provinces. It is gathering  support among the fluctuating bourgeoisie that is crying out for  optimism and expects another Italian miracle capable of pushing  prosperity well beyond the level of "a little workshop and a  little Alfa Romeo," despite the millions of billions of public  debt and the troubles affecting big industry. Can people be  permitted to dream? It is natural, in every era and under any  conditions, as Manilov showed in Gogol's "Dead Souls."    This is a desperate situation for the League leadership. And  the prospects are of conflict between Bossi and Berlusconi,  partly because they share no common language that can reconcile  the League's unsophisticated supporters in the valleys and city  outskirts with the Berlusconi supporters, who prefer to talk  about opinion polls, targets, ratings, and shares.    The level of the conflict is rising, partly because, after  the [former League ideologue] Miglio case it has become apparent  that Berlusconi is unwilling to pay any special regard to the  unruly Bossi. So the latter's fundamental survival instinct is  coming into play, and that can prove fierce.    His ministers in the government seem more cautious, but they  all share the survival instinct, which prompts "that crazy uncle  from Brianza" [Bossi] to sometimes go too far.    Other League representatives point out that it is  unnecessary, even dangerous, to attack Berlusconi every day, but  add that it would be unacceptable to dissolve into the  "Berlusconi soup."    So how, for instance, will the League's parliamentarians  vote  when the television decree is debated? This document, subject  to several amendments before becoming law, may perhaps gain  garner some additional support capable of investing, through  drastic regulations, Berlusconi's shares in order to resolve the  conflict between public and private interests. For weeks Bossi  has been criticizing Fininvest -- the private half of the  political authority of television -- while controversy raged  over the spoils sharing system that has for years dominated the  RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], which can now be either  freed from this system or subjected to it once more.    But there is more besides the skirmishes between the two  most  obvious antagonists. Bossi has all the more reason, if  possible, to be on a collision course with [National Alliance  leader] Gianfranco Fini. This, because the League's voters in  the Po Valley are demanding autonomy for local government to  levy taxes right away and abhor the leanings toward state  control and welfarism of the postfascists, who have their  dominant strongholds from Rome southward. And also because  Bossi's supporters are remote from the bureaucracy in Rome,  whereas Fini's supporters have always had reference points there  and are indeed exerting pressure on and surfacing in every  department.    Bossi can also consider himself free from any electoral pact  with Fini. While the balance of forces in the Senate remains  uncertain, the main coalition in the Chamber of Deputies  consists of two separate alliances -- between Berlusconi and  Bossi in the north and between Berlusconi and Fini in the south.  There was no joint program among the three at the national level  for the March elections, nor are there any direct relations  between Bossi and Fini. But behind Fini there is now emerging a  substantial band of "comrades" who retract nothing with regard  to fascism, and "all their pride lies in that nothing."    This being so, how are parliamentary proceedings likely to  be  in the near future? Already in the dispute over committee  chairmanships, the government alignment lost in the Senate,  5-13, because it refused to believe that an understanding with  the opposition forces was opportune, not on the basis of the old  and deplorable system of "associationism" but from the viewpoint  of the balance of forces. Be that as it may, what are those  five committees worth, if the chairmen on the government side,  almost all of them making their debut, are not acquainted,  through inexperience, with every aspect of the regulations and  every aspect of parliamentary practice?    Parliament already has to consider some 70 decrees on  urgent matters that have yet to be made law. Then there will be  the budget session, with the Finance Bill and its "supplement,"  with insufficient scope to satisfy the government's legislative  ambitions. Among other things, it will be necessary to fill the  financial chasm, some 30 trillion lire, created in the budget by  two rulings by the Constitutional Court concerning INPS  [National Social Security Institute] pensions. How often will  the government be defeated in the Senate? These are troubled  times, despite the prime minister's persistent optimism since  the 12 June elections, just a month after the inauguration of  his new ministers, at a time when nobody could yet judge their  work in relation to the promises and expectations.    If, moreover, the government's uncomfortable position in the  Senate is exacerbated by conflicts among the three major groups  within the coalition, plus the demands of the minor groups, in  the months ahead we may witness an outright storm in parliament.  Certainly, Berlusconi will claim credit for any partial success  and will blame any possible failure on the other forces'  parliamentary strategy, will talk about ungovernability, and  will threaten another early election. But what will his chances  in six months' time, or more be? And what will the opinion  polls show, assuming that the president agrees to another  election?    Under such circumstances, anything is possible. Indeed, any  observer can only be considered reliable for 24 hours. This is  the case of the daily newspaper, which knows everything, but  what it knows changes every day. Silvio Berlusconi has promised  a firm hand and a "middle course." But in some respects, and  without any rash forecasts of the outcome of the enterprise, the  situation is reminiscent of Jerome K. Jerome's story about that  high-spirited and adventurous river outing, "Three Men in a  Boat": "I was at the tiller..."</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Recovery? When? OF ALL the traps that lie in the path of the new investor the 'recovery share' must surely by the most insidious. The pit is so perfectly camouflaged. This is not 'speculation'; it is 'investment': backing some solid famous company which has run into a bit of bad luck. Consider, for instance, Sears, with a world-famous emporium in Oxford Street, half the shoe shops in England, not to mention shoe factories, men's wear, women's fashions, sports goods and buttressed by property. A veritable treasure chest. Surely the only direction now must be up. Or look at that classic 'recovery share', Chloride. Investors might not agree, but then they have been sitting at the convalescent's bedside for five yeas, watching the share price fall lower and lower. As for Sears' 'recovery', the city editors of two leading Sunday newspapers in December 1985 placed it high among their selections for the coming year. It was then 104p and it is now around 105p - a recovery share on the way to becoming as permanent a feature of the scene as the Lutine bell at Lloyds. The invisible factor in the recovery share trap is time, which almost always seems to be longer than expected. It is true that these long lingering convalescences may often be broken by moments when the patient suddenly sits up in bed - before falling back exhausted on the pillow. Ever buoyed by bid rumours, Sears did at one point reach 180p, and Chloride 100p (in 1987) before the relapse. Clearly, the successful investor needs to buy at precisely the moment recovery is imminent, prudently selling before the relapse. Not an easy trick. It is important to inquire closely why the bargain basement share acquired the recovery tag in the first place. For the recovery share proper is not merely a cyclical share, but a share marked by misfortune. Some companies, like some human beings, become accident-prone. A single World in Action TV programme, casting doubt on the durability of timber-frame houses wreaked enormous damage - with little real justification  -on Barratt Developments in 1983/84. The shares dropped from 250p to 150p within two years. The curious, opulent convalescence of Sears owes much to the extraordinary and abundant diversity of the shipbuilding-to-shops to factories-to-property empire hurriedly amassed in the 1950s by the financier Charles Clore. Chloride's perennial recovery status is rooted in the pioneering of the Chloride Electrical Storage Syndicate Ltd of 1891, and its failure to invest soon enough for changing times. So, for these convalescents, the essential question for the recovery share addict must be: How long? For recovery share addicts, reading the back issues of the financial press can be a salutary exercise. In the summer of 1990 an analyst of Salomon Brothers was recommending the purchase of the Dares Estates at 14p a share, because of its exceptionally high discount to asset values  - a fact to gladden the recovery share addict's heart. Alas, from confident talk of sums to come from rent reviews, the emphasis now changed to emergency sales, bank guarantees and, to quote Dares chairman  -survival. The shares were 3p this month. Hope, said Schopenhauer, the gloomy philosopher, is the 'hook through the nose by which humanity is led'. Nevertheless, as the persistence of these things called 'recovery shares' shows, the hook holds. Last November the brokers Wise Speke issued a buy note on Sears Holdings. There are now clear signs, it said, the share should now be viewed as a quality recovery stock, but the shares do not as yet carry a recovery rating. It could be right. Who knows?</p>

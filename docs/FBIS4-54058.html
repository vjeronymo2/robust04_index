			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- The leader of Japan's second  largest opposition party restated a demand Tuesday [24 May] that  the minority cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata resign,  while suggesting a new coalition government could be formed with  a reformed Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama  made  the remarks at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan.    "The cabinet should resign en masse so that an  administration  can be established that has a more stable foundation and has the  confidence of the people needed to solve important problems  existing both inside and outside Japan," Murayama said.    But he said the resignation should be put off pending  passage  in the Diet of the fiscal 1994 national budget bill and other  related bills.    Murayama said that following resignation of the cabinet or  after a snap general election, "the SDP would be prepared to sit  at the table and make earnest efforts to form the new  government."    He denied reports of a division of opinion between himself  and SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, who recently suggested  the prospect of a coalition between the SDP and its former  archrival, the LDP, now the largest opposition party.    "The SDP's policy direction is that we would not form a  coalition with the LDP in the form it has taken over the last 38  years," Murayama said.    By the same turn, he said, "the LDP must change  significantly  or else it will be unable to elicit the trust of the people."    Murayama also said the SDP and other parties must similarly  change and consider that the best framework should be for  formation of a coalition government.    He said the SDP is prepared to cooperate with many LDP  members who say they value protection of the Constitution and  democracy, and who make efforts to prevent corruption.    The present coalition is mainly formed by Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Japan New Party. The SDP,  which was the largest party in the previous cabinet led by  Morihiro Hosokawa, quit the coalition late last month in protest  against the abrupt formation of a large parliamentary group  excluding it.</p>

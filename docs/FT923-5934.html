			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Substituting new lives for old - Philip Coggan looks at the restructuring trend of split capital trusts 'YOU NEVER give me your money, you only give me your funny paper'. Shareholders in split capital investment trusts may be tempted to hum that Beatles refrain at the moment as they contemplate the spate of restructurings in the sector. Instead of being wound up at the agreed date - with the proceeds returned to shareholders - trusts are prolonging their lives, with new securities being substituted for old. The trend raises the question of whose interest is really being served by these restructurings. It is obviously to the advantage of the managers that the trust continues to exist, since they will continue to receive their annual fee. Paid members of the board have a clear interest in a continuing salary. But what about the shareholders? The issue has been brought into focus by the failed attempt to restructure Yeoman Investment Trust. Yeoman scrapped its proposals yesterday when two institutional shareholders with 48 per cent of the income shares decided to vote against the deal. Split capital trusts were devised by the investment trust sector as a means of increasing their investor appeal. Conventional investment trusts have just one class of share, offering investors a mix of income and capital growth. By splitting a trust, the managers can more closely target investor needs. Early splits created two classes of shares. One received all the trust's income - and so could offer a high dividend yield which appealed to retired, income-seeking investors. Another was entitled to all the capital growth achieved by the trust, after the income shares were repaid - and so appealed to higher rate taxpayers who wanted to use up their capital gains tax allowance. More sophisticated structures have been developed, involving zero coupon preference shares, which pay no dividends but have a set future repayment value. Returns made on these shares are taxed as capital gains, not as income - giving attractive tax advantages to many investors. Split capital structures also deal with a perennial problem of the investment trust sector - the discount. Shares in conventional investment trusts normally trade at a discount to their net asset values - generally acknowledged to a function of limited investor demand for the shares. The tax advantages of splits create additional investor demand. Furthermore, split capital trusts have a limited lifespan - and thus investors know that the trust will eventually be repaid at asset value. These two factors limit the discount - and indeed enable many split trusts to trade at a premium to their asset values. But the prospect of trust restructurings may create problems for some private investors. Suppose you had built an investment plan on the basis of an expected trust wind-up date. You could have bought, say, an annuity and a zero coupon share with the same maturity date. The annuity pays an income stream during its life but has no value on maturity; however, at that point, the zero is redeemed and replaces the original capital invested in the annuity. Such a neat scheme might be ruined if the trust is not wound up. However, it would be wrong to suggest that a restructuring will necessarily be bad news for investors. After a number of years of dividend growth, an income share will probably be paying a very high yield - which the private investor might find impossible to match elsewhere. 'In most cases, it is in the interest of income shareholders to perpetuate the income stream', according to Mr Lewis Aaron, an investment trust analyst at Warburg Securities. And Mr David Thomas, of Greig Middleton, the broker which has been behind several recent restructurings such as Fulcrum and St David's, points out that restructurings have to be approved by 75 per cent of shareholders - a built-in safeguard. Shareholders are hardly likely to approve of deals which leave them worse off. Nor does Mr Thomas see any problems with the idea of restructurings. He argues that one simply needs to look at these trusts on a discounted cash flow basis. If interest rates are 10 per cent, then it should make no difference to a shareholder whether he is offered 110p next year or 100p today. There are difficulties, however, in restructuring a trust so that shareholders in all classes of shares are getting a good deal. Restructurings can accordingly be complex affairs, leaving the average private investor bewildered by the deal on offer. In the case of Yeoman, for example, the capital shares were to be replaced by zero dividend preference shares and the repayment value of the income shares - 100p this year - was to be reduced to 50p in 1999. One small shareholder wrote to the Financial Times: 'The value of the income shares is to be reduced by 50p, said to be recovered by enhanced income at each pay-out. Yet this is to cover a period when it is likely that dividends will remain low . . .Are we being made fools of?' Much the same point was made by Orion Insurance, an institutional shareholder with 24 per cent of the income shares. When it said it would vote against the proposal, Yeoman offered to place its shares in the market. Yeoman yesterday blamed 'adverse market conditions' for its failure to do that. It now looks highly likely Yeoman will be wound up when its life expires. Such problems can probably be avoided in future if shareholders can be offered money, instead of 'funny paper'. Warburg Securities' Mr Aaron says 'these deals need to be structured so there is a cash exit for all classes of shareholders.' M&amp;G takes a similar view. Offering cash means that all shareholders can be satisfied: those who want the trust to continue and those who do not. Perhaps the fatal flaw in the Yeoman deal was that the income shareholders were not offered a cash alternative. Given the number of split capital launches over the last few years, Yeoman's failure to win shareholder approval could be a useful lesson for trust managers planning restructuring deals in the future.</p>

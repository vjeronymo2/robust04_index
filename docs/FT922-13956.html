			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Putting your shirt on power dressing / A look at the importance of style in politics 'THE first thing I noticed about Neil Kinnock . . . was the brilliant gleam from his highly polished shoes . . .This gave one a clue to the fact that he is, in fact, more self-disciplined and organised than might usually be thought.' Thus Brendan Bruce, former Conservative party communications director under Margaret Thatcher, illustrates a paradox at the heart of marketing, particularly the marketing of a political image. The apparently trivial - the well-polished shoes - can be yoked into serving a judgment of considerable importance - Kinnock's managerial and administrative abilities. If Bruce's interpretation takes hold, then John Major could well be looking for a new job tomorrow. But that is a large 'if'. A moment's reflection indicates how shallow such a judgment is; maybe all the Labour leader has done is to buy the marketing notion that human beings can be duped by shiny shoes? Was Michael Foot's sartorial inelegance really responsible for his failure to dislodge Margaret Thatcher in 1983? I suspect that Bruce, the archetypal marketing professional, doubts that proposition. But his commitment to image-polishing (ex-Procter &amp; Gamble, General Foods and Mars) ensures that frankness about the limitations of mass persuasion has small showing in his entertaining book.* Together, Britain's three main political parties will have spent more than Pounds 30m on marketing techniques in an attempt to form the next government. It has been an election largely waged by party backroom activists who have uncritically gobbled up the magic of unsophisticated marketing handbooks, firmly believing that image determines the outcome. But as Bruce points out, image-polishing is a weapon with only supportive value. The trouble is that in a neck-and-neck race, marketeers are tempted to get bigger than their boots. Thus as Labour and the Conservatives have chosen to slug it out on each other's traditional territory - the one trying hard to prove its competence to manage the economy, the other selling a newly-found adherence to the welfare state - the internal recriminations are being laid at the door of supposed failures by the 'communications directorates'. This argument suggests that if only they had rubbed harder on the shoes of their leaders, then victory might have been snapped from the jaws of defeat. That is not an entirely ridiculous notion. Bruce says that 'the impact we make on others depends on the following: how we look and behave - 55 per cent; how we speak - 38 per cent; and what we say - only 7 per cent.' But Bruce is more clever than that. He reminds us that marketing is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for persuading consumers, be they of chocolate bars or election campaigns. He thus castigates politicians for vainly hoping that, in a tight spot, lip gloss can conceal a lack of substance. When old-fashioned ideas like leadership, integrity, clarity of vision and principled policy-making have apparently retreated in the face of image manipulators, surely he who captures the cosmetic tendency will also capture power? Facts dispute that belief. There is a view that Labour 'fought the best campaign' in 1987, and Kinnock certainly had a 45 per cent popularity rating against Thatcher's 41 per cent. But much good that did Labour. So although there is little doubt that in 1992, Labour has again led the marketing slickness field, that may not be enough to overcome suspicions that behind the face-paint is wrinkles. All that image makers can do is to help the tide on its course. Bruce recalls that Hitler, who 'had studied advertising techniques and concluded that consistency and perseverance were the twin secrets of success', made full use of a wide range of techniques. Long before the current campaign, Hitler employed stooge audiences, warm-up men, snappy logos, media manipulation, even direct mail - posting tiny gramophone records of his speeches to supporters. Today's image massagers resort to many of the same tactics. But hyper-inflation and a febrile state structure gave room for Hitler's marketing techniques. Marketing can only ripen; it cannot germinate. Bruce is thus led to some robust conclusions, which future political leaders might well bear in mind: No amount of talent or hype can convince the voter that a sow's ear is anything but that. A popular and respected leader in charge of an unpopular party will usually lose. An unpopular leader in charge of a popular party will probably win. No political image maker can afford to ignore the leader's personality but if that is at the expense of communicating the benefits of policy, then it is always wrong. Those who mistake 'production values' for content are destined for a shock at the polls. Voters make a choice based on the credibility of promises, not on the track record of film directors. On those premises the current race must still be wide open. *Images of Power: How The Image Makers Shape Our Leaders. By Brendan Bruce, Kogan Page, 192 pages, Pounds 16.95.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Regular income from Pru THE PRUDENTIAL has launched a distribution bond designed to appeal to investors who want a regular income. The fund, which will invest in gilts, shares and property, will distribute its growth in the form of extra units. These can be cashed-in to generate the income, or re-invested. Income can be paid monthly, quarterly or half-yearly. The first 5 per cent of income taken in a year will be tax-free. Basic rate taxpayers can take out more than this without incurring a further tax charge, since tax has been paid by the fund already. Higher-rate taxpayers, however, may face a further charge - based on the difference between basic rate and top rate tax - if they withdraw more than 5 per cent a year. The success of Sun Life's distribution bond, which has produced an extremely good investment performance over the past 10 years, is inspiring other companies to enter the market. The idea of getting extra units (rather than merely increasing the unit price) seems to have appeal, although it is rather like getting a scrip dividend instead of cash. But the investment mix of these bonds, which tends to be somewhat on the conservative side, produces a mixture of a decent yield plus the prospect of some capital growth. It would be wrong, however, to assume that growth is guaranteed as it is (with some limitations) on a with-profits bond. It is possible for the unit price to fall and for the investor to lose money. There is a 5 per cent bid-offer spread on the units to reflect the manager's annual charge; there is also an initial charge of 1 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000; those who invest more than Pounds 10,000 will get a 1 per cent bonus, which rises to 1.5 per cent for investments of over Pounds 25,000 and 2 per cent for those of Pounds 50,000 and over. Provident Life has launched a Guaranteed Escalator bond which offers 125 per cent of the FT-SE 100 index's rise each year, with annual lock-in of gains. The bond is designed for the personal pension market and has a minimum investment of Pounds 10,000. A self-invested personal pension can be linked to the bond.</p>

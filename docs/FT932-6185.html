			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Letter: Education voucher a big step forward in bridging academic and vocational divide Sir, Regarding Lisa Wood's article, 'Education voucher scheme proposed' (May 25), it is not just the Confederation of British Industry which is taking forward the idea of 16- year-olds receiving vouchers or credits in exchange for education or training. Calderdale &amp; Kirklees Training and Enterprise Council is taking part in the second round of the Youth Credit pilots. We are being watched more closely than many pilots, because we are the only one to offer a combined education and training option. Launched in April this year, Next Step is available to some 6,600 young people who now have a genuine and extended career choice. This Tec believes in reducing the divide that still exists between the education and training establishments, which is why our initiative is built upon a strong partnership between ourselves, two education authorities, colleges, training providers and employers. Our initiative is not the ideal because we have different funding arrangements for education and training. The proposed education voucher, if linked with the CBI idea of careership, would represent an important step forward in bridging the academic and vocational divide.

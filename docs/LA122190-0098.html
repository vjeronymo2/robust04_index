			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OAK PARK ASKS SANITATION BOARD TO AID CITYHOOD BID;  </P> <P> JORDAN RANCH: THE COMMUNITY TRIES TO SPEED INCORPORATION IN AN EFFORT TO CUT  OFF SIMI VALLEY'S ANNEXATION PLANS.  </P> <P> Community leaders in unincorporated Oak Park, racing Simi Valley for control  over development of Bob Hope's neighboring Jordan Ranch, have taken the unusual  step of asking a sanitation agency to push for incorporation of their community  instead of doing it themselves.  </P> <P> The Triunfo County Sanitation District board Jan. 28 will consider submitting  an application for cityhood to the county Local Agency Formation Commission --  LAFCO -- on behalf of Oak Park, a district official said Thursday.  </P> <P> Approval from the five-member board would set in motion a process that could  take years to complete, but would be faster than if Oak Park leaders tried to  do it themselves, said Ron Stark, a sanitation district director and member of  the Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council.  </P> <P> "We're trying to expedite the time in which our filing will take place," Stark  said.  </P> <P> Stark said Oak Park is seeking a faster path to cityhood to cut off Simi  Valley's plans to annex the entertainer's Jordan Ranch, where a development of  750 residences is planned.  </P> <P> Ordinarily, cityhood supporters must gather signatures from 25% of the  registered voters in the proposed city to place an incorporation measure on a  ballot. If approved, LAFCO would then be obliged to begin the incorporation  process.  </P> <P> But members of the Municipal Advisory Council, an elected body that advises the  Ventura County Board of Supervisors, two weeks ago postponed such a petition  drive in favor of placing the request instead before the Triunfo district  board.  </P> <P> According to county LAFCO guidelines, a sanitation district may also make a  request on behalf of an unincorporated area, District Manager David R. Burkhart  said. He cited a similar situation in Los Angeles County, where the Las  Virgenes Municipal Water District made the request on behalf of the community  of Calabasas.  </P> <P> "They see it as a way to cut through some of that red tape and get to the heart  of the question," Burkhart said.  </P> <P> LAFCO Executive Director Bob Braitman was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> If the sanitation board agrees to submit the application on behalf of Oak Park,  it would heighten competition for Jordan Ranch.  </P> <P> Ever since Simi Valley received approval from LAFCO to submit an application to  change its planning boundaries, Oak Park officials have tried to find a way to  speed their incorporation efforts. They fear that if Simi Valley's annexation  goes through, Oak Park would be left out of any decision to develop Jordan  Ranch.  </P> <P> Residents are concerned about the effect on traffic and schools the Jordan  Ranch development would have on their community of 10,000.  </P></p>

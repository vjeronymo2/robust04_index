			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Tax ruling hits BES investors National Westminster Bank in conjunction with Hambros Bank, and BZW - may have to repay more than Pounds 50m to investors, after the Inland Revenue ruled this week that shares in their loan-backed Business Expansion Scheme companies were not issued in time to beat the deadline announced in the Budget. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said that shares in BES companies had to be issued to shareholders by midnight before the Budget if loans were to be made against them. Non-recourse loans allowed investors to exit from their investments after only six months instead of five years, while retaining full BES tax relief at their top marginal rate. This was intended to be on offer only to those who maintained their investment for five years. BZW has been invited by the Inland Revenue to discuss the matter next Tuesday. NatWest said that if the matter was not resolved, it would go to court to challenge the Inland Revenue ruling. BZW said it would wait until the outcome of its meeting with the Revenue before making the decision on legal action. BZW's Gracechurch companies were launched at the end of February and raised their full subscription of Pounds 25m within a week. NatWest's Homeshare scheme was launched in the first week of March and raised the full subscription of Pounds 25m within two days. Until the Revenue's decision this week it was unclear whether the shares had technically been issued. The Revenue had said earlier that a share was normally regarded as having been issued when the shareholding has been listed in the company's register of members. Both companies face the possibility of having to buy back the shares as well as paying all the associated costs. The schemes initially offered a rate of return equivalent to an annualised return of 30 per cent, which is very difficult to achieve without using tax relief. In its letter to its Homeshare shareholders this week, NatWest said that it was 'examining alternative mechanisms to assist' investors who expected to have access to their capital within six months. It said that 'even if legal action has not been concluded satisfactorily by September 1993, such investors will receive at least an amount equal to their original investment'.</p>

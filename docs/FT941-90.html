			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Shanks &amp; McEwan warning Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management group, revealed the extent of damage incurred by expanding its construction business and warned of Pounds 20m in provisions which will force the group into losses for 1994. The Pounds 15m charge announced yesterday, on top of the Pounds 5m specified at the interim stage, brings total write-offs since June to about Pounds 40m. Some Pounds 28m of this arises from disputed payments in the civil engineering division. Thebalance of the Pounds 40m charges covers rationalisation costs and asset write-downs. Shanks also announced the departure of its auditors, Moores Rowland, who were accountants to the civil engineering division. Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, spent 10 weeks reviewing the business. Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said the review had identified substantial central office overheads that had been carried by operating businesses. These would now be cut. There were also significant asset overvaluations. The review was instigated in January when Shanks made a profits warning - its third in as many years - and announced the departure of Mr Roger Hewitt as chief executive. Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said the latest provisions had wiped the slate clean. 'We have opened every cupboard, looked under the beds, looked for every kind of thing. Having made these provisions, we would sell this house to anybody - it is clean.' This did not mean Shanks was up for sale, but the group might consider taking a strategic partner. 'I have got no objections to joint ventures,' Mr Waddell said, 'but I am not in the business of sacrificing the independence of Shanks &amp; McEwan.' Fourth quarter results would be 'significantly better than the third', Shanks told shareholders, leaving it expecting pre-tax profits excluding exceptionals of Pounds 14m. After exceptionals, analysts expect losses for the year to March 26 to total Pounds 6m against Pounds 10.2m last time. The outlook was clouded by uncertainty over Rechem, the hazardous waste company. The possibility of a government ban on hazardous waste imports could swing a Pounds 9m profit into a loss of more than Pounds 1m, Mr Waddell said. See Lex</p>

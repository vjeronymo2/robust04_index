			<p>BFN     [Text] Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand  National Assembly [TGNA], has said that he is not contradicting  the judiciary in connection with the Democracy Party [DEP]  deputies, but merely following the Constitution. Cindoruk was  replying to questions from reporters at Amsterdam airport, where  he stopped off on his way to The Hague to attend the European  parliamentary speakers conference.    The TGNA speaker pointed out that Turkey has legal ways to  strip people of their parliamentary memberships. If there is a  contradiction, he said, it can be set right through an appeal  and judgment. Cindoruk stressed that the TGNA respects and is  loyal to the Constitution and the law.    Replying to a question on attempts by the deputies who are  abroad to gain the status of exiles, the TGNA speaker said that  Turkish law and justice must be trusted. We want all our  citizens to be in Turkey, he said, and we want these deputies to  come to Turkey to pursue their rights. Cindoruk pointed out  that one cannot sit abroad and demand that an injustice -- if  one exists -- be righted. He said: If they are right, why  should they live abroad with crimes attributed to them?  Cindoruk stressed that Turkey has the mechanisms of parliament  and public opinion to prevent the passage of unjust decisions.    Replying to a question on relations between the DEP and the  PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terror organization, Cindoruk  said that while trying to crush an antidemocratic gang of  bandits, Turkey exercises its sovereign rights within the  framework of democratic rules. He stressed that nobody can  defend a gang that kills innocent people or those who support  that gang.</p>

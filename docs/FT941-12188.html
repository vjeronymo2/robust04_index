			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Public staff face private envy Private-sector workers believe that their counterparts in the public sector are overpaid and under-worked, unpublished polls by the Trades Union Congress show. Private-sector workers think civil servants are 'paper pushers' on an average salary of Pounds 30,000, compared with the reality of closer to Pounds 15,000. The detailed research of attitudes in the private sector, by Opinion Leader Research, found the greatest hostility reserved for local government white-collar workers. Few in the private sector could describe what local government staff do, and average pay for a local authority secretary was put at Pounds 18,000, 30 per cent more than the true figure. There was more sympathy for emergency service workers and nurses and teachers, although the latter are thought to have over-long holidays. Most of those polled could not describe the government's public-sector pay policy and did not know of any TUC campaign against the proposed three-year pay bill freeze. Quite a large proportion did, however, support the idea of a one-day public-sector strike against the policy of pay restraint. That is almost certain to be rejected today at a TUC meeting of public-sector union leaders to discuss the next stage in the campaign against the pay freeze. According to polling details which the TUC did release yesterday, two-thirds of people believe the government's clampdown on public-sector pay will hit the quality of services. Seven out of 10 believe that the effect will be reduced living standards for workers in the public sector. The number employed in the public sector fell by nearly 1.5m over the past decade, according to official figures published yesterday. Partly as a result of privatisation the public-sector share of the total workforce fell from 29 per cent in mid-1983 to less than 22 per cent 10 years later. During the same period the number of people in the private sector rose from 16.6m to 19.2m. The workforce as a whole grew from 23.6m to 24.9m. The Central Statistical Office's analysis of public-sector employment shows that women in the National Health Service and NHS Trusts made up 78 per cent of the public-sector workforce. Of female public-sector employees, nearly half worked part-time, compared with 6 per cent of males.</p>

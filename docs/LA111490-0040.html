			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, PROP. 140 STANDS FOR PROFOUND CHANGE;  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> FRESH, ABLE FACES WILL RATTLE CAGES  </P> <P> Proposition 140 was a powerful demonstration of public frustration with policy  gridlock at the state level. Its arbitrary and simplistic approach to limiting  terms and cutting the Legislature's staff will not automatically improve the  Legislature, but instead will create a revolving door of inexperience. . . .  </P> <P> The impact of Proposition 140 is also personal.  </P> <P> Every Californian must now accept greater individual responsibility for making  the system work. That means getting involved in their schools, cities and  counties and, above all, going to the polls to elect the highest quality public  leaders we can. Legislators won't have the time for on-the-job training -- they  will have to hit the ground running. We can't expect to have a world-class  education system with a second-rate Legislature.  </P></p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Patten overrules parents on opt out Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday overruled a vote by parents against their school becoming grant-maintained by opting out of local education authority control, John Authers writes. He said the local authority involved had published misleading information before the ballot was taken. His action, the first time he had used the power given to him under legislation passed last year, intensified the political row over the government's opting-out policy. Parents at more than 1,000 schools in England and Wales have voted to opt out, under rules introduced in 1988, but the rate of opting out has fallen sharply in the last year. Mr Patten overruled the ballot taken at Christ Church Middle School, Staffordshire because, he said, the school had published information 'claiming, wrongly, that the school would incur a financial deficit if it became grant-maintained'. The ballot must be run again.</p>

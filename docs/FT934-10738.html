			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Andes pipeline plan reaches base camp - David Pilling on a step forward for a 700-mile gas link between Argentina and Chile ARGENTINA has more gas than it knows what to do with. Chile is crying out for cheap, clean fuel. What could be better than building a pipeline between the neighbouring countries? That in a nutshell, is the logic behind a Dollars 1.65bn (Pounds 1.11bn) project to transport natural gas across the Andes through a 700-mile pipeline linking the Neuquen fields in Argentina with industries and homes in Chile's principal cities. For years it has been just talk. But now, given Chile's rapidly growing economy, signs of greater stability in Argentina and a new-found determination to improve bilateral relations, that talk could become reality. A significant step forward was taken last week with the naming of Houston-based Tenneco Gas and British Gas as the technical operators of the transmission and distribution elements respectively. The two companies had beaten off opposition from other multinationals, including Enron, Enserch and Utilicorp of the US, BHP Petroleum of Australia, and Canada's Novacorp International and Transcanada Pipelines. British Gas and Tenneco, which earlier this year formed a strategic alliance for Latin American projects, are prepared to take out a significant equity stake, pending results of a year-long feasibility study. Construction is due to begin in late 1994, with a target completion date of 1997. The pipeline is expected to cost Dollars 600m, and it is estimated that the distribution network, perhaps up to 5,000 miles long, will cost Dollars 450m. A vital piece of the jigsaw still needs to be put in place. This is the construction of three thermo-electric generators, separate but intrinsic to the project. The generators, which would cost a total Dollars 600m and have a combined capacity of 700MW, would consume 45 per cent of the gas. Mr Rudolf Araneda, general manager of Gas de Chile, the project developer, hopes the generators can be built in tandem with the pipeline and distribution network. He believes the foreign companies that showed interest in those project elements may wish to play a role in the construction of generators. Serious obstacles remain. Toughest will be securing financing for a project which, consortium officials say, will involve six years of negative cash flows and a 20-year pay-back period. At least Dollars 700m will have to be invested before a therm of gas is sold. Banks may baulk at sinking money into a long-term project with such obvious political risk. Although Chile won an investment grade rating last year, Argentina has only recently witnessed the return of economic stability. Relations between the countries, although recently much improved, have often been tetchy and a resumption of tension could imperil the smooth supply of gas. Mr Chris Duhon, international vice-president at Tenneco, insists that such eventualities have been thoroughly evaluated. 'We are very comfortable with the political elements,' he says. Mr Araneda says: 'We will be looking for the whole mixture of financing sources - multilateral institutions, export credit agencies, and commercial loans. It is likely to be 40 per cent equity and 60 per cent loans.' The project depends on finding markets, a task to be undertaken by British Gas. In particular it will be necessary to persuade Chilean industry to convert from other types of fuel. Furthermore, plans to extend the network through to 2015 assumes the continued growth of Chile's economy. There is also the question of forming a legal framework for the supply and sale of gas. Chile's regulations were framed in 1931. Given the pace with which much legislation crawls through congress and the potential for political manipulation, agreement on a suitable regulatory framework could be a lengthy process. Executives admit there are many imponderables. However, Mr Richard Souchard, a project development manager at British Gas, says: 'We wouldn't be interested if we didn't think the scheme had a fairly good chance of coming to fruition.' The trump card being played by Gas de Chile is environmental. The consortium claims that converting thousands of industries and up to 600,000 homes to gas will help significantly in cleaning up the air in Santiago, fast becoming Latin America's most polluted city. Mr Araneda admits there are many hurdles to overcome. 'Chile is far away and it is a relatively small economy. But all the macro-economic elements are in place and we have a stability lacking in other potential markets such as Vietnam, India, Brazil and China,' he says. 'Here it is possible to predict steady, long-term growth. That makes this part of the world very interesting.'</p>

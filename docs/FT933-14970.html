			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Regional jostling ties up Yeltsin assembly / A look at new wrangling over a constitution for Russia RUSSIA'S constitutional convention starts a new session today that seems certain to continue and deepen the fissures in the country's power structure over the future form of the state. A new text of the constitution has been produced in the last few days by the convention's working group, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times. Like its predecessors, it is replete with rights and freedoms for the citizens of Russia, and is careful in many instances to emphasise the break between the formal documents of the Soviet era and the present-day intention to underpin the rights of a free people within a democracy. However, the contentious parts of the draft constitution are not, for most people - except the die-hard communists who have their own document proposing a return to the dictatorship of the proletariat - the promulgation of human and civil rights. Instead, they lie in the competing powers and responsibilities of the federal centres and the regions and republics within the Russian federation. It is the republican and regional leadership that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, relied on when he bypassed parliament to bring together the convention - largely made up of regional representatives. However, though this has, for the moment, shifted the struggle from a forum in which he could not hope to gain assent to one better disposed towards him, he now runs up against the jealousies and fears of leaders who are trying to safeguard their own and their peoples' interests at a time when the centre seems to bring only inflation and taxes. The response of the republics and regions has been to demand more and more autonomy. And, because earlier drafts favoured the republics over the regions (the republics marked ethnic territorial units reflecting the imperial nature of Russia's expansion in the 19th century), the latter are now declaring themselves republics in order to claim extra rights. In the latest draft there has been a conscious effort to equalise the treatment of the 'subjects of the federation'. For example, a small insertion in one clause gives the regions and the republics the right to make 'laws', the scope of which is not defined, while another allows the possibility of accession to the federation by means of a separate treaty - thus opening the possibility of bringing in Tatarstan, the powerful republic which has always demanded special treatment. At the same time, the drafters believe, anomalies have been ironed out of the relationship between the president and the parliament - with the president in the superior position but with parliament having greater power than previously envisaged in initiating legislation and in deciding on the composition of the government. An earlier clause which appeared to suggest that the president was the highest court in the land has been clarified to read that he will seek to arbitrate in disputes between the centre and the regions, or between the regions themselves - but if he fails, the case will revert to the courts. However, the differences among the regions and republics appear to be too great to enable agreement today, or in the near future. The republics resent being reduced to the level of the regions: the regions will tolerate nothing less: all resent the special status of Tatarstan. Mr Sergei Shakharai, the deputy premier who has been the driving force behind the Convention on Mr Yeltsin's side, said at the weekend that 'we should adopt an interim constitutional agreement instead' - a view shared by Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff. The most likely timetable now appears to be that a two to three week period will elapse in which the regions and republics consider the draft and make their views felt; in the likelihood that no compromise will be possible among them, there should be an attempt to adopt an interim constitutional agreement and an election law, allowing elections to a new parliament which  -unlike the old Soviet era assembly - would have the credibility and the mandate to agree the legal basis of the state. Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the influential mayor of St Petersburg and himself a lawyer, said in an interview with the Interfax agency that elections should be held at every level so that the system can renew itself as far as possible and so that the legislative assemblies across the Russian land mass 'reflect the true balance of forces in the country'. With these forces still gathering and feeling their strength, unsure of their own and others' limits, and inexperienced in the interplay of democratic struggle - the constitutional process in Russia could be prolonged, perhaps dangerously so.

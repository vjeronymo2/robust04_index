The  same Afghanistan produced an ugly image in the international  opinion after the culmination of their struggle in 1991 when the  Soviet Union-installed government ceased to exist.    The Mojahedin, who had been ready to sacrifice all they had  in the way of the armed struggle against the Communist  occupiers, turned their guns against each other. So far more  civilians and military personnel have become victims of their  revenge than all the casualties recorded during the 15 years of  Soviet occupation.    Western countries led by the United States ran away from  Afghanistan as after the conclusion of the Cold War and the  disintegration of the Soviet Union their interest in the  land-locked country ended.    But regional countries, particularly Iran and Pakistan, have  done their best to solve the internal fight, and have met with  no success.    Former Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif took all the  warring parties to Islam's holiest place, in Mecca, where the  Mojahedin vowed not to fight with each other and work for the  reconstruction of their almost destroyed country during 15 years  of war with the Reds.    Their pledge before the Almighty in Whose name they fought  the Communists had no meaning and several times they have shed  the blood of their own brothers.    The last was on Saturday when hundreds of rockets slammed  into Kabul, the worst onslaught on the shattered capital in  months.    The forces of President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime  Minister Hekmatyar battled in other parts of the country also.    It looks like the Mojahedin signed a peace agreement for  nothing but to break the citizens and bring them more hardship.  So far, whatever the neighboring countries have done to bring  peace to Afghanistan is not enough and a concrete step should be  taken.    An immediate summit meeting of regional countries including  Iran, Pakistan and some others with influence in Afghanistan,  could be held to chalk out a plan for free and fair elections  which is a must and that many believe can silence the guns.</p>

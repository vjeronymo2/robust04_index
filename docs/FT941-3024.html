			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Pay protests sweep France Demonstrators and police clashed in Paris yesterday after French trade unions and student groups joined forces to protest against a law which they claim undermines the minimum wage but which the government sees as vital to reduce youth unemployment. More than 30,000 demonstrators took part in the protests in Paris, which were the first to bring concerted action by the largest union groups and student organisations. Clashes erupted on the fringes of the march, with some demonstrators throwing stones and bottles at riot police. About 200 demonstrators were arrested. Tens of thousands of demonstrators also joined protest marches in provincial cities including Bordeaux, Lille and Lyons. The protestors say the law, which allows apprentices between 16 and 25 to be paid less than the minimum wage of FFr5,866 (Pounds 671) per month, undermines workers' rights and forces the young to pay for their training. Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, sought to ease concerns in an open letter published in the daily Liberation. 'Do you really think that the government would deliberately seek to harm the young?,' he asked. 'Our only motive is to end the situation where 750,000 youth are deprived of a job. . . I refuse to allow one in four young people to remain on the wayside.' He stressed he had already made concessions, exempting young people with university or technical diplomas from the lower wage, which will apply to unqualified young job-seekers. He offered further talks on improvements to the system and promised to review it after a year. Mr Balladur's letter reflects the government's concern about the level of opposition to the law. Yesterday's protests were the fourth significant demonstration against the measures, and were called despite government concessions. France has the highest unemployment rate among Group of Seven industrial powers with 12.2 per cent out of work and one young person in four under 25 is without a job.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Unemployment shows sharp rise: Accumulation of poor economic figures increases pressure for interest rate cut A SHARP rise in un-employment last month delivered a blow yesterday to Conservative confidence about the economy. The seasonally adjusted jobless total rose to 2.6m, the highest for four years. Together with news of record house repossessions and a big fall in manufacturing investment last year, the unemployment figures increased the pressure on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to respond to the severity of the 18-month recession with an early cut in interest rates and action to help the economy in next month's Budget. Seasonally adjusted unemployment rose in January by 53,000, nearly twice the figure expected in the City and the biggest monthly increase since August. The increase brought to just over 1m the headline count of job losses since unemployment started rising in March 1990. Repossession of homes by mortgage lenders reached more than 75,000 in 1991, while factories cut their capital spending by 15 per cent compared with the previous 12 months. There were angry exchanges in the Commons, where Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, said the unemployment figures were 'devastating' and accused the government of having caused the recession. He made clear that Labour would keep the government's economic record at the heart of the general election campaign. While Mr John Major, the prime minister, acknowledged that the unemployment figures were 'disappointing', other government ministers hinted that the March 10 Budget, as well as cutting income tax, would include measures to help the unemployed. The 22nd consecutive monthly rise in unemployment means that 9.2 per cent of the workforce were without jobs last month, up from 9 per cent in December, and marks an apparent quickening in the pace of unemployment. The figures follow announcements of big job losses across industry, and indications of a decline in business confidence - which some believe may put back an upturn until well into this year. Mr Peter Spencer, UK economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers, a US securities house, said: 'A lot of companies are giving up the ghost on any early recovery, and are moving to cut costs by shedding labour.' One piece of good news for Mr Lamont was that the index of underlying earnings across the economy rose in the 12 months to December by 7 1/4 per cent, compared with the November figure of 7 1/2 per cent. The rise, the smallest since the late 1960s, underlines the decline in inflationary pressures, which the government believes will lead on to a sustained recovery. Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said he had 'no doubt at all' that the Budget measures would help boost employment. Mr John Maples, a Treasury minister, said the tax burden would continue to fall 'this year and next', as it had done since 1981. But the prime minister faced strong attacks from both Mr Kinnock and Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, over his refusal to introduce an emergency package of measures to stimulate the economy. As Mr Major insisted that the government's strategy had laid the foundations for sustained economic recovery, some ministers joined a growing chorus of calls from backbench Conservative MPs for an immediate cut in interest rates. Senior ministers said that the cabinet was determined to 'keep its nerve', predicting that the Conservatives would return to the campaign offensive with an attack next week on Labour's plans to overturn its trade union reforms.

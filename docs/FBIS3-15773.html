The first round of talks is  expected to be held in Moscow some time after March 16 with  Russian mediation under the aegis of the UN.    A senior Russian diplomat, who had accompanied Adamishin,  said that Moscow appreciated "the positive mood" of the Tajik  opposition. "The venue of the talks proved to be the sole  problem; We proposed Moscow. Tajik opposition agreed to hold  only the first round of talks here which was to be followed by  meetings in Tehran, Iran or Islamabad, Pakistan. We did not  object because we thought that the most important thing was to  have the negotiation process started," the diplomat said.    He added that the Tajik opposition leaders had emphasized  the  special role played by Russia, notably as the guarantor of  Tajikistan's independence.    According to the diplomat, Russia will do its best for the  success of the talks while not being a party to them.    Adamishin met with a Tajik opposition delegation headed by  Khoji Akbar Turajonzoda who acted on behalf of Abdullah Nuri,  leader of the Islamic Revival Movement. Other delegation  members were Mukhammad Sharif Khimmadzoda, a leader of the  Islamic Revival Party; Atakhon Latifi, a leader of the  Democratic Party; Abdu Nabi Sattorov, a member of the Democratic  Force Movement ruling body; Sabib Sangipov, chairman of the Fund  of Aid to Tajik Refugees and Displaced Persons in CIS Member  Nations, Bozorali Safarov, former Tajik transport minister and  Khudoberdy Kholiknazarov, former foreign minister.</p>

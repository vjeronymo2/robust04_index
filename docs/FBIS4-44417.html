Bilateral economic and technological cooperation situation </H5>   1) Chinese joint venture enterprises in Indonesia.    Some 84 Sino-Indonesian joint ventures have been set up in  Indonesia since reestablishment of relations which have the  approval of Indonesia's Investment Committee or of China's  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade  [MOFERT--organization name as published], of which, 23 have been  approved by the latter organization and officially have informed  our office; seven have been approved by the former organization  and officially have informed our office. Chinese investment  agreements approved by MOFERT amount to $11.0025 million. The  primary means of Chinese investment is by introducing equipment,  manufacturing technology, set up and debugging, and conducting  training, which account for approximately 90 percent of all  Chinese investment agreements. Major projects include textiles,  glass, watches, electricity, chemical industry machinery,  universal machinery manufacture, activated charcoal, printing  ink, pharmaceuticals, fishing, and technical consulting.    2) Engineering contracts, and technology and labor export  cooperation.    Between January and June 1993 China signed Indonesian  engineering contracts and labor cooperation contracts at $41.52  million, up 640 percent over the same period in 1992, of which,  the former accounted for $29.89 million, up 1014 percent over  the same period in 1992, and the latter for $1.63 million, up 20  percent over the same period in 1992. Completed projects and  projects being completed include: a 35,000-ton grade oceanic  tanker and a 5 x 35,000 kilowatt thermal power plant unit. Work  continues on complete alkalization equipment, cooperative  gulch-gold mining, coal mine exploration and design, hot sheet  steel plant construction and electrical transmission projects.  In 1993 two contracts were signed for complete power generation  equipment alone. One is a 2 x 25,000 kilowatt t hermal power  plant unit. The other is China's largest thermal power plant  unit, a 2 x 200,000 kilowatt project. The latter project alone  is worth nearly $300 million, including plant selection and  design, construction, equipment supply, unit set up , debugging  and operation training. Only such a unified group of economic  and technological cooperation projects with elect  rico-mechanical equipment exports can better motivate and  promote swifter developments in Sino-Indonesian bilateral  economic cooperation to improve and spur on political and  diplomatic relationships between the two countries.  <H5>  3. Future outlook and growth </H5>   According to the ranking of countries in China's import and  export trade totals, Indonesia at present is in 14th place. In  the three years since reestablishment of relations, it is also  the country with the largest import expor t trade deficit with  China. However, because the strong mutual dependence between the  import and export commodities of both countries, we could say  that Indonesia will be a large potential market for China's  product exports, especially electrico-mechanical products and  complete equipment exports. It should be a key point in our  strategy to promote market diversification . Towards this end I  recommend using China's strength in producing  electric-mechanical products and complete sets of equipment  combined with China's contract engineering in Indonesia to  promote future growth in Sino-Indonesian economic and trade  relations. It is important that the following work be done well:    1. Stress developing China's strengths in the  industries of electric-mechanical products and complete sets of  equipment, and participate in the transformation of Indonesia's  production enterprises.    At present Indonesia's major economic and trade partners are  Japan, the United States, the EC, the ROK, Taiwan and Singapore  and other ASEAN countries (regions). To develop its economic  might swiftly, while actively developing its import and export  trade, Indonesia tends towards more preferential conditions to  attract overseas clients and foreign funds to open domestic  joint ventures and thereby accelerate expansion and strenthening  of economic and technological cooperation with various countries  and regions of the world. According to statistics from the  Indonesian Investment Coordination Council, as of the 31 August  1993, the accumulated global investment in Indonesia was $69.66  billion. The major investment industries are the chemical (19.6  percent), tourism (10.7 percent) and mining (9.3 percent) along  with machinery manufacturing, papermaking and textiles. The  aforementioned countries have been in the Indonesian market a  relatively long time and their actual strength is far greater  than China's. Regarding high class consumer goods in the  Indones ian consumer market, their products are high grade, good  quality, strongly functional, high priced and delivered on time.  The Indonesian light and textile industries have grown to a  certain international level with their own characteristics.  However, its electro-mechanical industry is still in the infant  stage; the country's largest machinery manufacturing plant only  corresponds to a medium-sized Chinese one. The majority mainly  do repairs. A few factories can produce some parts and small  volumes of small and medium-sized mechanical equipment. The  country has no complete electro-mechanical production system.  There still is no production of power plant equipment. Thus we  should stress importing complete medium and small capacity  thermal and hydropower generators, electric transformer  equipment, metallurgy equipment, mining equipment, a variety of  construction machinery, petrochemical and chemical industry  equipment, agricultural machinery, complete cement production  equipment, plus technology for computer-controlled system  software. China's greatest strength in opening and developing  Indonesia's markets is in equipment and technology to satisfy  the needs of Indonesia's production enterprises and extended  reproduction therein.    2. The effective way to develop Indonesia's industrial  product market should be active encouragement an d organization  of projects uniting economic and technological cooperation to  import and export trade.    Catering to the needs of the Indonesian Government, support  Chinese enterprises under contract work in Indonesia through  Indonesian economic cooperative projects to spur on exports of  Chinese electro-mechanical products and complete sets of  equipment or use the sup eriority of both exports to promote  bilateral economic and technological cooperation. This would  both improve the economic results of China's export enterprises  and earn us a lot of foreign exchange. Such forms of mutual  bi-directional investment cooperation also will improve friendly  relations with both countries. Given the shortage of Indonesian  funds, China should appropriately assemble some limited fiscal  power suited to Indonesia's peculiar situation and provide  necessary export loans to expand exports of complete sets of  electro-mechanical products.    3. To open the Indonesian market we must take note of  the form of China's model projects in Indonesia.    China severed relations with Indonesia for 23 years for  various reasons, making present Indonesia still harbor  misgivings regarding China. For example, Indonesia granted birth  certificates to people from 45 countries and regions, excluding  China. Although Indonesia's industrial and commercial world  understands China, not all understand China's complete  electro-mechanical equipment. Likewise they have many  misgivings, thus it is extremely important that we set up  several successful large-scale complete "model" projects in  Indonesia. Provided we all give priority to this matter at home  and abroad, it will have results very quickly. Recently we  coordinated with t hose at home and abroad to bring closer  bilateral relations through construction of an irrigation  project in Indonesia, promoting future bilateral cooperation in  broader areas.    4. Squarely face China's export product problems.    The old issue of the quality of China's export products,  which is difficult to resolve, is the fundamental issue for  entering the Indonesian market. The competitiveness of  electro-mechanical product quality lies in their superior  performance, ease of operation and work safety. At least we must  ensure that China's products are about the same as those of the  advanced countries of Europe and the United States. Second is  establishing product sales networks and after-sale service  networks, including parts and components and repair networks.  Finally, we must ensure that China's export products to  Indonesia do not compete for sales at rolled back and lower  prices. This would both confuse opening up the Indonesian market  and shatter the development base for enterprises to be  independent. Therefore, domestically, we must enhance the  restraint and control mechanisms over export products through  the chambers of commerce of various industries. At the same  time, mesh with the coordinated management of overseas  economic commerical attaches, and really consolidate and further  develop the Indonesian markets already opened.    5. Establish a project contract model suited to  Indonesia.    This contract model mainly incl udes the following:    1) Foreign contract projects themselves are a complex system  of projects. This is the same in every country. Basically they  involve two major processes: the process from bidding,  negotiations, study, economic and technolgical feasibility draft  approval to signing a contract; and the process from project  technical design, site selection and design approval,  construction, equipment manufacture, check and acceptance,  transport, assembly, debugging to going into commercial  operation.    2) Indonesian contract projects must correctly squarely face  special human relations and the phenomenon that "money opens  doors" which determine relations between Indonesian proprietors  and Chinese enterprises. We must firmly uphold the cooperative  division of labor principle that proprietors are responsible for  anything related to Indonesian work and conditions outside of  construction while anything related to China's relevant domestic  procedures and work is the responsibility of the Chinese  contractor.    3) Indonesian contract projects must firmly uphold the  overall responsibility of the Chinese side. We must divide labor  with Indonesia. The Chinese side should undertake responsibility  for technical guidance on projects in Indonesia. This is because  Indonesia still is now an economically undeveloped large country  with many people and rather high unemployment. We only arrived  at this rather appropriate solution after 1992 when the  Indonesian Government built a five unit 35,000 kilowatt  coal-burning electrical power plant project which caused a  "labor wave."    China and Indonesia have a close geographical location.  Economic and trade dependence is strong. In the more than three  years since relations were re-established on the basis of  voluntary equality and mutual benefit, the developing bilateral  economic and trade cooperative relationship fully accords with  the desires and basic interests of the people of both countries.  Looking to the future full of confidence, we should work harder  and strive to make greater developments in Sino-Indonesian trade  and economic and technological cooperation in 1994.</p>

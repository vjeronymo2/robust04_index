			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLORADO STATE KEEPS NORTHRIDGE IN CHECK  </P> <P> The margin of loss was nearly identical, but the difference between Cal State  Northridge's first and second Division I games was like night and day.  </P> <P> This time, the Matadors' running game was slowed and the experience of guards  Lynn Tryon and Mark Meredith led Colorado State past Northridge, 104-79, before  6,472 Saturday night at Moby Arena.  </P> <P> Tryon scored a career-high 30 points, including four three-pointers, and  Meredith had 22 points, also making four three-point baskets.  </P> <P> Although it was the most points scored by Colorado State since the 1971-72  season, the pace wasn't nearly fast enough for Northridge's taste and nowhere  near the frenzy of its 113-89 loss to Colorado a night earlier.  </P> <P> "They got back well on defense and filled the passing lanes," Northridge Coach  Pete Cassidy said. "We're not going to be able to run every game. Against a  Boyd Grant-coached team, he's not going to let us run. You gotta be able to  operate out of the halfcourt. You can't live on the break alone."  </P> <P> David Keeter (four of six) was the only Northridge player able to get off more  than one three-point basket as the Matadors were limited to 25 attempts,  compared to 44 in their Division I debut.  </P> <P> Keeter led the Matadors with 15 points.  </P></p>

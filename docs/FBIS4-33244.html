			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 2 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Today in El  Salvador, Juan Aristides Taveras, foreign relations secretary of  state, said his country has never violated the UN and OAS  embargo on Haiti. At a news conference, Taveras added that his  country knows Haiti "is not guilty of its poverty," but the  Dominican Republic "has lent Haiti a hand" in only those areas  permitted under the terms imposed by the international community.    Taveras emphasized the UN as well as the OAS are aware of  the  fact that the Dominican Republic "has never violated the  embargo." He added, however, "they continue to hold a grudge  against us, which is unfair."    Fernando Infante, Dominican ambassador to El Salvador,  pointed out that his country disagrees with the embargo against  Haiti because we "know it will fail to resolve Haiti's problems,  but, as a UN member, the Dominican Republic has to obey and  respect the UN decision." Infante stressed that his country  opposes "any type of invasion" in Haiti, because invasions "have  never proven beneficial anywhere."    According to reports coming from Santo Domingo, Joaquin  Balaguer's administration changed its mind from failing to  comply with the UN and OAS embargo to accepting a tight embargo  against Hait, an embargo that includes even foodstuffs and  medicine.    Foreign Secretary Taveras, who came to El Salvador to attend  Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol's inauguration on 1  June, said the international community has never recognized the  efforts his country made to help Haiti before the embargo went  into effect.    The official noted: "My country's government, in order to  overcome this grudge against us, went to the extreme of asking  the UN to send in advisers, supervisors, and technical experts  who, in plainclothes, will help us ensure the embargo is not  violated. Our Armed Forces are the ones who are currently  supervising this task."</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Tudjman confident ahead of Croat polls RIDING high on the first Croat military victory over the Serbs in a disputed enclave, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia is poised to tighten his lock on power in tomorrow's district elections. Clashes between Serb and Croat forces in Krajina, the self-styled Serb state, yesterday appeared to ease after an upsurge of violence on Thursday. Mr Tudjman and his Croatian Democratic Union look set to reap the rewards of the 14-day offensive when some 3m voters cast ballots for the upper house of the Croatian parliament. The Croat push across UN lines into the Serbian enclave helped Mr Tudjman to silence any criticism from the opposition that he has been soft on Serb rebels who in 1991 proclaimed their own state within Croatia. It also served to jeopardise the year-long UN peace plan which ended the eight-month Serbo-Croat war that killed some 20,000 people. The upper house has only limited power to override the house of representatives. Meanwhile in the Adriatic, western warships policing a trade embargo on Yugoslavia - now comprising Serbia and Montenegro - yesterday intercepted a Croatian vessel which said it was loaded with explosives. A UN arms embargo, imposed nearly two years ago on the former Yugoslavia - including Croatia - has been widely violated.</p>

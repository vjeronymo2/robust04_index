			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Money troubles Could it be that, having called the recovery wrongly so often, the government is going to miss it when it finally appears? An 0.8 per cent monthly increase in M0 a year ago really could have seen the chancellor offering champagne all round. Yet this is more than just a blip. M0 has been rising at a seasonally-adjusted annualised rate of 7.7 per cent over the past three months. Together with more buoyant retail sales and rising inland telephone calls, that points to a slow revival in activity. The trouble is that it is all a matter of degree. Rising unemployment and falling house prices are still cause for concern. And even those inclined to put an optimistic spin on the money supply still see no reason to alter their expectation that recovery will stay anaemic well into next year. Which is why stronger money supply growth has its worrying side as well. If this pace of growth continues into next year, M0 will breach its target range of 0 to 4 per cent annual growth. The authorities could then be forced to consider tightening policy before recovery was properly under way. That would be awkward indeed, but it is the natural consequence of sticking to a target first set while Britain was still in the ERM. The price pressures from devaluation may still be modest, but they mean achieving the government's forecast growth of 1 per cent next year would strain M0 to its permitted limit. The target looks a little tight outside the system, but changing it would further damage the government's credibility.</p>

The  February poll, conducted by Dimarso on behalf of DE MORGEN,  reveals that the Walloon Socialists only represent 30.1 percent  of the French-speaking electorate, representing a 6-percent drop  since December.    In Flanders, the VLD's [Flemish Liberals and Democrats]  progress seems to have come to a standstill. Party leader  Verhofstadt and his supporters lost 1.5 percent (down to 28.5  percent), and are now at their lowest level since July 1993.  Dimarso's monthly poll was conducted between 7 and 16 February  among 1,000 Flemish, 1,000 Walloons, and 400 people from  Brussels. There was a "no response" from 18 percent of those  questioned.    In Flanders, the majority parties are not benefiting from  the  VLD's downturn. The CVP [Christian People's Party] remains  practically at the same level (21.8 percent), while the SP  [Flemish Socialist Party] has dropped from 18.3 to 17.6 percent.  Even the Volksunie [People's Union] has fallen from 6.6 to 6.3  percent, despite the strong European list it disclosed in  February.    The winners are Agalev [Live Differently] (up 0.7 percent to  11.3 percent), the Vlaams Blok [Flemish Bloc] (from 9.7 percent  to 11.5 percent), and Rossem (from 2 to 2.4 percent).  <H5>  Walloon Region </H5>   In the Walloon region, the PSC [Social Christian Party] is  the biggest winner. Deprez' party registered a 1.5 percent  increase to 20.1 percent; the PRL [Liberal Reformation Party]  climbed slightly to 23 percent (up 0.7 percent); and the Ecolo  [Ecologists] jumped to 16.3 percent (up 0.9 percent). The  category "others," which in addition to the FDF [French-Speaking  Front] and some minor leftwing parties includes ultraright-wing  parties, lost some ground (from 11.2 to 10.5 percent).</p>

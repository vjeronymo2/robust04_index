			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / A divided Fiji faces further division: Nikki Tait finds uncertainty surrounding the islands' general election today The parish hall on the outskirts of Suva, Fiji's capital, is spartan and airless. Undeterred, hundreds of Fijians are packing into the final rally held by the prime minister, Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka, before the general election today. Kava-drinking is under way, leading to a ceremonial welcome, speeches and prayers. Outside, matters are less harmonious. The Indian taxi drivers are getting fretful, and a local scrap is brewing. 'These Fijians sit on my car,' complains one, shaking a fist. 'I chase them away, but they keep coming back.' Trivial though the incident seems, it is a reminder of the racial tensions that lurk behind Fiji's sandy beaches and graceful palms. These were acute enough to cost Fiji its democratic system altogether in 1987, when it became the first South Pacific country to have a military coup. Even now, with the electoral process partly restored, there is little certainty about where the week-long polling by the country's 330,000 voters will lead. A repeat of 1987 is not deemed likely, but other than that no one is sure. As one lawyer in Suva puts it: 'There'll probably be a government in 10 days' time, but who'll be running it: who knows?' The 1987 coup was triggered by fears that the economically dominant Indian community was securing political advantage as well. Col Rabuka walked into the parliament building with a group of soldiers and ousted what was viewed as an Indian-dominated coalition government. After four uneasy months of negotiations, he followed up with a second power grab, revoking the country's 1970 constitution. The international community's fears of an Idi Amin-style regime with persecution and expulsion of Indians, were not realised. Many Indians did leave Fiji, so that they now constitute only 45 per cent of the islands' 760,000 population. Seven years ago more than half the population was Indian. However, Col Rabuka quickly deregulated much of the economy, giving it an export-oriented emphasis. The manufacturing sector expanded significantly, thanks partly to the introduction of tax-free factory zones and the ability to export garments, duty free, to Australia and New Zealand. Tourists, scared off by the military action, returned. In 1992, Fiji held national elections - albeit under a 1990 constitution that guarantees indigenous Fijians a majority of the 70-seat parliament. Col Rabuka's SVT party picked up 30 of a possible 37 seats. Through a coalition with the General Voters' party, which holds the five general (non-Fijian, non-Indian) seats, it was able to govern. The tables turned on Col Rabuka last November. Seven of his SVT MPs refused to pass the 1994 budget, causing him to call an election. On the surface, the dissidents' concerns centred on government overspending, including almost FDollars 10m (Pounds 4.6m) by the army last year. But few observers think that was the only issue. There had been allegations of government mismanagement in other areas by Col Rabuka's critics, ranging from nepotism and unfulfilled promises, to a messy scandal - involving a local businessman, Tony Stephens - in which the prime minister was implicated. The upshot of the dissidents' action was the formation of a new party called the Fijian Association. This SVT rival is headed by Mr Josevata Kamikamica, a former finance minister and a challenger for the prime minister's job after the 1992 election. On paper, the manifestos of the Fijian Association and the SVT differ little. But the respected, Australian-educated Mr Kamikamica has talked of bringing Indian MPs into the cabinet, and his softer style contrasts sharply with Col Rabuka's. For the first time, the indigenous Fijian community - including its powerful chiefs - is seriously split. The Indian vote, by contrast, has been divided for some time. In 1992, 13 of the community's 27 seats went to Mahendra Chaudry's Fiji Labour party, and 14 to the National Federation party led by Jai Ram Reddy, a lawyer. Both parties recognise the two overriding concerns of the Indian community: to make some progress on overhauling the racially biased constitution and to resolve the issue of the thousands of 30-year farming leases, which begin to expire in 1996. Most of these are held by Fiji-Indian sugar cane growers, on Fijian-owned land. All that can be said with certainty is that the political instability helps no one. The country is operating without an approved budget for the current year, and investment, especially re-investment by the Indian community, is at a low ebb. Anything which threatens the tourism business - Fiji's largest foreign exchange earner, generating almost FDollars 330m in 1992 - is also unwelcome.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD-NEIGHBOR POLICY OR JUST PLAIN MADNESS?  </P> <P> The invasion fails any number of practical and psychiatric tests. It is both  potty and inefficient.  </P> <P> America, bizarrely, still fails to understand the nature of democracy. It is  not some imported ideology to be imposed on a country. It must (see  Czechoslovakia, see Hungary, see -- in time -- Romania) "spring" from within.  It must, in the end, be what the people of Panama want and will themselves  defend. It cannot be dumped on a country overnight by the U.S. Army. That will  prove, over coming months, the bitterest legacy for President (Guillermo)  Endara and Vice President Guillermo Ford. If they wanted -- down the long,  grimy, historical road of Panamanian oscillations -- finally to provide their  country with clean, free government, they arrive carrying a poisoned chalice  hung on a Marine bayonet.  </P></p>

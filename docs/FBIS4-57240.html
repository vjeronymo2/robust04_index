			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] There was movement today in high-ranking positions  of the federal government. Approximately 45 minutes ago, I  received the following bulletin from the Presidency:    Today, the president of the republic appointed Humberto  Benitez Trevino as attorney general of the republic, replacing  Diego Valades Rios, who was appointed Supreme Court justice.  This appointment will be submitted to the Senate for approval.  Benitez Trevino served as attorney general of the Federal  District until today.    The president of the republic designated Ricardo Canavati  Tafich as deputy secretary of urban development and  infrastructure, replacing Architect Jorge Lepe Garcia, who was  designated deputy secretary of housing and real estate of  Secretariat of Social Development. Lepe Garcia will in turn  replace Alfredo Phillips Olmedo, who was nominated by the  president to preside over the General Assembly of the Institute  of the National Housing Fund for Workers, Infonavit. This is  the end of the bulletin.    Following these changes, it is still not known who will be  the attorney general of the Federal District.</p>

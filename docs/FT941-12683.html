			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Poor auction result lowers prices of long-dated gilts UK government bonds fell almost one point at the long end yesterday in the wake of Wednesday's poorly-received Pounds 2.75bn auction. There were also reports that some marketmakers still had quite a lot of the new stock on their books. There were some concerns in the market that the forthcoming tax increases would lead to a temporary rise in inflation though analysts believed that the underlying rate would stay within the government's 4 per cent ceiling. The long gilt future on Liffe traded at 118 7/32 in the late afternoon, down  27/32 on the day and off an intraday high of 119 9/32 . Some dealers said that the market was likely to recover once the overhang from the auction had disappeared. German government bond futures fell back below par in moderate trading as the market awaited the publication of the M3 data for December early next week. The bund future on Liffe fell from an intraday high of 100.31 to 99.94 in the late afternoon, down 0.44 point from Wednesday's close. Cash bonds were also lower, with the benchmark 6.0 per cent 10-year bund dropping to 101.60 from 101.89 late on Wednesday. French government bonds eased after the Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 6.20 per cent at its securities repurchase tender yesterday. A small decline in call money earlier in the weak had raised some dealers's hopes of a modest cut. The Bank's targets for average annual M3 growth, of around 5 per cent over about four years, were in line with expectations and failed to stimulate the bond market. Analysts said the market was in a defensive mood in the wake of this week's issue of FFr22bn worth of state-guaranteed debt. In addition, next week's OAT auction was expected to raise a similar amount. There were also signs that international investors were seeking to switch out of French government bonds into the D-Mark bloc. The notional 10-year bond future on the Matif traded at 130.20 in the late afternoon, down 0.22 point on the day. Italian government bonds tumbled in the afternoon on a combination of profit-taking and growing uncertainty ahead of the forthcoming general election. Dealers noted that an opinion poll published yesterday suggested that voter support had shifted away from the left towards the right-wing and centre parties. The March future on Liffe fell from the day's high of 11.72 to trade around 118.12 in the late afternoon, down 0.44 point on the day. Japanese government bond and futures prices rose in Tokyo trading as their recent weakness encouraged some bargain-hunting. The March futures rose as high as 114.31 before closing at 114.25, up 0.65 on the day. In London, the future rose as high as 114.53. However, Mr David Knee at Daiwa Europe noted that political and economic uncertainty still hung over the market. Investors generally remained cautious ahead of any announcement on the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993. In addition, it was still unclear if there would be an agreement on political reform, leaving a snap general election as a real possibility. News of steady growth in factory orders failed to rattle the US Treasury bond market yesterday, as traders held their positions ahead of today's estimate of fourth-quarter gross domestic product. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 5/16 higher at 99 13/16 , with the yield receding to 6.252 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note edged 1/16 forward to 99 25/32, top yield 4.099 per cent. In early trading, prices showed little movement, despite the Commerce Department's announcement of a solid 2.2 per cent increase in December factory orders of durable goods. Reaction was also muted to news of a big drop in weekly claims for unemployment benefit, which was attributed to the recent snap of cold weather. With the market sitting tight, the long end of the maturity range was able to post moderate gains in light afternoon activity. Interest in today's GDP estimate stemmed less from concern about the rate of growth in the final quarter than from eagerness to establish a gauge of the economy's current pace. Analysts expect an estimate exceeding 5 per cent to trigger a sell-off.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / BT junior managers offered the chance to work from home MANAGERS and professional staff at BT will have the right to apply to work from home for the first time after the telecommunications company signed a framework agreement with the Society of Telecom Executives. Up to 8,000 junior managers and white collar workers are potentially eligible under the new scheme, although BT said the eventual number who choose to work from home is not expected to be more than 1,000 by the end of next year. In the first instance it expects several hundred to take advantage of the agreement. The STE represents 30,000 junior and middle managers and professional staff. Mr Peter Archer, BT's director of employee relations, said: 'Teleworking (working from home using modern telecommunication systems, computers and modems) is an area which has been of growing interest to us for some time. While not all jobs are suitable for teleworking, we have reached a framework agreement with the STE which will apply to those people who want to work from home.' In the UK, more than 500,000 people are thought to telework full-time, with a further 1.5m part-time. Some analysts estimate that, by the year 2010, at least 20 per cent of non-manual workers in the UK will be working from home, or near it. BT managers responsible for supervising employees on a 'day-to-day' basis will not be eligible for the scheme. However, about 8,000 of the STE's membership not involved in managing employees will be allowed to apply to work from home. The agreement ensures that those who do so will be eligible for additional home expenditure and will have no change in their pay, annual leave or pensions. Teleworking contracts will be renewed every year. Mr Simon Petch, STE general secretary, said: 'People who want to work from home for various reasons, such as those who do not like working in offices, and the disabled, will have the chance to work from home for the first time. It is amazing how much work you can get done.' BT recently unveiled a pilot scheme allowing some directory inquiries operators to work from home in Inverness, Scotland. This was designed as a year-long experiment intended to demonstrate to other businesses the potential of teleworking.</p>

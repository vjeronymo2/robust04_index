			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ONIONS, IF NOT TOBACCO, CAN RELIEVE PAIN OF BEE STINGS  </P> <P> Question: At our family reunion last week my little niece was stung by a yellow  jacket. My dad said his father always swore by tobacco juice, but no one at the  gathering was chewing tobacco. Someone tried soaking a cigarette and squeezing  the juice on the sting, but that didn't work.  </P> <P> Isn't there some other home remedy that would work to take away the pain of a  sting?  </P> <P> Answer: In our part of the country tobacco juice is an old home remedy for bee  stings too, but we've never seen any scientific data to show if this works.  </P> <P> But one of our readers came up with a home remedy for stings that really took  our breath away. He credits his German neighbor lady with suggesting that a cut  onion be applied to the sting for at least 10 minutes.  </P> <P> When we checked with the world-renowned onion researcher, Dr. Eric Block of the  State University of New York at Albany, he confirmed that a fresh-cut onion may  minimize the pain. Onions contain an ingredient that can break down the  chemicals responsible for inflammation and discomfort.  </P> <P> Q: I will be attending my 25th class reunion next month and I am feeling  embarrassed about my weight. I weigh 12 pounds more now than I did at the last  reunion, and my classmates made fun of me then.  </P> <P> I came across a diet pill that promised I could lose up to five pounds a week.  The ingredient is guar gum. What is it and how does it work?  </P> <P> A: Guar gum is a soluble fiber from guar seeds. Like the fiber in oat bran and  pectin, guar gum has been shown to lower cholesterol and perhaps even improve  blood sugar levels in diabetics.  </P> <P> There is controversy, however, about whether guar gum actually promotes weight  loss. Although you might have a feeling of fullness after consuming this fiber,  you should not expect to lose a lot of weight in a short period of time.  </P></p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: US pump plan is cleared INGERSOLL-RAND and Dresser Industries of the US are going ahead with a plan to merge virtually all their worldwide pump interests following a decision by the US Justice Department last month to drop its opposition to the scheme. The formation of the joint venture, Ingersoll-Dresser Pump, comes almost 18 months after they originally announced their intention to create the world's second-biggest pump company after Ebara of Japan. The move creates a company with about Dollars 900m of sales last year and 8,000 employees. UK manufacturing facilities at Gateshead, Coleshill and Newark are included in the deal, but not Dresser's Mono Pump operations. The merger was cleared by the European Community in January, but the Justice Department had said the deal was likely to lessen competition substantially in the US.</p>

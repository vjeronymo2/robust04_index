			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Crisps never tasted so good A MORE subtly flavoured potato crisp or tortilla chip could result from a French process to coat continuously the flavouring on both sides of the crisp or chip within a completely closed system. After leaving the fryer the food items pass into a biturbine, where two turbines rotate and isolate the chips. An integrated powder dispersion unit and air injection system puffs the flavouring on to the chips. Developed by EMT Process, of Cabries, the process ensures that the crisps emerge ready for packing. EMT Process: France, 42 02 92 57.</p>

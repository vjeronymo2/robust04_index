			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris April 21 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister  Antonin Baudys met today with leading representatives of the  French company MATRA who acquainted him with guided missiles  Magique-2 and Mistral, the purchase of which is being considered  by the Czech Army.    CTK learnt this from a source close to the Czech delegation  led by Baudys which started a three-day official visit to France  today.    According to the source, the Czech Republic has been  maintaining close relations with MATRA since 1992. Experts and  parliamentarians from both countries had agreed to test the  Magique-2 missiles on MiG-23ML planes with which the Czech Army  is equipped.    The relevant agreement was signed in January and the tests  were carried out by Czech pilots on two MiG-23MLs from March 28  to April 11 in France. The result was very good, the source  said.    It also said that the two types of missiles were too costly  for the Czech Republic and that Baudys only wanted to know  conditions offered by MATRA. "Though the negotiations have  progressed quite far, no trade agreement is in the offing. But  it cannot be ruled out in the future," the source said.    The French party offers direct and indirect compensation for  the missiles, the source said. "In case of direct  compensations, the Czech Republic would produce mechanical parts  for French guided missiles which would then be supplied to other  countries," the source said.    Indirect compensation consist in supplies for MATRA's  civilian programmes. The company produces Renault-Espace cars  and MATRA-Hachette publishes books and magazines.    According to the source, the French recently supplied guided  missiles to Finland, Norway and Austria in exchange for supplies  of component parts for cars and of paper.</p>

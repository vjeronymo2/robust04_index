			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASIA WARMS UP TO AMERICAN FAST FOOD;  </P> <P> TRENDS: U.S. CHAINS ARE MOST PREVALENT IN JAPAN, WHERE THERE ARE 350 MCDONALD'S  FRANCHISES AND 649 KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN OUTLETS.  </P> <P> Will the next generation of Asians shun curbside noodles, curries and other  indigenous food in favor of American burgers and fried chicken?  </P> <P> Although the answer is still inconclusive, a recent U.N. report says American  fast food has made major inroads across Asia.  </P> <P> "Fast food is the latest mega-trend in Asia where it is definitely making an  impact on the culture and life styles of the people, as the people begin to  have less and less time for a formal meal," says the report, "The  Socio-Economic Impact of Transnational Corporations in the Fast Food Industry."  </P> <P> The report quoted one Australian-based executive as saying, "Asians are  vulnerable toward fads from the West and some franchisers regard Asia and other  unexplored markets as potential dumping grounds for franchises."  </P> <P> According to the study, U.S. fast-food chains are most prevalent in Japan,  where there are 350 McDonald's franchises and 649 Kentucky Fried Chicken  outlets, among others.  </P> <P> Hong Kong follows close behind, while popularity is growing in the Philippines,  Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan. Thailand is a relative latecomer, but business  is booming.  </P> <P> Overall, Kentucky Fried Chicken does best in Asia, with McDonald's second.  </P> <P> The first two attempts in Thailand to introduce fast food were unsuccessful.  The British chain Wimpy's arrived in 1964, followed by Kentucky Fried Chicken  in 1970. Both closed soon after U.S. soldiers returned home from the Vietnam  War.  </P> <P> However, Mister Donut broke into the market in 1978 and paved the way for six  other U.S.-based franchises.  </P> <P> At the time of the report, Bangkok had 60 fast-food outlets, including 25  Dunkin' Donuts, 14 Mister Donuts, seven Pizza Huts, four Kentucky Fried  Chickens, two McDonald's and one Dairy Queen. More are planned.  </P> <P> Polls of customers at McDonald's in Bangkok showed they chose to eat there  because of brand loyalty, persuasion by their children, convenience and  atmosphere.  </P> <P> The study notes that World War II played a major role in introducing American  fast food to Asia.  </P> <P> Den Fujita, a McDonald's franchise operator in Japan, is quoted as saying  postwar changes in Japan, such as the introduction of bread and milk into the  schools by Americans, enabled the Japanese to adapt more easily to hamburgers  and milkshakes.  </P> <P> In the Philippines, the American GI diet became a new status symbol after World  War II. A whole generation of middle-class Filipinos in the postwar years were  raised on hot dogs, pork and beans, corned beef and Vienna sausages.  </P> <P> China is one of the few major countries in Asia that has not readily taken to  the fast-food industry. An exception is the successful two-story Kentucky Fried  Chicken restaurant on Beijing's Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> As for the future of American fast food, the report provided one clue: "Having  experienced the clean and cool atmosphere of fast-food restaurants, children  refuse outright to eat at hawkers' stalls, though the food there is much more  delicious and priced more cheaply."  </P></p>

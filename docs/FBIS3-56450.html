Poltoranin disagreed with the notion that Russia's Choice  used Gaydar's and Pamfilova's resignations to distance itself  from the president. "We do not want it, and we hope that the  president will not deviate from democratic principles. Then we  will be with him," he said.    Poltoranin qualified Gaydar's and Pamfilova's resignations  as  "a logical step stemming from the policy pursued by the  Chernomyrdin group in the government."    "It was a well-considered, not an impulsive, step, since the  outlooks of Chernomyrdin and Gaydar differ greatly. Gaydar and  the entire group of reformers have no right to serve as a cover  for the degradation of the economy and management system.  Gaydar's withdrawal is bad for Russia, but there is no other  way out," Poltoranin stressed.    Russia's Choice, he added, analyzed the situation earlier,  and suggested a month before December's elections that Gaydar  should resign and distance himself from the government "to stop  being in the shadow of errors the government committed in 1993."    "At that time this decision was not endorsed, since we did  not want to introduce an element of destabilization in society  and lose the new Constitution, because many people could decide  not to vote because of it," Poltoranin said. "Today this factor  no longer exists, and so we can make decisions more openly."</p>

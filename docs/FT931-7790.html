			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Health reform may trigger further tax rise CLINTON administration officials are bracing themselves to ask for a second round of tax increases to pay for short-term costs of the healthcare reforms they expect to propose in May. While healthcare reform is seen as essential to any long-term effort to bring government spending under control, it is expected to cost a considerable amount in the short term, before these savings start to accrue, because of President Bill Clinton's pledge that the reforms will include universal access to healthcare. About 34m people are excluded from the healthcare net. Most of these are employed but do not receive health insurance from employers, and are not poor enough to qualify for the government-funded Medicaid system. The General Accounting Office estimates the cost of extending coverage to these people at Dollars 12bn-Dollars 27bn (Pounds 7.8bn-Pounds 17.5bn) a year, but the Washington Post reports that a study prepared for Mr Clinton before he took office puts the cost at Dollars 175bn over the four years, before savings start to come in. But without reform, Mr Clinton warned when presenting his economic plan last week, healthcare, mostly on the Medicaid and Medicare programmes, will absorb 25 per cent of federal government spending by 1998. In addition, universal coverage is not merely a social goal but an element of a cost containment strategy; one of the problems in the US system is shifting treatment costs of those who cannot pay on to those who can. Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said last week that he expected some 'sin taxes' on items such as alcohol, tobacco and firearms to be increased to pay for the healthcare reform. An alternative would be to reduce the tax deductibility of employer-paid health insurance premiums. Other cabinet members have been less explicit, saying that tax increases are an option.</p>

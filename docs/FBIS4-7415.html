			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- The Supreme Court  rejected Friday an appeal by a 22-year-old American soldier  charged with murdering a Korean bar girl, confirming the  original sentence of 15 years in prison. The high court found  Pvt. Kenneth Markle guilty of intentional murder and dismissed  his plea of self-defense in view of the circumstances  surrounding the murder.    As soon as it receives the ruling, the Justice Ministry will  ask the delivery of the convict from the U.S. Forces Korea in  accordance with the Korea-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)  to put him in a juvenile prison in Chonan. Currently three  American soldiers are confined in Chonan prison.    The U.S. side can reject Korean Government requests to claim  soldiers, civilian employees in the military or their dependents  accused of a criminal offense on the ground of "sympathetic  consideration" provision of the SOFA but must comply with the  requests when they are found guilty in a court of law.    The Korean prosecution originally sought to put Markle under  its custody in view of the cruelty and inhumanness of his murder  of Yun Kum-i in October 1992, but it had to indict him without  physical detention since the American forces refused to turn him  over in accordance with the provision. He is currently detained  at a U.S. base here.</p>

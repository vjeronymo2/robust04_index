			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Cigarette tax may rise Dollars 1.25 Anti-smoking advocates won a significant battle yesterday when an influential congressional health committee voted to raise the tax on cigarettes by Dollars 1.25 (84 pence) a packet to help pay for a reform of the healthcare system, far more than the 75 cent increase proposed in President Bill Clinton's health plan. The stiff tobacco tax increase, which could raise an estimated Dollars 16bn a year, passed the health panel of the House of Representatives Ways and Means committee by a 6-5 vote, but could fall by the wayside as healthcare legislation goes through Congress. Mr Clinton had originally considered a steep increase in the tobacco tax, partly to raise revenue to pay for aspects of his reform plan and partly to act as a severe disincentive to smoking, but backed down to 75 cents to placate congressmen from tobacco-producing states in the south-east. Mr Clinton's efforts to push healthcare reform have appeared to lose momentum in recent weeks, but a legislative package is still being painstakingly crafted in Congress. One draft now being circulated by the House energy and commerce committee, under the chairmanship of Mr John Dingell of Michigan, would eliminate the requirement that all but the largest companies be required to buy health insurance for their employees through government-run 'health alliances'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Akira Yamagishi, president of the Japanese </F> Confederation of Trade Unions (Rengo), by MAINICHI SHIMBUN;  place and date not given]    [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How do you envision the future  realignment of political parties?    [Yamagishi] I anticipate the present political parties will  ultimately merge into two political parties. Given the  diversified values of the people, the present political parties  should be merged not into two conservative parties, but into one  conservative party and one nonconservative party. I anticipate  the realignment of the present political parties will go through  a tripolar party structure under which Conservative Party A,  Conservative Party B, and one nonconservative party coexist.  Conservative Party A is like the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] and Conservative Party B is a non-LDP conservative  party or a new conservative-oriented party. They will be formed  by social democrats, centralists or liberal forces.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Would you elaborate on the  nonconservative  forces?    [Yamagishi] They are the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party, the United Social  Democratic Party, Sakigake [the Harbinger Party], the Japan New  Party, and reformist members of the LDP. Conservative Party B  must be formed on the premise that it does not take a hostile  and confrontational stand against the other parties, but  cooperates with them and shores up the framework of the  coalition government.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] When do you anticipate the political  parties will be realigned?    [Yamagishi] I think the present political parties will be  merged into two political parties late this century or early in  the 21st century. It is highly possible that the tripolar party  structure will emerge after the next general elections.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] When do you think the next general  elections will be held?    [Yamagishi] From a commonsense point-of-view, I think they  will be held after next autumn. Next year, local elections and  lower house elections will be held. The ruling coalition  parties opposed the simultaneous elections for both houses of  the Diet as a violation of the Constitution when they were  opposition parties in the past. The political parties will be  unable to fight in the general elections immediately after the  upper house elections because of the limit of their financial  capabilities and energy.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How do you think the ruling coalition  parties will fight in the next general elections?    [Yamagishi] It is better for them to uphold their present  coalition framework. They should not fight in the next general  elections with their policy differences unbridged. Their  coalition might be seen as a common-law marriage [yago]. Two or  three ruling coalition parties should aim for high-level  electoral cooperation by concluding a policy agreement. They  should make utmost efforts to coordinate their views so as to  field a single candidate. Political forces that oppose the  concept by (Shinseito and Komeito) of forming a new party cannot  come to power.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of moves to reshuffle  the cabinet?    [Yamagishi] The moves are presumptuous. It is said that the  cabinet reshuffle is surfacing because of emotional  confrontation between Mr. Hosokawa (the prime minister) and Mr.  Takemura (the chief cabinet secretary), but I believe the  cabinet reshuffle is surfacing after two political forces in the  ruling coalition parties clashed. I have high expectations of  Mr. Hosokawa as a leader of the liberal forces. Their emotional  wrangling will never be a plus for Japanese politics.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What policy will become a watershed for  the realignment of the political parties?    Yamagishi: The policy must define how Japan should share  international responsibility. The policy should also place its  priority on people who work by the sweat of their brow.  Specifically speaking, the policy should place its priority on  the direction of promoting social fairness, decentralization,  and democracy.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Is Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi a  leader of the nonconservative forces?    [Yamagishi] It is good for the new party to maintain a  collective leadership system. There are many candidates for  leader: Satsuki Eda (director general of the Science and  Technology Agency), Mr. Takemura, Mr. Hosokawa, and defectors  from the LDP. It is impolite to call Mr. Ozawa leader of the  nonconservative forces because he pursues the new conservatism.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do the policies of those leaders not take  on an anti-Ozawa tinge?    [Yamagishi] Mr. Yokomichi and other former governors are all  qualified to become a leader of the nation. I believe they are  able to fashion comprehensive policies and come up with  ideologies to prepare Japan for the 21st century.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Is it not time for you to play a role in  the political world?    [Yamagishi] If I am asked to cooperate, I will cooperate  within the permitted limits.</p>

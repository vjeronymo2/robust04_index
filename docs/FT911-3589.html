			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Compony News: Costs and interest hurt Rand coal arm WITBANK Collieries, the coal arm of the Rand Mines group, suffered the effects of rising costs and higher finance charges to record lower earnings in the six months ended March 1991. Turnover rose by 18 per cent to R569.4m (Dollars 210m) but tighter margins saw operating profit only 4 per cent higher at R106.5m. A sharp drop in investment income and a 27 per cent rise in the interest charges to R26.3m, the result of the Middelburg mine purchase, left after-tax profits 13 per cent lower at R51.3m. The half-year dividend is being maintained at 210 cents a share but the directors expect profits for the full year to show a decline. In 1989-90, Witbank, one of South Africa's four big producers, contributed R163.2m, or 73 per cent of Rand Mines' total attributable profits. Export tonnages increased by 26 per cent, mainly as a result of the first-time inclusion of Middelburg. The effects of an economic slowdown were seen in the domestic market where sales declined by 4 per cent. Sales to Escom, the power utility, increased by 13 per cent. The directors reported that the increased turnover was mainly volume related, with margins falling because of increased rail charges while inflation-induced cost increases were not offset by export revenues which were held in check by the firmness of the rand.</p>

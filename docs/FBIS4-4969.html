			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 2 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, chairman  of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, said Saturday that South  Korea should ask for nuclear transparency in the North and then  quietly await the outcome without getting directly involved.    "This is because the nuclear question is basically an issue  between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) and between North Korea and the United States," he said.    Kim said that although Seoul had the right to demand  inter-Korean nuclear inspections under the joint  denuclearization declaration, it could refrain from doing so  once the IAEA completely guarantees Pyongyang's nuclear  transparency.    Kim's remarks are part of a lecture at Cheju University to  be  given Saturday afternoon, whose text was distributed to the  press in advance.    On the proposed exchange of special envoys, the former  opposition leader said it should be used as an occasion to  promote an inter- Korean summit by enabling the envoys to  discuss matters related to peace, cooperation and unification.    He said an inter-Korean summit should take place without  further delay if only to dispel distrust, misunderstanding and  enmity between the two sides and also to explore "our destiny on  our own."    Regarding the North Koreans' threat to turn Seoul into "a  sea  of fire," Kim said they should revoke the inflammatory statement  and apologize to the 44 million South Koreans. He also  criticized as "totally unrealistic and dangerous" a high South  Korean defense official's remarks that "if war breaks out, we  would use it as an occasion to achieve unification by force of  arms."    Kim observed that the North Korean forces are strong and,  besides, China would not allow South Korea and the United States  to gain control of the strategic Yellow Sea.    He also foresaw the possibility of the United States and  North Korea striking a deal featuring simultaneous resolution of  the nuclear question and diplomatic normalization. "It appears  that beneath-the-surface talks have been going on to a  substantial extent between the United States and North Korea on  the issues of diplomatic normalization and economic  cooperation," he said.    Kim voiced opposition to an arms buildup in the South,  asserting that deployment of Patriot missiles, procurement of  sophisticated weaponry and resumption of the Team Spirit  exercise would only impede attempts at dialogue.</p>

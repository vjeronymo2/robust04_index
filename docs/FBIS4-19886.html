			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Hopes From the Meeting"] </F>   [Text] The meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou confirmed the positive  atmosphere in our bilateral relations which might even affect  pending issues in our national policy -- the Cyprus and Skopje  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issues.    Mr. Bill Clinton created expectations on the Greek side when  he told journalists that there must be some changes in Skopje's  views and when he gave assurances of his personal interest in  the Cyprus issue, expressing the hope that there might be some  movement by the Turkish Cypriot side to accept the  confidence-building measures [CBM's] in the next few days.    The U.S. interest in stability in the region should be  considered obvious. It is also obvious that stability is not  feasible unless there is relaxation in Greece's disputes with  Turkey and the Republic of Skopje. Naturally, since all sides  have declared their intentions to resolve their disputes through  dialogue, any settlement that is reached can only be a  compromise.    Concerning the Cyprus issue the Greek side, by accepting the  proposals on the CBM's, has made further concessions and  consequently Mr. Bill Clinton was right when talking about the  need for a move by the Turkish Cypriot side.    Concerning the Skopje issue, Mr. Bill Clinton's statement  that there should be changes in the views of the regime of the  Former Yugoslav Republic of "Macedonia" acquires particular  significance in view of the meeting between Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias and UN mediator Mr. Cyrus Vance. However, it  would be a mistake to suppose that there has been no pressure on  the Greek side too to lift economic countermeasures and achieve  a compromise solution.    There are many who doubt that the United States really wants  to intervene on the side of Greek national interest since our  country's predicament involves states with which Washington  either is closely allied, such as Turkey, or is now laying the  foundations of cooperation, such as Albania and the Republic of  Skopje.    Nevertheless, the U.S. President's statement appears to lift  the pessimistic atmosphere, but it remains to be seen whether  Mr. Bill Clinton's interest will lead to concrete results in the  issues of Cyprus and Skopje.</p>

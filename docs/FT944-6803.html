			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Late spurt by Yes side as Norway votes on joining EU Final opinion polls showed the Yes campaign gaining ground as Norwegians began voting yesterday in a referendum on joining the European Union. A majority in favour when votes are counted tonight would reverse Norway's rejection in 1972 of membership of the then European Economic Community. The No side has led the contest throughout the year, but a spurt by supporters of Norwegian membership since neighbouring Sweden voted to join two weeks ago has encouraged Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, and her Labour government, to believe that victory is possible. In a final campaign push on Friday and Saturday, Mrs Brundtland appealed to Norwegians not to leave the country isolated now that Sweden and Finland, its fellow Nordic nations, had elected to join the EU. Calling the referendum the most important decision facing Norway since the second world war, she said the Yes campaign was gaining momentum and called for a high turnout to ensure victory. 'Get off the sofa and vote,' she said. 'We are almost there.' The last opinion polls yesterday showed a continued lead for the No side of about 52 per cent against the Yes side's 48 per cent. The No side argues that membership will erode Norway's independence and control over its oil and fish resources. But all polls showed significant gains for the Yes camp. The government and its pro-EU backers in the Conservative opposition party and the business community are banking on winning over most of those making up their minds at the last minute. The No side, however, is hoping its great strength in the rural and remote northern regions will be sufficient to defeat an expected majority for membership in urban areas, particularly in the Oslo area, where about a third of the 3.6m voters live. Tensions between the two camps boiled over in televised debates on Friday night when Mrs Brundtland accused Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, the principal leader of the No campaign, of lying when she said EU membership might weaken trade union rights. Ms Lahnstein demanded an apology, but Mrs Brundtland was unrepentant. Polling stations in about half the country's municipalities opened for voting yesterday and a heavy turnout was reported. The bulk of the electorate will cast their ballots today, with polls open until 9pm. Officials warn that if the outcome is very close, the result may not be clear until early tomorrow.

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Baynes back on acquisition trail Charles Baynes, the fast-growing specialist engineering group, yesterday returned to the acquisition trail, paying a total of Pounds 14.4m for five companies. It also reported interim pre-tax profits 71 per cent ahead at Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 3.27m), boosted largely by other recent acquisitions. Turnover increased by a similar amount at Pounds 67.04m (Pounds 39.34m), while earnings per share grew 19 per cent to 1.97p (1.65p). The interim dividend was raised 22 per cent to 0.7p (0.575p). Mr John Perkins, finance director, said that first half trading for existing businesses had been slightly ahead of the same time last year. The valve division had shown the most improvement, with operating profits increasing 64 per cent to Pounds 1.95m on turnover 25 per cent ahead at Pounds 14.2m (Pounds 11.34m). He said that overseas demand from the petrochemical industry was a significant factor in the improvement. However, the aerospace business continued to struggle. Operating profits slipped from Pounds 516,000 to Pounds 73,000 on turnover 9 per cent down at Pounds 8.35m (Pounds 9.2m). Buck &amp; Hickman, a tool distributor which Baynes acquired last year, contributed to its first full half year with Pounds 24.97m in sales and Pounds 1.85m in operating profits. The subsidiary was also behind the boost to cash reserves which jumped from Pounds 1.47m to Pounds 14.47m year-on-year. Mr Perkins said the cash was being used to fund yesterday's acquisitions, a move which would leave the company cash neutral. Pillar Engineering Supplies was the most costly of these at Pounds 5.95m. It will link up with its former competitor B&amp;H, greatly enhancing Baynes' distribution network. The company is also paying Pounds 4.25m for French valve group Industrie Mecanique Pour Les Fluids, Pounds 2m for Maxseal, a Bristol-based solenoid valve manufacturer, Pounds 1.1m for Orseal Valves, a manufacturer of ball valves for ships, and Pounds 1.1m for Andrews Fasteners, a distributor of corrosion-resistant fasteners.</p>

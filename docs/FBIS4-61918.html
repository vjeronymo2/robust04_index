			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Nikolay </F> Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] President Boris Yeltsin in an interview with  Interfax spoke of a prevailing atmosphere of partnership in the  world arena and Russia's drive to establish such relations with  its former adversaries of the cold war period, notably the  United States.    However, he also called for vigilance. "While going ahead  with arms reduction, we will be seeking military parity both  with the United States and NATO", Yeltsin said.    Yeltsin pointed to the significance of new forms of military  cooperation such as joint exercises adding that "we will hold  them in an effort to beef up the spirit of friendly cooperation".    Yeltsin also pointed to the strategic partnership of the  allied nations during the Second World War. However, he  stressed that Russia must be treated as an equal because any  other attitude was unacceptable.    For his part, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that  Russia was not opposed to joining the NATO-sponsored Partnership  for Peace plan. "We are not the weaker side in negotiations and  have no inferiority complex on that score", he said.    "In my view, Kozyrev went on to say, it is desirable that  attempts must be made to approve a wider concept of Russian-NATO  cooperation rather than a framework agreement." However, the  minister declined to say when exactly Moscow intended to sign  such a paper.    In an earlier interview with Interfax, Kozyrev said that  Russia wanted a more serious program of partnership with NATO to  meet the country's status and specifics. However, he denied  that such a program would be an alternative to the Partnership.    Russia will formulate its position on Partnership later this  month, Defence Minister Grachev told Interfax. Grachev is  expected to outline it at NATO's headquarters in Brussels on May  24 following Yeltsin's approval of the Russian formula. The  minister said Russia disagreed with parts of the Partnership  plan.    At an earlier news conference in Moscow, Grachev said his  ministry had decided to come up with a European security plan as  an alternative to Partnership. He said Russian experts were  given until May 15 to work out an appropriate document. The  minister made it clear he had discussed the idea with Yeltsin  himself.</p>

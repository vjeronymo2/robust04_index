			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (2): A much-ignored problem - Key Issues for users: Important business decisions are increasingly based on spreadsheets, but few companies have any way of testing their accuracy and significant errors can occur THE proliferation of personal computers has put a spreadsheet package on virtually every business user's desk. So the package suppliers - and many big user companies - are now looking beyond financial modelling towards promoting these products as a standard way of accessing central information systems. But encouraging users to be more adventurous is raising new issues of control and verification as important business decisions are based increasingly on spreadsheets. Certainly the spreadsheet package is well placed to become a standard business tool, just like a calculator. A survey by the UK's National Computing Centre has shown that 98 per cent of companies supply spreadsheet packages to their personal computer users. These products are marginally more popular than word processing packages, which won a 97 per cent vote. Some way behind, in third place, were database packages, mentioned by 87 per cent. In addition, a tiny handful of products dominate the market and have therefore become virtual standards, certainly in individual companies which direct their users to one package to make training and support simpler and to get the best discounts. Lotus 1-2-3, launched around the time that computer industry leader IBM made the personal computer respectable by entering the market, now claims 16m users world-wide. The various versions of 1-2-3 took almost half the UK market in unit sales and over 60 per cent in sales by value last year, according to market research firm Romtec. Computer Associates' SuperCalc and Microsoft's Excel both had around 20 per cent of unit sales, Romtec says. Excel had over 20 per cent by value and SuperCalc, which is a fifth of the price, had just over six per cent. These three products took 90 per cent of the UK market between them. According to VNU Business Publications' Software Users' Yearbook there are around 55 spreadsheet packages available in the UK, including eight versions of 1-2-3. If different versions of each product are counted as one, the choice comes down to around 40 - only a few more than the number of add-on packages listed: everything from systems to print spreadsheets sideways to get a better fit on the paper to products for linking into databases. This is a far cry from the 400-plus accounting packages thought to be available in the UK, for example. In addition, the different focuses of the leading suppliers have restricted the choice further on different computers. The most notable case here concerns the Apple Macintosh computer: Lotus 1-2-3 was launched for this machine only in December, which means Excel has so far been the only one of the top products to be available to Macintosh users. So, with a relatively limited number of very widely used products and with just three of these dominating the market, the scene is set for suppliers and users to see spreadsheet packages as standard tools in other fields, too. 'There's no doubt that in the last 18 months or so we have been promoting 1-2-3 not only for personal use but also for use at work group or organisational level,' says the head of Lotus Development in Europe, Mr Paul Bailey. 'We have versions for mainframes, for networks and so on, to facilitate the use of 1-2-3 as a front-end to corporate data. 'There are categories of front-end tools: other tools might be more suited to transaction-based applications but the spreadsheet fills the category which meets the need for analysis of data once it's extracted from the corporate database.' Mr Bailey says the spreadsheet package is thus moving into the area dominated and perhaps created by the more expensive executive information system - 'we certainly use the term 'executive information system' in our marketing now,' he says. Some of the companies interviewed in the following pages are already going this way; others are now using spreadsheet programs for imaginative applications which are far removed from the original financial modelling job that the products were mainly designed for. However, as some of these companies also point out, letting amateur programmers develop business models on which key investment or other decisions will be based is not without risk. This risk is highlighted by a survey this year by accountancy and consultancy firm Coopers Lybrand Deloitte. This survey of spreadsheets produced by 31 top companies found that over 90 per cent had errors of more than five per cent in their results. 'In four companies, the spreadsheets were so poor that the results were just meaningless and the models had to be rewritten,' says Mr Gavin Potter, a principal associate, who led the study. He quotes examples of the impact of these errors: a net present value was wrong by 54 per cent; an incorrect interest calculation showed pre-tax profit which was wrong by six per cent; an incorrect depreciation rate led to a seven per cent error in net profit. Design or programming errors made up 69 per cent of the total. The other problems were errors in financial or accounting theory (19 per cent) and human error, typically typing mistakes (12 per cent). 'Clearly, most of the errors occurred because the writers of the spreadsheets had had little training in how to produce robust results,' Mr Potter says. 'Yet despite the widespread occurence of significant errors, we found that this is a much-ignored problem.' The following pages feature some companies which believe they are doing all that can reasonably be done to overcome the problem without restricting use of the products. They provide, for example, central training, consultancy and a focal point for the exchange of user-experiences. Yet even these companies cannot guarantee to have eliminated the danger. It is thought that users typically use only 20 per cent of spreadsheet package facilities, so the danger must grow as business people become more familiar with spreadsheet programs, use more of the facilities and trust them increasingly as part of their day-to-day work. A 54 per cent error such as that mentioned by Mr Potter at Coopers Lybrand Deloitte could make quite a difference to a business decision. But as Mr Potter says: 'Although spreadsheets are often heavily relied on despite their relatively recent introduction, few firms have any way of testing the accuracy of the results generated.'

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: The double-edged Wilkinson Swordsman - Christopher Lewinton, TI Group chairman Correction (published 15th May 1992) appended to this article. MR Christopher Lewinton is something of an evangelist in the mould of Sir John Harvey-Jones, the peripatetic industrialist and troubleshooter. The chairman of TI Group, which this week launched a hostile bid for Dowty, the aerospace company, likes nothing more than to spell out his vision of a British industrial renaissance. 'I'd like to feel I had played a part in the resurrection of British industry and persuaded talented brains to be attracted to industry and not the City,' says the man who will head one of the largest UK-based, but internationally focused, specialist engineering companies if the Pounds 482m bid succeeds. 'I am trying to bring engineering closer to marketing in order to turn ideas into money.' Such pithy soundbites which lace his descriptions of TI's corporate culture owe much to his business career in the US. Disillusioned by the UK which he felt did not encourage wealth creation, he had emigrated in the 1960s and made his name with Wilkinson Sword. A jolly 60 year old, Mr Lewinton has the air of a natural salesman, suggesting he should have advertised and not developed double-edged razor blades at Wilkinson Sword. But since returning to base in the UK in the 1970s, Mr Lewinton has brought the steely business equivalent of a mid-Atlantic twang to TI and his ideas for industrial regeneration. It has led to a metamorphosis at TI. From dull Midlands metal basher, concentrating largely on the UK, the company has rapidly shifted to an internationally focused seals, tubes and aerospace engineer eagerly followed by a growing band of City followers. But the genesis of this growth lies in Mr Lewinton's previous experience reshaping industries. His first headline-grabbing move came in 1973 when he merged Wilkinson Sword and British Match, a sleepy world force in the match business that needed to find new products. The deal caused a stir, not least because the logic of mixing matches and razors confounded many spectators. Mr Lewinton denies charges of opportunism, saying British Match had strong cash flow and a stable market position but had diversified with no regard to a coherent strategy. Forming a consumer products group therefore made sense. A similar desire to return to strong core businesses lies behind this week's bid for Dowty, once a world name in aircraft landing gear but which latterly has gone astray with ill-judged diversifications. A second controversial deal, in 1978, involved the merger of the renamed Wilkinson Match with Allegheny Ludlum, a US special steels company which is now in bankruptcy proceedings. This went ahead after a stock exchange row erupted following Allegheny's plan to take a majority stake without making a bid. Two years later a full bid was forthcoming. Ironically it was the decision of Allegheny chairman, Mr Robert Buckley, to diversify from specialised steels and into consumer goods with the acquisition of Sunbeam domestic appliances in 1981, which Mr Lewinton feels lay behind Allegheny seeking Chapter 11 protection in 1988. Mr Lewinton is at pains to point out that he was in charge of international operations in London at the time the decision to diversify was taken and that he left in 1985, long before the company got into serious trouble. Given his history of merging and focusing businesses, it was therefore unsurprising that Mr Lewinton turned to Tube Investment's roots. Mr Michael Garner, TI's finance director, was however surprised at the speed with which he moved. A week after joining, he asked Mr Garner what he thought about closing the profitable appliances division, prompting Mr Garner to ask 'How did you get there so fast?' Croda was duly sold to GEC; Russell Hobbs and Tower went to Polly Peck; the headquarters was moved from a 180-strong office in Birmingham to an existing office in London; and a year later the Raleigh bicycle business was sold in perhaps the most unexpected move. John Crane, the engineering seals business, and Bundy, the specialist US tubes business, were also bought in the first three years, laying the foundations for the modern TI. In a grand and expensive gesture, Mr Lewinton also borrowed Pounds 100,000 to buy 60,000 TI shares, a move designed to boost sapping confidence. 'It had a tremendous impact on the company,' he says. 'There was no sparkle; they did not have a desire to create wealth.' It is not a criticism anyone could lay at Mr Lewinton's feet. His compensation package, which grossed him a handsome Pounds 750,524 of salary and bonus in 1990, has raised more than a few eyebrows. Mr Lewinton is unapologetic about such sums - he says in any case that he is unlikely to get a bonus either last year or this and is therefore looking at a basic salary of Pounds 485,000 in 1991 - plus the Pounds 800,000 of stock options he sold. 'If you compare top directors in the City and top directors in industry, I don't see why one should be worth very much more than the other,' he says. He argues that so long as bonuses are related to performance, shareholders are getting value. An important adjunct, he says, is that top brains are attracted away from law firms and the City, and the cause of engineering is served. Such sums are indeed likely to make a young graduate's mouth water and rejuvenate British industry. Correction (published 15th May 1992) An article in the Financial Times on April 25 incorrectly stated that Allegheny Ludlum Corp was in bankruptcy proceedings. The article should have said Allegheny International was in bankruptcy proceedings; Allegheny Ludlum is a profitable producer of specialty materials, which emerged from Allegheny International via a management buy-out in 1980.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS ASKED TO REDUCE WATER USE  </P> <P> The South Coast Water District is asking South County residents to voluntarily  reduce water consumption by 10% and vote for Measure F on the June 5 ballot, a  district spokesman said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Responding to a request from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern  California, the district is asking residents to refrain from washing down  driveways and sidewalks, overwatering their lawns or landscaped areas and any  other unnecessary use of water.  </P> <P> If the voluntary effort is not successful, the district may have to demand a  cutback, said Raymond C. Miller, its general manager.  </P> <P> The district provides water and sewer services to an area that stretches from  Victoria Beach in Laguna Beach, south to the Dana Point headlands area and  inland to the Laguna Sur development.  </P> <P> The district is also supporting passage of an $8.5-million general obligation  bond, called Measure F on the June 5 ballot, that would provide funds to build  another water pipeline to the area.  </P> <P> If the measure passes, the district would tie into the new Santa Margarita  water line now being built through Mission Viejo and into San Clemente, Miller  said. The new line would start at Avenida Pico in San Clemente and run north up  Stonehill Drive in Dana Point and tie into an existing line at Street of the  Golden Lantern, Miller said.  </P> <P> The district currently relies on only one line for its water needs, with no  backup in case of emergency, Miller said. That line runs down Laguna Canyon  Road, Miller said.  </P> <P> The Dana Point City Council unanimously endorsed Measure F at its meeting  Tuesday night. LEN HALL  </P></p>

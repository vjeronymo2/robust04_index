			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: GLANVILLE IS HIRED BY FALCONS  </P> <P> Jerry Glanville, who was an assistant coach for the Atlanta Falcons for three  of the five winning seasons in the team's 24-year history, became Atlanta's  head coach Sunday.  </P> <P> "It's like a dream come true," said Glanville, who first joined the Falcons in  1977.  </P> <P> "I feel like I'm coming home."  </P> <P> The 48-year-old Glanville, criticized by opposing coaches for allowing his  players to use illegal tactics, got the job eight days after leaving the  Houston Oilers, a team he took to the playoffs in each of the last three  seasons. He replaces Marion Campbell, who resigned with four games left in the  1989 season.  </P> <P> The Falcons were 3-13 this season, losing their last seven games. They drew a  franchise-low crowd of 7,792 for their finale, a 31-24 loss to the Detroit  Lions on Dec. 24.  </P></p>

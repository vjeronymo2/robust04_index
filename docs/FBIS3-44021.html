			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Joint communique from the National Bank and the National </F> Police General Command issued on 20 January]    [Text] 1. In accordance with Article 39 and Law No.5/91 of  20 April, published in the GAZETTE OF THE REPUBLIC No.16, first  series, all those violating the law and orders or instructions  from the Angolan National Bank could be sentenced up to two  years in prison and fined 5 million new kwanzas, apart from  other appropriate measures which could include a total ban on  exercising activities in any financial institution.    2. The Angolan National Bank has been issuing some notices  which could be viewed as government decrees. They contain norms  and instructions which must be carried out. These include  Notice No. 6/92 of 12 August, which defines conditions for  opening foreign exchange offices and institutions whose  exclusive objective is to carry out the purchase and sale of  foreign currency and travelers checks; Notice No. 8/93 of 27 May  which authorizes commercial banks and licensed foreign exchange  offices to purchase and sell foreign currency at the free market  rate; Notice 11/93 of 16 December, which establishes forms in  which commercial banks must carry out these operations; as well  as Notice No.12/93 of 16 December which clarifies regulations to  be observed by commercial banks in their foreign exchange  operations at free market rates.    3. The purchase and sale of foreign currency can only be  legally carried out by institutions which have been duly  authorized by the Angolan National Bank, which is exclusively  charged with the task of providing license for this activity.  Also in force is Notice No.6/93 of 12 August, which contains  necessary prerequisites for the provision of licenses to foreign  exchange offices.    4. Necessary conditions have, therefore, been created for  the  legal operation of the foreign exchange activity. It will not  be justifiable, therefore, to carry out this business outside  the legal perimeters, as has been the case on the streets and  other unsuitable places, endangering public order and the  personal security of the people involved in it.    5. Thus, the Angolan National Bank and the National Police  General Command announce that in terms of the authority  conferred on them by law they will deal with all those engaged  in the illegal purchase and sale of foreign exchange or  travelers checks. They, therefore, advise them to stop this  activity at once.    [Signed] Generoso de Almeida, governor of the Angolan  National Bank, and Santana Andre Pitra Petroff, National Police  general commander.</p>

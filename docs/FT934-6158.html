			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Fiat acts fast over program copies Fiat, Italy's largest private sector company, bought 30,000 software licences in two weeks after investigators discovered illegal copies of popular computer programs in use at La Stampa, the daily newspaper owned by the Italian motor group, Alan Cane reports. The raid on La Stampa's offices was authorised by the courts after the Business Software Alliance, an organisation of US packaged software suppliers campaigning against software piracy, produced evidence that illegally copied software was being used. The BSA has already brought at least 150 actions against companies in Europe.</p>

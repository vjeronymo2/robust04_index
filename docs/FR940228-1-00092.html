			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.16&blank;Standards of Administrative Capability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to redesignate &sect;668.14 as &sect;668.16.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In matters not governed by specific provisions, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 487(c)(1)(B) of the HEA provides for the establishment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards of administrative capability for participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that include any matter the Secretary deems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for the sound administration of the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. Section 498(d) of the HEA, which was added by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments of 1992, authorizes the Secretary to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures and requirements relating to administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability, including the consideration of past performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions or individuals in control of those institutions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance of records. In addition, section 498(d) authorizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary to establish other reasonable procedures that will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute to ensuring that institutions will be administratively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given this framework, the Secretary proposes to strengthen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and modify the administrative capability standards in the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations by making significant, substantive changes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative standards as well as some technical changes; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant proposed changes to the current regulations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to clarify the Secretary's current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principle that an institution must demonstrate that it is capable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of meeting each of the administrative standards in this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be considered administratively capable. During negotiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking, alternatives to requiring that institutions meet each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative standard were discussed. Among the options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered were that the various factors be ``weighted,'' i.e., the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary would identify which factors he considered to be the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most critical and would incur the greatest penalty if they were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not met. Some of the negotiators suggested that the various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors be used only as indicators of capability; that is, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary would be required to review each institution that did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not comply with one or more standard to determine the seriousness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of noncompliance. However, the negotiators did not reach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consensus on an approach. Therefore, the Secretary is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that to be fully certified as meeting the standards in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section (as well as the other standards in Subpart B of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations) an institution must demonstrate that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administratively capable by meeting all the administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. An institution that fails to demonstrate compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with one or two administrative standards could be certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisionally (see the earlier discussion on provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification) if the Secretary were to determine the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of meeting all the standards within a specific time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period and that the noncompliance did not necessitate taking a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stronger sanction such as a fine, limitation, suspension, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination proceeding against the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, an initial applicant would not be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate compliance with all standards prior to participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Secretary expects such an institution to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is capable of complying with all the standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Secretary currently provisionally certifies an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial applicant if the Secretary determines that the applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is capable of meeting the current standards within a specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of time. The Secretary will continue this practice, using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any additional standards proposed in this section if they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted in final.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to make explicit the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, to be considered administratively capable, an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must administer all the Title IV, HEA programs in which it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participates in accordance with all applicable statutory and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory provisions and special arrangements, agreements, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitations. This expectation has been implicit. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes it is important to lay out this standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together with all the other administrative standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

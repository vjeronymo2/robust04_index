			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Algerian government starts to play for time / A look at reactions to the fundamentalists' strong election showing IN the six months which followed his appointment as Algerian prime minister last June, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali seemed to pop up in an endless stream of interviews, meetings and chat-shows  - lionised to an extent never before seen in this country. Since Algerians cast their votes on December 26 in the first round of the country's first multi-party general election, their prime minister has all but disappeared from the public scene, emerging only to attack the lay opposition parties in a brief appearance on French television and, last night, to tell Algiers radio that he was disappointed by the turn-out in the polls. By any standards, such behaviour is extraordinary. Rumours of a military coup are two a penny, the local press is full of articles explaining in elaborate detail that the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), whose candidates won 47.3 per cent of all votes cast, 'manipulated' the election and that the walis (provincial governors) failed to ensure a 'fair' poll. Meanwhile, senior members of the cabinet map out their strategy to chosen members of the foreign press. The Constitutional Court, they explain, which is looking at alleged fraud in 145 constituencies, might annul the election of 50-70 newly-elected deputies, all of whom will inevitably be members of the FIS. New elections will then have to be organised in those constituencies within three months, a tactic which might give the government a breathing space. All of this looks like hukkumat mikki (Mickey Mouse government), the expression ordinary Algerians have come to use for those who govern them. The name of Mr Ghozali, whose reputation until June rested on his successful management in the 1970s of the state oil company, Sonatrach, between 1976 and 1979, is now best not mentioned among the many engineers and middle management of the company. Many are people who have never been given their due, or are worried about what the future holds for their children. Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, leader of the main lay opposition party, the Front des Forces Socialistes, pointed out a few days ago that cancelling the second round makes the country look like a banana republic. A military coup would bring Algeria back to square one but might become unavoidable if pressure mounts, at home, or if the FIS is 'deprived' of its majority. The King of Morocco cannot view with any sympathy the idea of a regime competing with his brand of 'Islamic legitimacy'. The behaviour of the FIS, whatever its rulers may say today, risks being dictated by its supporters, the have-nots and castaways of Algerian society. These people have many kindred spirits in Morocco for whom the king's title of Amin al Mouminine (Descendant of the Prophet Mohammed) weighs little against the harsh daily grind. The Tunisians, for their part, are desperately worried. Meanwhile, a few hundred (or maybe even a few thousand) 'Afghans'  - Algerians trained in the camps around Peshawar in Pakistan, who fought the Russians in Afghanistan in the name of Allah  - lie low. They were responsible for the recent attack on military barracks in south-east Algeria. The resulting shoot-out cost 24 lives. Many of the weapons stolen from the police during the riots of October 1988 have never been recovered. No modern conflict is free of the vengeful hands of old ghosts, but in a country on which modern history has inflicted much suffering, they pull the strings of the current fray with inordinate and perilous force.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rocco Tolfa] </F>   [Text] [Tolfa] Gianfranco Miglio Two - The Revenge. Until  yesterday, he was preparing the ammunition for Umberto Bossi to  fire. Today Miglio prepared another round of ammunition, but  this time it was aimed at the leader of the Northern League and  what powerful ammunition it was.    Miglio said Bossi was a liar when he told judges the 200  million lire which the Northern League had received from  Montedison was subsequently stolen. Miglio said this version of  events was not true; instead, the money had ended up in the  coffers of the party. Miglio added that the money was only an  advance, and that the League's bosses believed that they would  get more money. Miglio maintains that the League received money  from a number of sources.    The League's Francesco Speroni said that the allegations  were  inferences, and Roberto Maroni added that the allegations were  the product of bitterness. However, Miglio had plenty more  revelations. He said that Bossi was preparing to form a  secessionist movement and that he would try and get Silvio  Berlusconi in trouble.    Miglio said he did not like the Freedom Alliance government,  but he said he would vote for the confidence motion.

[end recording]    [Tolfa] Silvio Berlusconi can smile at another vote which he  has managed to obtain.    Bossi, on the other hand, appeared disillusioned. He said  that Miglio was a poor man who was bitter because he had not  been made a minister, but that nevertheless he would go to see  him soon. [end Tolfa recording]</p>

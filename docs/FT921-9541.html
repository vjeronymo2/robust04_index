			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Aitken Hume sells back Bachmann to its founder AITKEN HUME International, the financial services and investment group, is to sell back Bachmann Group, the Guernsey-based financial services operation which it bought in 1987, to Mr Peter Bachmann, its founder. The deal releases Aitken Hume from deferred payment commitments made when the 1980's economic boom was at its height. Under the terms of the now superseded 1987 deal, Aitken Hume would have had to pay Pounds 16.1m in new shares over the next 18 months. Uncertainty over the form in which Aitken Hume would pay for the remainder of the price caused Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte to qualify the company's 1990 accounts. 'We are absolutely delighted at this resolution of the problem,' said Mr Ziad Idilby, chairman and chief execu-tive of Aitken Hume yester-day. He said the two sides had been negotiating a settlement. Though Bachmann is nominally being sold for Pounds 17.8m, this amount will be offset by the return of a 23.9 per cent stake in Aitken Hume from Mr Bachmann and his companies. Net cash from the sale for Aitken Hume will be Pounds 1m. Bachmann Bank, which was established by Aitken Hume but renamed after it bought the Bachmann group, is not part of the sale. The agreement includes clauses to ensure that its client business is not disrupted by the sale of the other Bachmann companies and it will continue to operate from Bachmann premises. Aitken Hume made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m in the year ended March 31 1991 after a Pounds 1.7m exceptional charge; in the six months to Sept 1991 it reported profits of Pounds 2.6m. Bachmann Group recorded turnover of Pounds 4.8m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.74m in 1991.</p>

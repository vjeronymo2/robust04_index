			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Report at National Conference of Party Cell Secretaries"-- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- Kim Ki-nam, secretary  of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK],  delivered a report under the title "Let Us Make All Party Cells  Militant Organisations Remaining Intensely Loyal to the Party  and the Leader and Defending and Exalting the Cause of  Socialism" at the national conference of party cell secretaries,  which opened here today.    The report says:    The current conference initiated by the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il is a historic meeting, the first of its kind ever  since the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea. It will  powerfully demonstrate the revolutionary faith and unshakable  will of the entire party cell secretaries and party members to  remain loyal to the party and the leader and accomplish the  cause of socialism without the slightest vacillation under the  complex situation; it will also mark a radical turning point in  further strengthening the WPK into an invincible party and  accelerating the general march of Korean-style socialism.    Through a long-drawn-out arduous yet glorious struggle, the  WPK has been strengthened into a tested veteran party with great  revolutionary exploits and rich experience and a powerful  revolutionary party that can defend and carry to completion the  revolutionary cause of chuche, the cause of socialism and  communism, through storm and stress.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said in his letter of  congratulations to the delegates to the current conference:    "The foundation of our party and its development are  inconceivable apart from the development of its cell, the basic  party organization."    The party cells, the basic organisations of the party and  militant units directly implementing the party's line and  policy, have played a very important role in strengthening the  WPK and victoriously advancing the Korean revolution.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song formed the grassroots  organisations of the party and expanded them before founding the  wpk, a revolutionary party of chuche type, and strengthening it.    The work of strengthening the party cells as required by the  party's chuche-based idea of its building has been promoted more  dynamically in the gigantic undertaking to model the whole party  and society on the chuche idea under the outstanding and tested  guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    "On letting the party cell discharge its duty of effectively  guiding the activities of the party members," "the party cell  must properly organise party assignments and review them in  time," "let us strengthen the unity and cohesion of the party  members in ideology and purpose based on the revolutionary idea  of the leader" and other works published by the dear leader in  the early 1960s have served as a highly important guideline in  improving the work of the party cells and the activities of the  party members.    The dear leader declared the modelling of the whole society  on the chuche idea the supreme programme of the WPK and laid  down the policy of modelling the whole party on the chuche idea  in the 1970s, and guided the party cells to effectively train  the party members into ardent communist revolutionaries of  chuche type who are intensely loyal to the party and the leader  and uphold the leadership of the party centre with loyalty, to  meet the new requirement of the development of the party and the  revolution.    The national short course for party cell secretaries held in  may 1991 marked a significant milestone in strengthening the  party cells.    Over the last three years, all the party cells and their  secretaries have worked hard to make their cells unfailingly  loyal to the party and the leader in hearty response to "let us  strengthen the party cells," the historic letter sent by the  dear leader to the participants in the short course.    The members of tens of thousands of party cells sent letters  to the dear leader, pledging to follow the party wholeheartedly  and remain loyal to the revolutionary cause of chuche to the  last, and are carrying their pledge into practice.    The party cells have made vigorous efforts to implement the  party's military line of self-reliant defence to the letter,  greatly contributing to the increase of defence capabilities of  the country to smash any formidable enemy at one blow.    They are devotedly working to consolidate the singlehearted  unity of the leader, the party and the masses, the source of the  invincible might of our socialism.    All the party members and people, closely rallied behind the  party and the leader in one mind and purpose, breathe the breath  of the party's idea and will, speak the way the party does, and  march as one at the command of the party.    The WPK has been strengthened into an ever-victorious  revolutionary party deeply rooted among the broad masses and the  party and people have won victory after victory in the political  and military confrontation with the enemy hell- bent on stifling  the cause of socialism. Lurking behind this are the devoted  efforts and hidden feats of all the party cell secretaries.    Hundreds of thousands of party cells secretaries who are  intensely loyal to the party and the leader and devote  everything to the country and the people are valuable beings of  our party and revolution. Our party and people are highly proud  of having these excellent party cell secretaries.    The reporter elaborated on the tasks for a vigorous march  toward the final victory of the revolutionary cause of chuche,  the cause of socialism, saying:    If all the party cells are to become militant organisations  remaining intensely loyal to the party and the leader and  defending and exalting the cause of socialism, they must  thoroughly fulfill the five major tasks of party cells advanced  by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his letter of  congratulations to the delegates to the current conference as  well as the highly important tasks set forth by the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il in his historic letter to the participants  in the national short course for party cell secretaries in May  1991 "let us strengthen the party cells."    All the party cells must continue to maintain it as the  keypoint of its work to establish the system of the unitary  leadership of the party, and wholeheartedly uphold the party's  leadership with loyalty and filial piety, cherishing deep in  mind the high pride and honour of having the dear leader as the  centre of unity, the centre of leadership and the supreme  commander of the revolutionary Armed Forces.    The party cells must establish a revolutionary habit of  unconditionally accepting and fully implementing the  instructions of the great leader and the dear leader and the  party's line and policy, their embodiment, and train all the  party members to be iron walls and rifles and bombs to  resolutely defend the party and the leader politically,  ideologically and with their lives under whatever condition and  circumstance.    The party cells and their secretaries must educate all the  party members and other working people to maintain high  revolutionary vigilance against the war provocation moves of the  U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique and make  full preparations to firmly defend the socialist motherland and  the gains of the revolution under any unexpected circumstance.</p>

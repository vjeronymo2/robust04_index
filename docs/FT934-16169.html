			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COCOA futures prices yesterday extended the retreat that began after overhead resistance was encountered on Tuesday morning. The March futures price at the London Commodity Exchange closed Pounds 21 down at Pounds 950 a tonne and some traders were expecting a corrective move to develop, following the recent sustained rise. 'We had been expecting a washout and it came today,' said one trader. 'The market needs to correct itself but opinions vary over how low it can go. Some people put the move back to Pounds 830 to Pounds 840 a tonne. . . some say it could go further.' NICKEL and TIN markets, the London Metal Exchanges weakest contracts of late, maintained earlier advances in the afternoon, with both metals ending firmer and around their highs after late kerb covering. Dealers said short-term factors were responsible as both remained depressed by long-term fundamentals, and the current upticks were generally seen as snap rallies in a bear market. The COPPER market consolidated, with routine business seen either side of the Dollars 1,700-a-tonne level for the three months position, which ended Dollars 10 up at Dollars 1,699.50.

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: New conference darling steps up Mr Michael Portillo yesterday set out a 'distinctive' Conservative agenda for the 1996 European Union intergovernmental conference, as he threatened to usurp the unofficial title of 'conference darling' from Mr Michael Heseltine. The rightwing employment secretary used a speech to the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward group on the conference fringe to set out the 'clear blue water' he saw between the Tories and Mr Tony Blair's new-look Labour party. He made it clear that the adoption of more rightwing policies was not the key to distinguishing the party from Labour. 'If Labour were to adopt every Conservative policy, if Labour were to publish our manifesto word for word . . . there would still be a yawning gulf between the two parties,' he said. 'A gulf of belief and principle: the gulf between the rock of our philosophy and the quicksand of Labour's posturing.' In an impressive and well-judged display in a series of interviews and speeches yesterday, Mr Portillo did not make any semblance of an overtly disloyal remark. But those witnessing his performance could scarcely have been in doubt about the underlying message: the young pretender was still around and had reinforced his credentials as a likely rightwing challenger in any future leadership contest. The pains he took to appear restrained and statesmanlike were helped by Monday's startling speech by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor. By comparison, Mr Portillo's message - even his forthright call in the conference hall to 'stop the rot from Brussels' - seemed positively mainstream. Even so, he was careful not to provide ammunition for anyone anxious to portray him as having stepped out of line. He said he was pleased by the rapturous reception, complete with four-minute standing ovation, that his conference speech received because 'the things that got the biggest cheer . . . were the things that John Major had won for the Conservative party'. And asked about the difference in tone between his speech, with its stinging attack on Brussels bureaucracy, and that by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, he said: 'Mr Hurd is in a different league from me.' Mr Portillo proposed a three-pronged agenda around which he said the Conservative party could unite in the run-up to the 1996 intergovernmental conference. This comprised: making sure most decisions affecting people's daily lives were taken by national governments; encouraging the European Union to be 'outward looking' in its approach to trade and new members; and resisting moves to impose new costs on business that would impair the competitiveness of European companies. In a wide-ranging and combative speech, he was restrained enough to sidestep a question on whether he would rescind the Maastricht treaty and said Mr Major was right to delay a decision on joining a single currency. Mr Portillo's performance came as Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, warned Mr Blair that he would play into Tory hands if he chose to 'fight on our ground'. In a vigorous defence on the conference fringe of free enterprise and individual action, Mr Howard said there was still 'a philosophical gulf' between the two main parties. 'The values and vision of the Conservative party are as powerful and resonant as they were in 1979,' he said. 'We believe free markets and strong communities complement each other.'</p>

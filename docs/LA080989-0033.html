			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PIERCE EXPECTED TO HIRE 2 COACHES  </P> <P> Pierce College has called a press conference for Thursday at 1 p.m., apparently  to introduce two new physical education teachers who also will coach at the  school.  </P> <P> An academic committee last week recommended Bob Lofrano, Chatsworth High's  baseball coach, and Bill Norton, an assistant football coach who had been hired  as a walk-on, for the positions. That committee has not reconvened since making  its recommendations to Pierce President Dan Means.  </P></p>

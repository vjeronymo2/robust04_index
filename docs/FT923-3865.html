			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Sellafield halts reprocessing BRITISH Nuclear Fuels has halted reprocessing at its Sellafield plant in west Cumbria because of a malfunction in the plutonium evaporator, an element in the reprocessing operation. BNFL said yesterday that reprocessing of fuel from Magnox reactors, which stopped on Tuesday, was unlikely to resume before next week as the fault had not been detected. It said that no radioactivity had escaped and nobody was injured. The evaporator is used in the conversion of plutonium liquor into powder.</p>

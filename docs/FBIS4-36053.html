			<p>BFN     [Text] Abha, Saudi Arabia, June 5, SPA -- Foreign Minister  Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal said continuation of fighting in Yemen  will have repercussions on the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council]  member states.    Addressing the 51st session of the GCC Ministerial Council  here last night, Prince Sa'ud said the brothers in Yemen are  passing through difficult circumstances and sad events due to  the continuation of violence and fighting in their country.    Yemenis are killed in north and south and properties are  destroyed as the result of the bloody fighting, he said.    Prince Sa'ud noted that the GCC member states, since the  beginning, had appealed to the brothers in Yemen to avoid their  country woes of war and settle their dispute through peaceful  means.    Despite the efforts exerted to end the war, yet bloody  fighting continued in Yemen, he said.    Prince Sa'ud noted that during the pilgrimage season  Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz,  in a personal initiative, called the conflicting parties in  Yemen to cease fighting taking into account the sanctity of the  hajj season and the feelings of the Muslims.    But we were taken by surprise when the military operations  continued, he said.    When we discuss this issue we should bear in mind that  fighting will never enhance the pillars of unity, on the  contrary it will deepen the feelings of hatred and disunity, he  said.    Prince Sa'ud said the UN's Security Council, in its  resolution Number 924, issued in June 1, reiterated the keenness  of the international community on stability in Yemen.    As continuation of fighting in Yemen will have repercussions  on the GCC member states, the GCC Ministerial Council should  issue a resolution to reiterate that continuation of fighting is  an unacceptable matter, he said and added in the light of the  adverse impact of the war, it will be an essential matter to  take measures vis-a-vis such situation.    Prince Sa'ud deplored the maneuvers of the Iraqi regime and  its procrastination in implementing the resolutions issued by  the Security Council following the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.    Iraq has been following a selective policy regarding the  resolutions issued by the Security Council, he said.    Till now the Iraqi regime has not announced its respect to  Kuwait's sovereignty and independence, he said and added  announcement of Iraq to its respect to Kuwait's sovereignty and  independence constitutes the core of the international  resolutions.    He noted that the failure of the Iraqi regime to implement  the international resolutions had forced the Security Council to  continue imposition of sanctions on Iraq.    We call the Iraq regime to implement the Security Council's  Resolutions 706 and 712 so as to pave the way for ending the  sufferings of the Iraqi people, he said.    On relations with Iran, Prince Sa'ud said "we have not yet  get confident that Iran will adhere to the international  conventions and norms based on the principle of mutual respect  and non-interference in the domestic affairs of the other  countries."    But yet we are optimistic that the causes which affect the  nature of the existing relations between the GCC member states  and Iran will come to an end, he added.    Prince Sa'ud said the problem of the three islands  constitutes one of the main obstacles that prevent growth of  Gulf-Iranian relations.    The initiative of Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan to settle the  dispute of the three islands through dialogue constitutes a  declaration of good intentions, he said.    Prince Sa'ud expressed happiness over the new era started by  the Palestinians to practice their national rights on part of  their territories following the agreement signed in Cairo in  last May.    He hoped that this development would be an initial step  towards a comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli dispute  in a manner that leads to the Israeli withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories including Jerusalem in line with the  Resolutions 242, 338 and 425.    Our countries have supported the peace steps and will  continue to do so, he said.    On the other hand, Prince Sa'ud deplored the Israeli  aggression on Lebanon and said the aggression does not only  constitute a flagrant aggression on an independent and UN's  member state, but it also runs counter to the Israeli adherence  towards the peace process.    We call on the UN and the Security Council to take the  appropriate measures that prevent recurrence of such aggression  and guarantee the implementation of the Resolution 425 issued by  the Security Council on Lebanon.    On Bosnia-Herzegovina, Prince Sa'ud condemned the Serb  aggression on the Muslims in violation to the international  resolutions.    He noted that the refusal of the Serbs to withdraw from the  Bosnian city of Gorazde reflects their unwillingness to  positively respond with the ongoing international efforts to  settle the dispute.    It is high time for the UN and international community to  put  pressure on the Serbs until they comply with the international  resolutions, he said.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Heseltine spars with Labour over recession A HIGHLY CHARGED fore-taste of the general election campaign set pulses racing in the Commons last night as the two main parties clashed furiously over the roots of the recession. As Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, poured scorn on Tory claims that the stalled recovery was a consequence of a worldwide downturn, Mr John Major indicated in a newspaper interview that he was ready to authorise more public spending in the Budget to kick start the economy. Repeating his claim that the UK was now 'poised' for an upturn, the prime minister said recovery had been delayed by a general lack of the 'confidence factor'. Mr Major's admission that he would raise the public sector borrowing requirement came in an interview with The Daily Telegraph today ahead of a cabinet meeting on Budget strategy. Earlier Mr Smith had made clear he would unveil the details of Labour's tax and spending plans after the March 10 Budget was announced and before an election. The economy dominated the day at Westminster as Labour's ferocious assault on the government's record met an equally spirited counter-attack from Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary. Amid fierce barracking from the government benches, Mr Smith charged the Tories with blaming foreigners for their failures and being 'unwilling and incapable of moving the country out of recession'. But his attack was brushed aside by Mr Heseltine who counter-claimed that the Labour leadership was riven with divisions about how to respond to the downturn. Against the mounting election fever at Westminster, the recession debate had been widely - and rightly - anticipated as a 'clash of giants'. Mr Heseltine had been drafted in to answer Mr Smith because Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was giving evidence to the Treasury committee. Mr Smith used his opening speech to review the government's pledges of an early economic upturn. He went on to pour scorn on claims that recovery had been halted by an international recession. Earlier explanations from ministers that the causes of the recession were rooted in such factors as deregulation of the financial sector were proof it was 'home-grown, domestically caused and without a hint of a foreign bacillus', he said. Ignoring the charges, a clearly relaxed Mr Heseltine countered that the key issue was not the cause of the downturn, but how to respond to it. To the delight of his backbenches, he went on to cite newspaper reports of divisions within the Labour leadership. 'This debate started off as a vote of confidence in the government's economic policies,' Mr Heseltine said. 'It has rapidly become a vote of confidence in the shadow cabinet.' His light-hearted teasing of the Labour frontbench provoked outrage from the opposition, but clearly raised morale among Tory MPs who described his speech as a 'vintage performance'. The government had a majority of 100 when it came to the vote, with the Labour attack defeated by 311 to 211. Earlier, Labour had stepped up its assault on the Tories' economic record when Mr Smith, claimed the government had cost every household Pounds 2,200 last year alone. The figure - centrepiece of a new document entitled The Cost of the Conservatives - came as a clear response to the Tories' recent poster campaign alleging Labour would raise taxes by an average of Pounds 1,000 per taxpayer. It is based on a calculation that the government's 'economic incompetence' had delivered the worst growth record since the second world war, resulting in the UK economy foregoing some Pounds 50bn in gross domestic product last year. Sitting beneath a poster of Mr Lamont in a stocking mask alongside the slogan 'You've Been Robbed', Mr Smith told a Westminster news conference that 'everyone now knows' Britain was suffering the deepest recession since the 1930s. He said the Pounds 50bn GDP shortfall represented the gap between a 2.5 per cent average growth trend, established from 1955 until 1979, and the 'miserable' 1.7 per cent annual growth actually achieved.

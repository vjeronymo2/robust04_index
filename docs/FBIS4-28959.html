			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The Japanese  authorities' suppression of the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) is under fire in different  countries.    The Ghanaian National Institute of the Chuche Idea in a  letter of protest to the Japanese prime minister June 3 said the  Japanese authorities' search of Chongnyon, a legitimate  organisation of overseas citizens of the DPRK, with the  mobilisation of huge police and even their unhesitating murder  and violence are a politically motivated sinister inhumane act.    Noting that this was an anti-human political suppression the  like of which could hardly be seen in the history of the world,  the letter demanded that the Japanese authorities immediately  stop suppressing Chongnyon organisations, apologize for their  encroachment on the legitimate rights of Koreans in Japan and  fully guarantee their political rights and freedom regulated  under the publicly recognized international law.    The chairman of the Denmark-DPRK Friendship Association in a  letter of protest to the Japanese Government May 31 denounced  the Japanese authorities for suppressing Chongnyon as part of  their campaign against the DPRK and stepping up the anti-DPRK  campaign in league with international reactionaries, and urged  them to stop it at once.</p>

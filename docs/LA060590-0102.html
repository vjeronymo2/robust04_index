			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAT SOUND SYSTEMS ON WAY TO U.S. MARKET;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: AFTER A THREE-YEAR WAIT, THE RIVAL TO CD-QUALITY SOUND WILL ARRIVE  THIS MONTH -- AT PRICES FROM $900 TO $1,700.  </P> <P> The biggest news to come out of the Consumer Electronics Show now in progress  here is that digital audio tape decks -- a cassette system said to rival  compact discs in sound quality -- will finally be available on the American  market by the end of the month.  </P> <P> But they're not cheap. The decks will be priced in the $900 to $1,700 range.  </P> <P> Several companies, including JVC, Technics and Denon, will be shipping units by  fall, but Sony announced Sunday that it plans to be the first to market,  delivering tape decks to retailers by the end of June.  </P> <P> Sony's announcement generated the most interest because its decks not only will  be marketed first but also at the lowest cost: the DTC75ES at $950 and the  DTC-700 at $900. Discount stores may sell the latter unit for under $800.  </P> <P> Digital audio tape, or DAT, has been promised to American consumers for the  past three years. It's an audio-cassette system that uses a mini-tape to  generate CD-quality sound. Some industry observers have predicted that, just as  the CD has made the album obsolete, DAT will ultimately wipe out the standard  audio cassette, now the most popular format among music listeners.  </P> <P> What's kept DAT off the American market is fear that it would lead to extensive  consumer copying of CDs, which in turn would cheat artists out of royalties,  cut down on CD sales and ruin the standard audio-cassette market. But last  August a compromise to limit DAT copying was reached that satisfied both the  Electronic Industries Assn. and the Recording Industry Assn. of America.  </P> <P> The DAT decks will be equipped with copy-limiting circuitry developed by  Phillips that will enable consumers to make unlimited copies of CDs on DAT  tapes, but none of those tapes can be used to make other copies. So a DAT tape  must be purchased for each copy.  </P> <P> Initially, most DAT owners will be limited to making copies of CDs because  there's very little prerecorded DAT software on the market. Sony will market a  classical line of prerecorded DAT tapes, offering 10 titles at $19.95 each.  </P> <P> Blank DAT tapes won't be cheap either. Available in 60-, 90- and 120-minute  sizes, Sony, for instance, will market them in the $12-$18 range, while Fuji  will offer a less-expensive line, $11-$13.  </P> <P> Sony owns CBS Records but, according to a Sony spokesman, there's no indication  that Sony will force the label to rush into the prerecorded DAT market.  </P> <P> Of the technological advances announced at the show, one, by Hitachi, may have  far-reaching effects. In the fall, the company will market a full line of VCRs  -- both expensive and inexpensive -- featuring a built-in automatic  head-cleaner.  </P> <P> Dirty video heads, as most VCR owners know, cause all sorts of visual and audio  distortions.  </P> <P> A spokesman at the company's exhibit, which included a see-through machine  showing the cleaner in action, said that this feature will be added without a  price increase.  </P> <P> The cleaner is a drum-shaped mechanism that gently brushes the video heads each  time a tape is loaded or unloaded. The system doesn't require maintenance. Its  non-abrasive, assuring longer life for the video heads, and expels the debris.  </P> <P> If this system is successful, other VCR makers will undoubtely adopt it, which  will ultimately cut down on VCR maintenance and maintain a high level of  picture-quality.  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Letter: Economic sense of child care Sir, Mrs Johnson (Letters February 13) laments that it is difficult for women over the age of 40 to find jobs in the UK and that this group could be targeted to fill the supposed shortfall in the workforce arising from demographic changes. As a working woman with a vested interest (I am in my 30s), I wholeheartedly agree - if, indeed, this is the sorry state of affairs. However, I am also a mother of a 21-month-old daughter with another baby expected soon. I, too, have made my own child care arrangements by employing a young woman at a good wage for this full-time care. I am certainly fortunate in receiving a salary which enables me to do this. But I do ask that the government recognises the fact that I, like many other parents, have contributed to the well-being of this country by creating a new job as well as continuing in my own, which, after many years of investment in my education and training, I am well qualified to do. This point should not go unnoticed at a time when unemployment is increasing all too rapidly and investment in new resources is restrained. Most importantly, parents should be encouraged to continue on this path by being granted relief on the cost of child-care. I do not call this 'wet-nursing'. Rather, it is sound economic sense.

No traffic in any direction other than inbound or outbound (i.e., cross traffic) will be permitted in the area of implementation. If a five knot speed limit or one-way traffic is implemented, all participant and spectator vessels shall also abide by all other nonconflicting provisions contained within these special local regulations associated with the regulated area. If a five knot speed limit is implemented in San Diego Bay, all traffic entering or exiting the harbors will be required to make a speed of no more than five knots through the water. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effective Dates.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is effective 10 a.m. PDT on October 28, 1994 through 5:30 p.m. PST on November 6, 1994, inclusive, unless cancelled earlier by the District Commander. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> R.A.

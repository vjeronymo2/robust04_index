			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: The precise point of Irish interest Sir, Joe Rogaly, commenting on the future constitutional arrangement of the 'island nation(s)', ('Breakaway Britain', September 23) should start from some minimal precision concerning the present arrangement. Constitutionally, of course, 'Britain' does not exist. In its beginnings, to consolidate the kingdom as it emerged from the Wars of the Roses, England absorbed Wales; there remains a distinction on the rugby field and linguistically, but a uniform legal system is accepted. Later, to secure the Williamite coup and eliminate Jacobite pretensions, Scotland was associated with England to form 'Great Britain', though some distinctively Scots legal, ecclesiastical and educational structures survive. The 'United Kingdom' incorporating Ireland finds its origin in the Act of Union, 1801, passed as a security measure during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. With partition of Ireland and of Ulster, since part of that province is in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland succeeded to the role previously assigned to the whole island. Evidently that union, between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which defines the present United Kingdom lacks the antiquity, the consensus and the stability found within Great Britain. And even there, the status of each nation is different. It is interesting to compare the treatment of Scotland at the present day with that administered to Ireland during the Repeal and Home Rule periods of the 19th century, and speculate on its eventual consequences. Therefore, aside from the lack of selfish economic and strategic interests in Northern Ireland (Downing Street Declaration), there can be no doubt of London's constitutional and political interest.

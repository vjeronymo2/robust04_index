			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Catching baddies after they cross borders: Sir Brian Unwin tells Andrew Jack how attitudes among Customs staff have changed in the single market SIR BRIAN UNWIN has just two weeks to switch between two of the most significant public-service jobs in the European Community: from head of UK Customs and Excise during the implementation of the single European market to head of the European Investment Bank. He seems fully prepared for the transition. 'What I do now have is this extraordinary privilege,' he says, sitting in his office overlooking the river Thames. 'Having broken down the borders I now have a chance to go inside them and help make it all work.' Sir Brian, who was at Customs for four years, argues that his greatest challenge was removing the borders for traders as part of the single European market and motivating his staff to back the reforms. His team had to cope with withdrawing 1,600 staff from the frontiers. In place of the old arrangements is a system based around greater intelligence-gathering and the targeting of smugglers. 'There is tremendous tradition and loyalty in Customs,' he says. 'That is a strength, but can also be a weakness. It made it more difficult to move staff away from the baggage benches and convince them that they can still catch baddies without deploying everyone at the frontiers. For centuries they were there with their cutlasses stopping things coming in.' One of his biggest battles was to persuade people within Customs that the removal of border controls would take place. 'It posed a threat to people's jobs and their way of working. There was a tendency four years ago to just wish it away.' 'I said to the staff that it is jolly uncomfortable and extraordinarily difficult, but we have got to face up to it. Unless we plan now, we won't have any control and we will be faced with an imposed solution which will be less in your and the UK's interests.' In general, Sir Brian is pleased with the results to date on the single-market initiative. 'We have delivered the government what it wanted by removing the borders without threatening our security.' He believes the UK played an important role in changing the shape of the single European market, blocking mandatory harmonisation of value added tax throughout the EC and keeping the requirements for paperwork to a minimum. Sir Brian says Customs was used as a model for the government's executive agency reforms, which are now being mirrored by the Inland Revenue. But he sees an important continuing role for central control. 'I've developed our own model with 30 executive units. We have wide executive functions with a central policy role and report to the chancellor.' He believes he has made considerable progress in changing the way Customs operates and lays particular emphasis on promoting equal opportunities - especially the promotion of women, such as Mrs Valerie Strachan, his deputy. She has now taken over his post. 'After working in the Treasury and the Cabinet Office, Customs seemed very male-dominated to me,' he says. 'It still is, but things are starting to change.' He says the main challenge in his new job at the world's biggest international lender will be to consolidate the institution and reflect the new impetus it received at the Edinburgh summit. 'We are under tremendous pressure to increase the volume of lending,' he says. 'But we must also maintain rigorous criteria to sustain quality.'</p>

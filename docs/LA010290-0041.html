			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTLOOK FOR THE '90S;  </P> <P> FOR BUSINESS, THE 1980S WERE A PERIOD OF ENORMOUS TURMOIL. A JAPANESE SIEGE OF  THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY AND AUTO INDUSTRIES, A SURGE AND PLUNGE IN OIL PRICES,  MASSIVE FAILURES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND A FEARSOME STOCK CRASH. THE  1990S DON'T PROMISE MUCH PEACE AND QUIET. HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT BUSINESS FACES  IN THE NEXT DECADE.;  </P> <P> AUTOS  </P> <P> The American auto industry underwent more wrenching change in the 1980s than in  any era since the end of World War II.  </P> <P> The decade began with an energy crunch and an economic slump that left  Detroit's Big Three reeling.  </P> <P> It is ending with the Big Three slipping once more into recession and their  Japanese rivals still setting the pace in the car market. Despite a  multibillion-dollar drive by the domestic industry to catch up, Detroit never  has been able to match Japanese car makers on quality.  </P> <P> And car buyers are increasingly turning their backs on the domestics. In 1980,  Japanese manufacturers held 19.7% of the American car market; today, they have  24.66%, a figure held back by import quotas imposed in 1981.  </P> <P> Now, the Japanese are leapfrogging Detroit to compete head-on with European  firms in the luxury market, and, as a result, sales of pricey West German and  British cars are starting to slide.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Japanese car makers have moved much of their production to the  United States in order to skirt trade restraints. They now have eight assembly  plants in this country and soon will have the capacity to build 2 million cars  and trucks a year here -- roughly the same as Chrysler's North American  production.  </P> <P> To compete, Detroit has been forced to form a complex web of joint ventures  with Japanese and European companies. Ford, for instance, now counts on Mazda  of Japan for its subcompact development, Kia of Korea to assemble its smallest  cars and Ford of Europe to develop its mid-size cars. Meanwhile, it has just  purchased Jaguar to compete with the German luxury car builders.  </P> <P> As the 1990s begin, import restraints remain in place on Japanese cars but now  seem irrelevant because of Japan's U.S. production facilities. The major  Japanese auto makers are not even filling their quota allocations from Japan  because they are selling so many American-built cars.  </P> <P> Throughout the 1990s, look for Japanese car makers to take on an increasingly  American look.

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Arts: Under Their Hats - Theatre In Under Their Hats, a compilation of pieces by Flanders and Swann at the King's Head, Islington, deviser Alan Strachan has been rash enough to include a spoof on the old D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Why does Gilbert and Sullivan still have bite while much of Flanders and Swann is inoffensive? Perhaps because the Victorians were on the attack, even though they knew their targets were in the stalls. Flanders and Swann look on the audience as their accomplices and a cosy conspiracy results. At its worst it includes whimsy. It can patronise the safely non-theatre-going classes ('The Gasman Cometh'). The double bluff of the 'Song of Patriotic Prejudice' bespeaks the true complacency of nationalism by apparently laughing at it. And a certain philistinism is taken for granted in the audience, even in the 'Guide to Britten' despite its neat turns of phrase ('Albert Herring was pickled and cured'). Yet just when you are damning the entertainment as irredeemably middle-class and hopelessly English up pops something extraordinary: a song prompted by the announcement that the result of stockpiling nuclear arms was a total of 'twenty tons of TNT' for every human being in the world. The song is magnificent in its controlled anger and urgency; as scathingly deadpan as anything by Brecht. In Wendy Toye's production two women and four men mix biographical detail with the comedy. There emerges a gentle idealism. This is less apparent in the innocent political mockery of 'There's a hole in my budget' than the ironic self-congratulation of countryside polluters ('The Bedstead Men') and the exhaustingly dedicated modishness of 'Design for Living' ('We're terribly House and Garden'). Above all, there are the animals. The well-loved hippo of 'Mud' and the gnu of course, but more interestingly the wistful, the lonely and the yearning. Susie Blake adds a Chekhovian dimension to her musings on what she might have done if she hadn't been a sloth, hanging upside-down. And I had forgotten the extraordinary, sad surrealism of 'The Armadillo', a fey tragi-comedy worthy of Edward Lear. Of the big set pieces, Stefan Bednarczyk displays extraordinary breath-control in the famous Mozartian 'Ill Wind' ('I bought a French horn . . .'); and in 'Los Olvidados' Moray Watson describes the olive-stuffing festival in terms of the bull-fight with a serious sense of the ridiculous that almost disguises its contempt for the corrida. You realise that quite a lot of satirical edge can be blunted by cheerful humour. Perhaps Flanders and Swann were too nice.</p>

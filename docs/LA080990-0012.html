			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY CALLS FOR CITY MEETING ON OIL  SUPPLY  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, citing the crisis in the Persian Gulf, called  Wednesday for a meeting of top city executives to discuss the possibility of an  oil shortage. Bradley also asked city employees to voluntarily begin sharing  rides or using mass transit to commute to and from work to save fuel.  </P> <P> Preparing for the possibility of an oil shortage in the wake of Iraq's invasion  of Kuwait and the resulting tumult on the international oil market that sent  gas prices skyrocketing, Bradley called for a meeting of the city's Fuel  Allocation Committee. No date was set for the meeting, but Bradley said it  would convene in the next two weeks.  </P> <P> The fuel committee, formed in 1973 and comprised of the city government's top  nine executives, has the power to determine fuel allocations among city  departments "to ensure that no vital city services will be interrupted."  </P></p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Three-handed poker game at the dockyards: Bidding for sales on the waterfront Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, made much of the equipment orders which sweetened his defence cuts last month. In the package of goodies was a highly publicised announcement of up to five new Trafalgar nuclear hunter-killer submarines, costing Pounds 1.5bn. On the same day, confirmation that the Royal dockyards at Rosyth in Fife and Devonport in Plymouth are to be sold off was slipped quietly into a separate statement. In fact, the submarine order and the sale of Devonport are closely connected, and a sweltering summer poker game may develop between VSEL, the maker of submarines; DML, Devonport's operator; and GEC, which is interested in doing both. DML has run Devonport for the Ministry of Defence since 1987. However, while the incumbent management will be a strong contender when the yard is fully privatised, a dozen other companies, including GEC and BAe, have also registered an interest. DML's bid may be the best informed, but there is no guarantee that it will be the highest. Pricing the yard will be difficult because its profitability is low compared with the theoretical value of its assets. A defence-related company turning over around Pounds 260m a year with profits of around Pounds 12m might attract a modest bid of much less than Pounds 100m. Then again, this is a large slice of the waterfront in the centre of the biggest city in the south-west of the UK. And with the MoD being coy about what the dockyard's assets are worth, potential bids could vary widely. If a bidder could find an alternative use for half of the dockyard space - and Plymouth council is keen to free scarce industrial land in the area - another bidder might be able to pay substantially more. DML has one strong card. Last year it won the competition against Rosyth to refit all of the Navy's nuclear submarines. Submarine refits, at more than Pounds 100m a shot, are even more extensive, and expensive, than those for surface warships. Indeed, refits are very much like the original construction of the submarine, with the exception of making the pressure hull. As a result there is a great deal of common ground, and common costs, between the makers of nuclear submarines and the operators of Devonport dockyard. Nuclear submarines are traditionally made by VSEL in Barrow. In a cavernous covered yard there called, coincidentally, the Devonshire Dock Hall, the company has made the Trident missile submarines and the previous batch of Trafalgar hunter-killer boats. VSEL is the natural choice to build the new Trafalgars, which will cost Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m each, but it may not win. GEC-Marconi is also interested in the contract, and is a much bigger company, perhaps better able to carry the heavy risks of being the prime contractor for a Pounds 1.5bn project. For the first time the MoD is asking bidding companies to carry the heavy risks of fixed-price submarine construction. That puts the small but cash-rich VSEL at a disadvantage to the large but cash-rich GEC. VSEL also has an interest in strengthening its competitive position for the Trafalgar bid. Significantly, the MoD wants whoever builds the Trafalgar boats to cover some maintenance costs - up to and including the first refit of the submarines. It also wants whoever buys the dockyards to give guarantees over the cost of refits for at least the first five years after sale. Industry observers think that the conjunction of interests makes VSEL and DML natural partners. If the two could find a way to co-operate, or even merge, they could cut costs from many of the common operations they would need to run, and have greater certainty about the risks and rewards of new build and refitting submarines. Lower costs would allow a combination of DML and VSEL to bid a higher price for Devonport, increasing the chances of success, and mount a lower offer for the Trafalgar build, also improving the odds of beating GEC. But analysts say that fitting the two jigsaw pieces together would not be easy. VSEL is a quoted company, which as a result of the Trident contract, has built up a Pounds 320m cash pile that it wants to invest. DML, by contrast, is a management operation with three corporate shareholders: Brown and Root, the US engineering group, UK pump maker Weir, and BICC, the cables company. Perhaps the easiest way to combine the two would be for VSEL to buy out the existing shareholders, but they may be unwilling to sell. VSEL could bid for Devonport alone, but analysts regard that as risky. A consortium approach may be more likely, but then it may be difficult to gain the full benefits of integrating the two operations. GEC, meanwhile, may have other ideas. It hopes to win the Trafalgar order to bolster its position as a prime contractor to the MoD - a status it jealously covets. However, GEC's Yarrow yard on the Clyde is too small to build the boats. Yet much of the cost of a submarine is in electronics, which is GEC's forte, and it could sub-contract some of the building work to VSEL at Barrow. It is also looking closely at Devonport, though the company's legendary caution and the yard's potential liabilities may be enough to scare GEC away. As initial bids for the yards are due by the autumn, the three-handed poker game may develop rapidly. Any alliances must come soon if the bids are to be prepared in time. But even when the calculations of the defence contractors are complete, the best-laid plans for Devonport could still be overturned if a theme-park bidder wants to turn half of the Plymouth yard into Mr Blobby's World of Fun.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Aintree rejects National criticism AINTREE RACECOURSE officials yesterday rejected criticisms by an inquiry into the false starts at the Grand National in April, but said starting procedures would be changed for next year's race. The world's most popular steeplechase, watched by 50,000 on-course spectators and millions of television viewers worldwide, had to be abandoned after two false starts. The inquiry, headed by Mr Justice Connell, a member of the Jockey Club, horseracing's ruling body, yesterday strongly criticised the 'grey gate' starting system - a tape stretched across the 65-yard width of the course - as outdated and inadequate. It said the Aintree executive and the Jockey Club should have replaced it. Captain Keith Brown, the race starter, was criticised for allowing the horses to line up too close to the tape. Each false start was declared after horses broke the tape and became entangled in it. Failure to recall 30 jockeys who continued to race after the second false start was due to Mr Ken Evans, the recall man stationed down the course, the report said. Although it would be 'unfair and unrealistic' for Mr Evans to carry the sole blame for the affair, he was positioned too near the starting gate and had failed to wave a red flag to signal the false starts, the report said. Mr Charles Barnett, Aintree's managing director, said changes would be introduced after the Jockey Club's inquiry into starting systems reported later this summer. However, he rejected any responsibility for the pro-cedures criticised by the inquiry. The 'grey gate' system was approved by the Jockey Club and had operated successfully in pre-race tests, he said. Mr Barnett said the inquiry's comments on Mr Evans, who was 'under the direct control of the starter', were unfair. There was no evidence to contradict his claim that he raised his recall flag after both false starts. The stewards of the Jockey Club will study the report today before deciding whether to initiate a disciplinary inquiry. The Jockey Club has wide-ranging powers which include imposing fines on both Mr Evans and Aintree racecourse.</p>

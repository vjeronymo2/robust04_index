			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Letter: Procedures set out by social chapter will provide flexibility Sir, The otherwise reliable Joe Rogaly was plain wrong when he described the Maastricht social chapter ('The way out for Major', February 12). The social protocol may say that the 11, excluding Britain, wish to continue down the path laid down by the 1989 social charter, but the agreement which is appended, and from which Britain is also excluded, is merely a procedure which extends qualified majority voting to the area of 'working conditions'. The one-nation veto goes but majorities still have to be laboriously obtained. The agreement contains no specific provisions. However, it also sets out new procedures under which employers and employees can agree to make agreements between themselves without legislation from the EC. This concept of 'social framework agreements' was inserted into the chapter at the specific insistence of European employers in order to get more flexibility in European workplace legislation. In spite of the constant claims that the social chapter would reverse what change there was in industrial relations during the 1980s, the truth is that the social chapter specifically excludes mention of pay, strikes or lock-outs. The increasingly frenetic debate about the social chapter has to be based on facts, not propaganda, If it is it will be seen as a sensible, practical complement to the single European market - and one which will make it fairer and more effective.

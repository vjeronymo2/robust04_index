			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Observer: Mark of faith An extreme case of coals to Newcastle? The Pope was yesterday presented with copies of the gospels by Walter Veltroni, the trendy Italian ex-communist and now editor of what used to be the party's daily organ, L'Unita. The slim volumes are being distributed with the paper both as a promotional exercise and to underline just how post-communist Italy's left has become. Veltroni, now a leading member of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left, is the first PDS member to be received by the Pope. No Pope ever agreed to meet members of the Italian Communist Party. The gospels really do bring good news.</p>

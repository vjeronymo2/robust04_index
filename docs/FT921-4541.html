			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / BBC drops Panorama broadcast on economy THE BBC last night denied that political pressure lay behind a decision to drop at the last moment tonight's planned Panorama television programme on the economy, Raymond Snoddy writes. The programme by Mr Peter Jay, the BBC's economics editor, would have looked at how well the Thatcher economic revolution had survived the recession and the extent to which present difficulties were due to errors by Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor. At the weekend Mr Samir Shah, editor of weekly news and current affairs television, decided that the programme was too backward-looking. Tonight's Panorama will instead look at how the UK can escape from recession. Some elements of Mr Jay's film may be included together with a studio discussion. A BBC spokesman said last night that the unusual decision to drop or change a programme so late in the day was 'absolutely utterly not a political issue'. Some BBC current affairs staff last night questioned the view that an interview with Mr Lawson was too backward-looking when yesterday both the Walden programme on ITV and BBC's On The Record explored the origins of the recession and links with the Lawson era.

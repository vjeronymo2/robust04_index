Office director Peter Greeling said the weapons giant  Armscor  [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] opened the office in Abu  Dhabi last year and it covered the six-nation Gulf Co-operation  Council (GCC) and other countries in the Middle East.    "It is South Africa's first arms office in the world," Mr.  Greeling said. "It will co-ordinate arms sales to the region  and identify opportunities for military co-operation."    The project coincides with plans by GCC states to bolster  their armies following the Gulf War. Military experts said the  six members were expected to spend more than five billion  dollars annually on defence up to the year 2,000.    The United States, France and Britain will probably be the  main beneficiaries of such plans, as they already dominate the  Middle East arms market. However, South Africa participated in  a ground arms show in Abu Dhabi early in 1993 and sent  representatives of more than 30 companies to an international  air show in Dubai late 1993 to exhibit helicopters and other air  defence systems. The main feature in its pavilion was the CSH-2  Rooivalk attack helicopter.    South African officials said that they were negotiating with  some Gulf countries to sell the Rooivalk, one of the most  advanced helicopters in the world. "We are optimistic about  deals," Greeling said. "We are not competitive in some types of  weapons because ours are expensive. But we are competitive in  artillery, which is the best in the world. We also have the  Rooivalk."    The GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait  and the UAE -- lifted the boycott against South Africa two years  ago after sweeping reforms by President F.W. de Klerk to  dismantle "apartheid."</p>

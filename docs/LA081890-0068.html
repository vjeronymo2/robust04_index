			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> IF THIS ISN'T NEPOTISM, WHAT IS?  </P> <P> As a result of the "marriage in management" at the Child Support Division, the  D.A.'s office has initiated a number of special arrangements specifically to  accommodate the Troms.  </P> <P> The plan is to remove the child support ombudsman from the office and put her  in a location completely separated from the child support function.  </P> <P> Also, a newly created classification awaits her (in order to fit in with the  organizational chart that has been renovated).  </P> <P> The dictionary defines "nepotism" as undue favoritism and/or special treatment  shown to a relative.  </P> <P> Is this not special treatment for an individual based on her marriage? Mr. Trom  is the managing attorney-D.A./Child Support, but there is now a child support  employee who is no longer answerable to him. Is this not a change to his  responsibilities required as a result of his marriage?  </P> <P> Finally, the "investigation" by the personnel department was conducted jointly  with the D.A.'s office. As Mr. Bradbury has openly supported the waiver of the  rules for the Troms, how can the study be considered objective?  </P> <P> I prefer to consider the situation for what it is, a special treatment of  certain employees due to their family relationship. In a word, nepotism.  </P> <P> PATRICK C. SQUIRES  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Arts: A living picture of Hinduism - Patricia Morison finds much more than sacred cows at the British Museum Hinduism is not well understood in the west, even though many of its individual features are familiar. One thinks of sacred cows, many-armed dancing gods, Hari Krishna, titillating stories of tantric excesses, TV epics and yogis who stand for years on one leg. The difficulty most people have is fitting these colourful elements into a coherent picture of the everyday religion of modern India. For Deities and Devotion at the British Museum, Richard Blurton, its curator of oriental antiquities, has trawled the Museum's magnificent resources of Hindu art, and borrowed some others - in particular from the scandalously inaccessible hoard in the Victorian and Albert Museum. His aim is simple and admirably achieved: to explain and 'demystify' Hinduism. By the end of this century, Blurton points out, the Indian population will outstrip China's. Since the majority of Indians are Hindus, it behoves us all to form a picture of Hinduism as a living, evolving faith - although the resurgence of intolerant, militant Hindu fundamentalism is rather overlooked. It is a beautiful show; but, more importantly, it sets out examples of Hindu devotional art, ancient and modern, to teach the essentials of the religion. The gallery looks stunning in red and saffron yellow, a remarkable improvement on the BM's customary boring world of grey and white. I particularly liked the calligraphy by Sehmi Satwinder of Alphabet Soups. An exceptionally large quantity of Indian paintings is on view, lit dimly to protect them but brilliantly colourful. In the first section introducing the principal gods, there is a series of miniatures from Rajasthan of around 1800 depicting Vishnu in his ten orthodox incarnations. Here we find battling Rama of the Ramayana epic, playful Krishna, and Buddha, an example of a historical individual subsumed into the pantheon. Few of us would identify the splendid white parade-horse with a parasol attached to his saddle as the last incarnation of Vishnu as horse-headed Kalki, as he is yet to show himself. Cruder images of gods abound from all over India; on comics, palm-leaf books, on the scrolls used by professional story-tellers, and on cheap and cheerful prints sold to pilgrims. The textiles are gorgeous and two in particular. An enormous 17th-century silk cloth made in Assam is cunningly woven with little images and text describing Vishnu's incarnations. Until last year it was in storage at the Museum of Mankind, misclassified as Thibetan. As for a painted cotton hanging from Rajasthan, the BM should have it copied and put into production. On a sky-blue ground five rows of spritely white cows advancing towards each other, three to a side. Their horns and humps are coloured orange in honour of the festival which marks Krishna's erotic encounter with the milkmaids, or gopi. Instead of the gopi, the cows are being urged on by images of a turbanned figure, the 15th-century holy man, Vallabhacharya. His devotion to Krishna helped push him into the first league of gods. At the same time but in a different corner of India, a holy man called Chaitanya founded the Hari Krishna sect whose accolytes now jingle their way along Oxford Street. So one learns from Richard Blurton's helpful and attractively illustrated book, Hindu Art (British Museum Press, Pounds 14.95). Vallabhacharya's followers in Rajasthan have a tradition of making marvellous temple hangings like the cow-cloth, because they believe Krishna must live as elegantly and comfortably as possible. Their personal aim is 'to live as full a material life as possible', making this one Indian sect FT readers might like to explore further. By the end of Deities and Devotions, we have learned a lot. We have been introduced to some dozen gods, from amiable elephant-headed Ganesh to Kali the Destroyer and Jagganatha of Puri, whose festival car gave us the word juggernaut. Photographs and exhibits have evoked pilgrimages, rural religion, temple architecture, the rituals of worship, and Hinduism today. Crucially, we have learned about the concept of darshan, the supreme moment of devotion when the Hindu believer makes eye-contact with the image of the god enshrined in the inner sanctum of the temple. Darshan is represented in the centre of the exhibition, in the adoring gaze fixed by a statue of Nandi, Shiva's patiently waiting bull-mount, on his master. Shiva is here represented by an extremely fine 15th-century statue of him as teacher, but by this point we have understood something of the many faces and paradoxes of Shiva. He is both auspicious and inauspicious, male and female, represented as linga and yoni, which is to say phallus and vulva, the god of ecstasy and of transcendance. In this statue, his face is benign, and under his foot he treads the dwarf who symbolises Ignorance. It was such an image which Diderot misunderstood to show a god who tore apart young children. This exhibition stands in an honourable tradition of dispelling ignorance and bringing Indian religion to a wider public. Until April 19, sponsored by Bajaj Auto, Birla Technical Services and Mukand.</p>

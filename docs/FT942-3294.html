			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Severn Trent held to 4% rise Delays on international contracts held back the profits advance at Severn Trent as the group announced a 4 per cent increase to Pounds 281.4m at the pre-tax level for the year to March 31. Sales were 10 per cent higher at Pounds 998m. The results were at the lower end of expectations, and the shares moved up just 1p to close at 527p. The proposed final dividend is raised by 7.8 per cent to 15.2p, for a similar increase in the total to 22.75p. This compared with forecasts of an 8.5 per cent rise. Earnings were 4 per cent up at 72.7p. Mr Roderick Paul, chief executive, said Severn had taken action to cut costs following the Pounds 4.7m operating loss incurred by the international division last year. The loss had been largely because of delays on two contracts, in Mexico and New York, the subsequent restructuring charges, and the costs of marketing the international business. Marketing had been cut back, costs reduced and the division was now operating profitably, he said. Mr Paul was more upbeat about Biffa, the waste management arm. It had lifted operating profits by 18 per cent to Pounds 14.2m on sales 16 per cent higher at Pounds 120.6m in a difficult market. The return reflected the 'stringent control of operating costs and strength of our sales and marketing initiatives,' Mr Paul said. Biffa's ability to improve margins in its landfill business had been because of a changing mix of waste, rather than any underlying improvement in prices, he said. However, prices were beginning to show tentative signs of recovery. The division is believed to have incurred losses of Pounds 11m after interest, because of onerous financing arrangements at the time of the acquisition. Profits growth in the core utility business was held back by a 7.8 per cent decline in usage by the top 1,500 industrial users. The rate of decline had begun to slow, Mr Paul said. Operating profits in the water and sewerage business rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 324.6m, on sales 6 per cent ahead to Pounds 787.5m. Severn said costs in the water business had risen by 3.6 per cent. The workforce had been reduced by about 6 per cent, bringing the number of jobs cut in two years to 889. Severn was continuing to examine opportunities for cost-cutting although it refused to give details. Capital expenditure was some Pounds 25m less than budgeted at Pounds 445m (Pounds 550m). Net debt rose by Pounds 153.4m to Pounds 575.8m, representing 27 per cent of shareholders' funds.</p>

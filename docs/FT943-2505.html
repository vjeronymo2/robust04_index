			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Jaw-jaw in Ulster The prime ministers of Britain and Ireland are displaying remarkable political skill in their efforts to bring peace to Northern Ireland. On Friday Mr John Major undertook that any new arrangement for the governance of Ulster will be put before a referendum. Yesterday Mr Albert Reynolds said that there would be no united Ireland for at least 20 years, and that even then the matter would be determined by popular vote. Both statements are implicit in the joint declaration issued by the two heads of government last December. The essence of that statement was that future constitutional changes on the island of Ireland were to be based on the principle of self-determination, exercised north and south. Mr Reynolds has since re-iterated this several times, in a number of different ways. So has Mr Major. Yet such is the depth of suspicion in Irish affairs that it may have to be repeatedly repackaged and reiterated over the coming months. The theory is that, in time, the constant deployment of this basic democratic principle will persuade unionists that while they command majority support they can safeguard their province, and nationalists that if they can persuade enough Ulster voters to trust them they can realise their own dream. If this is an Anglo-Irish conspiracy, its purpose is to convert 25 years of debate by terrorism into peaceful politicking. Yet it would be a mistake to confuse the wish with its fulfilment. The IRA has announced a ceasefire, but it resists blandishments to declare it permanent. Mr Major has rightly lifted the ban on the broadcast of terrorists' voices, but has not been repaid with a pledge that Armalites will never again be used. The 'loyalist' murder gangs have not yet accepted the armistice. Both sides retain their arms. The IRA continues to demand the release of convicted killers it terms political prisoners. In these circumstances it is a pity that President Bill Clinton is fighting difficult mid-term Congressional elections. Looking to the Irish-American electorate, he is expected to grant a second visa to the president of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams. It will come as no surprise if - when - Mr Clinton or another senior US figure greets the leader of the political wing of the IRA. The excuse offered in Dublin and Washington will be that this will bind the IRA/Sinn Fein into the peace process. Mr Major, and the rest of us, can only hope that that judgment is right.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] The Venezuelan Government will send aid to Colombia,  where an avalanche razed eight towns in that country's southeast  on 6 June.    There is no decision yet on what to do with 35 Venezuelan  families affected by the storm Bret and who are staying at Fort  Tiuna, but the Venezuelan Government has already decided to send  aid to the victims of the tremor in Colombia. Foreign Minister  Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas has announced our country will assist  with 100 prefabricated houses for the families who lost their  homes.    [Begin Burelli recording] Armed Forces airplanes will be  going. Helicopters may also go to see how we can help.  Contributions in this case do not involve medicine, blankets,  and medical teams composed of doctors and nurses, as is usually  the case. What is needed now is the reestablishment of  communications, electricity, and housing for those who have been  left completely destitute. [end recording]    Burelli has also said no Haitians are coming to Venezuela.  He has said reports on the arrival of 120 people from Haiti are  the product of a lively imagination.    Evidently contradicting what was said last week following a  meeting with Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy secretary of State, the  foreign minister has now said the number of undesirable  immigrants, who are causing problems in the country and  intensifying the social and economic drama Venezuelans are  enduring, will not increase.    [Begin Burelli recording] This is the government's position.  I do not know the origin of the report on a certain group of  Haitians and their plight; this has never existed. We very much  want to help Haiti, and we help it at international forums. We  have a historical commitment. Recall that Simon Bolivar was  able to successfully and definitively return to Venezuela to  produce its independence thanks to help provided by Haitian  General Alexander Petion. Anything else is false. [end  recording]    In conclusion, the minister has announced that on occasion  of  the Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on  13 June the Group of Three [Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela] will  sign a free trade agreement that will count on the participation  of businessmen from the three countries to give practical  significance to the integration system.</p>

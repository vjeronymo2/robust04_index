			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost Intercare to Pounds 3.6m INTERCARE GROUP, the rapidly-expanding healthcare products supplier, more than doubled its pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 3.6m in the year to October 31. Sales rose from Pounds 14.9m to Pounds 29.1m, boosted by contributions from the group's two most significant recent acquisitions. SAFA, which distributes occupational health products to corporate customers, was in for seven months, and Birmingham Optical, which supplies equipment to opticians, made a six-month contribution. The acquisitions were funded by a Pounds 5.5m placing and offer last March. Mr Peter Cowan, chairman, said a pleasing aspect of the results was that profitability of businesses owned for a full year had grown organically by about 25 per cent. The group has created a new division which comprises Booster, which makes electric vehicles for the elderly and disabled, and Montis, its distributor in the Netherlands. This mobility division saw trading profits grow from Pounds 591,000 to Pounds 1.9m on sales up from Pounds 2.86m to Pounds 8.69m. The optical division increased trading profits from Pounds 240,000 to Pounds 891,000 on sales up from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 6.9m. Mr Cowan said the purchase of Birmingham, a distributor of clinical instrumentation and lenses to retail opticians, had complemented the original optical business. The medical products distribution division, which includes A-Z Dental Holdings, increased trading profits to Pounds 825,000 (Pounds 690,000) on sales of Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 9.6m). Dental's pre-tax profit was Pounds 252,000 (Pounds 372,000) on sales of Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 4m). Gearing is under 6 per cent. Mr Cowan said he expected to be able to maintain organic growth in excess of 20 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 9.5p (7.5p). A final dividend of 2p gives a total 2.6p (2p), an increase of 30 per cent.</p>

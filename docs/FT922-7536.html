			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / International Company News: France to control key Total decisions after sell-off THE French government intends to retain control of key strategic decisions affecting Total, the French oil group, in spite of plans to reduce its direct financial stake in the company to 5 per cent. Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister, claimed that the run-down in the state's share of Total, which currently stands at nearly 32 per cent, would facilitate its relations with other foreign companies. However, the Finance Ministry made it clear that the government would continue to exercise the right to appoint the chairman of Total, though Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy over the weekend expressed continuing confidence in Mr Serge Tchurk, the current chairman. The government's determination to maintain its influence over Total was further underlined yesterday, when it announced the appointment of four new state representatives to serve on the Total board. Mr Strauss-Kahn said that Total would continue to need government authorisation for international agreements, thus somewhat undermining his claim that Total would in future have greater freedom.</p>

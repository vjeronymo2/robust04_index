			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT IF THE WORLD CALLED 'LEADER' AND NOBODY STOOD UP?  </P> <P> A geopolitical order emerges very different from the one we have known since  World War II, not only in its actors but in its character.  </P> <P> Of the three dominant industrial powers today, two, Germany and Japan, make no  effort to translate this power into any other form of influence than the  financial and commercial.  </P> <P> The third power, the United States, is the only one of the three to think of  itself in classic geopolitical terms and to assume a responsibility for what  international society should become. It possesses great military power, which  it cannot now really afford to employ, given the national choices it has made  with respect to budget and taxes. It is in crucial respects dependent on its  Japanese and European creditors, which have proved reluctant to finance the  American deployment in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> A period thus has begun where one country professes a global vision and global  responsibilities, yet depends financially upon others who do not.  </P> <P> The debate between Japan, Germany and the United States reflects contradictory  assumptions. The United States says to them: You need an orderly world in order  to prosper. You must either police the world yourselves or finance our policing  it.  </P> <P> Their reply, as yet unspoken, but clear enough, says (to take the current  example) that it makes little difference to them who owns the oil wells of the  Arabian Peninsula, since whoever does will still need to sell as much oil as  possible at as high a price as possible.  </P> <P> Americans ask: But what about the principle of nonaggression? What about making  the world a just and orderly place? The answer implicit in Germany's and  Japan's actions is that, while they will cooperate in whatever the world  community may collectively choose to do, disorder does not greatly concern them  so long as it is confined to the Middle East or Africa or Southeast Asia. Or,  to put it less harshly, that they do not consider themselves capable of  imposing international order nor entitled to do so. Let Arabs, Africans,  Israelis and Asians be responsible for their own affairs.  </P> <P> There are many Americans for whom this logic is appealing. They ask if it is  logical for the United States to conduct a global policy meant to keep order in  the common interest when to do so engenders hostility toward the United States  and produces little credit.  </P> <P> The conclusion logically drawn from what these Americans argue, and from the  nature of Germany's and Japan's employment of power and their perception of  international obligation, is that we may soon find ourselves with no nation  really prepared to assume global responsibilities, or at least to do so  unilaterally.  </P> <P> With Russia gone from the arena, will this produce a better, or worse, world  than we have known since the 1940s? The conventional wisdom says worse. I am  inclined to say better. Of course, that is not saying much.  </P></p>

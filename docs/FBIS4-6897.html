			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala lumpur, April 25 KYODO -- Malaysian  International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said  Monday [25 April] she sees no changes in her country's ties with  Japan under new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, whom she described  as "well apprised" of global trade matters.    "We've established very good relations with Japan. If there  are any changes, it should be for the better," she said.    Hata, foreign minister under Morihiro Hosokawa, was elected  Monday by the Diet to succeed Hosokawa, who announced April 8 he  was quitting over his personal financial dealings.    Rafidah said she has met Hata several times, most recently  at  this month's signing of the Uruguay Round world trade pact in  Marrakech, Morocco, where "I remember teasing him about being  the next prime minister."    She said she felt Hata is fully aware of the ramifications  of  the Uruguay Round's policies to Free World trade and all other  elements of international trading matters.    Asked if she hopes Hata will back the idea of an East Asia  Economic Caucus (EAEC), proposed by Malaysian Prime Minister  Mahathir Mohamed, Rafidah said he should not be "burdened" with  the issue so soon in his term of office.    But she expressed confidence the EAEC will be seen  "favorably" in Japan if it is recognized as a loose,  consultative forum to enhance regional economic cooperation.    The six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN), which includes Malaysia, is anxious to get Japan, as  East Asia's economic powerhouse, into the EAEC.    But Japan and such other potential members as South Korea  are  noncommittal in the face of a cool response from the United  States, which would be excluded and which views the EAEC as a  trade bloc.</p>

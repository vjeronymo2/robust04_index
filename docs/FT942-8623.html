			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Oppenheim ahead 15% for year Sal. Oppenheim, Germany's largest private banking house, will increase its dividend by DM3 to DM15 after announcing profits up 15 per cent in 1993. Profits rose from DM39m to DM45m (Dollars 26.9m) last year, after the bank's concentration on corporate finance, asset management and financial engineering. Total business volume rose by 17 per cent to DM10.3bn and credit volume rose from DM5.6bn to DM5.8bn. All sectors of the bank recorded growth, but it was consolidating its interests in banking stakes acquired last year. These include MeesPierson bank in the Netherlands and Bank Oppenheim Pierson in Switzerland. The bank has not been directly affected by the collapse of the property empire of Mr Jurgen Schneider. However, a consortium including Rheinboden Hypothekenbank, in which Oppenheim holds a 51 per cent stake, had lent Mr Schneider DM125m. Axel Springer, the media group, is to pay a DM12 dividend. The company, which publishes the daily newspapers Bild and Die Welt, reported a rise in group net profits from DM57m to DM71m last year.</p>

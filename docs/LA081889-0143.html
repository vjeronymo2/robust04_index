			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CINEPLEX WARNS OF $39-MILLION LOAN DEFAULT  </P> <P> Cineplex Odeon Corp., the Canadian movie theater chain that has been placed on  the auction block by its two largest shareholder groups, said it could find  itself in default on a $39-million bank loan and face accelerated payment of  all of its long-term debt if its two top officers cease to be actively involved  in the company's management.  </P> <P> As of June 30, the company's long-term debt still exceeded $552 million,  despite the recent sale of some major assets.  </P> <P> The disclosure, made in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission, is provocative because Cineplex's controversial chairman and chief  executive, Garth H. Drabinsky, and his vice-chairman, Myron Gottlieb, have a  "golden handshake" deal that could be triggered as early as Sept. 30.  </P> <P> Drabinsky and Gottlieb have been trying to raise money to make a bid for the  Toronto-based company, but no offer has yet materialized. Other potential  buyers are scrutinizing the company, and some have indicated interest in  bidding for certain assets, which include more than 1,200 movie screens in the  United States and more than 500 in Canada.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Power Struggle  </P> <P> Although Drabinsky helped found Cineplex 10 years ago and has always been its  driving force, he never held a controlling stake. Four months ago, the Cineplex  chairman tried to seize control by cutting a deal to buy the Cineplex holdings  of Canada's wealthy Charles R. Bronfman clan. But the company's largest  shareholder, entertainment conglomerate MCA Inc., objected vehemently and put  down the attempted coup.  </P> <P> Since then, the Bronfmans and MCA -- which together own about 65% of Cineplex's  equity -- have banded together to put the company up for sale and have paved  the way to fire Drabinsky and Gottlieb if they so choose.  </P> <P> The two Cineplex executives have accepted new employment contracts of  "indefinite" duration that can be terminated by either the individual or the  company on 15 days' notice after Sept. 30. In a so-called golden handshake, the  company has agreed to pay each man $8 million in Canadian currency, or $6.77  million apiece in U.S. dollars.  </P> <P> The Bronfmans and MCA have also forced Drabinsky to share the office of the  chairman with two of their representatives and have changed some financial  reporting practices.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the company released its financial results for the second  quarter, reporting a $39-million loss on revenue of $149 million (U.S.).  </P> <P> Cineplex stock closed Thursday at $11.875 a share, down 62.5 cents, on a volume  of 303,600 shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P></p>

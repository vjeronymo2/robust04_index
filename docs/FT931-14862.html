			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Buoyant Microsoft advances to Dollars 236m MICROSOFT, the leading publisher of personal computer software, posted a 34.9 per cent improvement in second-quarter net income to Dollars 236m, or 78 cents, on revenues which jumped 37.5 per cent to Dollars 938m. Mr Frank Gaudette, chief financial officer, said record sales of the Windows operating system contributed to the results. 'Applications sales for the Apple Macintosh and for the Windows operating system were at record levels,' he said. A year earlier, Microsoft had net income of Dollars 175m, or 60 cents, on revenues of Dollars 682m. For the first six months, Microsoft had net income of Dollars 445m, or Dollars 1.48, on revenues of Dollars 1.76bn, against net earnings of Dollars 319m, or Dollars 1.10, on revenues of Dollars 1.26bn. Microsoft has restated last year's earnings per share to reflect a three-for-one stock split in June 1992. Apple Computer, the US personal computer manufacturer, yesterday unveiled a 2.3 per cent decline in first-quarter net income to Dollars 161.3m, or Dollars 1.33 a share, but sales, reflecting strong demand, hit record levels of Dollars 2bn. The company had steered analysts towards lowering their 1993 estimates, and the results were roughly in line with average expectations of earnings at Dollars 1.32 a share. A year earlier, Apple had net income of Dollars 166m, or Dollars 1.36 a share. Revenues rose 7.5 per cent to Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.86bn. Sales volume of Apple's Macintosh personal computers rose 31 per cent in the quarter. Apple said its gross margin fell to 40.3 per cent of net sales in the three months, compared with 43.7 per cent in the same period of the previous year. Mr John Sculley, chairman and chief executive, attributed the decline to new product introductions and pricing actions taken on older products in response to industry conditions.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / How to misuse the price mechanism A luggage trolley is one of the most useful of innovations, and, like many such, did not require sophisticated science and technology, but merely someone to think of the idea. It enables the feeblest person to transport his or her luggage without being fleeced by the red-coated 'privatised' porter services to be found, for instance, at Heathrow Airport. Alas, rarely has a good idea been put into effect for long when someone sets about spoiling it; and the bad example is copied. Imagine my chagrin when I arrived at Brussels airport a few years ago to find that a coin was required to release a trolley. Although I had small denomination Belgian notes, I did not have the coin required. The banks and newsagents were closed; and none of my fellow passengers was able or willing to provide change. Since then the habit has spread to other airports and to railway stations. The idea seems to be to find a new deterrent to cross-border travel now that customs barriers are coming down. It never seems to dawn on the clever idiots who installed the system that banks normally supply foreign exchange in notes; and not even flight attendants carry loose change. Yet a further horror has been invented which I first discovered at Zurich railway station. This is to make the traveller pay a somewhat larger sum - two Swiss francs as far as I remember - but to return the coins when the trolley is finally deposited at the curb or on the platform. It is extremely difficult to discover how to make the extraction, and I am usually more concerned to secure my taxi than make the effort. Similar devices have apparently been installed in some supermarkets. The trolley charging systems look at first sight like an application of the price mechanism, but on closer inspection turn out to be a misapplication to the point of caricature. Other things being equal, the price of a trolley should roughly correspond to the extra ('marginal') cost to the airport or railway of providing this service, for an appropriate charge helps in the allocation of resources. With the right pricing policy, there is an incentive for the airport or station to make available the appropriate number of trolleys - not too many or too few - and for the passenger to use them only if the advantage outweighs the cost. The snag in the above argument is that the gains in welfare from the use of the price mechanism are heavily outweighed by the discomfort and inconvenience. If you want to be pompous you can talk about the disutility of striving too earnestly to maximise utility. There are many other examples where separate charging is not worth the bother. Hotels do not charge separately for light, heating, water, room-cleaning, and so on. The transport authorities are simply trying to recover their costs. In that case would it not be simpler to add a small sum to the airport or station charge, which would be incorporated in the fare? The disincentive effect of the charge (as distinct from the nuisance cost of finding the coin) on the number of passengers using trollies, must be vanishingly small. So there would be almost no effect on the allocation of resources. As for the fear of stolen trolleys, this is farcical for airports. A trolley cannot be put in a waiting car or taxi without anyone noticing. Even at railway stations most illicitly taken trollies go to nearby hotels - whence they would be brought back by departing passengers for the same reasons of convenience, if the rail authorities did not criminalise the activity. The main reason why the issue is one of public policy is that airports and mainline rail terminals have a local monopoly, whether privatised or not. Supermarkets, where the danger of theft is less risible, can be left to make their own decisions, although even here bodies such as the Consumers' Association need to ventilate the issue, and make sure that customers are fully informed of where shopping remains easy. But where monopoly applies, the regulatory body needs to say: 'No, No, No.'</p>

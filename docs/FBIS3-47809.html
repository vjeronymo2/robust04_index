They allege that the spectrum analyzer which a trading firm  in Yokohama exported to the DPRK through a third country may be  used for the development of a ballistic missile.    The Japan Defence Agency expressed "deep concern" over the  case and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department made a fuss,  probing into "suspected" trading firms and manufacturers of  telecommunication devices.    The socalled "export of a spectrum analyzer" is an utterly  groundless fabrication against the DPRK.    It is impossible that the spectrum analyzer, which is used  for the development of television and other telecommunication  apparatus, was exported to the DPRK through a third country.  Still more preposterous is the argument that the DPRK may use  the device for the development of a ballistic missile.    The case faked up by the Japanese reactionaries is a product  of their chronic habit of fabricating every possible case to  slander the DPRK. It is a revised version and extension of the  rumour about "hi-tech leakage" they had spread some time ago.    They had spread the rumour that their technology had been  used for the "development of nuclear weapons" in the DPRK. As  it turned out to be a false rumour, they have concocted the case  of "export of a spectrum analyzer" this time.    Judging from the fact that the Japanese authorities  fabricate  such rumours and cases one after another, it is easy to guess  that they in actuality do not intend to establish  good-neighbourly relations with the DPRK, but, on the contrary,  are intensifying the anti-DPRK campaign, although they call for  "resumption of DPRK-Japan talks".    By inventing the case of "export of a spectrum analyzer,"  they foolishly seek to impair the image of the peace-loving  DPRK and put "sanctions" and pressure on it through "an  international cooperation system."    Unbiased public opinion is angered at the false case because  lurking behind it is a criminal intention to step up their  military power buildup under a faked pretext, stage a comeback  to Korea and, further, bring Asia under control.    The Japanese authorities must look straight at the trend of  the times and immediately stop their futile anti-DPRK campaign.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Hammud Bin-Hilal al-Habasi, undersecretary </F> for economic affairs, by Husayn 'Abd-al-Ghani, in Muscat, date  not given: "Finance Official Discusses 1994 Budget"]    [Text] The Sultanate of Oman has confirmed that despite the  current drop in both oil prices and oil revenue, the general  expenditure in the 1994 budget (2.033 billion rials [RO]) has  been reduced by only 5 percent.    Hammud Bin-Hilal al-Habasi, undersecretary for economic  affairs in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs  [ministry name as published], said that this reduction will lead  to neither a recession nor a slowdown of economic growth.    The Omani official told AL-HAYAH that despite the fall of  oil  prices, the estimated budget deficit in 1994 will be 20 percent  less than that of the previous year.    Gulf banking sources stated that Oman asked four banks in  the  Gulf region, the West, and Japan to provide her with a new loan  in the amount of $300 million. However, al-Habasi argues that  the $2.6 billion of foreign debt that existed at the beginning  of the present five-year plan will be the same at the end of the  plan period in 1995, resulting in a zero figure of Omani net  borrowing from abroad.    The undersecretary in the Omani Ministry of Finance and  Economic Affairs indicated that Oman was undertaking procedures  such as reviewing and modernizing investment laws as well as  establishing a comprehensive legal and institutional framework  for commercial, investment, and financial activities that are in  accordance with the free economy policy and market mechanism.    Following are details of the interview:    ['Abd-al-Ghani] What is the size of the current year's  budget  reduction compared to both last year's reduction and that  estimated and included in the fourth five-year plan?    [Al-Habasi] There is no reduction with regards to the gross  general revenue which has been estimated in the 1994 budget at  about RO1732.1 million representing a 2-percent increase over  the 1993 figure of about RO1698.5 million in the endorsed  budget. This increase is mainly due to the estimated increase in  the natural gas revenue and in other current revenues.    As for the figure for the general revenue for the current  year as it appears in the five-year plan, it has been estimated  at RO1.780 billion representing an increase of about RO48  million over the estimate of the current budget. This slight  increase in the general revenue is due to the fact that oil  revenue for 1994 had been estimated at RO1.364 billion in the  fourth five-year plan. However, due to the drop in oil prices,  this revenue had been estimated at RO1.311 billion in the 1994  budget.    Total general expenditure in the 1994 budget has been  estimated at RO2.033 billion compared to RO2138.5 million in the  1993 budget with a decrease of about 5 percent. Meanwhile, the  estimated figure for total general expenditure in the 1994  budget is more than the RO1.958 billion figure estimated for  1994 in the fourth five-year plan.    It is thus clear that estimates for general expenditure  tally  with the government directives to reach a balance and narrow the  gap between revenue and expenditure.    It is also worth mentioning that decree number 1/94 issued  by  the Sultan to endorse the budget indicated that it was possible  to review some expenditure items in case the net oil revenue  dropped below average estimated prices due to the drop in world  oil prices because of the current delicate and complicated world  economic conditions.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] What is the size of reduction in both the  current general expenditure and the investment expenditure in  the new budget?    [Al-Habasi] The general current expenditure is estimated in  this year's budget at about RO1.5859 billion compared to 1.6175  billion in the 1993 budget. As for the investment expenditure,  it is estimated in the current budget at about RO431.6 million  compared to about RO495.8 million in the 1993 budget.    As I indicated in my previous response, the reduction in the  size of the general expenditure came as a result of the drop in  world oil prices and the impact of that on revenues and  consequently on the size of general expenditure and the current  deficit.    It is worth noting that the current budget is geared to  serve  development and provide the necessary allotments for new  projects that are expected to be executed during the current  year. Therefore, the reduction decided upon for investment  expenditure will not greatly impact the previously endorsed  figure of RO448 million for investment expenditure programs for  1994 in the five-year plan. This is because allotments endorsed  for the programs seem quite similar to the figures, which have  been previously quoted, of the current budget.    Therefore, though oil prices have affected the current  budget, it remains balanced, financially sound, and able to  preserve the good developmental achievements that were executed  in the Sultanate.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] What is the anticipated 1994 budget deficit  and the "actual deficit" in the budget of 1993, the year when  the current drop in oil prices occurred?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] The deficit estimated in the 1994 budget  amounts to RO300.9 million compared to RO375 million in the 1993  budget and represents a 20-percent reduction. Therefore,  particularly in light of the current drop in oil prices in world  markets, it seems that this reduction is sound and in harmony  with the policies and procedures applied by the government in  order to tackle the deficit problem.    The "actual" 1993 budget deficit will be determined later on  following the preparation and endorsement of the 1993 final  accounts.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Which measures would be used to tackle the  deficit in the new budget? Will those measures involve more  withdrawal from the state's general reserves, or would there be  recourse to domestic and foreign borrowing?    [Al-Habasi] As I have previously mentioned, the current  budget deficit is about RO300.9 million. Measures to finance it  include resorting to state funds worth RO221 million and to RO48  million as receipts of government development bonds, in addition  to acquiring RO31.9 million in the form of net borrowing and aid.    A positive indicator is the fact that the figure for  estimates of withdrawals from state bonds has been cut down from  about RO292 millions in the 1993 budget to about 221 million in  that of the current year.    It is also worth mentioning that the resort to government  devlopment bonds and foreign borrowing were financing measures  mentioned in the fourth five-year plan. These measures are being  used in accordance with the relevant endorsed regulations.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Some people believe that, due to the drop in  oil revenues, the government should review its decision not to  increase foreign borrowing above the average reached during the  current plan of $2.6 billion. Will the Sultanate accordingly  arrange for foreign loans from either friendly countries or  world banks as happened following the 1986 oil crisis?    [Al-Habasi] I would like to indicate that the decision you  refer to in your question was included in the fourth five-year  plan, which stipulated that the size of the general foreign  borrowing should remain fixed at the figure it had reached at  the end of the third five-year plan: i.e., about RO1 billion.    This means that it is possible to arrange for new foreign  borrowing during the plan years. In fact, the planned borrowing  during the fourth five-year plan period would be equal to the  amount of loans paid back during the same period; the general  foreign debt would be thus the same at the end of the plan  period as it was at its beginning, i.e., the "net" foreign  borrowing would be zero. This scenario is the one currently  applied.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Procedures to cut down general expenditure  included cutting down recurrent expenses, freezing or abolishing  annual salary raises and professional allowances, and having new  regulations for travel tickets, as well as for housing for those  coming from abroad to be employed by the state. How much savings  would these procedures yield in the budget? Besides, do the  benefits accruing from these procedures outweigh the expected  risks that they may cause, such as slowing down of economic  growth and slump in some economic sectors, particularly those  with an active private sector?    [Al-Habasi] First of all, let me correct some inaccurate  information that is included in the question. First: Annual  raises have not been frozen or abolished; they continue to be  paid and the current budget includes the extra funds necessary  to pay periodic raises to employees of ministries and all  government units. Second: Professional allowances have not been  frozen or abolished, they have simply been reduced by 50  percent. As you know, this is not an allowance for all  government employees, but is only granted to some of them  according to either the nature of their jobs or to special  circumstances that were valid during the last few years and no  longer exist.    As for the procedures that were mentioned and that have been  resorted to in the framework of the comprehensive tackling of  the financial conditions, they aim not only at reducing  expenditures but primarily at rationalizing spending, cutting  down on administrative expenses and providing elasticity in  applying the benefits that are given to those coming from abroad  to work for the government. I would like to seize this  opportunity to affirm the following:    First: There has been no change in basic salaries and  periodic raises that were given to government employees as  acquired rights.    Second: We have rationalized spending and provided  elasticity  in applying the benefits granted to those coming from abroad to  work for the government. However, those benefits should be well  used in such a way that would allow those using them to choose  the housing and travel fit for them. It should also be noted  that these new procedures will save the government some expenses  and lessen its responsibilities and administrative work; they  will also enable it to control expenditure and waste.    Third: The reduction in government spending will not create  any noticeable recession trends that could impact the economy as  a whole and the private sector in particular.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] It has become crucial to harmonize--on the  one hand--between national laws such as those concerned with  work and workers, investment, trials and commercial arbitration  and--on the other hand--international codes and conventions.  With regards to this issue, is the Sultanate ready to revise  some current laws in order to make them more compatible with  world codes and directives that are encompassed in the framework  of the new world economic order?    [Al-Habasi] In view of severe economic international  competition, the Sultanate Government, since the onset of the  blessed renaissance of 1970, realized the necessity of adopting  the free economy system. It therefore provided the legal and  institutional framework for encouraging and facilitating both  the private sector activities and domestic and foreign  investment. Subsequently, besides issuing commercial,  investment, customs, financial, and monetary laws, the Sultanate  issued laws dealing with work and workers, immigration and  visas, as well as commercial disputes, etc.    In order to give a push to development and progress in the  Sultanate, as well as to confront the novelties and changes in  the world economy, the concerned authorities are currently  working towards reviewing, modernizing, and developing many of  the laws and legislation that are currently being applied. This  procedure aims at establishing a comprehensive legal and  institutional framework for commercial, investment, and  financial agencies and activities that would be compatible with  the Sultanate's directive of adopting the free economy system,  which relies on both the market mechanism and free competition  and which has become the main concept of the new world economic  order.</p>

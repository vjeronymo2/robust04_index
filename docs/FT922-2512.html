			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Italian bank acts to curb liquidity THE Bank of Italy squeezed the financial markets further yesterday by raising the rate for repurchase agreements with the banks to 14.21 per cent. In the two weeks since Danish voters rejected the Maastricht Treaty in a referendum, the Italian authorities have been obliged to make a series of selective upward adjustments to interest rates and intervene to bolster the lira. Rates on repurchase agreements, instruments of short term liquidity, have risen by nearly two percentage points. Yesterday the lira was being traded at 756.8 to the D-Mark only marginally down from Monday's record 757.1. Nevertheless, the lira continued to be under pressure. Economists predicted it would remain weak so long as Italy continued be without both a government and credible measures to curb the public sector deficit. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro is now in his second week of consultations with political leaders on choosing a new prime minister to form a government. Every formula so far tested has encountered serious obstacles Nevertheless, Mr Scalfaro has said he wants a speedy solution. There were suggestions yesterday he might opt for a 'new generation' Christian Democrat on the understanding that he looked for a support base broader than the outgoing coalition with the Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals.</p>

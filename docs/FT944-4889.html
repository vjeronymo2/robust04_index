			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Retailers under pressure Retailing shares came under pressure as the market remained nervous about trading prospects in the Christmas period. Also, UBS was said to have turned negative on the sector. This is traditionally the most lucrative time for most retailers, but nerves have set in recently about whether sales will match original forecasts. For clothes retailers, the warm weather of late has left many of the winter lines unsold. Worries over the prospect of higher interest rates were another factor that cast a shadow over the sector. Burton Group dipped 1 3/4 to 66 1/4 p, Kingfisher gave up 6 at 448p, Marks and Spencer softened 2 to 392p and Great Universal Stores, which reports interim figures on Thursday, declined 11 to 535p. However, trading was not all one way in the sector and bargain hunters helped Boots firm 1 1/2 to 489p. Hopes that the long awaited Office of Fair Trading investigation into warranties will not be as severe as originally expected helped Dixons harden a penny to 181p.</p>

An Iranian diplomat serving in Khartoum and two Lebanese  were  arrested and held until the end of an Islamic conference, during  which they planned to kill 'Arafat, the leftist opposition  weekly said, without citing its sources. The three were later  expelled.    Al-Ahali said they were found in possession of pistols with  silencers and poisoned knives.    Khartoum was tipped off about the plot by non-Sudanese  sources.    The paper also said most of the 1,900 Egyptians who  volunteered to fight against the Soviet occupation of  Afghanistan in the 1980s were currently in Yemen and Sudan.    The Egyptian Government holds the veterans of the Afghan  conflict responsible for fomenting fundamentalist unrest in  Egypt, in which more than 300 people have died since the violent  anti-government campaign started in March 1992.</p>

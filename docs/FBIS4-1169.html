			<p>BFN     [Text] The Government of Tanzania has again stressed its  intention to continue seeking ways to bring about peace in  Rwanda in order to save the lives of Rwandans. This was  expressed by the minister of foreign affairs, Joseph Rwegasira,  at a news conference regarding the peace talks which were  scheduled to take place in Arusha today.    Rwegasira said the delegation of the Rwandan Patriotic  Front,  RPF, led by its secretary general, Theogene Rudasingwa, vowed to  stop fighting in Rwanda tomorrow and he stressed the need for  all sides involved in the conflict to implement the Arusha peace  agreement.    However, Rwegasira, on behalf of the prime minister and  first  vice president, John Malecela, who is the chairman of the  current talks, said even if the delegation of the Rwandan  Government failed to arrive either today or tomorrow, the  government [of Tanzania] would use diplomatic channels to  communicate with that side to restore peace in Rwanda through a  cease-fire.    The UN secretary general, Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, has  called  on both sides fighting in Rwanda to stop the killings  immediately and reach an agreement to implement the resolve for  peace, reached in Arusha last year. In a statement issued in  Arusha today, the UN secretary general called on both sides to  cooperate with the UN team which is assisting them so that the  team can fulfill its duties as directed by the UN Security  Council. Butrus-Ghali also expressed his concern over the  prevailing situation in Rwanda, where these two groups are not  showing signs of ending their conflict [words indistinct]. Dr.  Butrus-Ghali said the United Nations has decided to let its  peace-keeping force stay in Rwanda, provided that the two sides  stop fighting and stop killing officers of the United Nations in  Rwanda and other aid organization officials and innocent  civilians.</p>

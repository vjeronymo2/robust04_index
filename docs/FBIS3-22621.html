Let us  follow our reporter, Skender Durmishi:    Durmishi: Some 56 persons became sick during the  epidemic of typhoid fever that broke out in Shtime over the last  two months. Of these, 26 are handicapped persons, while the  others are citizens of Shtime and near-by localities. So far,  37 persons effected by typhoid fever have been hospitalized,  while the others are under medical supervision, however, even  those need hospital treatment due to the danger of the disease.    These associations [Medical Commission and Red Cross]  ascertain that the main cause of the epidemic is the polluted  water in the Shtime wells, which were locked in the two nearest  quarters, as well as defects in the canalization network. At  communal level, a disease-prevention staff has formed since the  outbreak of the first signs of the epidemic. While, in some  quarters, commissions have been formed so as to advise on the  medical situation of the population, and particularly that of  the families of the sick. The present competent institutions  have warned the population to boil wellwater and to take  drinking water only from safe sources.    In cooperation with the Mother Teresa Humanitarian  Association, it became possible to ensure a considerable amount  of soap, disinfection equipment, and necessary antibiotics and  to inform the Federation of the International Red Cross and the  World Health Organization.    A communique on the disease mainly ascertains the present  situation, but at the end obliges the Medical Faculty  epidemiologists to rapidly present concrete proposals on urgent  measures to overcome the grave situation created by typhoid  fever in Shtime.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Unions launch campaign against 'a dirty trick' Trade unions representing defence workers plan a three-month campaign against cuts in the worst affected areas of the country which have Conservative MPs. Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary of the TGWU general union, said last night: 'Through a long, hot summer the unions will be asking why the party of defence is betraying the defence workers.' The IPMS civil service union, which represents 25,000 technical specialists in the Ministry of Defence, said the 7,100 cut in civilian jobs announced yesterday was on top 12,000 job losses announced under the Options for Change programme. Mr Paul Noon, the union's assistant general secretary, said last night: 'This means one-in-six civilian workers in the Ministry of Defence will be thrown out of a job within the next three years.' He said that the unions would be calling for an immediate inquiry by the Commons defence committee into the operational effects of the white paper proposals and that the Commons public accounts committee should inquire into the Pounds 1bn a year cost of contracting out work in the MoD. Mr Ross Burns, secretary to the industrial trade unions at Devonport, said the latest job losses at Royal Navy stores depots in Devon were 'a dirty trick to pull on people who have given damned loyal service to the government and to the country'.</p>

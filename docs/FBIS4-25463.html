			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade </F> and economic cooperation, by reporter Zheng Zhihai (6774 1807  3189); date, place not given: "Wu Yi on Reform of Foreign Trade  System, Seizing the Opportunity To Increase Exports"]    [Text] Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi said in a recent  interview with this reporter that we must deepen the reform of  our foreign trade system and seize the rare historical  opportunity to advance our export work to a new level.    Wu Yi said: The reform of our foreign trade system is an  important component of our economic restructuring and has been  implemented at a rapid pace for quite a long time. Following  bold reforms at three stages over the past 15 years, we started  a new round of reform this year, with the unification of  exchange rates at the core. The core of this round of reform is  that the state is to implement a unified foreign exchange  settlement and selling system in foreign trade export  enterprises, set up a unitary and managed renminbi floating  exchange rate system on the basis of market demand and supply,  and abolish foreign trade enterprises' task of turning over  foreign exchange to the higher authorities with or without  compensation.    Viewed from the experience and practice of foreign trade  development and reform over the past years, we really grasp the  key when introducing the new round of foreign trade reform  measures, particularly the reform of the exchange rate system  under the current situation. Compared with the past reform  measures, these measures have made a major breakthrough in such  respects as unifying policy, lifting restrictions on operation,  bearing responsibility for profits and losses, and promoting  fair competition, all of which will effectively solve some of  the deep-seated problems that have been disrupting our foreign  trade development for a long time, thus helping our foreign  trade system run in accordance with standard international  practice, helping foreign trade enterprises take part in the  international division of labor and exchange in a broader and  more profound way, developing an open economy, and linking and  supplementing our domestic economy with the international  economy.    Wu Yi said: In the future, our foreign trade and economic  cooperation must develop according to a new "large-scale  economic and trade" pattern, that is, linking foreign trade and  economic cooperation with foreign investment; merging barter  trade, technology trade, and service trade into a single whole;  integrating commodities, capital, technology, and labor; and  combining industry, agriculture, technology, and commerce with  one another in trade. In the third volume of his selected  works, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that our total foreign trade  volume would reach $200 billion by the end of this century, and  we must fulfill that task this year, which is six years earlier.  Not long ago, Premier Li Peng proposed that by the year of  2000, our total foreign trade volume must reach $400 billion,  which would double this year's figure. This is quite an arduous  task. With the end of the Cold War, the competition of  comprehensive national strength will occupy a leading position.  In the 1990's, worldwide economic competition will become more  intense, and a "commercial war" awaits us which has a strong  smell of gunpowder, but no smoke,. Faced with this historical  opportunity, the success of the reform of our foreign trade  system relates not only to whether or not a new foreign trade  system can be established, but also to whether or not a  socialist market economy system can be established at an early  date and can run normally. At present, first, we must handle  well the relationship between the reform of our foreign trade  system and the task of expanding exports to earn more foreign  exchange. Second, we must handle well the relationship between  reform and maintaining the order of foreign trade operation,  Third, we must handle well the relationship between the reform  of our foreign trade system and other reforms. Fourth, we must  handle well the problem of converging the old and the new  systems in the process of transformation. In short, in  deepening the reform of our foreign trade system, we should set  the task of boosting exports as the most important one, and  should try every possible means to advance it to a new level so  as to promote the full development of foreign trade and to make  new progress.</p>

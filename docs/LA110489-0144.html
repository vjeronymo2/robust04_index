			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS PLAY ROLE IN BOARD RACES;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: UNIONS USE MONEY, VOLUNTEERS TO TRY TO UNSEAT OR KEEP SCHOOL  DISTRICT INCUMBENTS.  </P> <P> Orange County teachers, having honed their political skills in several recent  elections, are gunning for incumbents in three elementary and high school board  races this year.  </P> <P> The local chapters of the California Teachers Assn. are pumping in dollars and  volunteers to unseat incumbents in the Anaheim City School District and the  Orange Unified and Santa Ana Unified school districts. A fourth district,  Huntington Beach Union High School, features the union in strong defense of the  incumbents it helped elect four years ago.  </P> <P> "Our teachers are out there and working," said Norma Potter, an Anaheim High  School special education teacher and chairwoman of the CTA's service center in  Orange. "There's a long history of this, of people working for their candidates  and succeeding."  </P> <P> Recent Orange County school board elections reflect the increasing  aggressiveness of local teachers' organizations, and the CTA has proven that it  can deliver votes. Just ask members of the Huntington Beach school board who  were tossed out in 1984, or trustees in Santa Ana Unified who in 1986 were  swept out of office in Orange County's largest school district.  </P> <P> In those races, unions gave thousands of  </P> <P> dollars to the successful candidates. But even more important, they gave their  endorsed challengers a guaranteed pool of volunteers to help canvass  neighborhoods and work telephone banks. School board elections tend to produce  low turnouts, so volunteer efforts, if they can muster even a few hundred  votes, can have a decisive impact.  </P> <P> James A. Richards, a Santa Ana Unified trustee who watched as three of his  colleagues were defeated in 1986, is seeking a third four-year term. He said he  has never received the union's endorsement, and he proudly shuns it, refusing  even to be considered.  </P> <P> "I frankly feel it's a conflict of interest," Richards said.  </P> <P> Like other officials who did not receive union endorsements, Richards said he  does not believe the union will play a decisive role in this year's Santa Ana  campaign. "Orange County is not a union county or a union society," he said.  </P> <P> Union leaders, while denying that Orange County voters rebel against organized  labor, carefully stress that teachers have been able to distinguish themselves  from most organized labor groups in terms of their popular support.  </P> <P> Still, most observers acknowledge that a union endorsement comes with risks as  well as benefits. Some voters do not like unions, and in districts where labor  disputes have prompted strikes or other work actions, even otherwise neutral  voters are often antagonized by the union's role.  </P> <P> That may be the case in Orange Unified, where a seven-day teachers' strike last  year frayed relations with district officials and tested parents' patience.  </P> <P> "There was a lot of backlash from that strike," said Jane McCracken, an  incumbent trustee who was named to the board in February to fill an unexpired  term and must run for election to complete the term's remaining two years.  McCracken, in fact, is counting on that backlash, as she joins other incumbents  seeking reelection in that district who are opposed by the union.  </P> <P> The unions, however, are pouring on their influence.  </P> <P> According to Steve McDonald, executive director of the Orange Unified Education  Assn., the teachers' union has actively pushed its slate in Orange and doled  out a total of $14,000 among its four candidates.  </P> <P> Also, the union representing other school district employees is backing three  of the same challengers on the teacher-endorsed slate. That union, which is  affiliated with the local chapter of the California School Employees Assn., is  protesting a breakdown in salary negotiations with the district and  demonstrated outside a recent board meeting. Several members spent Friday  stuffing mailers for one of their candidates.  </P> <P> Incumbent school board President Sandy G. Englander bristles at the power of  the organized labor groups and acknowledged that it has made some school board  races too close to call. Englander was not endorsed by either union, but her  opponent, college instructor John Hurley, didn't get the nod either.  </P> <P> "I think there are going to be some very, very close elections," Englander  predicted Friday.  </P> <P> In Anaheim, the union's position and its support of two challengers boils down  to a relatively straightforward disagreement with incumbents. For several  years, despite union urging, the Anaheim school board has refused to allow an  election to create an "agency shop." Under such an arrangement, all district  teachers, whether or not they choose to join the union, would be charged dues  to support the union's collective bargaining work.  </P> <P> "That's an important issue to us," Potter said.  </P> <P> Two incumbents are seeking reelection in the Anaheim district, the county's  largest elementary school district. Those incumbents, Celia Dougherty and Betty  Patterson, are facing off against four challengers for three seats.  </P> <P> Two of those challengers, Anaheim Police Officer Lou Lopez and realtor-educator  Barbara C. Gonzalez, are receiving union support.  </P> <P> Many teachers welcome the high-profile role assumed by the union, but that  feeling is not always shared by school administrators. Several high-ranking  school officials in various districts said the unions have made it difficult  for boards to govern objectively and have turned salary debates into hot  political confrontations.  </P> <P> While the unions have as many passionate opponents as they do defenders, the  fact that they prompt such strong reactions is evidence that they are a force  to be reckoned with. And both sides agree that they are not about to disappear.  </P> <P> "The fact that they're teachers doesn't prevent them from being citizens,"  Anaheim City School District Supt. Meliton Lopez said. "They're intelligent,  and they know how to set up a campaign. I expect they'll keep doing it."  </P></p>

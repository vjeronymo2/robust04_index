			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Observer: DC mafia When Britain's Sir Nigel Wicks takes up the chair of the European Community monetary committee he will be joined by another old Washington hand at the top of the secretive EC body. For later this month, Gunter Grosche, currently the German finance ministry's expert on European monetary union, moves to Brussels to head the committee's permanent secretariat. Wicks and Grosche know each other from when they were respectively British and German executive directors of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. Both high-fliers, Sir Nigel is second permanent secretary in the Treasury and so responsible for international monetary affairs. He was formerly the UK 'sherpa', the senior official who prepares the Group of Seven summit meetings. Meanwhile, Grosche has most recently been the Bonn finance ministry's expert on the Maastricht Treaty. He first attracted notice as a close aide of Manfred Lahnstein, German finance minister, in 1982. It will be intriguing to see how relations now develop between the European Commission and the committee, which is mainly made up of senior officials from EC member states' finance ministries and central banks. Wicks in particular is no friend of Euro-federalist views and he takes over as chairman after a period when relations with the Commission have occasionally been fraught.</p>

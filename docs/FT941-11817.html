			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Stronger UK demand helps Gardiner achieve Pounds 4.02m Steady growth in UK demand for home security helped Gardiner Group, the security and surveillance equipment distributor, announce improved pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.02m for the year to October 31. The shares added 4 1/2 p yesterday to close at 33 1/2 p. The comparative figure of Pounds 620,000 is restated in accordance with FRS 3 to include the Pounds 2.03m exceptional closure costs of the Spanish subsidiary in 1992. Turnover grew by 6.5 per cent to Pounds 78.6m (Pounds 73.8m),though on continuing operations the rise was 10 per cent. Earnings per share were 2.23p (0.17p) and a final dividend of 0.5p (0.19p) is recommended, making a total of 0.73p (0.66p). Mr Harvey Samson, chief executive, said thecompany had restored stability after the dislocation caused by the discovery two years ago of falsified accounting which led to the depart-ure of Mr Yashar Turgut, the then chief execu-tive. New accounting policies have been adopted for the company's asset valuation, resulting in a reduction of net assets as at October 31 1992 from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 6.75m. The change reduces depreciation costsand turns pre-tax losses of Pounds 473,000 for that year into profits of Pounds 620,000. Gardiner Security, the market-leading UK subsidiary, recorded strong sales growth at stable margins. Mr Samson said that rising crime offered substantialgrowth potential in the residential sector where fewer than one in 10 homes hadsecurity systems. The group's French and Scandinavian subsidiaries both performed well in spite of recession. However, in Belgium and the Netherlands a harsh economic climate made trading more difficult.</p>

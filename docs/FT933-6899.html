			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / People: Pilsworth selects Chrysalis SelecTV, the independent production company that was earlier this year upset by wranglings between co-founders Michael Buckley and Allan McKeown, is losing its managing director Michael Pilsworth, who had been in charge of the UK side, to Chrysalis. Pilsworth joins as managing director and chief executive of the newly created visual entertainment division, which groups together a number of operations including the TV production company, the home video operation and Red Rooster Film. Last November, Chrysalis brought Steve Lewis on board from Virgin to head up the music division, and group chairman Chris Wright says the senior management team is now complete. Pilsworth, 42, says he had been talking to Wright, whom he has known since student days at Manchester University, for the past year. But it was not until now that he felt he could leave SelecTV so that the transition, in what is a very small company, would be 'as seamless as possible'. McKeown is returning from Los Angeles, where he had been based, having opted to run down the US operation. Buckley was ousted as chairman in March. 'For me Chrysalis is a fantastic global brand name in the record business; it provides a great opportunity to capitalise on that goodwill for the visual entertainment side.' Chrysalis is also targeting a younger audience, in terms of mentality and cultural interests, if not in age. Hence it was no accident, Pilsworth thinks, that SelecTV executives were avid golfers when he was not. Now, by contrast, he is about to take an intensive tennis course in Spain. A lecturer in psychology at Manchester before he joined LWT as a research assistant in 1985, Pilsworth moved to TVS before joining SelecTV.</p>

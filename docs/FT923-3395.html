			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Higher dollar gives Paris a good day A RISE in the dollar, and a gently firmer start on Wall Street helped bourses, particularly the late closers, yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS enjoyed a positive day as the market took confidence from the dollar. The CAC-40 index ended up 27.81 at 1,801.99, just off the day's high of 1,803.01, while turnover was a healthy FFr2.4bn. The market gained 1.3 per cent on the week. Some speculative buying of bank and finance stocks was noted on hopes of a Yes vote in the Maastricht referendum, which could signal a cut in interest rates. Societe Generale gained FFr5 to FFr534, Suez was up FFr5.50 to FFr249.00 and Paribas advanced FFr15 to FFr342. Rhone-Poulenc reversed Thursday's sharp fall with a gain in its certificates of FFr13 to FFr543. Peugeot featured in active trade after the group forecast a rise in European sales: its shares gained FFr26 to FFr619. The Peugeot news helped the automotive sector, Valeo, the replacement components company, improving FFr35 or 4.9 per cent to FFr745 with some 40,000 shares traded. Michelin gained FFr7 to FFr206. FRANKFURT toyed with special situations as the DAX index ended 0.87 lower at 1,527.80, 0.6 per cent down on the week in turnover down to DM3.6bn from DM4.2bn. A earnings downgrade for Thyssen dropped the steelmaker by DM4.30 to DM190.50. Goldman Sachs trimmed its DVFA earnings forecasts from DM15 to DM13 a share for 1991-92, and from DM16 to DM14 for 1992-93, and expected a dividend cut from DM10 to DM6 a share. Varta, the battery maker, dropped DM6 to DM294 for a loss of DM16 on the week. Analysts said that the car industry was squeezing its components suppliers. On the plus side, construction stocks rose after a trade group reported that new orders for the west German construction sector rose by 2.1 per cent in June. Philip Holzmann closed DM40 higher at DM845 and Hochtief rose DM25 to DM970. In banking, Commerzbank said that it was thinking about a dividend increase for 1992 and the shares rose DM2.30 to DM220.80. MILAN went sharply into reverse, the Comit index closing 6.17 lower at 367.09, 1.2 per cent down on the week, as dealers again focused on the struggling lira and political worries. The Bank of Italy said the rumours of an imminent rate hike were unfounded. ZURICH rose on the higher dollar, the SMI index closing 19.0 better at 1,811.8. In addition, said Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Swiss Volksbank, better than expected first half profits from Nestle lifted the bearers by SFr11 to SFr952. AMSTERDAM rose on the stronger dollar, the CBS Tendency index climbing 0.9 to 109.2, 0.6 per cent lower on the week. Royal Dutch and Unilever both showed up well, up Fl 2.00 and Fl 2.50 respectively to Fl 144.30 and Fl 183.20. BRUSSELS took its cue from neighbouring markets and ended the week firmer. The Bel-20 index closed up 6.37 at 1,079.58, a gain of 0.86 per cent on the week, in turnover of BFr804m. UCB, the pharmaceuticals and packaging company, pleased investors with its first half figures (released after Thursday's close) and gained BFr650, or 2.9 per cent to BFr23,000. BBL resumed trading after Thursday's suspension on news that the Dutch insurer, ING, was to make a bid. Its shares closed up BFr175 or 5.3 per cent at BFr3,450 with 19,200 shares traded. STOCKHOLM closed the week firmer as investors began to be encouraged by central bank efforts to defend the krona. The Affarsvarlden index rose 13.1 to 720.3, 4.9 per cent lower on the week. Turnover was Skr355m after SKr397m on Thursday. The banking share index rose 7.3 per cent with SE-Banken A shares SKr1 firmer at SKr15. Procordia B shares rose SKr6 to Skr148 after announcing, on Thursday, the sale of its sugar producing subsidiary and acquisition of Swedish Match. In OSLO the market continued to improve with the all-share index up 4.18 at 313.51, unchanged on the week. Turnover was NKr218m. Norsk Hydro gained NKr4 to NKr134. VIENNA was little changed on the day but up 2 per cent on the week. The ATX index rose 0.53 to 745.85 with Leykam, the paper manufacturer, gaining Sch7 to Sch312, for the day's biggest rise. ISTANBUL reached a two month high in spite of some late profit-taking. The 75-share index, which rose 128 in early trade, closed up 24.77 at 4,322.10 in turnover estimated at TL321.8bn. Eregli, the steel group, went against the trend, falling TL50 to TL3,800. MADRID's general index rose 1.16 to 208.81, 3.5 per cent down on the week.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - Sep 11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1028.70  1027.44  1028.25  1030.12  1031.47  1033.12  1032.59  1033.57  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Day's High  1034.59    Day's Low  1026.92  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        Sep 10     Sep 9     Sep 8     Sep 7     Sep 4       1027.59   1021.42   1029.38   1032.28   1029.27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NCAA COUNCIL BACKS ALL-YEAR DRUG TESTS, HARSHER PENALTIES  </P> <P> The NCAA Council announced today unanimous endorsement of a year-round random  drug-testing program and tougher penalties for athletes who test positive, NCAA  President Albert M. Witte said.  </P> <P> The 46-member council ended three days of closed-door meetings, setting its  agenda of proposals it will sponsor at the full NCAA convention in Dallas on  Jan. 7-10.  </P> <P> Witte said the drug-testing program would call for longer suspensions for  athletes, but he did not offer specific penalties. He said the feeling among  the council members, composed of faculty representatives from all three  divisions, was to show "more concern and compassion for those athletes found to  use street drugs."  </P> <P> The council also denied an appeal for immediate eligibility for Chris Mills,  who transferred from Kentucky to Arizona after Kentucky's basketball program  was placed on three years probation. Mills had claimed he was not involved in  any of the violations for which Kentucky was put on probation and should be  able to compete immediately.  </P> <P> "Mills voluntarily transferred and, according to the Division 1 steering  committee, he seems to fit within the category of voluntary transfer students,"  Witte said. "The committee saw no reason to make an exception in this case."  </P></p>

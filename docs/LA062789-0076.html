			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Denying that he is "the cold-blooded, inhumane monster some people believe me  to be," John Galen Davenport was sentenced to death for the second time in the  murder of a Tustin woman found impaled on a wooden stake. Davenport's original  sentence was reversed by the state Supreme Court under then-Chief Justice Rose  Elizabeth Bird. On March 27, 1980, Gayle Ann Lingle, 30, was stabbed repeatedly  and impaled on a stake while she was still alive. Her nude body was found in a  field in Irvine. "I cannot imagine a more horrible way for a person to die,"  Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey said in pronouncing sentence on  Davenport's 34th birthday. Davenport's girlfriend, Judy Dunn, said that in one  way, it was the present he wanted most -- "He's anxious to get back to San  Quentin and out of the Orange County Jail."  </P></p>

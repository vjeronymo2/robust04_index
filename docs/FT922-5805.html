			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Spectre of losses dogs US carriers / Outlining the well-founded anxieties of American Airlines Bob Crandall has never lacked a punchy comment. Even so, the outspoken chairman of American Airlines seemed to attain fresh levels of exasperation last week when he assessed US carriers' prospects. 'This isn't a game,' he told assembled media after his company's annual meeting. 'This is deadly serious. This industry is going down the tubes.' Mr Crandall has a point. In the first three months of 1992, with the economy supposedly recovering and the Gulf War a distant memory, only two US airlines - American and its much smaller Dallas-based neighbour, Southwest - made any money at all. In American's case, the operating profit was a skeletal Dollars 137m, on revenues of Dollars 3.5bn. Grim first-quarter figures may be only the beginning of the year's bad news. Many US analysts believe that the sector will be lucky to make any money in 1992. 'We were forecasting a very marginal profit, between break-even and Dollars 500m,' says Lee Howard at Airline Economics, the Washington-based consultancy. 'Now, it could be the bottom-end of that range.' Avmark, another aviation consultancy, is bleaker still, suggesting that losses may start to approach the levels seen in 1991. That was when the nine surviving national carriers (excluding Pan Am, which went out of business in October), produced a horrendous Dollars 1.63bn deficit after tax. Either way, if such Cassandra-like predictions are correct, 1992 will become the third successive year in which the US airline industry has failed miserably to line its coffers. Accumulated losses for the nine carriers over the three-year period may range upwards of Dollars 5bn. The explanation for the flood of red ink is simple. In spite of all the airline bankruptcies, staff cuts and pruned capital spending plans, there is a continuing mismatch between domestic capacity and costs on the one side, and demand/revenues on the other. The chief questions are: when will matters improve; and can anything be done to accelerate recovery? The cost side, however, has not been unremittingly bleak. The price of fuel, accounting for 15 per cent-plus of any airline's operating expenses, has fallen year-on-year, although it has been rising again recently. United Airlines calculates that it paid about 62 cents per gallon of jet fuel in the first three months of 1992; down from 83 cents in the first quarter of 1991. A one cent reduction in fuel prices adds Dollars 130m to the industry's annual profits. Labour costs, meanwhile, amount to another 30 per cent of operating expenses, and some carriers have secured concessions here. For example, USAir reached a new agreement with its pilots, involving salary cuts. Even the mighty Delta, which set the pace for pilots' pay with a three-year contract in 1990, won agreement from employees to extend the deal for a further 16 months. Instead of receiving a 12.5 per cent rise over three years, pilots will receive 14.5 per cent over four and a half years. On the revenue side, mitigating circumstances are harder to find. While international traffic recovered swiftly from the Gulf War hiatus,North America's huge domestic market remains moribund. According to the Air Transport Association (ATA), US passenger traffic fell last year, for the first time in a decade. Revenue passenger miles were flat, and the number of passengers slipped by nearly 1 per cent. Scheduled capacity, however, increased by 2 per cent. The first four months of 1992 have been no better, with revenue passenger miles down by 1.1 per cent year-on-year and available seat miles up by 1.9 per cent. That hurts, because in spite of all their expensive route acquisitions, in Europe and Asia, US carriers remain heavily dependent on domestic traffic. American, for example, drew more than three-quarters of its revenues from the US last year. With demand flat, that leaves pricing - and here matters are more complex. Last month, American announced a fares offensive. Essentially, its domestic price structure will be streamlined into four basic fare classes: first class; full coach; 7-day advance; and 21-day advance. The first two classes will be substantially cheaper than comparable 'pre-streamlining' fares, but will dispense with the myriad of discount fare schemes, corporate concessions, and so on. It is easy to see why American felt the need to act. ATA figures show that 'discount' traffic accounted for 94.9 per cent of total domestic travel in 1991, compared with 70.6 per cent a decade earlier. The 'average' discount, moreover, increased from 46.2 per cent in 1981 to 65.6 per cent 10 years later. American itself was offering about 500,000 separate fares ahead of the overhaul. Post-streamlining, this was reckoned to reduce to 70,000; a significant cost-saving. But many analysts interpreted the move mainly as a bid to stimulate business travel or at least to persuade business travellers to pay for convenient full-coach tickets (albeit cheaper than before), rather than have them scramble around the discount offerings. American acknowledged it would see a net revenue loss short-term, but hoped this could be recouped by increased demand. One month later, it is questionable whether the strategy has worked. The largest carriers immediately matched American. But, within days, financially troubled carriers like TWA, USAir and Continental, were undercutting. Only this week Northwest Airlines introduced a two-for-one leisure fare during the summer season on domestic flights and some carriers have followed suit. Today, Mr Crandall defends his overhaul. He says the simplified fare structure is still in place, even if the level of fares is lower than anticipated. He claims that about 30 per cent of the fares now being booked are full coach. 'We are not displeased,' he says defiantly. 'We're getting the change in mix, but yields will be lower than we thought.' Analysts beg to differ. They point out that various corporate discounts are still available. Moreover, even on a simple route like Washington-New York, there are a dozen published fares, three times the number which the 'simplified pricing' strategy was supposed to create. At least one analyst claims the fare structure overhaul is deteriorating rapidly. Some cynics suspect that American's objectives were two-fold from the outset. Even if the overhaul failed, it would at least put further pressure on the financially-distressed, undercutting carriers, and hopefully push them from the skies. American denies this. The fact is, however, that airlines in the US do not die easily. So long as assets can be sold or further credit secured, debt-burdened carriers have survived for years, especially under bankruptcy court protection. Eastern, Pan Am and Midway only collapsed when the cash ran out. So, although consolidation is taking place, the process - for the survivors - is painfully slow. Moreover, even if the financially-troubled carriers disappear, there remains the competitive threat from Southwest, the highly-successful low-cost airline. By avoiding all the costs of a national hub network and by retaining its lean structure, Southwest can regularly undercut its bigger rivals and still make a profit. Mr Crandall acknowledges that something may have to be done. Options being considered include pulling American out of some particularly tough markets, or introducing a rival low-cost service. Many analysts think that the most the industry can expect is a long wait until domestic traffic revives, until undercutting slackens off as a result of failures, and until demand starts to reflect supply more closely. That may start to happen in 1994. Mr Crandall is less phlegmatic: 'Either this industry fixes itself, or the US is not going to have an industry.'</p>

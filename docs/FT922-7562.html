			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Letter: Backing for civil servants as non-executive directors (1) Sir Mr Elyan's understanding of non-executive directorships (Letters, May 15) is regrettably limited. The government encourages its senior staff to take non-executive directorships with major companies. We need productive interchange of ideas and experience. It is essential for senior civil servants to understand the needs of business and the context in which it works, just as business needs an insight into workings of government. Each appointment is carefully vetted to ensure that there are not conflicts between the company and the civil servant's official duties. None of the officials in this department who is a non-executive director receives a fee. Where a fee is paid it passes via this department to the exchequer. David McDonald, director of information, Department of the Environment, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1</p>

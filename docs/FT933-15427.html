			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (8): Compromise specialist / Profile of Vasso Papandreou SHE HAS kept a low profile since returning from Brussels in January after serving as the European Community's commissioner for social affairs. But if the Panhellenic Socialist Movement returns to power, Vasso Papandreou may find herself responsible for trying to improve Greece's relationship with its EC partners. 'The climate towards us is still negative, both because of the economic situation and our policy on Skopje (Macedonia),' she says. 'The only thing that's changed is there are so many other pressing problems, there's less time for getting upset with Greece.' She notes that in spite of the conservative government's avowed commitment to European union, Greek attitudes towards the community are still based on taking rather than contributing. By way of example she names two prominent cabinet ministers who have never bothered to attend an EC ministerial council, preferring to send an under-secretary instead. Ms Papandreou, an economist by training, is sharply critical of the government's attempt to reform the economy. She argues that the present stabilisation programme was too ambitious in its targets for cutting inflation and the public sector deficit. 'What was needed was a medium-term approach. It's just not possible to bring inflation down from 22 per cent to single digits in the space of two years,' she says. A more coherent policy is needed to reduce tax evasion, she says. Rather than simply reducing the tax burden for high- and low-income earners, as the government did last year, in the hope that the wealthy will be encouraged to declare more of their income, a different approach is needed. 'With the highest proportion of self-employed earners in the community, about 30 per cent, we have to use objective criteria of income. How about a property tax, for example?' she says. Ms Papandreou is sceptical of Greece's chances of meeting the Maastricht targets for economic convergence, though she is by no means convinced that other EC members will manage to keep the current timetable for economic union. 'But in any case, it's not just a question of fulfilling macroeconomic targets, but of real convergence, which means that Greece's per capita income must rise to the EC average,' she adds. When Pasok was in power in the 1980s, Ms Papandreou - who is not related to Mr Andreas Papandreou, the socialist former prime minister - held a succession of junior ministerial posts, from research and technology to trade. Despite a reputation for being a radical, she became popular with scientists and businessmen alike for her willingness, rare in Greek politics, to build compromises. If Pasok comes back to power, she would join the moderate faction that calls for a consensus approach to government, in contrast to the fierce polarisation of political life cultivated by the socialists in the 1980s. 'Coming back to Greece this year, I was aware of a sense of frustration, that the politicians were failing to offer anything substantive. There is much more discontent than there used to be. On the other hand, there's a greater maturity, especially among the business community which is now much better equipped to compete in Europe,' she says. For all Ms Papandreou's studied composure, there is a definite glint of enthusiasm in her eyes at the prospect of an election, not to mention the longer-term changes it will set in motion. 'There's going to be a period of uncertainty over the next year or so as things are shaken out. But the departure of the old political leaders will make it possible for attitudes to change,' she says.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (13): Neighbour that always wins - The country's relationship with Russia 'Finland has fought many wars with Russia and it has come second every time,' Finns will joke when discussing their sensitive relationship with their giant eastern neighbour. The most recent confrontation was during the second world war. On that occasion, the country achieved one of its better results, managing to preserve its independence despite the sacrifice of a tenth of its territory The sensitivity in the relationship is hardly surprising. Finland was ruled by Russia for more than 100 years until 1917. During the cold war it was forced to adopt a stance of strict neutrality to avoid provoking Moscow. More recently it has had to endure the taunts of Vladimir Zhironovsky, the Russian nationalist, and even talk that a starving Russian population was about to flock over its borders in search of a better life. Even today, instability in Russia almost automatically provokes a sell-off on the Helsinki stock exchange. Against this background, it is not surprising that Finland's desire to anchor itself firmly in the western camp was one of the main reasons that its electorate voted to join the European Union by such a clear margin on October 16. In the back of many people's minds was that the thought that Finland would gain more security without any new military alliances or commitments. The irony is that Finland would probably not have got its chance to apply for EU membership without the momentous changes which have swept through Russia in the past five years. Its ability to chart a more independent course came with the ending of the cold war and the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, signalled in 1990 that Finland was able to go its own way. Then, in mid-1991 Sweden applied for EU membership. When Finland duly followed suit in March 1992, the move passed almost unnoticed in Russia. In the run-up to October's referendum, both supporters and opponents of EU membership used the Russian issue to back their argument. Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, said: 'Finland will be able to be very active and play a very important role in programmes the European Union has for assisting Russia. 'My impression is that on the Russian side they see the membership of Finland as an opportunity also for Russia because of the fact that resources for co-operation will be increased.' Opponents are not so sure. They believe Finland will slowly be drawn through EU membership into less neutral defence structures, which could in a future east-west confrontation put the country in the front line. Mr Risto Volanen, a member of the 'No' camp, says: 'I am worried we are putting ourselves on the chessboard in such a way that we are not in control of the moves that are made.' The aim is still to hang on to the spirit, if not the fact, of neutrality. Thus, Finland has joined the Partnership for Peace, while stressing this is not a staging post on the way to full membership of Nato. As for the Western European Union, the country says it will seek observer status but has declined to give any commitment beyond that. This shows a continuation of the pragmatic stance which Finns have adopted in their Russian dealings for most of this century. It is an approach that has benefited them in many ways. The best example has been trade. During the cold war, Finland had a privileged trading relationship with the Soviet Union. Under a clearing system arrangement, agreed at government level and implemented through five-year plans, the country built up a dangerously high dependence on its eastern neighbour. Most of its oil and gas imports came from the Soviet Union; in exchange it supplied ships, machinery and equipment, chemicals and consumer goods. At its peak in the mid-1980s, the Soviet Union accounted for 26 per cent of Finland's trade. The total fell during the late 1980s, but even so the Finnish economy felt a massive shock when the clearing system was abandoned  -at Soviet insistence - at the beginning of 1991. The blow deepened Finland's three-year recession between 1991 and 1993 at a time when it was already reeling from the consequences of 1980s over-heating and a downturn in the international economic cycle. Finnish-Soviet trade, having been worth FM36.6bn in 1983, fell to just FM9.7bn in 1992. However, there are already clear signs of recovery. In 1993 the trade was worth FM13.9bn and this year it is predicted to reach FM18bn, or 7.2 per cent of the country's total. This makes Russia Finland's fifth largest trading partner. But the structure of the trade today is totally different. Having been centralised and largely the domain of Finland's big exporters, the picture is now more fragmented and thousands of Finnish companies are involved. Moreover, the type of trade has changed. Today, Finland is exporting (or re-exporting) far more consumer goods than in the past. Trade is also more complicated due to the absence of a sound legal and banking infrastructure on the Russian side. Finland is confident it will benefit in the long term from its geographical proximity to Russia and, in particular, its closeness to St Petersburg where Finnish companies are already among the most active foreign investors. The Finnish port industry has already benefited from congestion and obsolete facilities on the Russian side, helped by the fact that the two countries share a common rail gauge. Whether Finland can successfully market itself more broadly as the 'Gateway to Russia' and attract foreign investment on the back of it remains open to doubt. Finland has more experience of dealing with Russia than other western countries. But its experience derives from a different era and different conditions when different people were in charge. In many respects, it is having to start afresh, just like everyone else, in its dealings with the 'new' Russia.</p>

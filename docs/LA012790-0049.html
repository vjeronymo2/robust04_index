			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> CHURCHES CHARGED IN GAY ORDINATIONS  </P> <P> Formal disciplinary charges have been lodged against two Lutheran congregations  that violated denominational policy by ordaining three gay ministers who refuse  to renounce sexual relations. St. Francis and First United churches face  punishment ranging from censure to expulsion from the church organization for  "willfully disregarding" membership requirements of the 5.2-million-member  Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Jeff Johnson, 27, was installed Sunday  as assistant pastor at First United.  </P> <P> At the same time, Ruth Frost, 42, and Phyllis Zillhart, 32, were installed at  St. Francis, near the predominantly gay Castro neighborhood. The ELCA bans  ordination of "self-avowed, practicing homosexuals." A consultation team will  be named to meet with the congregations. If the group cannot resolve the  dispute, a 12-member disciplinary committee will review the charges.  </P></p>

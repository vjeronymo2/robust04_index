			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / London consolidates lead in foreign currency trading THE AMOUNT of foreign currency trading conducted out of London is now so substantial that more US dollars and D-Marks are traded in the City than in either the US or Germany. The volume of currency trading throughout the world grew sharply between 1989 and 1992, with an increasing proportion of deals being done in the D-Mark, according to a report issued yesterday by the Bank for International Settlements. The report, which is the most comprehensive survey ever made of activity in the foreign exchange market, confirmed that London remains the world's largest centre for foreign exchange, accounting for more than a quarter of all turnover in currencies. Yesterday's report by the BIS, outlined an inquiry into foreign exchange dealing conducted by 26 central banks last year. The survey showed that global net turnover in the world's foreign exchange markets grew 42 per cent between 1989 and 1992, reaching an estimated Dollars 880bn (Pounds 585bn) per business day in April 1992. In spite of the increase, these figures represented a slowing in turnover growth, compared with the three years between 1986 and 1989. However, there was a strong increase in the number of transactions in currency futures and options in these years. According to the report, the dollar remains the single most widely traded currency in the world, accounting for seven out of 10 reported transactions. The D-Mark is now the second most widely traded currency, being involved in 38 per cent of all currency deals. 'The evidence strongly suggests that its (the D-Mark's) importance rose sharply between 1989 and 1992 at the expense of the dollar,' the BIS said. In Luxembourg, Ireland, Austria and Portugal, trading of the local currency against the D-Mark now exceeds local currency transactions against the dollar. London's predominance in foreign exchange trading was confirmed: it accounted for 27 per cent of net world turnover, compared with 25 per cent in 1989. 'The amount of foreign currency business conducted out of London is so great that domestic currency transactions account for less than a quarter of total trading there,' BIS says.</p>

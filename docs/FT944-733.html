			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Bosnia signs interim ceasefire: Country-wide truce expected to pave way for four-month halt in hostilities Bosnian Serbs and Moslems yesterday signed a country-wide interim ceasefire agreement, after Bosnian Serb objections forced the truce to be postponed from yesterday until noon today. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday said he had ordered his forces to stop fighting even before the details of the agreement were hammered out with Mr Yasushi Akashi, senior UN envoy in former Yugoslavia. Before the noon deadline for the truce passed yesterday, Mr Akashi met members of the Moslem-led Bosnian government in Sarajevo to discuss the terms of the interim ceasefire agreement, which is expected to pave the way for a four-month cessation of hostilities beginning January 1. The deal was brokered this week by Mr Jimmy Carter, former US president. Yesterday's delay was caused by Serb objections to two points in the agreement. The first called for the resumption of political negotiations which would lead towards a final settlement based on the five-nation Contact Group plan. Serbs regard the plan - dividing Bosnia almost equally between themselves and a federation of Moslems and Croats - as a starting point for peace negotiations. The Bosnian government insists it should be the basis of a peace settlement. The second point of contention was over the exchange of prisoners of war and the tracking of tens of thousands of people who have gone missing over the past 32 months of war. Before leaving the snow-covered mountain stronghold of Pale after talks which included General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, Mr Akashi told reporters: 'Our enormous efforts have resulted in a happy outcome.' He read aloud the declaration of a general ceasefire to come into effect throughout Bosnia along all frontlines at noon today. The most vulnerable point will be around Bihac, the Moslem enclave in the northwest being strangled by Serb forces. The agreement does not include Croatian Serbs and rebel Moslems fighting government forces there. In Belgrade, the state power company has announced that electricity cuts will be extended to 12 hours a day throughout Serbia. Outraged citizens have already set up barricades in several cities and towns and assaulted workers from the state power company. The company announced that prices would be increased by 60 per cent. In a joint appeal issued by state-run television and the electricity company, citizens were urged to 'shut off at least one of their heaters' so everyone in Serbia would be able to watch a Brazil-Yugoslavia soccer match on television yesterday evening. It was the first foreign match to be played since UN sanctions on Belgrade were eased in October. Brazil won 2-0. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic last night took over Borba, the last independent newspaper in Serbia. Even though Borba was privatised four years ago, a Serbian court, which is under Mr Milosevic's control, proclaimed that Borba, as of yesterday, was no longer private, but state property. Mr Dragutin Brcin, current minister of information and a member of the ruling Socialists' politburo, was named as editor-in-chief. The move was part of a wider campaign to stamp out any dissent in Serbia. It has intensified since Mr Milosevic was named by the west as the 'key man for finding peace and stability in the Balkans'.</p>

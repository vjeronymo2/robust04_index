			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS likely to smelt less western copper COPPER SMELTERS in Russia and Kazakhstan will experience a sharp drop in business from western merchants this year, predicts Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group. About 300,000 tonnes of stockpiled copper concentrate (an intermediate material) was shipped by merchants from the west to smelters in the Commonwealth of Independent States for treatment in the second half of last year, it estimates. This resulted in an unexpected production increase of more than 100,000 tonnes for the year. 'Not only did this alleviate the smelter bottle-neck which occurred during the first half of the year, it also prevented the copper market from registering a significant supply deficit as seemed likely at mid-year,' points out analyst Mr Wiktor Bielski in Carr's latest Metals and Mining investment update. However, Carr believes that the concentrate stockpiles are now nearly exhausted and that in 1993 only about 100,000 tonnes will be shipped to Russia and Kazakhstan for toll smelting (the system where smelters treat other companies' material for a fee). This would result in only 30,000 to 35,000 tonnes of 'extra' copper production from this source this year. 'Given the internal infrastructure problems in the CIS and the long distances involved, coupled with the recent fall in treatment charges, it may well prove unprofitable to undertake toll smelting in Russia at all this year,' adds Mr Bielski. Meanwhile, Carr expects imports of copper to China to continue growing strongly. Mr Bielski estimates that China's copper imports rose from 114,000 tonnes in 1991 to 280,000-300,000 tonnes last year and expects that to be exceeded in 1993. China's domestic copper production is running at full capacity (about 575,000 tonnes a year) and no expansions are expected for about three years, whereas demand is on course to rise to an annual 950,000 tonnes by the mid-1990s (up from about 650,000 tonnes in 1991). Carr suggests that net copper imports to the west from the former eastern bloc countries might disappear almost completely by the mid-1990s, a substantial reversal from the 254,000 tonnes imported in 1990.</p>

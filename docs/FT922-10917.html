			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / New economic allies begin the long haul THIS week's decisions in Washington to admit Russia and other former Soviet republics to membership of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have provided an important, historic moment in the process of integrating the former Soviet Union into the world economy. But the really hard work is only just beginning. Difficult negotiations are in prospect over conditions to be attached to IMF financial support for its new members and on details of the proposed rouble stabilisation fund. Russia and the other entrants will soon find themselves on a difficult learning curve as they discover that the IMF and World Bank are no 'soft touch' for easily available finance. Although the IMF has produced an impressive battery of documents over recent weeks detailing economic developments in Russia and the republics, monetary officials admit it is difficult to tell what relevance these have to conditions 'on the ground' outside the main metropolitan centres such as Moscow and Saint Petersburg. President Boris Yeltsin's remarks yesterday that Russia 'would not work under the direct orders' of the IMF were a pointer to future tussles over economic policy between Moscow and the IMF. The detailed difficulties which lie ahead are symbolised by discussions over the proposed Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.4bn) rouble stabilisation fund, which was agreed in principle by the Group of 10 industrialised countries this week. The idea is simple: that the fund should exist in reserve to support rouble parity once Russia has agreed to an IMF economic reform programme. Ideally, as Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's first deputy prime minister, said on Tuesday, the best use of the fund would be not to use it at all because that would show confidence had been established in the rouble. But the questions are many. Nobody knows what the rouble parity should be, although the Russian government feels existing market-determined rates undervalue the currency. The future regime for the rouble is open. Will it be fixed, put in a crawling peg of adjustable rates or float? G10 senior officials have suggested at least an initial period of floating, while Mr Gaidar favours fluctuation margins of 7.5 per cent either side of an eventual parity. What, if any, will be the anchor currency for the rouble? Will it be the Ecu, as proposed by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, or the dollar as suggested by Mr Gaidar? What will be the arrangements to ensure that monetary policy in the other countries of the planned rouble zone does not undermine the currency? It is also far from clear whether the industrialised countries agree on how the fund should operate. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, has suggested it should run for only one year and that extensions be agreed among the G10. This would keep the Russians on a short leash. The stabilisation fund itself will only come into effect when Russia and the republics have satisfied the IMF and G10 that they have effective macro-economic and structural reform programmes in place. It is therefore far from certain that it can be established in time for Russia's planned move to a unified exchange rate for the rouble on July 1. It is little wonder that some senior western monetary officials privately doubt whether the fund will come into being at all. But the stabilisation fund is only a small part of a bigger and more confusing mosaic. 'The big question is how much they - that is their government, the country and the Russian political community - recognise the true magnitude of what faces them,' one senior western official mused this week. Mr Gaidar spoke of Russia having a stable and high rate of growth after five years. Some western officials talk of a 25-year process of economic rehabilitation for Russia and the republics. Ominous parallels are drawn with the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s. That is only now resolving itself after nearly 10 years. Yet the Latin American countries had experience of the market economy and market-orientated structures in place; Russia and its neighbours have none of these. But Russia clearly has one asset in the shape of Mr Gaidar. Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury secretary, expressed a fairly general view of Russia's deputy prime minister when he described him as 'an enormously convincing person'.</p>

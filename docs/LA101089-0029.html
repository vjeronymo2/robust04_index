			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Mega-star Michael Jackson will be given a commemorative plaque by his  sixth-grade teacher, Laura Gerson, on Wednesday during dedication ceremonies  for the newly refurbished auditorium that will bear his name at Gardner Street  Elementary School in Hollywood. Jackson attended sixth grade at the school in  1969-70. Principal Jeff Sweeney says the tribute to Jackson was the brainchild  of a group of Gardner parents who helped spearhead an extensive, three-year  renovation project of the school's main building, where the auditorium is  located.

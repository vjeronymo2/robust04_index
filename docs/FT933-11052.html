			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Litigation against accountants rises THE BIG accountancy firms face mounting litigation from creditors and investors seeking to recover losses from insolvent or troubled companies, Lafferty, the business information group, says. Lafferty says in a report to be published next week that the 'threat of litigation has taken on new dimensions' in the US, with accountants held responsible for much more than 'obvious malpractice'. A sharp fall in share prices is sometimes enough to trigger a lawsuit against auditors. In the 1992 financial year spending on litigation of the six leading US accountancy firms amounted to 12 per cent of US accounting and auditing revenues, compared with 9 per cent in 1991. Lafferty says 1992 'will likely go down as the worst year ever for litigation against accountants'. Statistics in the report show that worldwide there have been 12 settlements involving payouts of Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.4m) or more. Four of the cases related to a Dollars 400m settlement by Ernst &amp; Young when it was sued by three US government bodies for its role in the failure of US savings and loans institutions. Ten of these cases were in the US but increasingly the profession is under attack elsewhere in the world. Three of the five lawsuits which sought to recover losses of more than Dollars 1bn have been launched outside the US. These include a claim for Dollars 8bn in damages by the liquidators of Bank of Credit and Commerce International against Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young. The report says that accountancy firms in at least 50 countries have experienced one or more claims. Firms in at least 20 further countries may have claims pending. Although the level of liability in continental European countries is low, the trend there is rising faster than in any other part of the world. Last year, for example, French accountancy firms faced about 150 cases, twice as many as in 1991. The report says that if all proposed legislation and regulation in the European Community is adopted, accountants practising in member states will be subjected to the harshest rules anywhere that govern claims and liability.

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Unemployment up to 9.5% in east Germany THE GERMAN government yesterday stepped up a campaign for foreign companies to invest in east Germany as latest figures showed a further rise in unemployment east of the Elbe to 837,000, 9.5 per cent of the labour force. The jobless statistics for April, from the Federal Labour Office, underlined continuing economic divergence between east and west Germany. Unemployment in the west fell 79,000 during the month to 1.65m, 5.5 per cent of the labour force, whereas in the former Communist part of the country it rose by a further 30,000. Mr Heinrich Franke, president of the Federal Labour Office, warned against reading too much optimism into the relatively minor rise in the east German jobless rate last month. A large number of redundancies were planned after June 30 as east German companies moved to a new system for maintaining employees on short-time working, he said. In a speech in Washington yesterday, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the German economics minister, linked the economic collapse in east Germany above all to harsh international competition after the introduction of the D-Mark last July. He issued an appeal to US investors to participate in rebuilding east Germany. Terming the restructuring process under way there 'the supershow of the market economy,' Mr Mollemann said: 'This is an invitation to the whole world.' Making his debut before an US audience after taking over as economics minister in January, Mr Mollemann said the booming west German economy had become 'the locomotive for its trading partners.' Highlighting the economic buoyancy in west Germany, unemployment in the west of the country fell by 262,000 against April 1990, and now stands at the lowest for 10 years. Reflecting the large increase in labour market participation over the past 12 months, employment in west Germany rose by 680,000 since April 1990 to 28.8m.</p>

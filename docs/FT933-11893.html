			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: China threatens to become Hong Kong's nemesis - Simon Holberton and Peter John examine growing unease over the mainland's rapid economic growth SOME brokers and property agents in Hong Kong are wondering if China, the force behind the vertiginous heights to which Hong Kong's stock and property markets have risen, will prove the colony's financial nemesis. Less than a month into the Chinese government's attempt to dampen economic activity on the mainland it is still too early to say if the Beijing authorities will succeed. Equally difficult is measuring the impact on Hong Kong's stock and property markets of such success. For the past year mainland Chinese investors have been a large source of the liquidity that has buoyed asset prices in the colony. For that reason it has not been lost on Hong Kong's financial community that one of the prime targets of the mainland's current economic policy is speculative stock and property market investment. In the past six months companies in Hong Kong, especially mainland-backed companies, have raised HKDollars 40bn (USDollars 5bn) in new equity, excluding warrants. Last year, companies raised HKDollars 70bn including warrants. Much of this money has been raised specifically for China, underlining Hong Kong's growing importance as a supplier of capital to the mainland. However, rapid economic growth in China has brought in its wake resurgent inflation which the mainland authorities have taken measures to suppress. This has done two things: made people think twice about the near term growth prospects for China, and made them ask how much mainland money has been coming into Hong Kong. Ms Janice Wallace, head of research at Goldman Sachs, says: 'If these guys start taking their money home then we will feel it. Liquidity is the real threat to this market.' China-related stocks - known as 'red chips' - account for more than 4 per cent of the value of Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, according to Wardley James Capel, Hong Kong. Chinese officials have warned that mainland investment in Hong Kong will slow. In both Hong Kong and Macao, rumours abound about this project being deferred or that mainland partner withdrawing from a venture because he has come under pressure from mainland banks to repay debt. But the euphoria in Hong Kong surrounding the flotation of nine large and medium-sized Chinese state-owned companies has waned. Tsingtao Brewery went well because it was the first of the nine to come to the market, and local Hong Kong investors knew its product well. Shanghai Petrochemical, the second and largest entrant, was less successful. Its sale in Hong Kong suffered from the company being poorly marketed to investors - the Hong Kong tranche of 850m shares was just 1.7 times oversubscribed - and from being seen to be too highly priced. Concerns about the Chinese economy also took the lustre off the issue. 'A lot of interest in China stocks has been concept driven,' says one analyst. 'They came to the market boasting good backers and good contacts and with the promise that they would do good deals on the mainland. Now, with the retrenchment under way, it is difficult to see what they will do.' Mr Alex Tang, director of research at Dao Heng Securities, agrees. 'On top of the concern about the economy is concern about the controlling shareholders of these companies. What will they put into these listings and will the businesses have good earnings potential? No one knows.' To date, foreign investors appear content to ride out what is seen as an essentially short-term correction. Mr Simon Nicholson, senior Far East investment manager for Gartmore Asset Management, agrees that there are problems. 'It will be a tricky six months in terms of markets,' he says. 'Hong Kong is saturated with new issues, rights issues and placements, and the whole worry about China is that the currency will steadily deteriorate.' The most enthusiastic investors are, unremarkably, the China funds which dedicate their cash to mainland concerns, targeting China plays principally but also unlisted Chinese companies. There are more than 30 China funds with a total investment potential in excess of Dollars 2bn. The problem they face, with the total capitalisation of the Shanghai and Shenzhen B shares hovering below Dollars 1bn, is to find enough places to put their cash. Kleinwort Benson's Dollars 60m China fund, which began operating last autumn, has so far placed only Dollars 16.5m. However, Mr Robin Fox, the fund's chairman, remains confident. 'You only have to spend some time there to see how fast the country's growing,' he says. The jitters in the equity market have been echoed in property. Mainland interests own an estimated USDollars 10bn of residential and commercial property in the colony. Mr Nicholas Brooke, senior partner of surveyors Brooke, Hillier, Parker, says: 'We are seeing a reduction in the number of transactions and mainland interest in the property market. There has definitely been a cooling, but we have a number of large deals in the pipeline and there is no indication that the mainland counterpart has been told to pull out.' One thing that Hong Kong has in its favour is that no one, including the Chinese central government, knows the extent of mainland investment in the colony. This is because Hong Kong has become a place where the public duties of mainland Communist party officials overlap with their private financial interests. Mainland interests in Hong Kong, if asked, will be understating their assets in the colony.</p>

Link-ups between the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), NAFTA and  other countries such as Australia were the sort of  inter-regional ties which could ensure that economic groupings  in the Asia-Pacific region remained part of an open global  trading system, he said.    He was speaking on the opening day of the 10th general  meeting of the Pacific Economic Co-operation Council (PECC) on  "Open Regionalism: The Way Forward".    Under AFTA, the six ASEAN countries will reduce their taxes  and tariffs on trade between them to 5 per cent or less by 2008.  NAFTA is a comprehensive free trade area comprising the United  States,Canada, and Mexico.    Mr. Yeo told reporters yesterday that Singapore hoped an  AFTA-NAFTA link could be developed along the lines of ASEAN's "6  minus X" formula.    Under this formula, those which are ready to proceed do so,  while the others can join when they are ready.    He was elaborating on his comment during the Pacific leaders  forum on open regionalism that while an AFTA-NAFTA linkage would  take time to develop, "we are prepared to take smaller steps  first".    He proposed in his speech that "concentric and overlapping  circles of linkages" could reconcile regionalism with  multilateralism and prevent the danger of trade blocs developing.    Singapore's concentric circles range from its Growth  Triangle  with immediate neighbours, Indonesia and Malaysia, through AFTA  to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) grouping, he  said.    While all this collaboration was of mutual benefit to those  involved, "economic relations cannot be conducted on the basis  of strict geometry".    "These concentric circles of linkages have to be  complemented  by linkages that overlap or stretch across circles," he said.  [passage omitted on Thai deputy prime minister's speech]    PECC's member committees come from the ASEAN countries,  Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, Japan,  South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia, Taiwan, the  United States, and the Pacific island nations.</p>

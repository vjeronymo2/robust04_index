			<p>BFN     [Text] The Philippines armed forces chief of staff said  arrangements for security and stability in the Asia-Pacific  region are not required with organizations like ASEAN in place.  Lieutenant General Arturo Enrile made the point at the opening  of the exercise Anoa Singa 2/94 in Singapore today. He said  that exercises like Anoa Singa can serve as a model for  bilateral training arrangements among ASEAN member nations.    General Enrile and Singapore's chief of Defense Force, Major  General Ng Jui Ping, officiated at the opening of the seven-day  exercise. Anoa Singa will see over 1,000 men involved in the  battalion-level war games exercise.</p>

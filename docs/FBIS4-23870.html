			<p>BFN     [Text] The eight Guinean senior officers who were arrested  at the end of last week were released, today, Thursday.  According to the Guinean interior minister, the reports of a  coup bid are totally unfounded. We have a report from Nicolas  Balique:    [Balique] Official sources in Conakry said this morning that  the reports of a coup bid were, I quote, totally unfounded. On  the other hand, the arrest a week ago of a dozen or so senior  officers was confirmed, without the reason behind this being  given. Among these officers was Commander Oulare, the deputy  chief of staff of the air force, and Captain (Noumbouya), in  command of the battalion of airborne troops. They were released  today, Thursday, and it has even been pointed out that this  afternoon one of them was due to lead the battalion with the  task of welcoming President Lansana Conte back from the OAU  [Organization of African Unity] summit.    In fact these arrests are reported to have followed a secret  meeting held by the group of officers, the subject of which was  basically political, while it is noted in Conakry that a  military man has an obligation to remain apolitical. It is  impossible to establish whether a coup plan was indeed being  considered. The release of the eight men may confirm the  regime's desire to take the heat out of the situation  [dedramatiser la situation] and to avoid the sound of boots  being heard in Guinea once again.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Gao Ningsheng (7559 1337 3932)] </F>   [Text] Yinchuan, 27 Mar (XINHUA) -- Ningxia's radio  broadcasting and television service has developed rapidly in the  nineties. In 1993, the radio broadcasting coverage rate rose to  76.3 percent from 68.9 percent in 1989 and became higher than  the nation's average for the first time. In the same five-year  period, the television coverage rate rose 18 percent from 61.8  percent to 79.8 percent.    In Ningxia and particularly in its southern mountainous  region where information and transportation facilities are poor,  people learn of new policies and information and acquire science  and technology knowledge mainly through radio broadcasts and  television. In the five years, the autonomous region and various  cities and counties themselves invested a total of 80 million  yuan in radio and television facilities, in addition to  obtaining 4 million yuan in state assistance. Thus, the  development of radio broadcasting and the television service was  accelerated.    The region spent more than 20 million yuan on updating radio  broadcasting equipment and on repairing circuits. Twelve  county-level FM radio stations have been set up, and the FM  broadcasts cover more than 60 cities, counties, and townships in  the region. The region's radio broadcasting as a whole, with a  total transmission power of 268 kw, covers 89.3 percent of  townships and towns and 57.16 percent of villages. The Luoshan  FM station, with a transmission power of 6 kw and which will  cost more than 1 million yuan to build, will be completed this  year. After it begins operating, the radio broadcasting  coverage rate in the southern mountainous region will increase  to 78 percent.    As of 1993, there were five television stations and more  than  10 television relay stations in Ningxia. The Central Television  Program One Network covers 74.26 percent of Ningxia, and the  programs of Ningxia's own television stations cover 75.46  percent of the region. All counties in the southern mountainous  region receive television programs from more than three stations.</p>

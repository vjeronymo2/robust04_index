The Armenians had to retreat, sustaining heavy losses, from  two villages they had seized earlier -- Shirvanly and  Garagashly. Fighting is now continuing ten kilometers northeast  of Agdam.    The ministry said that the enemy continued shelling villages  in northwestern Azerbaijan.    In a separate report, the press centre of the  Nagorno-Karabakh defence army said earlier today that heavy  fighting continued throughout last night and most of the day on  Monday after Azerbaijani troops launched an offensive in the  direction of Agdam.    The press centre said the operation involved tanks and  aviation. Reports from Stepanakert, capital of Nagorno-Karabakh,  said that Karabakh fighters were repelling the attack,  inflicting severe damage on the enemy.</p>

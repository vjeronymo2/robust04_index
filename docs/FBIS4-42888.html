			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ewa Thibaud report: "Social Democratic EU Supporters </F> Polish Their Arguments"]    [Text] Yes, indeed. Of course it will be possible to  pursue Social Democratic policies if Sweden becomes a member of  the EU [European Union], in the view of the Social Democratic EU  supporters. Yesterday they made public their debate document in  preparation for the party extraordinary congress.    "It will be harder work and more difficult to pursue a  Social  Democratic policy in Sweden if we remain outside th EU," Mats  Hellstrom, the party's EU spokesman, said.    The Social Democrats' pro-EU group is therefore voicing  views  that are completely different from those of the no-side which  made its view public last week. While the no-side believes that  membership is a threat to democracy, the yes-side says that  membership will save Sweden from the "dictatorship of the  market."    "First we have to get a Social Democratic government. But  that is not enough in itself," Ines Uusman, chairman of Social  Democrats for the EU, said.    She explained her reasons for making propaganda for the EU  somewhat in the manner of Pastor Jansson by comparing the EU to  a potato peeler.    "Politics is like a potato. It is good and useful, and can  be used for many things. But it is more useful if you have a  potato peeler. The EU is one such potato peeler."    Mats Hellstrom's argument was a little simpler. He talked  about the reshaping of Europe.    "It is now that things are happening. And we Social  Democrats in Sweden are self-confident. We know that we have  something to contribute and we want to be involved and exert an  influence."    To questions of finances the Social Democrats have woolly  answers. According to Mats Hellstrom, they do not need to put  forward any detailed proposals about how the contribution to the  EU is to be paid, not before the government has made it clear  how the contributions from the EU are to be allocated and how  great the net cost of membership will be. The Social Democratic  yes-group is expecting a bill of 10 billion kronor.    "The money must come from production," Ines Uusman replied.    She gave some clarification by mentioning large farmers and  property owners. These will have an "EU duty" imposed on them.    "The end result must be neutral from the point of view of  the  distribution of wealth," Mats Hellstrom.    This means that no one should profit from Sweden's becoming  a  member of the EU. If anyone does profit that profit must be  taken from him or her. Mats Hellstrom also thought that the  government and the Federation of Swedish Farmers are currently  overestimating the profits for farmers.    "The contribution from the EU will chiefly go to compensate  for price cuts," he said.    Leif "Blomman" Blomberg and Kerstin Alnebratt from Goteborg  also took part in yesterday's presentation of the yes-program.    "Blomman" said that his strongest reason for being in favor  of membership is trade union cooperation. Kerstin Alnebratt  said that the EEA [European Economic Area] is not enough.    "It is not enough to be part of a market."    However, the program declares that the biggest tragedy if  the  Swedes were to choose to remain outside the Eu is that the  Social Democratic Party would then lose its membership in the  ESP, the European social democrats' party.</p>

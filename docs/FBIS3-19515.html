			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "sm": "Bluem Wants a New Basic Law for Job </F> Security"]    [Text] Bonn, 14 Feb--Labor Minister Norbert Bluem of the  Christian Demoractic Union (CDU) wants the legislature to pass  the long expected new rules on working hours and occupational  health and safety prior to the Bundestag elections. In addition,  the 1994 Job Creation Act is to stimulate the labor market, and  farmers' wives are to be provided with a social insurance  program of their own.    The labor minister's most important objective, however, is  to  have a nursing insurance law passed during the current  legislative session. Bluem's draft calls for a new social  nursing insurance which initially provides for outpatient  nursing services and, as of 1996, financial support for home  care as well. Initially, the new nursing insurance will be paid  for with a 1-percent payroll tax up to the assessment limits on  health insurance, and that tax will be raised to 1.7 percent  once the second phase of the program commences. The program  would spell relief for the health insurance program, for the  government in its expenditures for the care of war victims, and  local governments and the laender in their social welfare  budgets.    The government coalition and the Social Democratic Party  (SPD) agree that industry should not be additionally burdened  with the contributions for the new nursing care program. Which  is why a way is being sought to make the working population pay  for the program in its entirety. To make up for employer  contributions, the SPD whose support is required in the  Bundesrat would like to have Whitsun Monday declared a workday  and to shift the Day of Prayer and Repentance from Wednesday to  Friday.    For its part, the coalition is calling for lower holiday pay  which may be compensated for by relinquishing leave time, by  additional work or by transforming one holiday during the first  phase and a second one during the second phase at the land  level. The SPD is opposed to this on the grounds that it  represents interference in the right to free collective  bargaining guaranteed by the constitution.    On 24 February the joint Bundestag-Bundesrat conference  committee will try to work out a compromise once more. If it  does not succeed, the nursing care project will not come up for  a vote during this legislative session. There is lively  speculation in Bonn whether Bluem will continue in his post in  that case.    The 1994 Job Creation Act is part of the action program for  economic growth and jobs which the coalition hopes will provide  a new stimulus to the labor market in the face of 4 million  unemployed and the upcoming elections. Since there is no money  in the Bonn treasury for job programs costing billions, the  primary focus of the planned measures is on bringing about  improvement by licensing private employment agencies, on paying  for more job programs with existing funds by lowering wages on  the secondary labor market and on increasing the incentive for  Job Creation Program employees to look for jobs on the primary  labor market.    The Labor Ministry has merely provided help in drafting  these  programs. The political authorship does not rest with Bluem but  is claimed by the experts on economics and job market issues of  the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] and FDP [Free Democratic  Party] parliamentary caucuses.    Th new legislation dealing with working hours is designed to  replace regulations on working hours established in 1938. Bluem  views those regulations as providing for maximum limits on  working hours and minimum standards for health and safety. It  will be up to business and labor to agree on actual working  hours within the limits of the law.    Bluem and Guenter Rexrodt (FDP), the economics minister,  have  long been at odds on what to do about work on Sundays. The draft  legislation continues to call for a ban on work on Sundays and  holidays but also for a number of exceptions, among other things  in the interest of job security. According to Bluem's timetable,  final deliberations by the Bundesrat on the new legislation on  working hours are to take place on 18 March.    Bluem wants the Bundesrat to give its approval to the new  omnibus industrial health and safety bill on 20 May. This law is  designed to improve health and safety standards at the factory  level and to summarize and clarify the numerous existing  regulations.    For the first time ever, the health and safety bill  establishes basic, uniform rules on workplace health and safety  standards to be followed by employers and employees in all job  groups and activities, including public services. The obsolete  trading regulations governing health and safety in the workplace  will thus be replaced by a basic health and safety law which  conforms to EC standards. Bluem's draft also includes the  regulations contained in the existing health and safety law  concerning medical advice for employees by factory physicians  and experts for workplace safety. The existing health and safety  can therefore be revoked.    The centerpiece of the agricultural social reform measures  which Bluem has prepared in collaboration with Agriculture  Minister Jochen Borchert (CDU) is a social welfare program for  farmers' wives. They are designated as entrepreneurs in the  old-age insurance program for farmers. Farmers' wives active  prior to the introduction of the reform measures will be able to  vote for or against inclusion in a social welfare program of  their own.    In the political debate vehement criticism was voiced about  the fact that farmers' wives will receive taxpayer-funded  pensions of their own without contributing to the retirement  scheme themselves. Bluem hopes that the agricultural social  reform bill which also calls for new rules on contributions will  pass the Bundesrat on 29 April.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Aeroflot Seeks to Join IATA: The Soviet airline Aeroflot applied to join the  187-member International Air Transportation Assn., IATA said. IATA spokesman  John Brindley said acceptance was a formality and Aeroflot, the largest  non-IATA airline in the world, should become a member within two or three  weeks. He said it was not likely to affect Aeroflot fares, since IATA fare  decisions are not binding, but it was likely to help bring Aeroflot procedures  and documentation into line with international practice. Airlines also can  exchange information quickly through IATA in the event of a hijacking or bomb  threat.  </P></p>

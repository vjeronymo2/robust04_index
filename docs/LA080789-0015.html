			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Two top-of-the-line Soviet fighters accompanied by the world's largest aircraft  made a historic stop at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska, en route to a  "sales mission" in Canada. It was the first time that MIG-29 fighters and the  Soviet An-225 transport had landed on the North American continent. "These are  showroom models," said Maj. Doug McCoy, an Elmendorf spokesman who was  referring to the pair of stripped-down MIG-29s. After a refueling stop in  Alaska they were to be escorted to the Canadian border by U.S. Air Force F-15  Eagles.  </P></p>

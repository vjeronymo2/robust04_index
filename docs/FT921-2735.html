			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Danish cleaning group in 41% advance as sales rise ISS, the Danish cleaning services group, yesterday reported an increase in operating profits of 41 per cent to DKr582m (Dollars 90m) on turnover up by 23 per cent at DKr11.8bn. Profits after financial items and goodwill write-offs rose by 24 per cent to DKr329m and net profits were 19 per cent higher at DKr244m. Earnings per share increased to DKr56 from DKr55. The company is paying an unchanged DKr10 per share dividend on increased capital. The acquisition of Electrolux's Swedish cleaning services company, ABAB, last year added DKr1.3bn to sales. However, there was an increase of 21 per cent in sales in the European (excluding Scandinavia) division of which almost none was explained by acquisitions. In the UK, Mediclean, the hospital cleaning services company, has doubled turnover to about DKr500m since ISS acquired the company three years ago. Earnings were also satisfactory, said Mr Poul Andreassen, group chief executive. No major acquisitions are planned for this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pavel Anokhin: "Mutiny on Board the PRES. Will </F> Konstantin Zatulin Remain Duma Committee Chairman?"]    [Text] Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of a State Duma  committee, has announced his resignation from the post of senior  secretary of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord]  faction. Among the many reasons which prompted him to do this  he mentioned "the impossibility of collectively formulating,  discussing, and implementing party policy in a serious way." In  Zatulin's opinion its most serious problem as of today is the  question "with whom and against whom the PRES will be in future  presidential and parliamentary elections." He expressed his  fear in the words of Solzhenitsyn: "There is a risk that the  party could remain the Moscow entourage of its ambitious leader  and that its members could inherit the lot of hostages in a  political game they do not understand."    The discord among the faction's leaders has immediately  raised the following question point-blank: Will Zatulin  continue to head the Committee for CIS Affairs and Ties With  Compatriots, or will the PRES try to replace him with a more  reliable representative of its own? Faction member Sergey  Shulgin, chairman of the Duma subcommittee for tax and customs  legislation, prefers to call what has occurred not a split but a  redistribution of duties -- Zatulin has been extremely heavily  burdened with Duma committee matters. Nevertheless, Shulgin  said, "I am surprised by Zatulin's words concerning Sergey  Shakhray's 'dictatorial' ways. Rather, it is the author of the  reproaches himself who suffers from this. Shakhray is quite a  democratic man. When he attends sessions of the faction --  which rarely happens -- he conducts them evenhandedly and  properly, taking account of all opinions. If Zatulin does leave  the faction, he is not obliged to quit the chairmanship of the  State Duma committee. We voted against making deputies'  mandates imperative. We should proceed from the premise that  Zatulin's nomination may have brought a certain percentage of  votes to the PRES in the elections and helped our candidates  into parliament."    Sergey Shapovalov, chairman of the State Duma Committee for  Federation and Regional Policy Affairs, is convinced that it is  a question of conflicts over certain political questions which  are being decided within the association. The question of  whether the PRES representative should hold the chairmanship of  the Committee for CIS Affairs and Ties With Compatriots should  he leave the deputies' faction is a complex one. The State Duma  statute contains no legal rules defining such actions. When we  voted en bloc for the chairmen and deputy chairmen of  committees, Shapovalov said, we did not envisage such a turn of  events. An amendment must now be made, because this problem  could arise in other factions as well. "Personally I believe  that if a `party' deputy leaves a faction, the faction is  entitled to raise in the Duma the question of replacing him with  another member of the faction. Otherwise this will destroy the  mechanism for pursuing party policy in parliament."</p>

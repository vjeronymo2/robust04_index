			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EVERT MAKES 49 UNFORCED ERRORS, FALLS TO ANNE MINTER  </P> <P> Chris Evert, retiring after next week's U.S. Open, committed 49 unforced errors  Wednesday night and lost to Anne Minter of Australia in the second round of the  Player's Challenge tennis championship at Toronto.  </P> <P> "I'm rusty," said Evert, who lost, 6-4, 7-5. "I haven't played a tournament in  six weeks.  </P> <P> "I paid the price of not having played a match since Wimbledon. It's  uncharacteristic of me for the past 18 years not to have been in every point.  That's one of the reasons why I'm retiring."  </P> <P> Evert, seeded third, credited Minter with "playing a great match."  </P> <P> Minter, ranked No. 41 in the world, said it was "an honor" to play Evert again  before she retires.  </P> <P> "I feel sorry for her," Minter said. "I know she wanted to go out on a good  note."  </P> <P> In another upset, seventh-seeded Hana Mandlikova lost to unseeded Jana  Pospisilova, 1-6, 6-1, 7-5.  </P> <P> Other players advancing were No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, who beat Jo-Anne  Faull, 6-1 6-4; No. 9 Helen Kelesi of Canada, who beat Czech Regina Rajchrtova,  6-1, 6-2, and No. 15 Sylvia Hanika of West Germany, who eliminated American  Shauna Stafford, 6-2, 7-5.  </P> <P> Mandlikova, 27, a Czech who has become an Australian citizen, said her legs  felt heavy and that she was weary during her loss.  </P> <P> "I don't really think she won the match, I think I lost it," Mandlikova said.  "I was tired. I've played four weeks in a row. That's not an excuse. She played  good."  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl and Aaron Krickstein each won in straight sets in the first round of  the Hamlet Challenge Cup tournament in Jericho, N.Y.  </P> <P> Lendl, seeded first, defeated Guillermo Perez-Roldan of Argentina, 6-4, 6-2.  No. 5 Aaron Krickstein beat Andres Gomez of Ecuador, 6-4, 6-3.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 30 May (PL) -- The president of the  Federation of University Students [FEU], Otto Rivero, confirmed  today that the approximately 8,000 students who will graduate  this year from Cuba's universities have job guarantees despite  Cuba's adverse economic situation.    Rivero said the conclusion of the school year is less than  45  days away and already 7,000 graduating university seniors have  been informed where they will have a job. There are ongoing  talks with authorities to determine where the rest will work.  Rivero said a great effort is being made to guarantee jobs for  all graduating students.    Cuba is enduring severe economic difficulties following the  loss of its main foreign markets as a result of the  disappearance of the socialist camp in Europe and of the Soviet  Union and as a result also of the tightened economic blockade  imposed on Cuba by the United States more than three decades ago.</p>

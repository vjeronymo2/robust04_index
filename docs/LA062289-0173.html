			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARAMOUNT SAYS ANTITRUST HURDLES HAVE BEEN CLEARED  </P> <P> Paramount Communications, which launched a hostile $10.7-billion offer for Time  Inc. two weeks ago, cleared certain federal antitrust agency hurdles Wedneday  but conceded in court documents that it is not prepared to purchase shares by  July 5, the date its tender offer for Time is due to expire.  </P> <P> Lawyers for Paramount told a Connecticut judge that Paramount awaits an initial  decision by the Delaware court where the company has sued to overturn some of  Time's anti-takeover defenses, including Time's recent move to acquire Warner  Communications for $14 billion. The next hearing in the Delaware case is set  for July 11.  </P> <P> Paramount's disclosure was made in response to a Connecticut lawsuit filed last  week by American Television &amp; Communications Corp., a cable TV company 82%  owned by Time. The cable firm's suit alleges that it would be forced to breach  some of its financial agreements and franchises with local governments if  Paramount is allowed to proceed with its tender offer without first obtaining  the requisite license transfers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confirmed by Paramount  </P> <P> The Paramount admission in court was called to the attention of reporters by  ATC but subsequently confirmed by Paramount. "We intend to extend our  expiration date until after the (Delaware) court hearing and a decision," said  Jerry Sherman, Paramount's vice president of corporate communications.  </P> <P> Sherman added: "Despite the efforts of Time to stir up opposition with  misinformation, we expect to get cable franchise approval where required by  state and local law in an orderly and expeditious way."  </P> <P> Separately, Paramount said the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice  Department's antitrust division notified the company that a 15-day review  period has ended without the agencies challenging the takeover on antitrust  grounds.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the price of Time shares rebounded slightly after a three-day  decline. Time shares gained $4.75 to close at $157.25, while Warner dropped $1  to close at $58.50.  </P> <P> "People are coming to realize that the game is not over yet," said an analyst,  suggesting that another offer for Time may emerge.  </P> <P> Separately, Paramount is believed to have asked the New York Stock Exchange to  determine if a Time acquisition of Warner would require a shareholder vote.  </P> <P> An exchange official, without commenting on the Paramount request, said, "As a  standard procedure, we will review any deal of this nature that involves one of  our listed companies."  </P></p>

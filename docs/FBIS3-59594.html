			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "New EC Proposal on HDTV Transmission Standards"] </F>   [Text] Brussels--The European Commission [EC] is going to  propose a new directive (Europe-wide law) on high-definition  television (HDTV) to promote popularization of wide-format  television (16/9 width-height ratio) that will be applicable  independent of the transmission standard used, according to  Community sources.    This new proposal follows the Twelve's decision last June to  promote wide-screen television in the HDTV action program and  abandon any reference to a single, mandatory transmission  standard. Initially, the Commission had planned to make the  D2-MAC and High Definition-MAC (HD-MAC) standards obligatory.    The new proposal, to be submitted to member states on 7  December, provides that television services transmitted to  viewers by cable, satellite, or ground-based broadcasting  stations must utilize either D2-MAC or a transmission system 100  percent compatible with PAL or SECAM standards. Among other  things, that should permit use of the German "PAL Plus" standard  now under development.    For services not fully digitized, the Commission proposal  endorses the HD-MAC transmission system. Experts expect digital  transmission standards to evolve rapidly in the coming years.  The Commission stipulates however that digital transmission  systems will have to be "standardized by a European  standardization body."    The proposed directive also says that "any wide-format  (16/9)  television service that is picked up and rebroadcast by cable  systems must be rebroadcast in the wide (16/9) format."</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Polisario pulls out of Western Sahara talks UNITED Nations efforts to resolve the long-standing dispute over the former Spanish territory of Western Sahara suffered a sharp setback yesterday after the Polisario Front refused to enter scheduled talks with Morocco. Initiated three months ago in the Western Sahara capital, Laayoune, these were to have resumed in New York on Monday in the presence of the UN mediator, Mr Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan, a former foreign minister of Pakistan. But the Polisario declined to participate because the Moroccan delegation included former officials of the nationalist movement who have thrown in their lot with Morocco, which claims sovereignty over the territory. Announcing the breakdown, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, spoke of a 'critical' situation. But he reaffirmed his determination to work for the UN-supervised referendum which was supposed to have been held almost two years ago but which continues to be held up by a dispute over who should be entitled to vote. Mr Boutros Ghali, who has returned to New York from London following an extensive trip abroad, including a visit to Somalia, was to report on the crisis and other issues arising from his visits to a meeting of the Security Council last night.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. M. Mashimov; UDC 528.33] </F>   [Abstract] As the end of the 20th century approaches and  the new century is in the offing, there is a wide array of  problems which must be dealt with in order to solve problems in  astrogeodesy, geodynamics and cartography. These include  organization of a planetary geocentric coordinate system, a  global position system and a VLBI network; study of the figure,  physical fields and internal structure of the Earth with  allowance for their secular, long- and short-period changes with  time; determination of an inertial coordinate reference system,  parameters of rotation of the Earth and polar movement; study of  the figures and physical fields of the moon, planets and their  satellites and defining coordinate reference systems for the  Moon, Venus, Mars and other planets; determination of the center  of inertia of the Earth-Moon system for the epoch; organization  of state astrogeodetic, geodetic, gravimetric and vertical  control networks; organization of special- purpose local, sea  and space geodetic networks; tie-in of different coordinate  systems and physical fields; astrogeodetic, gravimetric and  cartographic support for astroengineering programs in near and  distant space; astrogeodetic, gravimetric and cartographic  support for study of crustal movements, lithospheric plates and  the continents, changes in sea level and the world ocean,  prediction of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and catastrophes  of different types; monitoring of natural and technogenic  environments; implementation of land, sea and aerospace surveys;  production of graphic, digital and electronic topographic and  thematic maps. These problems cannot be solved without the  coordination of long-term scientific and technical programs in  the field of astrogeodesy, geodynamics and cartography during  1995-2010 by the academies of sciences of the CIS and  Rosgosstandard. The article discusses the organization of a  network of astrogeodetic observatories (AGO) for uniformly  covering the entire area of the country and the requirements on  a new highly accurate fundamental astrogeodetic network, without  which work on the enumerated problems is without promise. The  work of the AGO, on which the entire network hinges, also is  described, as is the role played by GLONASS, Navstar and Lageos  satellites. Work already done and that which is planned is  outlined. How the basic system and its subsystems will allow  solution of key problems is discussed.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Watchdog steps in over ADollars 500m bid for Foodland The ADollars 500m (USDollars 367.6m) bid by Rank Commercial of New Zealand for Foodland Associated, the Western Australian grocery group, took a dramatic turn yesterday when the Trade Practices Commission, Australia's competition watchdog, went to court to prevent the bidder lodging or issuing formal offer documents. The commission, which had said earlier that it was examining the offer for anti-competitive implications, said it was unhappy with the potential acquisition of Foodland's Australian assets by Coles Myers, one of the nation's largest retail groups. If the offer by Rank - a private company owned by Mr Graeme Hart, a New Zealand entrepreneur - is successful, the bidder intends to split up Foodland's assets. It would sell the NZ assets on to Whitcoulls, a stationery and book retailer, while Coles Myers would have an option to acquire the Australian assets for around ADollars 250m. Yesterday the commission said it 'had formed the view that the acquisition of Foodland by Coles Myer would substantially lessen competition and therefore constitute breach of the Trade Practices Act'. It asked the court for an interim injunction to prevent the formal 'part A' offer documents being either lodged or issued. The judge who was hearing the case reserved judgment until today. The concerns rest partly on the potential hold which Coles Myers could obtain on the Western Australian grocery market, where Foodland has a 54 per cent share of the wholesale trade. Coles would also take over Foodland's half-share in Australian Liquor Marketers, the country's largest liquor wholesaler, and its minority stake in Independent Holdings, the grocery independent. Vox, the ailing Perth-based retailer, is to sell its core retail division to a subsidiary of Brierley Investments.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, February 13 (TANJUG) -- Special United  Nations envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi has stopped  the artillery withdrawal around Sarajevo assessing that the  Bosnian Serbs' heavy weapons could be efficiently controlled  where they are at present, Chief of the General Staff of the  Serbian Army General Manojlo Milovanovic said on Sunday.    "The reason for stopping the withdrawal of artillery pieces  is that the U.N. peacekeepers (UNPROFOR) are unable to secure  efficient control of the Moslem infantry, which is envisaged by  an agreement reached by the Moslem and Serb sides and UNPROFOR,"  General Milovanovic told a press conference after meeting with  Chief of the UNPROFOR Command for Bosnia Angus Ramsey.    General Milovanovic and Ramsey met at Pale, the political  centre of the Bosnian Serb Republic, to discuss Sarajevo's  demilitarization and control of the agreed ceasefire which took  effect at noon on Thursday.    The Bosnian Serb army has proposed that its artillery be  controlled on its present positions with simultaneous control of  the Moslem infantry because the Serb heavy weapons are a balance  to the more numerous Moslem infantry, General Milovanovic said.    As UNPROFOR has failed to secure the control of the Moslem  infantry Milovanovic said he did not allow the Serb artillery to  be withdrawn.    The relevant documents, including NATO's ultimatum, do not  insist categorically on a withdrawal of the artillery because  they use the terms "withdrawal" and "placing under UNPROFOR  control," he said.    "We have fulfilled our obligation by accepting to put our  artillery under control on condition that the same is done with  the Moslem infantry," General Milovanovic said.    Asked whether he took NATO threats seriously, he replied  that, as a soldier, he did.    "I don't know what NATO will do but I know what we'll do -  we'll defend ourselves," he said.    The North Atlantic Council on Wednesday gave ten days to the  Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons 20 kilometres from  the centre of Sarajevo or to place them under UNPROFOR control,  or their positions would be bombed.    NATO also demanded from the Moslem side to place its heavy  arms under UNPROFOR control.</p>

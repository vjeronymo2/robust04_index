Korea received orders for 9 million tons of shipping, or 40  percent of the world's total of 20 million tons, compared to 6.5  million tons, or 32 percent, for Japan, the economic daily said.  But Japan was first for the 37th consecutive year in volume of  ships built at about 7.5 million tons, compared with 4.5 million  to 5 million tons for Korea.    According to Lloyd's register of shipbuilding, Korea began  its climb to the top with 5.73 million tons of orders in 1990,  when it surpassed 5 million tons for the first time.    The newspaper attributed Korea's jump in volume of orders to  the strong Japanese yen and weak Korean won, which enabled  Korean yards to rapidly increase orders for ships to be  completed in one or two years.    The Japanese Shipbuilders' Association said that Japan will  retain first place in actual volume of ships built because it  has much more capacity than Korea.</p>

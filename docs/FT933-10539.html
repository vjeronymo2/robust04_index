			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The ERM: EC economies, the opportunities and risks - Denmark When Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, Danish central bank governor, explained on Monday why the krone had been subject to speculative attacks - although 'fundamentally it is the soundest economy in Europe' - he referred to the country's large foreign debt, accumulated in the 1970s and 1980s, writes Hilary Barnes. Past policy failures explain why the government and the central bank have strongly resisted a devaluation and why there has been little pressure for one from exporters. Denmark committed itself to a strong krone policy in 1982 after a period of high inflation, frequent devaluations, a large central government budget deficit and persistent large deficits on the current account of the balance of payments under a succession of Social Democratic party governments. Considerable political capital was invested in the strong krone policy, which brought gradual dividends with lower inflation (under one per cent over the past 12 months) and, from 1989, a surplus on the current account. When the Social Democrats returned to power at the head of a coalition government in January after more than 10 years in opposition it was vital that they showed there would be no return to the pre-1982 policies. They saw off a speculative attack on the krone in the spring and put up a stout defence again last week. Since Sunday night interest rates have not been lowered and a tight hold on liquidity has been maintained to punish speculators who built up positions against the krone in July. Yesterday it was charging 25 per cent for one-month lending to the commercial banks.</p>

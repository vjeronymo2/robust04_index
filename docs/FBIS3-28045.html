The letters say that the proposal to realise the  reunification of the country in the form of confederation based  on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments put  forward by President Kim Il-song in his New Year address is the  most realistic and fair one suitable to the conditions of Korea.    They express firm solidarity with the Korean people in their  just struggle to resolve the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula through dialogue and negotiation.    They promise strengthened support and solidarity for the  struggle of the Korean people for national reunification this  year and wish President Kim Il-song good health and long life  for the victory of the socialist cause and a world-wide victory  of the cause of independence.</p>

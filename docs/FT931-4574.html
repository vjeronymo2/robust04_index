			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: A question of duty for Samsung - Electronics group awaits key US decision on tariffs THE STAKES are high for Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest electronics group, as it anxiously awaits a decision from Washington on whether the US will impose dumping duties on its semiconductors. Such penalties could pose a serious threat to the com-pany's profitability. Samsung Electronics, the flagship of the Samsung industrial conglomerate, reported a 5.5 per increase in net earnings to Won72.4bn (Dollars 91m) in 1992 as sales rose by 16.7 per cent to Won6,103bn. The semiconductor division, although accounting for only 22 per cent of total sales, is the main source of the earnings for the company. Analysts estimate that the division generated taxable profits of Won110bn last year. Its larger consumer electronics division, with 54 per cent of turnover, provided Won10bn in pre-tax profits, while telecommunications added another Won25bn, according to analysts. The personal computer operations incurred estimated losses of Won35bn. Pre-tax profits for the group were Won111.6bn - an increase of 21.2 per cent. It is considered unlikely the US will penalise Samsung Electronics with the 87.4 per cent dumping duty on 1M and 4M dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) chips it proposed last autumn. This was in response to a complaint from Micron Technology, the US concern which provided Samsung with semiconductor technology in the 1980s. But even a much lower duty could reduce semiconductor exports to the US, which purchased more than half of the company's output of D-Ram chips last year. 'Anything above a 15 per cent dumping duty would be bad news for the company,' said Mr Hwang Sung-june, electronics analyst for WI Carr in Seoul. The US Commerce Department is expected on Monday to determine the level of dumping duty, while a decision on whether to impose it will be made by the end of next month. The US action follows a decision by the EC last year to apply a self-regulating pricing policy to Korean chipmakers after the EC threatened to impose dumping duties. Samsung is increasing semiconductor shipments to south-east Asia in response to the trade problems with the US and Europe. Samsung is the world's fifth-largest producer of memory chips and the biggest producer of D-Ram chips, which account for 70 per cent of its intergrated circuit production. The group's strategic importance to South Korea as one of the country's few competitive high-technology companies and its second-biggest listed concern may force the government to support it with increased subsidised loans and other financial aid for research and investment if the dumping duties seriously threaten profits. Earnings are already under pressure due to the company's heavy research and capital expenditures, which total more than Dollars 1bn annually. Its 1992 research and development budget of Won460bn was the biggest among Korean companies, with almost half devoted to semiconductors. The ambitious R&amp;D effort has paid off with the recent development of what was claimed to be the world's first laboratory model of the 64M D-Ram chip. It also spent Won740bn last year to build a production line for 16M D-Ram chips and modernise consumer electronics factories. But R&amp;D and capital spending increased its debt/equity to an estimated 320 per cent last year. The looming challenges confronting Samsung Electronics forced a management reorganisation in December, with the company's four previously autonomous divisions being placed under the direct control of a new president, Mr Kim Kwang-ho, who was formerly head of the semiconductor division. The management consolidation was considered necessary to correct problems stemming from the 1988 merger between the Samsung Electronics and Samsung Semiconductor and Telecommunications. A slimmer management structure is meant to end the duplication of research and sales activities among the four divisions, while promoting faster decision-making. Samsung has recently forged technical alliances with other chipmakers to reduce production costs. It signed an agreement in December to produce advanced 'flash' memory chips developed by Toshiba. Samsung will also manufacture semiconductor chips at a Texas Instruments' plant in Portugal, while it plans to make semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a joint venture with Dainippon Screen of Japan. Analysts believe that improved prospects for consumer electronics and telecommunications might balance a possible profit fall for semi-conductors. The consumer electronics division is cutting manufacturing costs by moving facilities to low-wage countries, with the production of microwave ovens in Malaysia, refrigerators in the Czech Republic and VCRs in China. The depreciation of the Korean won has helped increase exports of consumer electronics to south-east Asia and Latin America, which are emerging as new markets as sales slow in the US and Europe. Domestic demand is also expected to expand this year as the economy recovers to an estimated growth rate of 6 per cent. Public procurement of telecommunications equipment, such as Samsung's telephone exchanges, is also expected to rise this year with the installation of a new cellular telephone system. But Samsung is likely to suffer continuing losses in its personal computer business due to fierce competition and price-cutting in this sector.</p>

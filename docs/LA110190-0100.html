			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'COTTON CLUB' TRIAL OPENS WITH TALES OF GREED, DRUGS, MURDER;  </P> <P> COURT: A REPUTED COCAINE DEALER IS ACCUSED OF HIRING THREE MEN TO KILL A  PRODUCER AFTER A MOVIE DEAL WENT SOUR. HER LAWYER SAYS SHE WAS FRAMED.  </P> <P> Seven years after the bullet-riddled body of theatrical impresario Roy Radin  was found in a remote canyon, a reputed cocaine dealer and three former  bodyguards of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt went on trial Wednesday in a case  that will explore the underside of Hollywood.  </P> <P> In opening the so-called "Cotton Club" trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn  told Los Angeles Superior Court jurors that Radin was killed by the former  bodyguards on orders from co-defendant Karen DeLayne (Lanie) Greenberger, who  was angry after being denied a share of profits from a movie deal she helped  organize between Radin and producer Robert Evans.  </P> <P> Greenberger also suspected Radin of helping one of her former associates steal  $200,000 in cash and 10 kilograms of cocaine from her home, the prosecutor  alleged.  </P> <P> "Each of the defendants were involved in a conspiracy to kidnap and kill Roy  Radin," Conn said. "And each defendant did it for one purpose only: for  financial gain and for their own personal greed."  </P> <P> Conn called the former bodyguards "hired guns."  </P> <P> "She is the only person in this courtroom who had a personal problem with Mr.  Radin," he said, referring to Greenberger.  </P> <P> But Greenberger's attorney, Edward Shohat, countered that his client had been  framed. He suggested reputed Miami drug runner Milan Bellechesses, the father  of Greenberger's child, was actually behind the crime and should be on trial.  </P> <P> Bellechesses has not been charged in the case.  </P> <P> "Lanie Greenberger was set up, used, literally and figuratively, to take the  rap for the murder of Roy Radin," Shohat said.  </P> <P> Greenberger, 43, was ordered in July, 1989, to stand trial for the killing of  Radin, described in court as a man of excesses, an obese, cocaine-sniffing  impresario from New York's Long Island who sought to expand his show business  connections to Hollywood.  </P> <P> Also on trial are William Mentzer, 40, Robert Ulmer Lowe, 43 and Alex Marti,  29.  </P> <P> All four defendants are being held without bail and could face the death  penalty if convicted.  </P> <P> Wearing a long skirt with a sweater draped around her shoulders, Greenberger  appeared relaxed Wednesday as she sat directly in front of jurors. She smiled  occasionally as she chatted with her attorneys and gazed about the courtroom.  The other defendants sat behind her, flanked by their lawyers.  </P> <P> During the trial, which is expected to last six to eight months, Greenberger  will testify on her own behalf. Evans, who was linked to the killing by a  prosecution witness but never charged, may also be called to testify, Conn  said.  </P> <P> In 1983, Radin met Greenberger, who arranged to have him meet Evans,  prosecutors allege. However, Greenberger and Radin's friendship soured after  the cocaine and cash was stolen from Greenberger's home and when Radin later  refused to cut her in on any profits from a production company deal he and  Evans were negotiating. The deal would have included "The Cotton Club," the  film about the famed, Prohibition-era Harlem jazz club.  </P> <P> "She wanted a share and that threw a wrench into the whole works," Conn said.  </P> <P> The prosecutor said Radin was last seen alive on May 13, 1983, when he got into  a limousine with Greenberger to go to dinner in Beverly Hills. Conn said that  at some point, Lowe, who was driving, pulled the vehicle over and Greenberger  got out.  </P> <P> Mentzer and Marti then got in and Radin, 33, was driven to a canyon near  Gorman, where Marti emptied his revolver into the back of Radin's head, Conn  said.  </P> <P> Mentzer fired one shot, "the coup de grace," and pulled out a 3- to 4-inch  stick of dynamite, put it in Radin's mouth, lit it and "blew up the face," he  said.  </P> <P> A beekeeper discovered Radin's body on June 10.  </P> <P> Shohat conceded that Greenberger was a drug dealer at the time of Radin's  killing, but insisted that no evidence exists to tie her to the crime. He  described his client as a woman caught in a "tightening vise" because the  stolen cocaine and money did not belong to her and she was desperate to find a  way to pay back the loss.  </P> <P> "Roy Radin offered her a way to pay the debt," Shohat said. "And that way was  the 'Cotton Club' deal."  </P> <P> Lawyers for both Marti and Lowe attacked the credibility of the district  attorney's witnesses, saying many have been granted immunity from prosecution  in exchange for testifying against their clients.  </P> <P> Lowe's attorney, Mark Kaiserman, told jurors the only people that would place  Lowe at the scene of the crime were "people bought and paid for by the  prosecution."  </P></p>

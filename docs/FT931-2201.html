			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / West rallies in support of president's plebiscite WESTERN governments have rallied in strong political support of President Boris Yeltsin's decision to call a popular vote on who rules Russia, though differences persist on what practical help can be given to him. The US took the lead at the weekend in backing Mr Yeltsin's move as an 'appropriate' way of breaking the deadlock between Russia's president and parliament. 'President Yeltsin has proposed to break that political impasse by taking it to the people. That is appropriate in democracies,' the White House said in a statement issued after Mr Yeltsin's announcement. 'As Russia's only democratically elected national leader, he has our support as do his reform government and all reforms throughout the Russian Federation.' It said Russia must remain democratic and keep moving towards a market economy. 'That is the basis for a continued US-Russian partnership and for a better and more prosperous future for the Russian people.' The US statement was echoed by the European Community, and by members of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, some of whom were given advance notice of Mr Yeltsin's move. In Bonn, Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said that the 'German government has understanding for Mr Yeltsin's action towards solving the constitutional struggle through a referendum'. But Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, said economic assistance would have to be increased so that Mr Yeltsin could push through his economic reforms. France, meanwhile, stepped up its campaign for an emergency G7 meeting to discuss aid for Russia. 'International aid seems more than ever necessary and urgent to help the transition to a market economy and consolidate democratic reforms in Russia,' a foreign ministry statement said. The Japanese government, which is due to host the next regular G7 summit in Tokyo in July, pledged it would make further efforts to reach agreement with its G7 partners on measures to promote reform in Russia. Mr Hisashi Owada, a senior foreign ministry official, is attempting to clear the way for a mid-April meeting in Tokyo of G7 foreign and finance ministers. However, both Japan and EC officials remain deeply sceptical about the economic case for a large-scale aid programme given the chaotic state of the Russian economy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [MTI report: "Party Leaders on Agreement"] </F>   [Text] "If this agreement promises a stable government, I  will gladly accept it," Prime Minister Peter Boross said.  "However, I again call attention to the fact that it is one  thing to sign a coalition agreement, and another thing to  exercise a coalition government. I should know the agreement in  detail in order to be able to formulate a full-value opinion. In  any case, efficiency is the only measure of government activity.  The question is how the veto possibility and the coordinating  mechanisms will be put into practice," Boross said.    In his first reaction, Christian Democratic People's Party  [KDNP] Chairman Laszlo Surjan pointed out that Sandor Keresztes  also suggested the creation of the position of deputy prime  minister to the late Jozsef Antall, but things did not work out  at the time.    "I was not surprised by the success of the first phase of  the  coalition coordination talks. I have never doubted the creation  of this coalition," Laszlo Kover, head of the parliamentary  group of the Federation of Young Democrats, said. Laszlo Kover  pointed out that, given the fact that no exchange of views has  yet taken place in his party about the agreement, his words only  reflect his own opinion.    "I was the only politician who drew the attention of the  public and the media already before the elections to the  emergence of a coalition between the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. These two  parties are incapable of governing without each other, and the  fact that the MSZP came out as a bigger winner does not change  this," said Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent  Smallholders Party. Torgyan stressed that he cannot start  evaluating an agreement that he does not yet know in detail but,  according to the first information, his opinion is that the  coalition cannot function this way.    According to Lajos Fur, chairman of the Hungarian Democratic  Forum, it is extremely important that Hungary should have a  really stable government and he is convinced that the past four  years have been successful in this respect. In connection with  the current situation, Fur said that, given the proportion of  the election victory, it seemed that there would be stability in  governing. However, in connection with the guarantees that  emerged in the course of the negotiations, Lajos Fur  increasingly thinks that there are reasons for concern.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: P&amp;G disposals to bring in additional Dollars 600m PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products giant, yesterday said it expected to complete the sale of its commercial pulp businesses early next year, bringing the total price for its pulp plants and timberlands to Dollars 1.2bn. The company had previously announced the sale of pulp mills, saw mills and 175,000 acres of Georgia timberland to Weyerhaeuser for Dollars 600m. The additional Dollars 600m comes from the sale of its Memphis, Tennessee, cotton linters plant to an investor group led by Mr Robert Cannon, former head of P&amp;G's pulp operations, and the sale of 665,000 acres of timberland in north Florida. It also includes the formation of a limited partnership with the Cannon group to operate a pulp plant in Florida. The company said the sale would have no immediate material effect on earnings. The gain from the sale will be offset by the reduction in pulp sales to outsiders. About half its pulp output is sold to P&amp;G itself. In March, P&amp;G said it was selling its large interests in the pulp business to concentrate on its core consumer businesses.</p>

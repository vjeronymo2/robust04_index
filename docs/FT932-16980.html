			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Hyundai shipyard weathers bleak forecasts - John Burton visits HHI shipbuilders in Ulsan during a period of structural transition The frantic activity at Hyundai Heavy Industries' shipbuilding yard in Ulsan appears to belie a recent forecast by the Federation of Korean Industries that shipbuilders face the bleakest future among the nation's main businesses this year. The FKI cited an excessive supply of ships and a downturn in the global shipping industry to support its prediction of a slowdown in orders. Although the ships being built by Hyundai Heavy Industries at the world's largest shipyard were ordered during the past few years, its officials believe that new orders will be able to keep its seven dry docks occupied. 'We are expecting good years in both 1994 and 1995,' says Mr K. H. Lee of the ship sales department. Orders fell to Dollars 750m last year from Dollars 3.1bn in 1991. 'We regard last year and this year as a period of structural transition that will lead to a recovery in the mid-1990s,' Mr Lee adds. One reason for the optimism is that HHI is shifting toward the production of more advanced and profitable vessels, such as gas carriers and large container ships, while reducing its dependence on tankers and bulk carriers. It plans to build passenger cruise ships within the next few years. It launched its first liquefied natural gas carrier in February and the vessel will be delivered next March to Hyundai Merchant Marine, a sister subsidiary in the Hyundai group. A second LNG vessel is being built for Yukong Line, a Korean shipping company. This follows the construction of 13 liquefied petroleum gas carriers since 1986, with four more on order. HHI expects to deliver 34 ships with a total value of Dollars 1.9bn this year, against 26 vessels worth Dollars 1.7bn in 1992. The company has built 530 ships since 1973, when the Ulsan yards were opened. HHI has reported a significant improvement in earnings in the past two years, making it the most profitable unit among the 41 companies in the Hyundai industrial group. Profits reached Won281.2bn (Dollars 239m) on estimated sales of Won2,400bn last year having climbed from Won33.9bn in 1990 to Won206.7bn in 1991. It has set a sales target of Won3,250bn for 1993. The higher profits reflect a cessation of labour strife that convulsed the yard between 1987 and 1990, when it was a centre of the country's trade union movement that emerged after the downfall of the military dictatorship. The absence of industrial action since 1990 has led to an increase in productivity among the company's 22,000 workers. Privately-held HHI is eligible for a listing on the Seoul stock market since it has reported at least three successive years of profits, a condition for a public offering in Korea. State approval for a Won270bn share issue, which was requested in September, has been delayed because HHI has become embroiled in a political dispute between the government and Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the Hyundai conglomerate, after he unsuccessfully stood for president last year. HHI has been accused by the government of providing illegal campaign funds for Mr Chung's presidential campaign and Mr Choi Soo-il, HHI president, is in prison awaiting a possible trial for his alleged role in the affair. Hyundai claims the government is preventing HHI and other Hyundai companies from directly tapping the equity market because of its hostility towards Mr Chung. HHI acknowledges that the threat posed by emerging shipbuilding nations, such as China, is forcing it to reduce its dependence on ship construction. While shipbuilding accounts for 60 per cent of sales and almost all of its profits, according to analysts, HHI wants to reduce the sales ratio to 50 per cent by 1995 and 40 per cent by 2000. Two thirds of its Dollars 350m capital investment budget this year is devoted to expanding production in its three non-core sectors, including industrial plants, engines and machinery, and offshore facilities. Offshore business has been lifted by orders worth Dollars 1bn placed last year by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission of India for platforms and undersea pipelines and other sales in Canada and China. The industrial plant division is expanding into environmental projects, including the production of water sewage plants. The engine division is developing a gas turbine engine that will be used in LNG ships and other vessels.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: CBS completes record year with profits of Dollars 326m CBS yesterday announced a 39 per cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 46.4m as the top-rated US broadcast network completed a record-breaking financial year on a strong note. Full-year profits ended at Dollars 326.2m, up from Dollars 81m in 1992 and the best result in the company's history. While the latest three-month earnings failed to match CBS's accomplishments in the third quarter, when the company earned Dollars 118.3m, profits in that period were boosted by several one-off factors. Once again the best performance within the group came from the CBS Television Network, which has consistently led the other three networks  - ABC, NBC and Fox - in recent viewing figures. Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman, said CBS was now close to being the most watched network in prime-time, daytime and late night television, a feat achieved only once before by a US network. Higher ratings usually lead to bigger profits because they allow networks to charge higher rates for television advertisements. CBS has been particularly successful in late night programming since September's debut on the network of an 11.30pm weekly talk show.</p>

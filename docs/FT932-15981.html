			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Patten calls for shift on industry MR CHRIS Patten, the Hong Kong governor and former Tory party chairman, yesterday said Britain had to 'play to its strengths' and concentrate on promoting advanced industries - including financial and other services. He said he did not want to 'downgrade manufacturing' because success depended on staying ahead of the competition and upgrading industries, but 'no one should want people in Europe or north America to be locked into tough manual or repetitive jobs', he said. In a rare intervention in British political debate since his appointment to the Hong Kong post a year ago, Mr Patten warned that the 'comparative advantages' of western industrialised economies will tend in the future to be man-made. He added: 'They will - above all - be determined by training and education.' Mr Patten's speech to a Tory Reform Group meeting in London did not clash with recent calls by Mr John Major for a greater emphasis on promoting manufacturing. But Mr Patten said: 'It plainly makes sense for the highly industrialised economies to concentrate on the higher-value-added industries including financial and other services.' The government was right to reject the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty and argue for free trade, he said.</p>

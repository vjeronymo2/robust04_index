			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Letter: Why the banks may live to regret their approach to customers Sir, I note with interest Barclays Bank chairman Sir John Quinton's comment ('Barclays falls 30% to Pounds 533m', February 27) that individual managers might be wary of lending, even to sound customers. As an accountant dealing with individuals on a daily basis, I am continually being bombarded with criticisms of the way banks treat their customers - astronomic and sometimes incorrect charges, refusal to entertain even small loan requests, excessive interest rates, and so on. One would think that banks, by their very nature, would have a more business-like and sensible view of the way in which they treat their customers. Are they so blind that they cannot see the tremendous outflow of goodwill that is taking place? It is at times like this that most people are in need of help and understanding from their bank; instead, all they are getting is an unsympathetic attitude and a sad deterioration in the standard of service. My heart does, however, go out to the general staff who are caught in the cross-fire of senior management instructions and customers' complaints. No wonder their morale is at an all-time low. I am not suggesting that the banks should lend without careful consideration of the facts involved, but reasonable charges combined with a more understanding and considerate approach would go a long way to retaining the goodwill of their customers. It also hardly seems fair that the man in the street should pay for the enormous bad debts incurred in recent years through poor decisions made by the banks. The banks could well regret their current approach to a problem which affects us all. Many will not forget that when they looked for help at a time when it was needed were simply told: 'Sorry, can't help. Have you tried the building society down the road?' Perhaps they will.

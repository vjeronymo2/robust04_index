			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Westminster poll fever mounts: Speculation on date of election announcement overshadows NHS offensive A GOVERNMENT attempt to take the offensive over its National Health Service reforms was swamped yesterday by a bout of feverish speculation as to when an April 9 election would be announced. As Mr John Major clashed with Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, on the health issue at question time, MPs debated reports that the prime minister would call an election next Wednesday - only 24 hours after the Budget. Mr Major held a Downing Street summit last night with members of his election 'A' team of cabinet ministers, including Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman, to finalise the Conservative election manifesto. Mounting excitement at Westminster was fuelled by a new poll showing the two main parties exactly level on 38.5 per cent with the Liberal Democrats at 18.5 per cent. A Gallup 'snapshot' poll for The Daily Telegraph was accompanied by a Gallup 9000 poll of 10,405 voters, showing the Tories on 38.9, or a statistically insignificant 1.3 points ahead of Labour in soundings taken over the past month. Whatever the parties' true positions, the polls show Labour support has not grown fast enough to prompt reconsideration of an April 9 date. As analysts predicted the narrowest election race for decades and stock and money markets dipped on fears of a change in Downing Street, the day's events were dominated by bar room tacticians trying to calculate the strategic advantages to the Tories of making the election announcement 24 hours earlier than most had expected. One theory had it that an early election call, backed up by a prime ministerial address to the nation on television, would switch attention away from the Budget statement and Labour's counter attack. It would also detract from Mr John Smith's right as shadow chancellor to a 10-minute television 'reply' to the Budget, Tory campaign officials insisted no final decision had been taken on timing and that the issue had not even been raised during a political discussion after yesterday's cabinet meeting. Downing Street said Mr Major had scheduled a normal weekend in his Huntingdon constituency. But there was evidence of a government clearing its desks for an election as ministers announced nearly Pounds 400m of spending on projects ranging from roads for Scotland to grant aid for technical schools. The 'business as usual' message cut little ice in the Commons where Mr John MacGregor, Leader of the House, came under opposition fire for announcing a normal statement for next week's business. In fact, as soon as the election is called, he will have to cut short the traditional four-day Budget debate, introduce a truncated Finance Bill, and ensure remaining business is rescheduled or abandoned. The Commons must be prorogued by the night of Monday March 16 for an April 9 election. In the Commons, Mr Kinnock promised a Labour government would end tax concessions for private health insurance and use the Pounds 60m annual saving 'to fight cancer'. The prime minister retorted that Labour's promises would have more credibility were it not committed to a minimum wage which would cost the NHS Pounds 500m.

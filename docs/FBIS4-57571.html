			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tatiana Rothschild] </F>   [Text] Juigalpa, Chontales -- Here in a meeting with  congressmen and guests of the extraordinary congress that will  take place this weekend in Managua, Commander Daniel Ortega  Saavedra said that "the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation  Front] candidate who emerges from the consensus is going to be  the unity candidate." Ortega confirmed to Chontales Department  congressmen his pledge to "respect the congress results even if  they do not agree with the positions we are defending from the  rank and file."    Ortega regretted having to compete for the post of secretary  general with Commander Henry Ruiz and considered that those who  try to run down or alter the principles that have guided the  FSLN are gaining from the conflict. The current FSLN secretary  general recognized Commander Ruiz as the revolutionary leader  who historically has maintained leftist positions and expressed  surprise that those who lean toward social democracy have taken  shelter under Ruiz' candidacy. Ortega said "any Sandinist can  have this aspiration, but the grassroots, who demand unity  around popular struggles, must be the ones to define the party  we want."    Peasant leader Celestino Garcia demanded it be noted clearly  on the record that the launching of Commander Henry Ruiz'  candidacy by Chontales Department Political Secretary Luis  Enrique Figueroa was in Figueroa's capacity as a Sandinist  follower.    Benedicto Miranda, Sandinist Youth department coordinator,  questioned the role of journalists, who have assumed the task of  deepening the trends rather than highlighting the party's  platform program.</p>

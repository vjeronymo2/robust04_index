			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bogdan Mozdzynski: "Employers in Favor of </F> `Strategy'"]    [Text] Employers say that it will not be possible to  implement the goals of the "Strategy for Poland," which they  think are correct, without their participation.    Representatives of 42 organizations that are members of the  confederation of Polish Employers [KPP] and representatives of  five organizations that are not members of the KPP told Prime  Minister Pawlak yesterday that the "Strategy for Poland" is a  document for which they have been waiting for a long time, that,  in their view, the goals outlined in the program are correct,  and that they themselves are interested in their implementation.  <H5>  On Equal Footing </H5>   During a discussion on the main items of the "Strategy," the  employers had particularly high praise for the government's  readiness to form partnershiplike labor relations and  negotiation-based mechanisms for salary regulation. The  employers want the state to play the role of an umpire and  mediator in conflicts between employers and employees. As KPP  Chairman Andrzej Wilk stated, the implementation of the task  would make for a rapprochement among those who are most  interested in seeing conflicts resolved--that is to say, trade  unions on the one hand and employers on the other.    According to Ryszard Bielawski of the Gdansk Employer  Association, only an economy "based on consultations" can assure  social peace. Employers will gladly participate in  negotiations, provided the government approaches them on a  partnership basis.    The prime minister said that employer participation in the  Trilateral Commission is very significant for putting  employer-employee relations in order and that the government  will be "seriously taking employers' views into account."  <H5>  Let Us Commercialize </H5>   Many of the employers present stressed the importance of  commercialization of state-owned enterprises. "It is a good  thing," they said, "that the issue was mentioned as a `strategic  problem' in Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko's program." Without  its successful implementation, it will not be possible to carry  out the "Strategy." Commercialization implies making the  enterprises oriented toward market criteria, and "only then will  employers be stimulated in an appropriate manner."    State-owned enterprises currently produce almost half of the  GNP, while 95 percent of all conflicts occur in them. According  to Andrzej Tyszkiewicz, manager of the Zeran automobile plant  and chief of the Federation of Employers of Domestic Automobile  Producers, employers representing the current and former state  ownership are more sensitive to social policies than private  employers. In Tyszkiewicz's view, employers of the enterprise  to be commercialized will be the leading executors of the  appropriate labor relations in Poland (meaning relations modeled  after EU [European Union] countries).    Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak responded by saying that he  can see no obstacles against a speedy commercialization of  enterprises, even if their current managements were to be  retained. "They will simply start thinking along different  lines once they find themselves under market conditions, while  you are not going to have good cadres emerge from lame  structures," the prime minister said. He is waiting for a  unanimous position on this issue by the managing cadres.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Base rate rise indicated at Clarke talks This month's rise in UK bank base rates was foreshadowed in November's discussions on monetary policy between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, according to minutes of their meeting released yesterday. The minutes show Mr George saying there was a case, if evidence on prices and activity was taken at face value, for a rise in interest rates at the time of the meeting on November 2. The governor said that on the basis of what was currently known, rates would 'probably need to rise before very long'. He was, however, 'inclined to wait a little' to see whether clearer signs appeared of an easing in the rate of UK growth and how wage and price pressures devel-oped. Mr Clarke said Britain was having a healthy and well-balanced recovery with inflation remaining low. But further ahead the data were 'somewhat mixed'. His inclination was not to change rates at the November meeting and in his view the evidence at that time showed no need to act. 'Looking ahead, we would need to remain cautious and alert to the potential risks,' he said. In concluding there was agreement to leave rates unchanged, Mr Clarke noted that there was uncertainty about the effect that the tax rises already announced before last month's Budget might have on consumer demand. He said it was important to check that statistics which had a good record as indicators of inflation in the past were still reliable. Although the minutes reveal the now familiar nuances indicating the difference in approach to rates between governor and chancellor, they bear out both men's claims that the December 7 base rate increase to 6.25 per cent from 5.75 per cent was based on economic and not political factors.</p>

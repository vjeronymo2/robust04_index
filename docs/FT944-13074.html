			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Beating Mideast swords into ploughshares: The peace summit in Casablanca Seven heads of government, 50 foreign ministers and more than 1,000 senior business executives from 60 countries began gathering in Casablanca yesterday for a three-day summit aimed at transforming the region's peace agreements into fuller economic integration. Organisers of the most ambitious political and business networking session ever undertaken for the Middle East hope it will encourage a new partnership between the private and public sectors, new financing structures, including a Dollars 10bn capitalised regional development bank, and solid moves towards realising hundreds of development projects. Mr Klaus Schwab, president of the World Economic Forum, the Swiss-based think tank which jointly arranged the conference with the independent US Council on Foreign Relations, likened the meeting to the pioneering steps taken in the late 1950s which created today's European Union. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, the most outspoken advocate of Middle East economic integration, has called the conference a 'battle cry' for regional co-operation. 'Israel and many Arab countries are facing a new danger,' he said, 'one that cannot be fought by conventional means of guns or tanks: the spread of extreme movements. What fuels these movements is poverty, starvation and unemployment ..the answer must be economic.' Not everyone in the region shares Mr Peres' optimism. Syria and Lebanon are boycotting the summit and neither is prepared to join any multilateral talks including Israel until a full Syrian-Israeli peace is agreed. Some Arab officials taking part have also voiced scepticism at the scale of the conference's ambitions. Israel has submitted a detailed list of projects worth up to Dollars 27bn over 10 years. Some are immediately practicable: like linking electricity grids; water conservation and desalination plants; regional agriculture research and development; shared use of ports and airports and the development of huge tourism centres. Others will require more time and political will, like a Beirut-Tel Aviv-Cairo-East Mediterranean coastal motorway, gas and oil pipelines from the Gulf to Israel's Mediterranean ports and plans to buy water from Turkey. Israel and Jordan, the two countries most enthusiastic and perhaps best prepared for economic integration, will jointly present plans developed in a trilateral economic commission with the US for the cross-border development of the valley which divides the two states. Jordan, whose delegation will be headed by Crown Prince Hassan, also hopes to create a permanent process from Casablanca. 'We're already discussing a sequel to it in Amman in the spring and are hoping to create a permanent secretariat,' said Mr Ahmed Mango, the Crown Prince's economic adviser. Mr Peres has promoted the creation of a Middle East development bank, with initial capital of Dollars 10bn. Modelled on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, it would principally make capital investments and long-term loans to finance regional infrastructure projects, provide technical assistance for projects and raise money on international capital markets. The new bank would also create a Middle East OECD as a forum for regional economic policy. Israel also hopes in Casablanca to get western governments to commit themselves to an expanded programme of government guarantees, political risk insurance and export financing for regional projects. But the summit's most enthusiastic proponents believe the core task will be to bring the private sector more solidly into the development of a region which, among Arab states notably, has lain overwhelmingly and often inefficiently in state hands. Israeli companies alone are expected to present proposals for Dollars 100m in joint ventures. There has been no shortage of interest from outside the region with an estimated 1,100 business executives descending on the Moroccan city this weekend.</p>

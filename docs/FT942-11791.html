			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy The strong growth in M0 money supply last month is about the best indication yet that economic recovery has survived the immediate impact of the chancellor's tax increases. But the jury must still be out on whether that positive response will continue, especially now that consumers have banked their April pay cheques. Anecdotal evidence suggests confidence is weak. Yet spending may well turn out not to be too badly affected. Employment and wages are growing, and higher turnover in the housing market, underlined by yesterday's mortgage lending figures, should boost demand for consumer durables. Obviously the authorities cannot wish the recovery to falter, but such a high rate of narrow money growth must also leave them uneasy. Year-on-year growth of 6.2 per cent is way above the monitoring ceiling of 4 per cent, and the excuse that individuals are inclined to hold cash because interest rates are so low is wearing thin. Arguably, the original target range for M0 was too tight, but the authorities cannot let the aggregate expand at this kind of level for more than a month or two without risking serious loss of credibility. Then talk would turn, not to whether there is room for one more rate cut, but rather to the question of how soon rates would have to rise again. It is perhaps unfortunate that news of such vigorous money growth coincided with fresh nervousness over sterling. Its trade-weighted index dropped 0.9 per cent yesterday, partly in the backwash of a weak dollar and partly in response to political worries. There was no inflationary threat when sterling left the ERM because the economy was so weak. Depreciation is more risky now that the output gap is closing and unit labour costs have bottomed out.</p>

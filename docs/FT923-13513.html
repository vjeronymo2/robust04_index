			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Letter: When Sky's the limit Sir, Mr Richard Brooke's euphoria (Letters, July 7) over the recent up-beat performance of BSkyB perhaps needs to be tempered with the realisation that pay TV is likely to be a loser (in the short-term). I purchased Sky TV earlier this year to watch the cricket world cup and consequently pay a monthly fee. The introduction of a further fee to allow me to watch (second rate) Premier League football matches and the other sports I already receive will not be countenanced. At the end of my existing agreement in 12 months' time my aerial will be returned. Speaking to other subscribers, that is a common reaction. P J R Baker, 17 Arne Grove, Horley</p>

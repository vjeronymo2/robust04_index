			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Japanese and Germans face higher charges - Subsidiaries German and Japanese companies face higher UK tax charges on the earnings of their British subsidiaries, as a result of changes in tax law announced by the Inland Revenue. The changes, to the tax liability of UK subsidiaries which have a higher ratio of debt to equity than the Inland Revenue deems acceptable, will also require British companies to re-examine the funding of their UK subsidiaries. Although the changes could be most disruptive to overseas companies, they may provoke protests from large UK groups which have been free to create an internal capital structure without worrying about debt-equity ratios. Mr Jim Marshall, head of KPMG's international group in London, described the proposals as 'very significant' and said that German and Japanese subsidiaries in the UK would need to review debt provided by a parent company urgently. The new rules change the regime for 'thinly-capitalised' subsidiaries. One reason they have been funded predominantly with interest-bearing loans rather than share capital is in order to gain tax relief on the interest paid. The changes may raise the UK tax charge of German and Japanese companies for new loans from today, and existing loans from April 1, because the existing tax treaties do not restrict tax relief on thinly-capitalised companies. But parent companies from countries including Ireland and Korea may benefit because under the tax treaties with those countries, no interest is tax deductible. The changes will be neutral for subsidiaries of US and Dutch companies. The changes could affect UK inward investment because the manner in which the Inland Revenue interprets the rules will add uncertainty to German and Japanese companies, which have been among the leading investors into the UK. The rules replace existing thin capital rules for payments to overseas parent companies, and impose thin capital rules for all UK companies paying interest to a company which owns 75 per cent of its shares, or a fellow subsidiary. A change in the regime had have been expected for some time on UK subsidiaries of foreign companies, but the proposal will also apply to all companies in a UK group. This could create tax uncertainties and problems for some large UK companies. The proposals apply an 'arm's length' test to determine the amount of debt a third party lender would have advanced to the borrower, given its existing financial position, including particularly its level of share capital. To the extent that the amount of debt exceeds that which the Inland Revenue believe is appropriate, then the interest on the excess debt will be treated as a non-deductible distribution, increasing taxable profits of the borrower.

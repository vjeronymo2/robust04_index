			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED-HOT ROYALS DROP ANGELS TWO GAMES BACK, 4-2  </P> <P> Rain, rather than Angels, fell at Royals Stadium Tuesday night, but not heavily  enough to suit the Angels' purposes.  </P> <P> Despite a rain delay of 1 hour 25 minutes, the game went on.  </P> <P> Darn the Angels' luck.  </P> <P> For the seventh time in as many tries, the Angels lost to the Royals in Kansas  City, this time by a 4-2 score. And, for the second time in as many nights, the  Angels lost ground to Oakland in the American League West standings, now  trailing the front-running Athletics by two games.  </P> <P> Suddenly, the Angels are nearly as close to third place as they are first  place. With the victory, Kansas City's eighth in a row, the Royals moved to  within 2 1/2 games of the Angels with two games remaining in this series and  Tom Gordon (15-4) scheduled to pitch tonight.  </P> <P> Just two days ago, the Angels were the team on a roll, taking a five-game  winning streak and a power-hitting offense into Kansas City.  </P> <P> Now, they've spent two games here and lost one starting pitcher (Chuck Finley),  two 4-2 decisions and any momentum they might have built after pounding  Minnesota and Cleveland last week in Anaheim.  </P> <P> "We're very streaky," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "Everybody knows that. And  right now, we are catching a club that is very hot.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is we are not swinging the bats well enough to win. We need to  regroup and play better baseball the rest of the series."  </P> <P> Angel catcher Lance Parrish seconded that assessment.  </P> <P> "I hope everybody shows up tomorrow ready to go," Parrish said. "We can't  afford to let too many more slip away from us . . . Now is the time."  </P> <P> For Kansas City, it is, anyway. With the Angels and the A's in town for seven  games this week, the Royals entered this series talking about playoff  atmosphere and intensity and the need to capitalize on this chance to jump back  into the AL West race.  </P> <P> In Parrish's view, the Angels need to get that same feeling.  </P> <P> "I think we have a tendency to get into little lulls, where we want to let  things happen instead of making them happen," he said. "That seems to be the  story with these two games here. There seems to be no energy -- and this  probably isn't the greatest time to do it.  </P> <P> "Hopefully tomorrow, we'll shake out of it."  </P> <P> In their latest loss, the Angels managed but five hits against four Kansas City  pitchers -- and this was with starter Mark Gubicza lasting two innings. Gubicza  was a victim of the rain delay, pulled by Manager John Wathan after six outs  for future considerations -- i.e., this weekend's encounter with Oakland.  </P> <P> By replacing Gubicza with reliever Terry Leach in the third inning, Wathan is  hoping to bring Gubicza back with two days' rest for Friday's series opener  with the A's.  </P> <P> Already, Wathan has won half his gamble. Leach picked up after the 85-minute  delay and pitched five innings of two-hit ball, yielding only an unearned run.  Then, Wathan turned it over to relievers Rick Luecken and Jeff Montgomery.  </P> <P> Leach, a mid-season acquisition from the New York Mets, is 5-3, having won  three times during the Royals' current streak. A fourth-inning double to Chili  Davis and a sixth-inning single to Devon White were the only hits he allowed.  </P> <P> "Same old Leach," Rader said. "He's a guy who gives us trouble. In particular,  he gives our left-handed hitters problems."  </P> <P> That's due in part to Leach's pitching motion, the type of delivery that hasn't  been seen in these parts since Dan Quisenberry's era.  </P> <P> Leach inherited a 1-0 lead, courtesy of Mike Witt's latest two-out lapse,  coming in the bottom of the first inning. Witt (8-11) retired the first two  batters he faced -- and then allowed hits to the next three.  </P> <P> After striking out leadoff hitter Kevin Seitzer and getting Willie Wilson to  ground to second base, Witt surrendered a single to George Brett.  </P> <P> And another to Bo Jackson.  </P> <P> And another to Jim Eisenreich, this a bouncer up the middle that scored Brett  from second base. He escaped further damage when Jackson overran third base  after White's throw eluded third baseman Jack Howell. Witt backing up, fired to  Howell and Jackson was nailed trying to get back to third.  </P> <P> Kansas City took that lead into the rain delay. Witt returned after sitting for  nearly 90 minutes. Rader was asked if he considered changing pitchers for the  resumption of the game, as Wathan did.  </P> <P> "No, because he didn't throw enough to begin the game to get stiff," Rader  said. "So, it wasn't a problem."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Chuck Finley figures to miss at least one start as a result of the foot injury  that knocked him out of Monday night's game after 17 pitches. Today, Finley  will undergo a bone scan to determine whether or not he has a stress fracture  in his left foot, but either way, Finley isn't expected to pitch again before  next week. If a stress fracture is ruled out, Finley will receive a cortisone  injection in the foot, which should sideline him through Saturday, his next  scheduled start. "The doctor wanted to shoot it with cortisone today, but he  thought the cortisone might hide the effects of the bone scan," Finley said.  "So we'll do the scan first and if no hot spots (fractures) are there, he'll  shoot it up then."  </P> <P> Finley hurt the foot by rolling over on it while warming up in the bullpen. "It  felt like a burn," he said. "At first, I thought it was just a different  twisting of the foot. It was a little sore, but I thought it'd go away after a  couple pitches. Instead, it got worse and worse, and then, I had trouble  walking. I knew I wouldn't be out there much longer." Finley said he felt no  improvement in the foot Tuesday, but was talking hopefully in preparation of  today's bone scan. "I'm not expecting it to be any big deal," he said. "I think  it's more like a bruise. They're just taking (the scan) to make sure there's  not a crack. If I can get the soreness out of it, I should be ready to go in a  couple days. If it's one start, I'm sure the team can pick me up. I think  that's the worst that can happen -- that I miss one start." Finley grinned.  "This is September, or getting close to it," he noted. "It's got to be all  right."  </P> <P> The Angels have Bert Blyleven, the Royals have Bret Saberhagen. And when  Tuesday's game was delayed nearly 90 minutes because of rain, Saberhagen donned  a ski mask and one of Bo Jackson's jerseys -- which he overstuffed with padding  -- and launched into a home run trot on the slick tarpaulin. That soon evolved  into headfirst slides and belly-flops into the largest puddles on the tarp.  </P></p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Mitsotakis bribe allegations An investigating committee has asked the Greek parliament to bring criminal charges against Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the former prime minister, over allegations that he accepted bribes in the 1992 sale of a state cement concern. Officials said the parliamentary committee handed a petition to Mr Apostolos Kaklamanis, parliamentary president, asking that Mr Mitsotakis and two of his former ministers be tried by a special 13-judge criminal court. Mr Kaklamanis must now set a date within the next month for a debate and vote on whether to lift the immunity of Mr Mitsotakis, who was conservative prime minister from 1990 to 1993, and send him for trial. The 300-seat parliament, where the governing Socialists have a clear absolute majority, has already voted in a separate case to try Mr Mitsotakis on charges of illegal wiretapping. Mr Mitsotakis is accused of accepting Dollars 22.5m in bribes in the sale of the state-run Heracles cement company to Italy's Calcestruzzi Cement and Greece's National Bank for Dollars 225m.</p>

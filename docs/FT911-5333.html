			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: The Winter's Tale - Aldwych Theatre After commenting unfavourably earlier this week on the English Shakespeare Company's transformation of Coriolanus to eastern Europe, it is pleasant to be able to report that the same company has come up with a thoroughly enjoyable production of The Winter's Tale. It is not until at least half way through that a deliberate act of perversity takes place. Antigonus, having deposited the infant Perdita in the wilderness, does not, as in the Shakespeare text, 'exit pursued by a bear'. Instead he is killed by Leontes, who makes an unscripted appearance. Not that the bear episode is the best of Shakespeare's inventions; it is odd to replace it with the killing by a king who is already a penitent after realising he has falsely accused his wife. This, however, is director Michael Bognadov's only aberration. For the rest he sticks to the play, which is precisely its title: a very good winter's tale that ends in spring. Seeing the two productions within a day or two of each provides a chance to assess the strengths of the company. It is strong enough not to need wild ideas to show off. Michael Pennington is a far better Leontes than he is Coriolanus. He speaks the verse clearly and altogether looks more at home in a dinner jacket than dirty jeans. Some of this style might yet be put into his Coriolanus. One of the best-looking players in Coriolanus was Lynn Farleigh as Virgilia. As 'my gracious silence', she had very little to say. As Hermione in The Winter's Tale, she looks good and speaks well. And as we noticed with her Virgilia, she is stunning at standing still. The final scene where her statue comes to life is played with immense presence because the whole cast behaves with discipline. The piece inevitably and deliberately falls into two parts: the first where Leontes is consumed with jealousy, the second where the rustics begin to take over. Part one is played with the intensity that one would expect from this company, though not without subtlety. Leontes, for instance, gives some facial indication of his suspicions even before he voices them. Part two brings out some unsuspected comic depths in the playing. Autolycus (James Hayes) is an unusually elderly Irishman. When Polixenes and Camillo put on their disguises, they choose some wonderful old tweeds and plus-fours. It is hard to recognise this Polixenes as Andrew Jarvis who plays Aufidius in Coriolanus. Clearly he has more talents than one realised. Robert Demeger stands out in both productions as one of the tribunes in Coriolanus and Camillo in The Winter's Tale. He could probably play most of the other parts as well.</p>

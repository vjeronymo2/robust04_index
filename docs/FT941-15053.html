			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Bank chief eases fears of small companies Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, last night argued that antagonism between banks and small companies was easing, and companies were unlikely to be constrained from recovery by a lack of finance. Mr George spoke after publishing a bank inquiry which found that tension had been heightened by 'exaggerated expectations on one side, and insensitivity on the other', but was caused mainly by the high rate of company failures. The bank's largely optimistic conclusion was welcomed by groups representing small businesses. The Confederation of British Industry said it would raise the quality of debate on an issue of crucial importance to the economy. High street banks also welcomed the results, including the finding that banks were 'committed to the finance of the small firm sector', and that companies recognised that banks were 'not public utilities' and had to make profits. The inquiry was conducted by Mr George last year after his appointment as governor. It followed two studies by the Bank on terms set by the government, which cleared banks of not passing on interest rate cuts. Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the British Bankers' Association, welcomed the findings. He said earlier inquiries had been 'politically motivated' and too narrow. The Bank's report criticised banks for having shown 'a lack of sophistication and sensitivity in their dealings with small businesses', particularly in setting charges and taking securities against loans. But Mr George emphasised in a speech to the Scottish CBI and Scottish Enterprise last night that he was 'very encouraged' by the inquiry, and by 'the extent and variety of initiatives' taken by banks, small companies and the government. He said that improving access to finance for Britain's 2.5m small companies was best tackled in 'many small steps across a wide front'. The damage inflicted on banks and small companies was rooted in the economic volatility of the past five years, and stable low-inflationary growth would 'go a long way to reducing the tensions'. The inquiry concluded that banks should offer businesses a wider range of finance than overdrafts. It also suggested that venture capitalists and 'business angels' should be encouraged.

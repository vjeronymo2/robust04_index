			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Germany edges nearer recession as output in west falls sharply GERMANY slid further towards recession in the third quarter this year and new indicators suggest the downturn is accelerating. Gross national product in the west of the country fell a real 1.5 per cent between the second and third quarters of this year, official figures show. Industrial output has fallen sharply since and unemployment has risen further. Meanwhile, the number of company failures has grown by 13 per cent this year after falling steadily for the previous seven. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, said the latest growth figures were a clear warning of a further downturn, which must be avoided if recovery in the east was not to be hit. Mr Mollemann and Chancellor Helmut Kohl have both recently described conditions as recessionary, but the Bundesbank still believes that the economy is 'returning to normal' after rapid post-unification growth. There is worse to come, according to the Ifo economics institute in Munich, which yesterday forecast a real 3 per cent drop in industrial output in 1993, after a 1.5 per cent decline this year. The one bright spot was a wages settlement, reached overnight, giving steel workers a rise of just over 3 per cent for 18 months. This deal and moderate demands from other unions suggest the downturn and the prospect of job losses have had a powerful impact on wage hopes. The Bundesbank would see this as positive, but insufficient on its own to cut interest rates, economists said. Real GNP in the third quarter was unchanged - officially 'minus 0.0 per cent' - compared with the same period last year. Year-on-year growth in the first quarter was 3.2 per cent, but only 0.6 per cent in the second. Gross domestic product, which excludes overseas earnings, was a real 1 per cent up on the comparable period of 1991 but 0.5 per cent down on the previous quarter. According to the economics ministry, capital spending fell a real 3 per cent in the three months under review. Other figures indicate further weakening. West German manufacturing industry output in September and October was 2.6 per cent lower than a year earlier. Capital goods and consumer products production slumped 3.9 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively. The impact on the labour market showed in an unadjusted rise of 54,000 in west German unemployment in November and an increase of more than 150,000 to almost 500,000 in numbers working short-time. Mr Heinrich Franke, labour office head, said the jobless total in the west could rise to 2.1m next year, if nil economic growth forecasts were correct and 1.2m - about 120,000 more than now - in the east.

Kiesus said the Russian company guarantees stabile oil  supplies and steady work of the refinery, which is very  important to Western partners and banks, who might consider  giving preferential loans to Mazeikiai.    According to a contract between Lucoil and the Lithuanian  refinery, Mazeikiai is supposed to refine 6 million tons of  Russian oil this year. Lucoil supplied only half of the amount  it promised for 1993. Kiesus said Mazeikiai will refine 6  million tons of Russian oil this year if all transportation  problems are successfully solved.    The refinery received 5.1 million tons of oil last year.  Three million were supplied by Lucoil, 2 million came in from  different commercial companies and 50,000 were purchased by the  refinery itself.    In 1992, Mazeikiai refined a record low of 4.9 million tons.  The refinery hopes to get 8 million tons in 1994, which is still  4 million tons below its maximum annual refining capacity.    Kiesus said Mazeikiai intends to buy more oil itself -- some  50,000-100,000 tons each month. The oil will hopefully be  purchased for preferential loans from foreign banks and  financial organizations, he said. Loans for the refinery are  currently under negotiation between Lithuanian energy officials  and some Western banks.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Senate wrangles hit National Service scheme PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's National Service plan has run into trouble in the Senate with Democrats unable to break the Republican will to prevent a vote on the measure. The House of Representatives this week passed Mr Clinton's plan to create a domestic version of President John Kennedy's Peace Corps, whose participants would also earn money towards higher education. In the Senate, however, the plan has fallen victim to the partisan wrangling that has plagued many of the president's proposals. The Democrats have a 54-seat majority in the Senate, but need 60 votes to cut off debate and force a vote on the measure. Five Republicans voted with the majority, leaving the Democrats one vote short. The House agreed on Wednesday evening to Mr Clinton's plan to grant Dollars 5,000 a year in educational benefits in return for community service work, with a handful of Republicans joining the Democratic majority. But it scaled back the educational stipend to Dollars 4,725. 'National service is a bipartisan concept. . . and it is a shame to have it treated like a political football,' said Mr Rick Allen, deputy director of the White House's Office of National Service. Some Republican senators, led by Ms Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, support the concept of national service, but believe the president's plan is too expensive. The White House has been seeking a compromise with her, so far without success. The president's plan calls for Dollars 394m for fiscal 1994 with no set spending amounts for the next four years. Mr David Durenberger, a Republican senator, and Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy introduced an alternative plan that scaled the programme back to three years and set spending at Dollars 300m for the first year and Dollars 500m and Dollars 700m for the next two years. Ms Kassebaum believes spending should be limited to Dollars 200m in the first year and Dollars 400m and Dollars 600m for the next two. If the White House were to win Ms Kassebaum's support she would probably be followed by enough Republicans to overcome the filibuster. There are, however, a number of Republicans who seem prepared to block passage of the bill at any cost. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, for example, cites the programme as an example of 'tax-and-spend' politics of Democrats and the president who are not doing enough to fight the deficit. 'It doesn't have to do with Clinton having victories, it has to do with the number one problem in the country,' said Mr Larry Neal, a spokesman for Mr Gramm.</p>

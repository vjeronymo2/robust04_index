			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Swiss-Saudi Economic Relations, </F> Differences of Opinion on Price of Drugs"]    [Text] At the eighth meeting of the Swiss-Saudi Arabian  Joint Economic Commission in Bern on 3 May, Federal Councilor  Delamuraz and his guest, Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Aziz Bin-'Abdallah  al-Zamil, Saudi minister of industry and electricity,  underscored the strong economic relations between the two  countries. Saudi Arabia would like to correct the trade  imbalance, expand scientific cooperation, and increase the  number of joint ventures. The thorny issue of prices of  pharmaceutical goods is still a subject of discussion.    The two delegations consisted not only of representatives of  various ministries, but also members of chambers of trade. On  the Swiss side, there were also representatives of those  industrial branches interested in entering the Saudi market.  Saudi Arabia has emerged as a very keen consumer of Swiss  products in recent years. Swiss exports to Saudi Arabia have  increased from 859 million Swiss francs in 1990 to 1,491 million  in 1993. Forty percent of these exports consist of jewelry, or  50 percent when one includes watches. Chemical products and  machines are also major Swiss exports to this country.    On the other hand, imports from Saudi Arabia have sunk  dramatically. In 1990 they still amounted to 540 million  francs, but in 1993 they only reached a level of 275 million.  Ninety percent of Saudi Arabia's exports to Switzerland consist  of gold and crude oil. Delamuraz expressed Switzerland's  concern for more Saudi imports, and gave an assurance that there  were no quantitative restrictions on exports outside the  agricultural sphere. The Saudis mentioned the possibility of  increased exports of petrochemical products to Switzerland, but  Delamuraz said that Switzerland's market potential for such  goods was rather small.    At the end of 1993 there were 21 industrial joint ventures  involving Swiss capital in Saudi Arabia, plus another 19 joint  ventures in the services sector. The Saudi delegation expressed  its interest in an expansion of this cooperation, and suggested  possible projects in the food, chemical, and plastics sectors,  and in the production of instruments. These cooperation  possibilities are to be discussed in greater depth at a special  seminar in Geneva attended by representatives of Swiss private  industry. In this connection, Federal Councilor Delamuraz  recalled the usefulness of concluding an agreement on the  protection of investments and on avoiding double taxation, and  invited his guests to commence appropriate negotiations with  Switzerland.    The Saudis were interested in scientific cooperation in,  among other things, the electrical industry and in railroads.  The ongoing difficult debate on the subject of prices of  pharmaceutical goods was summarized, and referred to a separate  commission for further talks. Until now, the Swiss factory  prices of these goods, without the profit margins of pharmacies  and wholesalers, have been used when setting prices in Saudi  Arabia. In the future, the Saudis want to work out an average  price on the basis of prices in 42 different countries, and  apply this average price in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis explained  this intention last year at a meeting in Basel.    The Swiss pharmaceutical industry representatives criticized  this method as administratively cumbersome and insufficiently  representative, because the list of drugs involves too many  countries and provides too little information. On its part, the  Swiss delegation suggested that instead of calculating prices of  drugs on the basis of the prices in 42 countries, these prices  should be calculated on the basis of prices in just seven  countries whose economic performance is similar to Saudi  Arabia's. Swiss drug manufacturers want to be certain that the  prices of pharmaceutical goods exported to and sold in Saudi  Arabia are sufficient to contribute to the costs of the  manufacturer's research to an extent that befits the economy of  an oil-producing country.</p>

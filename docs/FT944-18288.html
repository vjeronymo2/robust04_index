			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway to step up Statfjord oil recovery Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, expects to increase recovery from the prolific North Sea Statfjord field by 220m barrels of oil worth an estimated NKr22bn (Pounds 2.05m) at current prices. 'We are pushing the recovery from the Statfjord field to the limits,' Ms Wenche Skorge, a Statoil spokesperson, said yesterday. The field's recoverable reserves are to be upgraded to 3.89bn barrels from 3.69bn, marking the fourth upgrade since production of crude oil came onstream in 1979 and lifting the recovery factor to 62 per cent against an average 40 per cent from other Norwegian North Sea fields. By the end of this year about 3bn barrels of these reserves will have been produced but daily average production this year has reached 650,000 barrels, exceeding the 1993 production plan for 600,000 barrels. Statoil attributes the potential to increase recovery from the field to the development of expertise in reservoir engineering, highly-deviated well drilling and extended reach-horizontal well drilling - so called 'designer wells' - enabling the tapping of oil from the Brent and Statfjord reservoirs that would not be possible with conventional technology. For the Statfjord reservoir a new drainage strategy - in which water will be injected into the gas-filled reservoir so as to drive residual oil towards production wells - is expected to boost production by an estimated 88m barrels and the recovery factor by 80 per cent from this formation. An improved and growing understanding of the Upper and Lower Brent reservoirs is expected to sustain a high rate of recovery over a longer period, potentially yielding 132m barrels more of oil from these structures.</p>

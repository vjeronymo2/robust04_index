			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Untitled item FROM EARLY morning meetings with officials to speaking at party engagements until late into the evening, any senior minister has a lifestyle that generates enormous pressure, Alison Smith writes. Apart from the stress of office, however, there was nothing to suggest that Mr Michael Heseltine would be a likely victim of a heart attack. Mr Julian Critchley, Mr Heseltine's long-standing friend and his biographer, told ITN yesterday: 'Michael scarcely drinks and in all the years I have known him, he has not been interested in food very much. He eats anything put in front of him. He certainly doesn't smoke.' Colleagues added that his work on his arboretum on his estate on the Oxfordshire-Northamptonshire borders probably contributes to giving him a healthier lifestyle than that of many at Westminster. The 60-year-old Mr Heseltine's political persona is that of someone relaxed in the face of difficulties which are no worse than those that governments have survived before. In spite of that style, however, Mr Heseltine drives himself hard, and has elements of workload not shared by all his colleagues. He is a member of no fewer than 12 of the 27 known cabinet committees and sub-committees which carry out much of the business of government, including the key committees on economic and domestic policy and on defence and overseas policy. His ability to deal with media interviews means that when the government is in difficulties he is constantly fielded to sound a note of reassurance. And his continuing high profile on the constituency engagements circuit  - stepped up in his time out of office from 1986 - also contributes to the burden, requiring tiring hours on the road.</p>

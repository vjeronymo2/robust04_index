			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Letter: Mortgage interest tax relief and the imbalance in Britain's cities Sir, Your leader ('Future of tax reform', March 4) repeats the conventional wisdom that the deductibility of mortgage interest on domestic properties is undesirable, because it distorts the tax system in favour of purchasing residential property, and against other forms of investment. Abolishing mortgage interest relief would, however, distort the British property market even more than at present, because business premises would be unfairly favoured over domestic accommodation. Businesses typically rent property for themselves. The rent paid is a tax deduction, which attracts relief often at 35 or 40 per cent. The landlord frequently is a pension fund, which pays no tax on rent receipts. The real after-tax cost of land use to businesses is thus less than for homeowners, whose tax relief is limited to 25 per cent of Pounds 30,000, and much less than for those who rent their homes, who receive no tax relief at all. Not surprisingly, the result is that businesses are able to pay more for their premises than householders. The consequence of this imbalance can be seen from the way vast swathes of British cities have become bereft of residential accommodation. It is only by non-market means (eg the planning system or housing associations) that areas like Covent Garden in London retain any residents at all. Only by increasing tax relief to householders will a level playing field be created between business and domestic use of land. Adrian Jack, 2 Paper Buildings, Temple, London EC4Y 7ET</p>

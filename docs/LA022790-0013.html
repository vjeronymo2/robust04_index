			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BORDER CHANGES THAT FRIGHTEN  </P> <P> The weekend's voting in Lithuania surprised no one. The Soviet Union's first  multiparty election in more than seven decades saw most Communist Party  candidates, particularly those who urged keeping strong ties with Moscow,  repudiated. The parliamentary candidates backed by the nationalist independence  movement Sajudis won 72 of the 90 contests that were decided. Runoff voting  scheduled soon in 51 remaining parliamentary districts will probably see  similar Sajudis gains. Then will begin one of the more momentous processes in  recent Soviet history.  </P> <P> With the political and moral authority of a sweeping electoral mandate behind  it, Lithuania is preparing to claim its national independence, 50 years after  its forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union. The Soviet constitution  guarantees, without saying how, that any of the nation's 15 republics may  secede. But until just a short time ago anyone foolish enough to advocate such  a step would have been clapped into prison, and any movement organized to  promote it would have been crushed. Now, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev abjures  the use of force to block Lithuania's move toward independence. His only  recourse is to try to delay matters. To that end he argues, rather weakly, that  Lithuania's assertion of independence must be reviewed by the other republics.  More effectively, he can try to drag out the negotiations about Lithuania's  future economic and military relations with the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> But Lithuanians who have never accepted the legitimacy of Soviet rule are  unlikely to remain passive in the face of endless delays. Gorbachev surely  understands that. He also understands the encouragement that a breakaway  Lithuania could give the Soviet Union's other restive republics. From the  Baltic states to Central Asia, tens of millions of non-Slavic Soviet citizens  have never been comfortable within the Soviet empire. They will watch with the  greatest interest what Lithuania is allowed to do.  </P> <P> The rest of Europe will be watching as well, with mixed emotions. While no one  who supports democracy can readily oppose self-determination for those so long  denied a voice in their own destiny, no European familiar with the Continent's  tortured history of conquest, ethnic hatreds and territorial claims can be  wholly at ease with the prospect that border changes may loom once again.  That's why many Europeans have become fed up with West German Chancellor Helmut  Kohl's continued weasling on the question of recognizing Germany's border with  Poland. For good reason, any unresolved boundary issue is seen as threatening.  </P> <P> The key difference in Lithuania, of course, is that restoring the Baltic  state's pre-1939 border with the Soviet Union would not be seen as a danger to  anyone's security. But Lithuania isn't Germany, which is why Kohl's coy  equivocations are making people exceedingly nervous.  </P></p>

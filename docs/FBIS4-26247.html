			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporters Lin Ning (2651 1337) </F> and Ye Hongyan (0673 4767 3601): "500,000 People Fight Floods  in Guangdong"]    [Text] Lubao, 19 June -- Guangdong's Bei Jiang dike today  has resisted the worst floods in 50 years, but the situation  remains critical. Accompanied by Zhang Guoying, deputy  secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, General Li  Xilin, commander of the Guangzhou Military Region, and those in  charge of the Ground Forces, the Navy, and the Air Force in  Guangzhou, inspected the water situation at the Bei Jiang dike  this afternoon along the section between Sanshui's Huangtang,  Lubao, and Datang and Qingyuan's Shilan. They conveyed  greetings to the more than 1,400 officers and men combating  floods at the forefront.    The whole length of the Bei Jiang dike currently is standing  the test of the highest water level on record. The water level  throughout the river valley is not expected to drop appreciably  over the next few days and the flood peak has entered the Bei  Jiang dike area. This, plus the rising water level in the Xi  Jiang, means the high water level will last for some time. This  will still pose a major threat to the safety of the earthen  dike. Moreover, the weather may worsen, and work is under way  to strengthen the dangerous section of the dike, but the  situation of the dike foundation, which has a high degree of  water penetration, is even more grim.    Early this morning and in the daytime, the water situation  in  Bei Jiang was most critical. At 0300, 0800, 1000, 1400, and  1500 today, the water levels at the Bei Jiang dike measured at  Qingyuan, Shijiao, Lubao, Datang, and Huangtang stations all  were higher than the highest figures ever recorded in the past  50 years. After that, the water level at various sections  dropped slightly, but rose again quickly after 1800. By 2200  today, the water levels at the five stations rose again,  reaching 16.34, 14.80, 12.46, 13.94, and 11.93 meters,  respectively, higher by 10-20 cm than the highest figures ever  recorded in the past 50 years.    According to Ou Guangyuan, head of the flood-control  headquarters at the Bei Jiang dike, the water situation tonight  and tomorrow will be very critical because the water level at  the Bei Jiang dike will reach the highest point tonight.  Afterward, it will drop slowly. The Xi Jiang floods also will  reach the highest point tomorrow. The simultaneous rise of  water in the two rivers will keep the water level high for 6-8  days. The time between now and 26 June is a tide-flowing  period. Having been subject to the high water level pressure  for a long time, the Bei Jiang dike will face a test.    Until now, there have been no major breaches of the Bei  Jiang  dike, but owing to the loose soil at the dike's base, there have  been leaks and gushes of water in scores of places. Both early  this morning and in the daytime today, the most critical  situation happened in Shijiao, where there were many leaks along  the 16-km dike. There were 17 leaks in a single 3-km section.  Some 300 soldiers have been dispatched to the scene to plug  holes with sandy soil and stone. In the evening, a serious leak  occurred in the Shijiao-Xialingzhou section, to which Ou  Guangyuan hastily dispatched 900 soldiers to deal with the  emergency.    According to statistics from Zhaoqing, Qingyuan, Shaoguan,  Foshan, Jiangmen, and the Bei Jiang dike, the number of people  taking part in controlling floods and dealing with emergencies  has reached 506,000. At 0400 today, the Guangdong Provincial  CPC Committee and provincial government delivered 100 tonnes of  biscuits and 100,000 bottles of mineral water to Yingde to be  airdropped by the air force to the 70,000-plus victims who are  still trapped by the floods in that area.    In dealing with the worst flood in 50 years, Guangdong has  received vigorous support and help from the Guangzhou Military  Region. The support troops have energetically organized people  to inspect dikes, watch the water situation, enforce dikes,  repair roads, and plug leaks and holes in dikes.    At 1400 today, accompanied by Zhang Guoying, deputy  secretary  of the provincial party committee; vice governor Ou Guangyuan;  and Major General Yu Lusheng, head of the Army flood-control  headquarters at the Bei Jiang dike and deputy commander of the  provincial military district; General Li Xinlin, commander of  the Guangzhou Military Region; along with Lieutenant General  Yang Zhengang of the Guangzhou Air Force; Major General Gong  Gucheng, chief of staff of the Guangzhou Military Region;  political department director Major General Lei Mingqiu;  logistics department director Major General Chen Tianlin; Major  General Liu Yuanjie, political commissar of the Guangdong  Military District; Rear Admiral Zhang Zhensheng, commander of  the Guangzhou Naval Base; and Rear Admiral Li Xingguo, political  commissar of the Guangzhou Naval Vessels Academy; visited the  commanders and fighters of the troops protecting the Bei Jiang  dike. General Li said: The 30,000-plus officers and men of the  Guangzhou Military Region are standing in readiness for orders  to go to the dike at any time to deal with emergencies and  combat floods.    This afternoon, on behalf of Xie Fei, member of the  Political  Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the  Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, and Guangdong Governor Zhu  Senlin, Deputy Secretary Zhang Guoying extended greetings to the  5,000-plus officers and men at the forefront of combating floods  and dealing with emergencies.</p>

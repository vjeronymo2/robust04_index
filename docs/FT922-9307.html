			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Rights and doubled loss at Proteus PRE-TAX LOSSES at Proteus International, the USM-quoted specialist in computer-aided molecular modelling and rational drug design, almost doubled from Pounds 1.27m to Pounds 2.41m in the year to March 31. The company also announced a rights issue to raise Pounds 12.2m net 'to undertake a number of specific, budgeted product development plans'. Mr Kevin Gilmore, chairman, said that the year had seen a continuation of the expansion into molecular modelling design facilities and considerable costs were incurred on business development work. The potential Aids/HIV prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine was being given further trials with results still encouraging. While striving to maintain ownership interest in the core proprietary products, the formation of joint ventures is being pursued - the first was with Genelabs Technologies of the US in relation to potential DNA-binding compounds. Turnover was reduced to Pounds 3,000 (Pounds 7,000) and losses per share were 11.05p (5.92p). The rights, underwritten by Allied Provincial Securities, is on a 1-for-5 basis at 280p per share.</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Business Week Case: The last paragraph of a story in Wednesday's Business  Section inadvertently substituted the last name of a Securities and Exchange  Commission lawyer for the name of one of the defendants in an insider trading  suit stemming from leaks of advance copies of Business Week magazine. As stated  elsewhere in the article, the defendants in the suit, filed last Tuesday, are  Brian J. Callahan and William N. Jackson.  </P></p>

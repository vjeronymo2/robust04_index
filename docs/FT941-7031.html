			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Malaysian worries hit stocks Concern over the implications of the simmering row with Kuala Lumpur hit the share prices of several UK companies with Malaysian trade links. Electrical and electronic stocks were the most severely affected. BICC fell 14 to 436p and GEC 5 1/2 to 319p with analysts worrying less about existing contracts than the threat to future work. But the phrase 'a storm in a teacup' was used more than once, as analysts pointed out that Far East contracts were small as a proportion of the companies' total sales. BICC was also hit by a downgrade from Credit Lyonnais. North West Water, part of a consortium for the privatisation of Malaysia's waste water system, ended down 6 at 547p. However, the company said the contract would not be affected by the furore. In construction, John Laing fell 13 to 385p, but other stocks were quiet. 'Worries over Malaysia are four parts sentiment and one part reality,' said one analyst. But Rolls-Royce was undermined by the nervous sentiment, the shares trailing 5 at 168p. The Malaysian government has an order for 24 Hawk aircraft which are to be powered by Rolls engines, though analysts said it is unlikely to cancel the deal. The aircraft are manufactured by British Aerospace whose shares finished 3 ahead at 505p, after recent falls.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Tory MPs warn on council tax valuations CONSERVATIVE MPs and local authorities are concerned that valuations of properties for the council tax, which will replace the poll tax, may provoke resentment and a mass of appeals next year. This is because they are based on two-year-old valuations, without any allowance for the decline in property prices since then. The concern is greatest in London, where the drop has been steepest. Sir Rhodes Boyson, the Tory MP for Brent North and a former local-government minister, warned yesterday that householders in London and the south-east would feel 'betrayed' if their first council tax bill in April comes to significantly more than their poll tax. He urged the government to send civil servants to 'individual streets' to compare next year's likely bill with what people are paying this year. If people are going to be faced with larger bills, then the government 'may again be walking off the cliff-end' as it did with the community charge, he warned. The timing of the change was also unfortunate, he said, coming during 'a major recession' when 'people are battling to survive'. Because of the price of property, the council tax would 'disadvantage seriously' those who live in London and the south-east. For council-tax purposes, properties are being allocated to one of eight bands by their estimated value in April 1991. The tax payable will rise from Pounds 361 a year for properties in the lowest band (properties valued up to Pounds 40,000) to Pounds 1,078 for those in the top band (payable for properties valued at more than Pounds 320,000). Homeowners will have a right of appeal against the valuation of their properties, but the Department of the Environment insists that appeals will not be allowed on the basis of price falls since April 1991. Since properties in London and the south-east, which will fall disproportionately among the higher-value bands, have suffered the greatest losses in the past two years, the number of aggrieved taxpayers is likely to be considerable. Sir Rhodes urged the government either to introduce a separate set of bands to take account of higher property values in London and the south-east, or to put London properties in a band lower than that appropriate to their value.</p>

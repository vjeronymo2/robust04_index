			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Amsterdam SE changes rules THE AMSTERDAM stock exchange is to lower the threshold for newcomers to the bourse as part of plans to abolish the exchange's 'parallel market' for smaller, younger companies in early-1994. Starting next year, new bourse-listed companies on the main market will need to ensure that the total value of shares tradeable on the exchange is at least Fl 10m. This is well below the bourse's existing threshold of Fl 50m but above the Fl 5m minimum on the parallel market, a separate market established in 1982 for young companies. The parallel market, similar to the UK's Unlisted Securities Market, is to be integrated into the main market next year because it has failed to attract sufficient investors, particularly among institutions. Under rules published yesterday, the exchange said existing companies on the parallel market will be able to move automatically to the main market provided they agree to comply with the bourse's limits on anti-takeover devices.</p>

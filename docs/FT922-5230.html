			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Chambers of trade and commerce set to agree on merger BRITAIN'S chambers of commerce and chambers of trade are on the verge of ending their long rivalry and hope to reach agreement on a merger by the autumn. A link-up between the Association of British Chambers of Commerce (ABCC), with 83,000 member companies, and the National Chamber of Trade (NCT), with 150,000 members, mainly in retailing, would create a business organisation second in size only to the Confederation of British Industry with 250,000 members. A merger would also bolster the ABCC's programme to reorganise and strengthen the chamber of commerce network to make it more of a match for the large officially recognised chambers on the Continent. The ABCC has launched a recruitment drive to bring membership to 150,000 by 1994 as part of the programme. 'A merger will complicate our development strategy but it will add new fabric and build membership,' said Ms Janet Poshtar, spokeswoman for the ABCC. The chambers of commerce and of trade have made many attempts in recent years to merge but these failed over disagreements about the respective voting strengths of the two organisations. These problems have been overcome with agreement for the NCT to form a retail division of the ABCC. Last month's annual meeting of the NCT voted by a margin of nine to one in favour of a merger in principle. The ABCC board of management and national council have now approved the merger and the NCT will consult members in more detail before the two organisations hold extraordinary meetings in the autumn to finalise the merger. 'On a move as fundamental as this we have to give all our members an opportunity to comment,' said Mr Bernard Tennant, director general of the NCT. 'It (the proposed merger) is a terrific achievement.' The organisations believe that combining their head offices - the ABCC's in London and the NCT's in Reading - will make considerable savings. The largest remaining question concerns the degree to which local chambers of trade and chambers of commerce work together. Neither central organisation can force individual member chambers to work with other groups but the benefits of the merger would otherwise be lost. The NCT told members recently that local autonomy was 'sacrosanct' and would remain so even after a merger. The two organisations have been rivals for much of this century although the chambers of trade have tended to attract the small retailer while the chambers of commerce have drawn their membership from a broader range of manufacturing and service industries.</p>

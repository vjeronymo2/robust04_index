			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hunting almost halved to Pounds 21m as defence side falls by a third HUNTING, the maker of the P233 runway denial bombs used to great effect in the Gulf war, has reported profits sharply lower as its key defence business fell by a third. Group pre-tax profits in 1991 fell from Pounds 38.5m to Pounds 21.1m on sales Pounds 21.6m lower at Pounds 749.7m. Basic earnings per share fell from 23.8p to 10.2p, or from 23.5p to 12.7p fully diluted, but the directors are recommending maintaining the final dividend at 6p, giving an unchanged total of 10p. The group spent Pounds 31m on its aviation and its oil and technology divisions, continuing efforts to diversify away from defence businesses. The group took a Pounds 6.2m exceptional charge relating to the closure of its US car body filling business and the write-off of property. Mr Ken Miller, chief executive, said it was unlikely there would be a similar exceptional charge this year. Gearing rose from 42 to 58 per cent as net borrowings increased by Pounds 16m to Pounds 69m. The company said gearing was unlikely to change this year and capital expenditure would fall. Profits before interest in the defence division fell from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 10.5m as the JP233 contract came to an end early in the year. Mr Miller said the division continued to earn a good return on capital and that the greater part of its decline in profits had taken now place. Operating profits in the oil and technology area rose almost 7 per cent to Pounds 11.3m despite problems with the bodyfiller business which has been since sold. The UK specialised products, including those for the DIY market, increased sales and profits. Mr Miller expected a significant increase in profits from this area this year. COMMENT Hunting has suffered along with other defence contractors, underperforming the market quite sharply in the last six months. Furthermore, in the two non-defence divisions it is now pushing, it has few niche positions and the aviation and oil businesses are experiencing particularly tough times. While growth is unlikely to be exciting, there are, however, reasons to suggest Harding has been oversold. The dividend is well covered, last year's exceptionals relating to the closure of a business and property write-offs are unlikely to recur, and the group should start to benefit from the US reorganisation. Pre-tax profits could easily be Pounds 29m in 1992, giving earnings of 17.7p and a prospective gross yield of 7.8p, a 50 per cent premium to the market.</p>

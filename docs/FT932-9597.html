			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht bill abstention set LABOUR'S leadership last night decided that the party's MPs should abstain when the Commons next week reaches the final stage of the Maastricht bill before it goes to the House of Lords. Next Thursday's third reading has been deliberately arranged to take place two days after the second Danish referendum - and will be cancelled by the government if the Danes vote no. Labour's decision means that the government should be able win Commons approval with relative ease. The official reason for Labour abstaining, in spite of its pro-Europe stance, is that Britain is still excluded from Maastricht's social chapter. But it is also the only strategy that has a chance of uniting Labour's pro- and anti-Maastricht factions. However, the number of Euro-sceptic Labour MPs who defy the party whip and vote against the bill is likely to run well into double figures.</p>

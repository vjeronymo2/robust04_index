			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO THE MURK  </P> <P> At first it seemed to be only a lovely nugget of perestroika-era irony. The  Communist Party paper in Havana announced Friday that two Soviet publications  were henceforth banned from Cuba for "justifying bourgeois democracy" and  showing "fascination for the American way of life." It seems that the weekly  Moscow News and the monthly Sputnik, former propaganda magazines that have been  reborn under glasnost as promoters of reform, now contain ideas sanctioned by  Moscow but considered too radical for the Cuban masses.  </P> <P> On Monday, however, the news was far from humorous. Three human rights  activists, Elizardo Sanchez, Hubert Jerez and Hiram Abi Cobas, were arrested  and detained by security police before dawn Sunday morning. The Cuban  government has given no reason for the arrests and the men have not been  formally charged. The three are the last leaders of the fledgling Human Rights  Party, an illegal coalition of human rights groups whose cause is now in  jeopardy.  </P> <P> The detentions and the magazine banning are the most recent stages of a general  crackdown that began last September. Since then, Cuban authorities have  arrested more than two dozen human rights activists, jailing most of them for  petty crimes. The repression has not been limited to dissidents; in June,  Castro publically tried and executed one of his top aides, General Arnaldo  Ochoa Sanchez, for corruption and drug-trafficking. Other government officials  have received the same treatment in the last several months.  </P> <P> The atmosphere of repression is thick and thickening. Even his Soviet  benefactors are alarmed. When Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited Cuba this past May,  the tension between the leaders was evident as Castro enthusiastically  described Cuban socialist achievments and Gorbachev replied politely but  without vigor.  </P> <P> It is clearer than ever that Cuban leader Fidel Castro has become completely  unconcerned with human rights, due process or international opinion. He is  sticking resolutely to his own repressive agenda, refusing to heed the new  socialist call to reform and integrate with the rest of the world. Even as the  rest of the socialist world turns slowly outward, Castro is steering Cuba  straight back into the Stalinist murk.  </P></p>

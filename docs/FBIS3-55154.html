But the  unexpected success in the parliamentary elections of Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's party, voicing ultraradical views of restoring  the USSR and of the new Russia's foreign policy "added fuel" to  the smoldering fire. First in Vilnius the Baltic Council of the  three former Soviet republics asked for guarantees from the  West, then the nerve of politicians in Poland, the Czech  Republic, and Hungary failed. "Poland will press for the  countries of East Europe to be admitted to NATO most speedily,"  Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said. "Acceding to  NATO could be a means for Hungary and other countries in the  region to reliably join Europe and provide weighty guarantees of  security and stability," Hungary's new prime minister, Peter  Boross, stressed at a 22 December press conference.    Europe calmed down somewhat after Boris Yeltsin's statement  regarding the immutability of Russia's foreign policy and the  announcement of the Federal Assembly election results: The  rumor of the overwhelming victory won by the Liberal Democratic  Party and the national-patriots proved somewhat exaggerated.  But the question of NATO's possible eastward progress has not  been withdrawn once and for all. What is more, Russian  diplomacy is confronted with new tasks. First, organizing  reliable contacts with Federal Assembly deputies, who are  already seen to be not at all inclined to toe the executive  line. Second, proposing a clear program for cooperation with  all-European structures. A base for this is in place: During  his recent visit to Brussels Boris Yeltsin signed an  all-embracing political declaration on cooperation with the  European Union -- a declaration that has made it possible to  view with hope the prospects for Russia's economic relations  with the EU. But there is no such treaty with the Council of  Europe, the Western European Union, or NATO.    Dialogue with the NACC opens up extensive opportunities in  this connection. Set up three years ago, it is in our view  fully justifying its existence during the transition from  confrontation to East-West partnership. "The NACC is unique in  that it operates at the meeting point of the interests of West,  Central, and East Europe," Andrey Kozyrev, head of the Russian  Foreign Ministry, rightly pointed out at the Council session in  Brussels. For NATO countries it provides an opportunity to  transform the North Atlantic alliance with consideration for the  radically changing nature of the threats to European and  international peace. It provides Russia and other countries in  the former USSR with a practical mechanism for partnership with  their former adversaries in the most sensitive sphere of  security. For the countries of Central and East Europe it means  an opportunity to eliminate the sense of a certain "security  vacuum" without expanding NATO. What is more, there is an  interest common to all -- that of jointly countering new  challenges to peace and stability on our continent.</p>

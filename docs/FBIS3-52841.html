While the world looks to this summit and its outcome with hope  and confidence, only Israel seems to hope that the Geneva summit  will not achieve any results that might advance the peace  process.    Israel, which was forced to join the peace process under  international pressure and did so with the hope of disrupting it  from within, does not wish the summit success because such  success will undoubtedly reflect positively on the peace process  and give a strong push toward the establishment of a just and  comprehensive peace based on the resolutions of international  legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle. It is only natural  to expect that Israel might do anything in order to confuse the  picture and sabotage the expected results of the summit in  advance.    The Tel Aviv rulers, who tried to delude the world into  believing, after the Gaza-Jericho agreement, that peace has been  established in the Middle East, are only seeking to strike  separate and partial deals and avoid a comprehensive solution as  stipulated by the initiative undertaken by the two cosponsors  and on whose basis the Madrid conference was held. Israel's  adherence to partial solutions, its continued occupation of Arab  territories, and its establishment of settlements on these  territories are considered obstacles hampering the peace process  and preventing any progress in talks.    The international community, led by the American sponsor,  stressed the need to find a comprehensive solution and noted  that settlements are an obstacle to peace. It also welcomed  Syria's position and the paper it presented during the sixth  round of Washington's bilateral talks, considering it an  objective paper based on the relevant resolutions of  international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle.  Nevertheless, Israel stood against the resolutions of  international legitimacy and evaded the Madrid formula and work  for a comprehensive solution. It publicly states that it will  not withdraw from the Arab territories it occupies and that it  is ready for a withdrawal in the Golan and not from the Golan.  All this clearly indicates that Israel is not serious in its  quest for peace. One who wants peace should unequivocally  announce his readiness to restore rights to their owners and to  withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. It is neither  reasonable nor logical for Israel to ask for land and peace  together because no one in the world would approve of this.    Syria and the Arabs are not ready to cede an inch of the  occupied Syrian Golan or any usurped Arab right. There is no  doubt that the U.S. Administration is fully aware of the Syrian  position, which is based on the principles of history,  geography, right, and justice. U.S. President Bill Clinton may  have something new to energize the peace process on the basis of  Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of land for peace.  Syria is ready to listen to the ideas of the U.S. President and  his convictions, but not on the basis of ceding what we struggle  for and believe in. The anticipated Syrian- American summit is  an historic opportunity to advance the peace process. Upon his  meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad, President Clinton will be  reassured about Syria's desire for a just and comprehensive  peace to which the region's peoples aspire. He will also make  sure of the Syrian desire to open all avenues leading to this  peace. What remains to be seen is the actions of the U.S.  Administration, which declared itself a fair and honest partner  in the peace process, toward the party that placed hurdles and  set ambushes along the path of peace. Only then can one talk  about a new and serious trend toward establishing the aspired  peace in the Middle East.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Stanislav Bychkov and Oleg </F> Velichko]    [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 7 Jun -- "Since Malaysia has become  the first country in Southeast Asia to acquire Russian weapons,  we discussed the possibility of establishing in this country a  center for their further promotion in the region." This was  stated to an ITAR-TASS correspondent by First Vice Premier Oleg  Soskovets after his meeting today with Malaysian Prime Minister  Mahathir Mohamad. The Russian Government's representative is in  Kuala Lumpur on an official visit, and was today present at the  ceremony of signing the contract for the delivery to Malaysia of  18 Russian MiG-29 fighters.    Malaysia needs new technologies, new scientific  developments,  and is displaying a practical interest in the sphere of  telecommunications and space technology. "They are not  wondering like some figures have started doing in Russia about  whether to be in space or not, but they intend to get on with  it," O. Soskovets said. Thus, during the conversation with the  head of the Malaysian Cabinet, accord was reached "on  large-scale and long-term scientific-technical cooperation and  the transfer of individual Russian technologies to Malaysia."  It was an "extraordinarily intensive conversation between two  sides with an interest in cooperation," O. Soskovets stressed.    The new Malaysian-Russian relations are "called upon to  serve  the two countries for a minimum of 20 years," Malaysian Defense  Minister Mohamad Najib Abdul Razak stated during today's  meeting. The sides discussed the prospects for cooperation in  military technology as a result of signing the contract on the  MiGs. The war minister called the agreement "the biggest deal  with Russia," and expressed "interest" in the development and  expansion of such cooperation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] held a meeting of  senior party post holders today and discussed measures the party  should take as the national security is driven into a tense  situation while international sanctions against the North is  impending because of the North Korean rejection of nuclear  inspections. In the meeting, the DLP decided to make efforts to  have the people become aware of the present security situation.    At today's meeting, Yi Se-ki, chairman of the Policy  Committee, said that the crisis situation resulting from the  North Korean nuclear issue is heightened because North Korea  claimed that it would regard any form of sanctions against it as  an act of war declaration against North Korea. Yi also said  that in case the UN sanctions turn out to be difficult because  of the Chinese opposition, despite the fact that measures for  sanctions are pushed ahead on the part of the United Nations,  the government is grouping for multinational sanctions among the  ROK, Japan, and the United States.    DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil noted this is the time for the  people to be precisely aware of the national security situation,  and stressed the need for the authorities to explain the present  situation to the people and have them share the correct  awareness. Chairman Kim Chong-pil stressed that the DLP should  play a leading role in this.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Canon advances 84% at halfway Canon, the Japanese office equipment and camera maker, lifted pre-tax profits by 83.6 per cent to Y28.54bn (Dollars 291m) in the first half to June as restructuring efforts paid off. Parent company sales were up just 3.8 per cent to Y512.68bn. The company said it had achieved savings worth Y65bn, more than offsetting a Y38bn negative impact from appreciation in the yen over the period. Canon has been hedging foreign currency and shifting production overseas. Sales of copiers fell by 3 per cent, cameras by 12 per cent and telecommunications equipment 4 per cent. However, a 12 per cent rise in revenues from computer peripherals, its largest product line, was enough to redress the balance. Other optical equipment, the smallest division, showed the sharpest growth at 42 per cent. Domestic sales grew 6 per cent overall, while exports were up only 3 per cent, reflecting the increase in overseas production. By the end of the current year an estimated 30 per cent of all sales is intended to come from products made outside Japan, up from 25 per cent a year earlier. Moody's, the US credit rating agency, this week put Canon's long-term debt under review for possible upgrade because of improved competitiveness. First-half net earnings per share rose from Y14.93 to Y20.44, from which a maintained interim dividend of Y6.25 is being paid. TDK, the magnetic tape and computer peripherals producer, suffered a 26.5 per cent fall in worldwide net profits to Y2.49bn for its first quarter to June. Sales dipped 2.3 per cent to Y117.81bn and pre-tax profits were down 23 per cent to Y4.95bn. The company blamed price-cutting in some of its consumer markets and disappointing demand for magnetic heads used in hard disk drives.</p>

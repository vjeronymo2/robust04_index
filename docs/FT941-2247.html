			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Challenge of trade deficits The UK is living beyond its means. That is the conclusion which will be drawn from statistics for the country's trade with the world outside the European Union, published yesterday. Some will go on to argue that the UK recovery is doomed to drown in a sea of current account deficits. How plausible is that view and what might it mean for policy? As a share of gross domestic product, the UK's measured current account deficit never fell below 1 per cent of gross domestic product during the recession. On average, independent forecasters predict that it will run at about 1 1/2 per cent of GDP during 1994 and 1995. But there are far more pessimistic views. Bill Martin of UBS global research argues, for example, that the current account deficit will rise from 2.2 per cent in 1994 to 3.3 per cent in 1995. This forecast, bad enough on its own, is part of a grim view of economic prospects, which rests on two main points: first, that the growth of domestic demand will remain strong, notwithstanding the tax increases due in 1994 and 1995; and, second, that the supply capacity of the economy is inadequate, despite high unemployment. The UBS team forecasts inflation peaking at 7-8 per cent during the latter years of this parliament, with base rates reaching a floor around 5 per cent this year, before moving towards double digits, if not beyond. Such views have to be taken seriously, in the light of experience and particularly when a more complacent view of economic prospects is held by most forecasters, including the Treasury. Unfavourable trends The current account deficit shows that there is already an excess of aggregate demand over aggregate supply, despite unemployment at just under 10 per cent of the labour force. Moreover, trends seem unfavourable. In December to February, for example, the volume of UK exports (excluding oil and the erratic items) to the world outside the European Union rose 2 per cent by comparison with the previous three months, while the volume of the equivalent imports rose by 3 1/2 per cent. More encouragingly, the value of these exports rose by 18 per cent over the past year, while the value of imports rose by only 9 per cent. But this reflects a sharp rise in export unit values, which must threaten the future growth of export volumes. If domestic demand were to expand at a brisk pace, there could well be inflationary pressure in sectors producing non-tradable goods and services, while the trade deficit would also rise. If foreigners were to prove unwilling to channel funds to the UK or UK residents prove unwilling to repatriate wealth held abroad in the requisite amounts, either the exchange rate would fall, or the interest rate rise, or both. So a trend deterioration in the external balance would impose a constraint on economic growth by threatening higher inflation. Gloomy scenario The nature of that inflation needs to be understood. If the devaluation since September 1992 does prove insufficient to generate a financeable current account at existing interest rates, as economic demand expands, the implication is that the UK's real exchange rate remains overvalued. The implication of the gloomy scenario is not that growth need stop. It is rather that the UK might find itself in the middle of another real depreciation of the exchange rate. Such a devaluation could be achieved either over a long period, during which wages rise by less than productivity, or by a nominal devaluation of the currency. The former would be consistent with continued low inflation; but the latter would threaten a period of higher inflation. What might this possibility mean for policy? First, the relevant measure of inflation for the UK is that for domestic costs, principally labour costs. Second, the government must prevent the growth of nominal demand from surging as it did in the second half of the 1980s. Third and most important, a policy of high interest rates and a high exchange rate may be an unsustainable way of controlling inflation, because of its adverse long-term effects on the supply of tradable goods and services. The fiscal alternative is being used this year and next. Higher taxes may have to be used again, in the still further future.</p>

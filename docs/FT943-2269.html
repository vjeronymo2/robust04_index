			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Ruling casts doubt on eurobonds Bankers fear London's reputation as a leading international financial centre could be severely dented unless an inadvertent restriction on UK insurance companies' holdings of corporate eurobonds is reversed swiftly. UK insurers are not allowed to have more than 10 per cent of their assets in unlisted securities, the definition of which was revised earlier this year when UK insurance industry legislation was amended to include the European Union's third life directive. The Department of Trade and Industry now classifies listed assets as those regularly traded or traded on a regulated market. Since the International Securities Market Association (Isma), the eurobond market's association, has chosen not to be a regulated market but a designated investment exchange, corporate eurobonds are unlisted securities in the eyes of the DTI. Eurobonds issued by sovereign or supranational borrowers are not affected by the ruling because they have been classified by the EU as approved assets for insurers. Mr Richard Regan, head of investment affairs at the Association of British Insurers, said the new ruling was not a major problem since he was not aware of any insurers being close to this limit. The DTI had also indicated it would grant dispensations if individual insurance companies applied. A DTI official confirmed that it had received representations and that it was considering whether to relax the restrictions on traded corporate debt instruments. However, Mr Simon Ellen, chairman of Isma's committee of reporting dealers, said a change in the legislation was required to prevent a serious impact on the eurobond market where UK insurers have become big investors in recent years.</p>

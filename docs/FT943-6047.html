			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Philippine first-half economic growth rate doubles to 5.1% The Philippines economy grew 5.1 per cent in the first half of this year, more than double the 2.3 per cent growth in the same period last year, according to government data released yesterday. The performance puts the economy on track for its target of 4.5 per cent overall growth for the whole of 1994, government economic managers said. Behind the first-half expansion, according to the state policy-making National Economic and Development Authority (Neda), was the stable electric-power supply and favourable weather conditions during the period. In the previous couple of years, the economy had stagnated because power supply shortages had caused daily power cuts that crippled manufacturing activities. Agriculture, on the other hand, was badly hit by typhoons and drought. Gross domestic product in the first half rose 4.1 per cent, but the ever-increasing flow of remittances from Filipinos employed abroad continued to bolster the overall gross national product, the Neda data showed. Power-related activity and construction were the growth leaders during the period, rising 14.5 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. The government, in an effort to bring greater stability to power supply, has been commissioning several private groups to construct power stations. The manufacturing sector, on the other hand, advanced 5 per cent, a turnaround from the decline of 3.1 per cent in the same period last year, when the power cuts were at their worst. The trade sector was also vibrant. Exports expanded 18.2 per cent, but imports rose 22.2 per cent. Neda officials said the bulk of the imports were capital goods (industrial equipment and machinery), which could lead to further industrial growth in the coming months.</p>

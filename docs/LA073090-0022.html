			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> JARVI, GOLABEK IN BOWL BEETHOVEN SPECTACULAR  </P> <P> Some words get overused. At Hollywood Bowl for the last 22 summers, spectacular  has been worked over regularly and frequently. But some nights, the word is  appropriate.  </P> <P> Friday, at the first of two performances of the sometimes annual Beethoven  Spectacular, the fireworks show at the Bowl lived up to its advance billing.  </P> <P> Multicolored visions, kaleidoscopic lighting effects and splashes of lively  images in the night sky reawakened one observer's visual imagination.  </P> <P> No matter that the aural subject of this vivid show-for-the-eye was the  composer's embarrassing pastiche, "Wellington's Victory." It worked,  nonetheless, in tandem with the Los Angeles Philharmonic's careful treatment of  this meretricious material. Michael Hackett staged the work, using costumed  soldiers, swordsmen, townspeople and, of course, cannons.  </P> <P> And the preceding performances, also conducted by Neeme Jarvi in his fifth and  final Bowl program of the summer, proved similarly circumspect.  </P> <P> Most jolly was Mona Golabek's stylish and authoritative playing of the  wonderful solo part in the composer's "Choral" Fantasy, in which she, Jarvi and  the Philharmonic were assisted by the Los Angeles Master Chorale. It's a part  that thrills pianists and mystifies everyone else, but genuine Beethoven  nonetheless, and, in its way, terrifically grateful for the soloist. With her  usual panache, Golabek made it live.  </P> <P> Violinist Mark Baranov was the other soloist of the evening, stepping out of  his seat in the orchestra to play the Romance in G (on Saturday, Mark Kashper  was scheduled to play the F-major Romance at this spot in the program), which  he did with neatness and elegance, if some timidity. The evening, reportedly  attended by 17,753 listeners, began with a bright run-through of the Third  "Leonore" Overture. DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 18 KYODO -- Nippon Steel Corp. said  Saturday [18 June] it has signed a contract to build a steel and  tin producing plant worth about 20 billion yen for China's  leading steel manufacturing plant, the Shanghai Baoshan Iron and  Steel Complex.    The world's largest steelmaker said the plant, comprising a  continuous steel annealing unit and two tin plate producing  lines, is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1997.    It will be the first time for the Chinese steelmaker to  engage in the production of tin, company officials said.    Consumption of tin plate has been increasing rapidly in  China  along with rising sales of canned food and beverages, they said.    Baoshan is undergoing the third phase of expansion to boost  its annual crude steel production capacity to 10 million tons by  the year 2000 from the present 7.2 million tons, they said.    The officials said the Japanese firm will provide  engineering  and operational training for Chinese employees at the plant.    The Japanese steelmaker has been providing technical  assistance for the Baoshan plant since its construction began in  1987.</p>

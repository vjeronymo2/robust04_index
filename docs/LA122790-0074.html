			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE HIGH SCHOOLS EXPECTED TO GROW 34% IN NEXT DECADE;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: CHILDREN OF BABY BOOMERS ARE GROWING UP. 'ESSENTIALLY, WE NEED TO  BUILD 19 NEW CLASSROOMS EVERY DAY,' AN OFFICIAL SAYS.  </P> <P> The number of California high school students will surge by 34% over the next  decade, reversing the no-growth trend of the 1980s, the U.S. Department of  Education said in a report to be released today.  </P> <P> Throughout the nation, children of the baby boomers swelled class rolls in  elementary schools during the 1980s. They will do the same for high schools  during the next decade, the government report said.  </P> <P> Nationwide, the number of students enrolled in public high schools is expected  to grow from 11.2 million this year to an estimated 13.4 million in the year  2000, a gain of about 20%, the report estimates.  </P> <P> The projected growth rate is far higher in California, where an influx of  immigrants and higher birth rates have fueled an enrollment boom in the  elementary grades. That surge is about to sweep through secondary schools.  </P> <P> Enrollment in the state's public high schools is expected to rise from 1.32  million this year to 1.77 million in the year 2000, a 34% increase. Meanwhile,  the number of graduates will grow from an estimated 230,580 next June to  333,640 in the class of the year 2000, an increase of about 45%.  </P> <P> The figures are good news for employers of young people and for college  admissions officers, but they will cause problems for officials who oversee  school construction.  </P> <P> "All those elementary kids we got in the last decade are growing up on us. And  we don't have room for all of them," said Henry Heydt, assistant director of  the school facilities division in the state Education Department in Sacramento.  "We need to build 166 high schools in the next five years."  </P> <P> In the last decade, school planners were able to shift some students from  overcrowded elementary buildings to empty high school classrooms. But that will  no longer be an option, Heydt said.  </P> <P> The state projects that its schools will gain an extra 230,000 students each  year for the next five years. "Essentially, we need to build 19 new classrooms  every day," Heydt said.  </P> <P> The state Department of Finance predicted in September that huge enrollment  increases in public schools will continue at least until the end of the decade.  Figures released by the department's population unit showed that enrollment in  kindergarten through 12th grade will grow from almost 5 million to 6.8 million  in the fall of 1999.  </P> <P> Enrollment jumps have been the underlying causes of problems such as  overcrowded classes, the shaky financial condition faced by 20 to 30 school  districts and a $5-billion backlog in unmet school construction needs.  </P> <P> State officials predicted that the highest projected percentage increase would  be in Riverside County, where school enrollments are expected to increase by  almost 107% -- from 201,600 this year to 417,000 in 1999. Los Angeles County is  expecting a 36% increase in the next 10 years, Orange County 44%, San Diego  County 55% and Ventura County 30%.  </P> <P> The U.S. government report, "Projections of Education Statistics to 2001," is  based on data compiled over the last decade or longer to project trends over  the next 10 years.  </P> <P> It indicates that for the most part, the enrollment trends of the 1980s will be  reversed in the decade ahead:  </P> <P> * Nationwide, public school enrollments in kindergarten through eighth grade  rose from 27.6 million in 1980 to 29.5 million in 1990. The number is expected  to peak at 31.1 million in 1996 and finish the decade by edging down to 30.7  million by the year 2000.  </P> <P> * Public high school enrollments nationwide declined from 13.2 million in 1980  to 11.2 million in 1990. They are expected to increase steadily to 13.4 million  by the turn of the century.  </P> <P> * In California, enrollments through the eighth grade rose even faster over the  last 10 years, from 2.7 million in 1980 to 3.6 million this year. The number  should peak at 3.95 million in 1998 and decline slightly to 3.92 million in the  year 2000.  </P> <P> * While elementary schools bulged, enrollment in California's high schools  declined slightly in the 1980s. The number of students in grades nine to 12  fell from 1.36 million in 1980 to 1.32 million in 1990.  </P> <P> * Nationwide, the number of high school graduates fell from 2.41 million in the  1985 school year to an estimated 2.23 million for the current school year. But  the graduation total is expected to increase to 2.62 million in the year 2000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SURGE IN U.S. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES  </P> <P> A U.S. Department of Education report estimates that the number of students  graduating from California high schools will rise 45% over the next decade,  from 230,580 in 1991 to 333,640 in the year 2000.  </P> <P> 1991: 230,580  </P> <P> 2000: 333,640  </P></p>

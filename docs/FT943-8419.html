			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Robert Lowe back in black Robert H Lowe, the clothing, printing and packaging company, returned to the black with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 305,000 for the six months to April 30, compared with a loss of Pounds 1.28m. The group, which raised Pounds 3m via a placing and open offer in July, saw turnover increase 37 per cent to Pounds 5.59m, although Mr David Sebire, chairman, said that results were flattered because sales to certain customers were brought forward 'compared with normal experience'. He warned that this meant the full-year figures were unlikely to increase proportionately, despite the second half traditionally being better than the first. The placing and offer reduced borrowings by Pounds 2.5m, bringing gearing to 'an acceptable level'. Earnings per share were 0.67p (losses 2.83p).</p>

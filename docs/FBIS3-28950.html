			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 12 (YONHAP) -- North Koreans across the  country observed Lunar New Year's day on Feb. 10 by playing  folk games, according to Radio Pyongyang as monitored by NAEWOE  press, the official North Korea watcher here.    "Our people meet Lunar New Year's day, one of the  traditional  festive seasons, at this juncture of a forceful march toward a  new victory, upholding the (Solar) New Year's day message (of  President Kim Il-song), and cities and villages are filled with  the rejoicing of workers, farmers and children playing such folk  games as sledging, kite flying and top spinning," Radio  Pyongyang was quoted as reporting on Friday.    The report, noting that Lunar New Year day is one of  Koreans'  three traditional festive seasons, said, "the people clean their  houses on New Year's Eve to send off the passing year and put on  new clothing and eat special food on New Year's day to meet the  coming new year."    "The most important thing you must do on New Year's day is  bow down to your parents and seniors in New Year's day  greetings, as this is a custom observed on New Year's day only,  and not in other festive seasons.    "In the past, poor workers could afford to prepare only one  or two plain dishes on Lunar New Year's day and the only jovial  way for them to spend the festive day was to play a folk game."    Radio Pyongyang was also quoted as reporting that North  Koreans spent a joyful Lunar New Year's day "because of the  sagacious leadership of Kim Chong-il in the preservation and  development of the cultural assets of the nation handed down  from generation to generation."    Pyongyang resumed observing Lunar New Year's day in 1989,  not  as a public holiday but as a "substitute holiday" -- meaning  that North Koreans must work on a public holiday in exchange for  a day off on this substitute holiday.    Just after the armistice ending the Korean war was signed in  July 1953, North Korea stopped observing Lunar New Year,  regarding it as a vestige of feudalism.    On Lunar New Year's Eve in February 1989, Radio Pyongyang,  celebrating the holiday's restoration after 36 years of  oblivion, reported the people could once again observe the day  as a traditional festive season through "the good offices of the  dear leader (Kim Chong-il)."    Celebration of Lunar New Year's day in North Korea appears  to  be quite different from South Korea.    In South Korea the first event performed by every household  on this traditional holiday is a rite in memory of ancestors,  but in North Korea this custom is not observed, according to  North Korean media. Instead Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il are  eulogized through propaganda praising the Kims for restoring  Lunar New Year's day as a traditional festive season, with the  people told anew to pledge their allegiance to this father-son  dynasty by visiting a nearby statue of Kim Il-song.    In North Korea, Lunar New Year's day is not a day of family  reunions, unlike in South Korea.    In playing folk games, however, North Koreans are not much  different than their brethren in the South: Sledging, top  spinning, kite flying and other games are played on both sides  of the border.</p>

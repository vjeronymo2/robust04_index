			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / RMC decline held to 11% by German side A 26 PER cent rise in German profits during the first six months of this year was not enough to offset an even greater fall in British profits, RMC Group, the world's biggest concrete producer said yesterday. Overall group pre-tax profits fell 11 per cent to Pounds 62.1m in spite of a 9 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 1.4bn. The group said the disparity between the strength of the German and British businesses underlined the wide gap between the economic performance of the two countries, particularly their construction markets. German profits rose from Pounds 32.1m to Pounds 40.5m accounting for half of group operating profits of Pounds 80.6m, compared with Pounds 86.6m last time. This was using an exchange rate of DM2.90. The contribution from Germany would have been even higher if current exchange rates had been used, said Mr Jim Owen, managing director. British profits fell more than half to Pounds 8.8m accounting for slightly more than a tenth of group operating profits. The group is to pay a maintained interim dividend of 6.6p which was almost twice covered by earnings of 12.1p, down from 15.5p. Its shares rose 34p to close at 443p as UK stocks soared yesterday. There was no sign of recovery in the UK construction market, said Mr Owen. Sales of ready-mix concrete had fallen by up to 4 per cent during the first half and were likely to be about 8 per cent down for the whole year. Mr Owen expected British sales of ready-mix to fall 5 per cent next year with UK construction output unlikely to recover until 1994 at the earliest. German construction by comparison remained strong and earnings in the second half of this year were expected to be every bit as good as the final six months of last year. Mr Owen said a fall in construction output in western Germany next year would be more than compensated for by higher investment in infrastructure in the former East Germany. Profits from other European countries in the first half dipped from Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 23.6m due mainly to lower sales in France and Spain. Lex, Page 22</p>

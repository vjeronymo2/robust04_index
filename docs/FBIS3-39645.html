At the same time,  Athens warns that it will impose stricter measures if Skopje  does not stop its intransigence. Athens is also preparing to  counter the charges from the European partners and Washington at  the political and diplomatic level.    At the same time, the Greek immigrant community in Canada  has  expressed its enthusiasm for the actions and has sent  congratulatory letters to Greek Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou. The overwhelming majority of voters in Greece agree  with the measures imposed. According to an opinion poll  conducted by private research companies in Attiki following the  prime minister's announcement, 67 percent of those asked agreed  with the measures. Consequently, according to political  commentaries, there is overwhelming support for the government  actions.</p>

Addressing the Japan Federation of Economic Organization  (Keidanren) here today, Donald Tsing, secretary for the  Treasury, said big investment will also be launched to meet the  everyday needs of the population.    A major expansion of the Lowu station would be completed  early next year, and the government was considering the  feasibility of a new railway to the border through the northwest  New Territories to link up with the Chinese national rail  system, he said. He added that planning for more container  terminals is under way.    He said the government was particularly satisfied that many  Japanese construction firms had participated in the government  funded core program projects of the new airport at Chek Lap Kok  and helped contribute towards the remarkable progress to-date.    Opportunities are plenty for private sector participation in  Hong Kong's major infrastructural projects for the coming years,  the secretary said.    "Hong Kong will continue to prosper as we embark on our  ambitious but essential works programs to build for the future,"  he said.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Bombay securities scandal cost Standard Chartered Pounds 305m STANDARD Chartered, the UK bank, yesterday disclosed that it had sustained a Pounds 305m loss on Indian operations last year after it raised its provision for possible bad debts resulting from the Bombay securities trading scandal to Pounds 272m. The India loss, boosted by a fresh Pounds 160m general provision in the second half, was offset by an exceptional gain of Pounds 111m from selling properties, and doubled trading profits in the Asia Pacific region of Pounds 382m (against Pounds 184m in 1991). The bank's pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 205m to Pounds 202m as its total charge for possible bad debts rose to Pounds 366m (against Pounds 159m). Its trading loss in the UK and Europe rose to Pounds 64.4m, against Pounds 46.5m in 1991. The group made a Pounds 100m interim provision against the Bombay scandal, which rose in value to Pounds 112m because of exchange rate movements. Mr Rodney Galpin, Standard Chartered chairman, said there was 'no quick solution' to the affair. Mr Galpin, who will retire in May, said the India problem meant that the group's results were 'far less good than I would have wished'. In spite of the Bombay losses, which mean the group is now 80 per cent provided against its gross exposure of Pounds 343m, shares rose by 25p to 716p on expectations of rapid profits growth in future helped by the buoyancy of Asian operations. The group proposed an unchanged final dividend of 13p, making a total of 20p for the year. Its earnings per share after the exceptional gain from selling properties in Asia fell to 29p, against 44.3p. The ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets fell to 4.9 per cent from 5 per cent because of sterling's depreciation against the US dollar. Mr Galpin said it might issue up to Dollars 300m of preference shares 'at some time in the future'. Mr Malcolm Williamson, chief executive, said he had 'no reason to believe that the India situation was other than a unique and isolated event'. Fifteen staff had left, including three in London, and a further six had been reprimanded. The value of Indian securities held as collateral fell from Pounds 63m at the half-year to Pounds 34m at the year-end. Lex, Page 24; Sorry example, Page 28</p>

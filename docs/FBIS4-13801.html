			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, April 23 (AFP) -- The Islamic Resistance  Movement Hamas said Saturday [23 April] the Israeli army  arrested more than 2,700 Palestinians in the last two weeks, but  added its militants would still continue to attack Israelis.    These arrests "which affect all those suspected of links to  Hamas will not prevent more operations by the (armed wing)  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam nor the popular resistance" against  Israeli occupation, Hamas said in a statement to AFP here.    Palestinian sources in the occupied territories have said  that the Israeli army had arrested more than 500 militants in a  bid to destroy the group after it launched attacks which claimed  the lives of 14 Israelis this month.    The mass roundup "comes at a time when the enemy government  prepares to release thousands of prisoners who don't belong to  Hamas in a bid to divide the Palestinian people," the statement  said.    Israel is to set free around 5,000 prisoners after the  signing of a final deal to launch delayed Palestinian autonomy  in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, which may take  place in May.    Israeli negotiators have rejected requests to set free  members of Islamic militant groups opposed to peace.    Hamas called on the London-based human rights group Amnesty  International "to pressure the Israeli government into freeing  immediately the prisoners."</p>

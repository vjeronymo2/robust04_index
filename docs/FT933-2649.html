			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Davis Service ahead at Pounds 8.47m PRE-TAX profits at Davis Service Group, the now reorganised and refocused business services concern, rose from Pounds 8.03m to Pounds 8.47m in the six months to June 30. The results for the first half of 1992 were skewed by a Pounds 2.45m contribution from Godfrey Davis (Contract Hire), sold in April 1992 for Pounds 5.75m, and a net interest charge of Pounds 2.53m, which was mostly the result of the large amount of 'back-to-back' borrowings incurred by the contract hire business. Net interest payable this time came to Pounds 456,000. Gearing at the period-end was 23 per cent on borrowings of Pounds 25.5m, Pounds 18m of which were built up by the Pounds 52m acquisition in May of HSS Hire Services Group from John Mowlem. The 170-strong HSS chain contributed Pounds 699,000 to continuing operating profits of Pounds 8.93m (Pounds 8.11m) and Pounds 10.2m to continuing turnover of Pounds 119m (Pounds 101.7m). It is expected to grow at the rate of 20 outlets a year. Total group turnover came to Pounds 127.7m (Pounds 124.7m). Mr George Boyle, finance director, said as had been foreseen, demand in the group's markets had remained flat, making for increased competition and pressure on margins. Earnings per share advanced to 6.51p (6.39p) and the interim dividend is held at 2.73p.</p>

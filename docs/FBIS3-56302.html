			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Irina Bolshakova: </F> "U.S.-Russian Trade Relations Have Much Room for Improvement"  -- ITAR-TASS headline]    [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- The U.S.-Russian trade  turnover is not very substantial so far, according to Russian  Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov. The  United States accounts for only about two per cent in Russia's  foreign trade. Thus, the trade turnover with the U.S. totalled  2,426 mln dollars in the period from January-November 1993,  including 1,007,200 thousand dollars in export and 1.418,800  thousand in import.    The structure of the bilateral trade turnover inherited by  Russia from the former Soviet Union is based on raw materials,  Davydov noted. The bulk of Russia's export to the United States  is made up by precious metals and articles made of them, rare  earth and non-ferrous metals, oil products, chemicals and  agricultural produce. The U.S. import to Russia is largely  represented by foodstuffs and agricultural produce (wheat,  maize, oats, butter, soy-beans), machinery, equipment and  transport vehicles.    The Russian minister believes the legal and agreement  framework for U.S.-Russian trade and economic relations set up  in 1992-1993, the most-favoured-nation trade regime, the  extension to Russia of the U.S. general system of preferences,  as well as the new programmes for economic assistance to Russia  create real preconditions for a greater volume and a broader  range of U.S.- Russian trade.    However, despite of the recent progress in trade and  economic  relations between the two countries, they still bear the stamp  of the Cold War, Davydov stressed. Thus, the development of  U.S.-Russian trade is hampered by the Jackson-Vanick Amendment  and Cocom lists, barriers on U.S. export of hi-tech products,  tough quantitative restrictions on imports. Furthermore, the  solution of some commercial and financial problems is linked  with various political conditions and the progress of market  reforms. Recently, the United States has considerably limited  the possibilities of Russian uranium products and imposed an  anti-dumping duty on ferrosilicium. According to the minister,  anti-dumping investigation is likely to be launched with respect  to Russian supplies of potassium chloride, aluminium and steel,  which may undermine the positions of Russian exporters on the  American market.    With all this in view, Davydov thinks it necessary to work  out a mechanism of bilateral consultations to prevent possible  conflicts over the trade regime. According to the minister,  Russia should also press for lifting the existing non-tariff  restrictions on Russian exports to the United States and for  using partnership relations with the U.S. to ensure Russia's  full-fledged participation in GATT and the international export  control system. Large-scale cooperation in the investment sphere  is to promote U.S.- Russian trade and economic relations as  well, the Russian minister pointed out.</p>

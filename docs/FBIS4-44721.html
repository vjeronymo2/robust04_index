			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Michael Wendel: "Black Gold From Plastic Waste: </F> Plastics Recycling Will Channel Packaging Floods -- Pilot Plant  Starts Work This Week"]    [Text] About 10 million tons of plastics and elastomers are  produced and processed throughout the year in the German  plastics industry. In 1993, more than 280,000 tons ended up in  the yellow Dual System (DSD) collection sacks as packaging  waste. DSD managers expect 440,000 tons of plastic packaging  bearing the green dot by the end of 1994, the plastics mountain  for recycling being expected to swell to 750,000 tons by the end  of 1986 -- much more than the recycling capacity currently  available in Germany. However, the much-prophesied waste flood  by no means rattles the top DSD people, who are temporarily  afflicted by tight finances and reprocessing bottlenecks. They  are placing their trust in a confident promise made by Plastics  Manufacturing Industry Association chairman Albrecht Eckell:  "The problem of plastics recycling will have been cracked by  the end of 1998."    The magic formula is reprocessing into raw materials.  Instead of just melting plastics down to make park benches,  flowerpots, and noise insulation panels, yogurt pots, detergent  bottles, and similar waste will be used as sources of raw  materials. This week, the BASF chemicals group (on whose board  Eckell sits) is bringing on stream a pilot plant in  Ludwigshafen, where ground-down plastic waste will be liquefied  at 400C then split into oils and gases. Up to 950 grams of  petrochemical products will be distilled in this way from every  1,000 grams of plastic and used as raw materials in the BASF  factories. The PVC [polyvinyl chloride] component will be  separated out as Javelle water and processed in the hydrochloric  acid works. The plant, claims a BASF brochure, will operate  without pressure in a closed system, so it will discharge  "virtually no emissions."    The 40-million German mark [DM] pilot plant has an annual  recycling capacity of 15,000 tons. The follow-up model, which is  scheduled to come on stream early in the summer of 1996, is of a  different caliber: It can reprocess up to 300,000 tons of  contaminated, unsorted DSD packaging -- sufficient volume,  together with the VEBA [United Electricity and Mining Works AG]  coal-oil plant in Bottrop (170,000 tons) and the RWE [Rhineland-  Westphalian Electricity Works] plant (70,000 tons), to meet the  requirements of the Packaging Regulation until that date.    The new industrial-scale technology admittedly has one  drawback: These expensive plants -- BASF's investment will  amount to DM300 million -- must keep running, so they need a  constant plastic waste input. This does away with the incentive  to avoid creating packaging waste. In order to ensure supplies  of DSD material, BASF is also working with the Cologne-based  Otto Group, whose annual sales of DM1.3 billion make it one of  the giants on the waste disposal market. Group chairman Otto  answers objections that central plastics recycling will speed up  the polarization process in the industry by pointing out that  small and medium-sized disposal firms could participate in a  "nationwide project" at 15 regional logistical centers.    Plastics recycling does not come cheap. The Dual System pays  BASF DM325/ton -- about a 10th of the cost of producing a ton of  recycled raw materials, collection, sorting, and separating the  packaging waste taking the lion's share. One ton of crude oil  costs DM200 on the world market. In the ultimate analysis, the  consumer has to pay for it as well at the checkout -- the "green  dot" is what makes this possible.</p>

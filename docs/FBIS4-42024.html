			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Our correspondent" report: "Crimeans Have Made Their </F> Choice"]    [Text] Some 1,103 polling stations opened last Sunday at  0700 hours Moscow time (an hour earlier than throughout Ukraine)  in cities and districts of Crimea. The elections of a president  of Ukraine had begun. This is the third election campaign on the  peninsula since the start of the present year. And if it is  considered that in the first two the elections were held in two  stages, 26 June was the fifth time that Crimeans had gone to the  polls.    The campaign for the election of the president of Ukraine  crept up somehow imperceptibly, without the usual ballyhoo and  scope. Only in the final week before the elections did all seven  Ukrainian presidential candidates take part in a televised  debate, speak on radio, and tour the regions, the Republic of  Crimea included. The candidates for the position of head of  state endeavored to win votes by personal contact with the  electorate and presentation of their programs.    And this was not an easy choice for the latter. Which of the  seven to choose? After all, what our lives will be like in the  future will depend on who is elected. We cannot, therefore, make  a mistake and approach the polls indifferently, as just another  campaign of which we are sick and tired. This is a critical and  decisive choice, particularly for Crimea, with its difficult  relations with Ukraine.    The fears that the summer vacations and the height of the  summer season would influence the activity of the election were  unfounded. Those who had left Crimea were able to perform their  civic duty as of 11 June. Students who had passed their  examinations and lecturers who had gone on leave availed  themselves of this right at Polling Station 1/253 of the  republic center's Zheleznodorozhnyy Rayon, which is located at  the Medical Institute. Polling Station 1/350 of Tsentralnyy  Rayon was crowded from the first hour that it was open. Fifty  percent of those on the electoral roll had voted here by 1400  hours.    According to preliminary information, 52 percent of the  electorate had participated in the elections in the republic as  of 1600 hours. The greatest activity was displayed by the  electorate of Nizhnegorskiy (57.2 percent), Razdolnenskiy  (63.3), Krasnoperekopskiy (57.2), Belogorskiy (55.9), and  Krasnogvardeyskiy (53.2) Rayons and Sudak (54.6), Kerch (53.6),  and Bakhchisaray (58.8 percent).    According to the data of the district election commission of  Crimean Election District No 1, some 1,003,785 persons  participated in the ballot for the election of the president of  Ukraine, and 999,376 persons actually voted, which constituted  62.7 percent.    The vote was distributed as follows:    Valeriy Georgiyevich Babich--19,272 "for," 971,718  "against" (1.9 percent);    Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk--74,243 "for," 916,747  "against" (7.4 percent);    Leonid Danilovych Kuchma--825,250 "for," 165,740  "against" (82.6 percent);    Volodymyr Timofeyevych Lanovyy--33,623 "for,"  957,367 "against" (3.4 percent);    Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz--12,640 "for,"  978,367 "against" (1.3 percent);    Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch--2,975 "for," 988,015  "against" (0.3 percent);    Petro Mykhaylovych Talanchuk--2,224 "for," 988,766  "against" (0.2 percent).    Repeat elections were held on 26 June in four election  districts in which deputies of the parliament of Crimea had not  been elected on 27 March: Chapayevskiy No. 6 of Yevpatoriya,  Livadiyskiy No. 29 of Yalta, and Sevastopolskiy No. 63 and No.  64.    According to data of the Central Election Commission for  Elections of the Supreme Council of Crimea, the elections were  valid, but a runoff for the election of the deputies were  scheduled for all the districts for 10 July.</p>

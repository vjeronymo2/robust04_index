			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / FT London Motor Conference: Rover chief attacks government over economy A SHARP attack on the govern-ment's handling of the economy was delivered yesterday by Mr George Simpson, chairman of the Rover vehicles group and deputy chief executive of its parent, British Aerospace. Blaming the recession on the economic policy of Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, he called for a national industrial strategy such as in Japan or Germany. Mr Simpson told the Financial Times London Motor Conference that if such a strategy were not created 'the possibility of Britain re-emerging as a significant industrial force in the new Europe seems to me to be very remote indeed'. The 'first lesson' the government needed to learn was the 'urgent' need to reduce the relative volatility of the economy compared to those of its international competitors. While the government could not insulate the UK from global economic upheavals, 'they could - as others do - manage the domestic economy in such a way as to iron out the excessive fluctuations which continue to characterise macro-economic conditions in the UK'. Mr Simpson added: 'Surely, if Nigel Lawson had handled the economy differently a few years ago we would not have seen the explosive growth in demand and the loss of control of inflation with the consequent need to raise interest rates to a level, the only consequence of which could be the onset of a sharp and deep recession.' Mr Simpson called for improved quality of information about the economy, and much more 'continuous and effective' communication between government and industry. He said: 'We continue to be faced with economic models with an inbuilt capacity for forecast fallibility . . . with politically influenced Treasury statements . . . and with opinion-based surveys with dubious statistical and research basis. 'There is a very clear need to establish in the country a range of independent, reliable, consistent economic forecast data.' He made clear his belief that the motor industry could not escape partial responsibility for the reduced profits - and in some cases record losses - from the sharp decline in UK vehicle sales. In spite of all the lessons some UK-based manufacturers had handled the recession badly. They had been unrealistic about the effects of recession, cutting back too little and too late. The industry needed to become more flexible and quicker to adopt Japanese lean-production methods. A firm prediction that Honda will move fairly quickly to production of 200,000 cars a year at its Pounds 300m plant under construction at Swindon, Wiltshire - twice the officially-declared capacity - was made yesterday by Professor Garel Rhys, a senior motor industry economist. The forecast was based on the size of component purchases Honda has indicated it will make in Europe, and on the economy-of-scale disadvantage the plant would otherwise face in comparison with Japanese competitors in the UK. Prof Rhys, of Cardiff Business School, told the conference that Honda envisages spending between Pounds 600m and Pounds 800m a year in full production. Toyota was planning spending of about Pounds 700m at its 200,000-cars-a-year plant due to come on stream in Burnaston, Derbyshire, and Nissan Pounds 850m at the 300,000-cars-a-year level in Sunderland. Because of this, said Prof Rhys, it was 'virtually inconceivable' that Honda would not move to at least 200,000 units annually, perhaps by the mid-90s.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Komeito Secretary General  Yuichi Ichikawa said Tuesday [8 February] Asian nations should  establish a system of collective security with the United States  as its center, similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO).    Ichikawa expressed the views at a press conference when  commenting on Japan's existing security system in relation to  Japan's plan to purchase the U.S.-made Airborne Warning and  Control System (AWACS).    "In Asia, too, I think it would be better to establish an  axis of collective security equivalent to NATO," Ichikawa said.    This is the first reference by Ichikawa to collective  security, an issue contravening the constitution which renounces  Japan's use of military force as a means of settling  international disputes.    Ichikawa is known for his close relations with Shinseito co-  leader Ichiro Ozawa, one of the main strategists of the  coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Ozawa  also advocates a cooperative security system in Asia.    Komeito, which is a member of the coalition government along  with six other parties, has recently stepped up criticism of  Japan's military policy as having a tendency to enjoy peace  while refusing to help conflict-ridden countries.    In 1992, Komeito joined hands with the then-ruling Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) in enacting a Peacekeeping Cooperation  Law that enabled the Self-Defense Forces to be sent overseas for  the first time since the end of World War II on U.N.  peacekeeping missions.    "Considering the international situation following the end  of  the Cold War, we should discuss at this juncture how far it is  possible to defend one country alone," Ichikawa said.    Noting that NATO works as an military axis in Europe,  Ichikawa said, "Asia has the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) in the field of economy but it does not have a single  axis in the security field."    He proposed creation of a collective security system in Asia  by integrating APEC and the six-member Association of Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN) as its nucleus and asking the U.S. to join  in as well.</p>

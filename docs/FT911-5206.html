			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Suffering and betrayal in Mogadishu: Somalis believe the outside world has abandoned them MOGADISHU has been devastated by the war, particularly the heavy tank and artillery shelling unleashed indiscriminately in January from Villa Somalia. Few buildings remain unmarked by bullet or grenade fire. Almost every home and factory has been gutted in an orgy of looting. The Mogadishu abbatoir recently constructed with Italian aid money has been disembowelled. Cables were ripped out, walls and corrugated iron sheets torn down and useless hunks of metal machinery carried off by looters. Help is desperately needed. But when the war broke out foreign governments, United Nations organisations and aid agencies scrambled out of Mogadishu as fast as possible. Only Medecins Sans Frontieres, Save the Children Fund UK and the Red Cross have returned with a few expatriates and minimal supplies. Food, fuel, drugs and water are extremely scarce. Fears of an outbreak of cholera, measles and malaria epidemics are rising with the approach of the rains later this month. 'The world has put a humanitarian embargo on us,' said Mr Nurelmi Osman, the acting Health Minister. 'We are asking for food and drugs not guns, for tents not tanks. People are suffering. It will be a disaster.' Somalis feely deeply betrayed by the desertion of the international community, particularly the US and Italy which for years shored up the regime of former President Mohammed Siad Barre with guns and money. And Somalis have showed their anger the Mogadishu way. The US embassy, recently finished at the cost of Dollars 40m (Pounds 22m), was completely wrecked and looted. So was the Catholic Cathedral where the friezes of Christ and the Madonna were sprayed with bullets, the roof torn off and the marble font and altar destroyed. 'Italy was a very bad people because they like Siad Barre,' is scrawled in black paint on one of the walls. 'Our society is deeply demoralised by the actions of Italy and the US government,' said Miss Mariam Arif, a businesswoman from the Hawiye clan, the overwhelming majority in Mogadishu which suffered most at the hands of Mr Barre's security forces. 'They have abandoned us and left us flat. What did the innocent suffering people of Mogadishu do against them?' United Somali Congress officials say an Italian government delegation lead by Mr Umberto Plaja promised emergency help to repair the communications system but has failed to deliver. They also accuse Kenya of directly supporting the Darod clan (Mr Barre's rule favoured his own Marehan tribe, a sub-clan of the Darod). They say Kenya gave the Darod military aid and blocked relief flights to Mogadishu because of links between senior military figures with the Darod clans, business ties and a fear in Kenya of having a multi-party system on its borders. Foreign governments deny that they are supporting the Darods. But they, and UN agencies, excuse their lack of humanitarian assistance saying they cannot yet recognise the provisional United Somali Congress government and that Mogadishu is too insecure. 'That's bullshit,' said Mr Willie Huber, the Somalia representative of SOS, an international aid organisation, who stayed in Mogadishu throughout the war running a hospital for the wounded. Mr Huber, an indefatigable humanitarian, lived through the worst of the war as other relief workers fled the war-torn city. He gathered several hundred Somalis together in the SOS compound. 'I said if we stayed together we could protect each other. After that I couldn't leave. To do so would have been a crazy betrayal.' Mr Huber is now in charge of the only regular relief flights coming into the country, a Belgian Hercules C130 which flies into Mogadishu five times a week with 18 tons of food, fuel and medical supplies which SOS distributes across the city. This only link to the outside world and to regular, although meagre emergency relief, has given him a position almost as powerful and important as that of president. But he is fighting a battle to get funding from the European Community to keep the lifeline open. And he despairs about the absence of basic assistance for the thousands of people on the brink of death. 'Its a disgrace,' he said. As the international community stands by and Somalia plunges deeper into disaster, a feeling of helplessness is mounting in Mogadishu. 'What can we do,' says a teenage USC member who had just driven two wounded fighters back from the front. 'If we were in the Gulf it would be different but this is Africa. Nobody cares.'

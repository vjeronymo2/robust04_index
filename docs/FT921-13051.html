			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Scottish optimism declines BUSINESSES in Scotland see no sign of an economic upturn and are less optimistic than they were three months ago, according to the latest Scottish Chambers of Commerce quarterly survey, James Buxton writes. The recession has affected Scotland less severely than some other parts of Britain, but demand remains stagnant or contracting in all main sectors, while manufacturers' stocks continue to run down. All told, 1,229 companies responded to the survey. In manufacturing, only 2 per cent of respondents were more optimistic than they were three months ago, when the balance was 12 per cent. In retailing, only 2 per cent reported greater optimism, compared with 18 per cent in the previous quarter, and in wholesaling a net balance of 4 per cent was less confident. In the tourist industry, a balance of 24 per cent showed more optimism than three months previously. Confidence in the construction industry deteriorated. Investment is falling and where it exists is mainly devoted to replacing or improving existing plant rather than gearing up for expansion.</p>

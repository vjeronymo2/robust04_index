			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (3): A thrower-up of ideas - Profile of Emre Gonensay A TASTE for Jermyn Street shirts is not the only thing he has in common with the prime minister. As 'ambassador and chief adviser' to Mr Demirel, Professor Emre Gonensay has emerged as a key figure in the Turkish government. In the revolving doors of Turkish policy-making, the exact contribution of this 55-year-old former lecturer at the London School of Economics is hard to pin down. His Ankara office is in a small government building on the road out of town. Colleagues say his task is simply to throw up ideas for Mr Demirel. If his curriculum vitae is anything to go by, he is not the grey academic type - director of Koc Holding, of Egebank, founder and director of Chemical Mitsui Bank Turkey, and chairman of Turkinvest. Prof Gonensay makes few public statements. He claims he was misquoted by the official Anatolian Agency, when expressing enthusiasm for the prospect of a No vote in the French referendum on Maastricht, which he said would enhance Turkey's long-term chance of finding a home in Europe. But Turkey, he says, wants a Europe as wide and as open as possible. 'There needs to be a multilateral globalisation of the northern hemisphere. Look at the Black Sea Co-operation Agreement we signed in June: that's our contribution. It's not watertight and it's not a trade bloc.' He maintains that there are important lessons for Turkey in the confusion over Maastricht and the currency crisis in the exchange rate mechanism. His enthusiasm for a treaty which some believe is already a dead letter might seem curious, particularly given Turkey's own economic realities - 67 per cent inflation, and a budget deficit running at 11 per cent of GNP. In diplomatic and business circles, there are already real questions as to whether Turkey will make its 1996 deadline of full Customs Union with the EC, given the need to keep tariffs high for revenue-raising purposes. Prof Gonensay's view is that Turkey should adopt the financial targets on inflation and budget deficits, as agreed by the Twelve. 'Maastricht, together with a fixed exchange rate, could provide a convenient external anchor for Turkey,' he says. 'It's an an irony, but in Europe there is so little inclination left to wring inflation out of the system, that it's not worth the suffering. In Turkey I think we are still prepared to suffer.' He sees little room for manoeuvre on tax reform, contrary to the analysis of the OECD and other economists. Turkey's economy is already taxed at around 26 per cent of GNP, he says. 'In a country like ours, you cannot hope for a rate much better than that.' The alternative is to cover the deficit by more foreign borrowing or foreign investment. 'Personally, I would like to have seen an increase in our foreign borrowing this year. Our credit rating was fairly good. But now we've lost time.' Of course, the only 'miracle' cure he can see is privatisation. The professor has just two proposals: adopt the practice of balanced budgets, and strengthen the central bank. 'We need a mandate for the central bank to enable it to stabilise prices. No bank governor in Turkey can stand up and do something different from the government.' His idea is to peg the exchange rate to some low-inflation currency, which he says would take the 'discretion out of the central bank's policy-making.' If only for the economic benefits, Prof Gonensay wants 'to see Turkey fulfil the conditions for full membership' of the European Community. 'Customs Union without full membership? Well, that's a matter for the politicians.'</p>

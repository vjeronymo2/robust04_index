			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Anxious Japanese fearful of yen's strength: Worried industrialists and financiers - and contented consumers The unthinkable suddenly became thinkable yesterday after the yen briefly voyaged, for the first time, through the psychologically emotive barrier of Y100 to the dollar. This historic trip into unknown territory has reawakened corporate Japan's fears that the unexpected strength of the currency might stifle the country's fragile economic recovery, just as an unscheduled rise in the yen did this time last year. An anxious Tokyo government yesterday said it would step up efforts to reach a trade agreement with the US, suspense over which has contributed to the yen's rise, and seek co-ordinated currency market intervention with other members of the Group of Seven. The yen hit a new closing high of Y100.65 to the dollar in Tokyo yesterday, 12.6 per cent above its level at the turn of the year. 'Rapid fluctuations would do harm not only to the Japanese economy but to the world economy,' warned Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, after an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the yen's break through Y100 in New York the previous night. He would not comment on why, by yesterday evening, central banks had not jointly intervened, as they did last time the dollar fell sharply against the yen, in May. 'There is a scream arising from Japanese industry,' added Mr Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade and industry. The rise could not have come at a worse time, in European and US markets after the Japanese government had gone to bed, celebrating the day's announcement of a 3.9 per cent annualised increase in gross domestic product in the first quarter, the best performance for three years. A satisfied Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, vice minister of the government's economic planning agency, had at the time announced that - barring a yen shock - Japan had now turned the corner, from its 37-month long economic slowdown, the longest post-war decline. The currency turmoil prompted the third consecutive daily fall in share prices yesterday, leaving the Nikkei 225 index down 231.8 points at 20,581. The Bank of Japan bought dollars heavily. But officials said there was no change in monetary policy, on the grounds that the yen's rise was more of a function of the dollar's weakness against the D-Mark, even if this could be 'negative for the economy'. Most Japanese companies based forecasts of a recovery this year from four years of profits decline on an exchange rate of about Y105 to the dollar. They may therefore have to reduce their forecasts if the yen sticks at the present level. The impact, however, will be uneven. Export dependent sectors, such as electronics lose 6.7 percentage points from annual pre-tax profits with each one yen rise of the Japanese currency against the dollar, estimates Nikko Research Institute. Car manufacturers lose 10 per cent of their profits for every yen rise, estimates Miti's Mr Hata. Car importers, by contrast, have been achieving record sales recently - 8.6 per cent of the Japanese market in May - thanks to the yen's strength. Japanese consumers have seen prices of imported goods fall accordingly. Unsurprisingly, they find it hard to understand the routine cries of alarm from government and companies at every time the yen rises through a psychological barrier. This invites the question of whether the Finance Ministry is right to be as worried as it is. The currency rise is not enough to choke the general economic recovery, as happened last year, believes Mr Yusuke Kashiwagi, senior adviser to the Bank of Tokyo and former vice minister of finance for international affairs. 'I don't think this will hit recovery prospects. This recovery is consumer led and not export led, so the exchange rate will affect the minds of business rather than consumers,' he said. However, he admitted that the volatile jumps in the yen's value were getting 'more and more unbearable' in casting uncertainty over Japan's economic performance. Mr Jun Saito, senior economist at the government's Economic Planning Agency, believes managers are getting more worried by the yen's appreciation, rather than learning to to live with exchange rate volatility: 'They are having to make hard decisions on how to adjust.' So far, corporate Japan has avoided the toughest decisions. It has avoided making redundancies to reduce its high-yen inflated costs in line with international competitors, so that consumers have been partly insulated. However, companies have started to cut recruitment and have increased the pace at which they move production out of Japan to cheaper locations. According to a recent survey by the Yomiuri Shimbun daily, 70 per cent of Japanese companies will recruit fewer new people this year. In the meantime, the proportion of overseas production will rise from 7 per cent of the total now to 12 per cent in the next two to three years, forecasts the Tokyo office of Morgan Stanley. The latest yen shock can only reinforce those trends, suggesting that Japan is unlikely in this decade to recover to the fast economic growth of the 1980s. The yen's strength makes for a weak economic dawn.</p>

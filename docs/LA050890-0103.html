			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW SPRAYING PLAN IS UNVEILED;  </P> <P> MEDFLY: MALATHION TREATMENT WILL CONTINUE IN MUCH OF AREA NOW AFFECTED BY  INFESTATION. NEW OUTBREAKS WILL ALSO FACE WEEKLY APPLICATIONS OF PESTICIDE.  </P> <P> State agriculture officials, girding for a crucial stage in their long campaign  in Southern California against the Mediterranean fruit fly, unveiled details  Monday of a new battle plan that calls for continued pesticide spraying over  much of the now-infested territory and more aggressive attacks against any new  flare-ups.  </P> <P> Under the new plan, roughly 250 of the 470 square miles now being treated with  the pesticide malathion will be sprayed from one to three more times this  month. For some sectors, spraying will be repeated each week through June. Any  new outbreaks also will face weekly aerial applications of the pesticide.  </P> <P> At the same time, the strategy calls for less reliance on sterile fruit flies,  which were to have replaced the controversial malathion-bearing helicopters as  the eradicators' principal weapon.  </P> <P> Under the new scenario, most spraying will be finished by the end of May -- if  no new flies are found. Officials, who initially had hoped to end all spraying  by Wednesday, were reluctant to address the prospects of new outbreaks.  </P> <P> San Bernardino, and Woodcrest in Riverside County, will continue to be sprayed  after May.  </P> <P> Among communities to receive their final sprayings this month and then be  treated with the release of sterile flies are Burbank, Hancock Park, Walnut,  Diamond Bar, Pomona, San Dimas, Glendora, Irwindale, Azusa, Bradbury, Brea and  La Habra.  </P> <P> Among communities to receive their final spraying this month and require no  further treatment are Downey, Norwalk, Artesia, Cerritos, Gardena, Bell,  Maywood, Lynwood, Eagle Rock, South Pasadena, Panorama City, Garden Grove,  Pasadena, San Marino and Temple City.  </P> <P> Underlying the tactical shift is a widely held assumption that the next few  months will prove pivotal in the 10-month-long struggle to eradicate the pest,  which is regarded as a menace to the state's enormous agricultural industry.  </P> <P> "I think the months of May and June will be most critical," said Isi Siddiqui,  assistant director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture.  </P> <P> Summer heat provides ideal breeding conditions for the Medfly. As part of the  new plan, eradication efforts will begin any time a single fly is found in a  neighborhood. Previously, two flies were required before an infestation was  declared.  </P> <P> Siddiqui, who heads the eradication effort, declined to assess how the campaign  is going. "We have to find few flies for a few weeks before I can say where we  are," he said.  </P> <P> James R. Carey, one of five scientists advising the state effort, expressed  even more pessimism about what the summer might bring.  </P> <P> "It's clear," the UC Davis entomologist said. "We are going to find more  (flies). It's not a matter of if, but when."  </P> <P> The broad outline of the new attack had been revealed Friday when Carey and  other science advisers made a series of recommendations to the Department of  Food and Agriculture. Henry Voss, who heads the department, had agreed in  principle to the new spraying schedules and protocols before their release.  </P> <P> The infestation has grown over the months to about 470 square miles in Los  Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. The state divides the  infestation into 19 zones, stretching from Hancock Park in Los Angeles to  Woodcrest.  </P> <P> Monday's detailed, zone-by-zone schedule of spraying and sterile fly releases  shows that about 250 square miles of the spray zone, including Garden Grove,  Eagle Rock and Panorama City, will be sprayed up to three more times this  month. Most will be sprayed only once more.  </P> <P> Conversely, malathion treatment will end Wednesday over about 225 square miles  of Los Angeles and Orange counties, including Glendora, Brea and Upland.  </P> <P> About 170 square miles of infestation will be treated with the release of  sterile flies after the spraying ends. A shortage of the steriles, which over  the span of three life cycles breed fertile flies out of existence, prevented  officials from converting completely to a program of fighting outbreaks with  one or two sprayings followed by sterile fly releases.  </P> <P> In addition to more spraying in some areas, 34 square miles in the city of San  Bernardino will be repeatedly sprayed with malathion through at least June  because of the limited sterile fly supply.  </P> <P> Similarly, Riverside County's Woodcrest community will be sprayed during the  summer, largely because of its commercial citrus groves, which require a  stricter eradication procedure.  </P> <P> Siddiqui cautioned that discovery of any new Medflies could force revisions in  the plan. During the infestation in Northern California during 1980-82, a  relatively quiet spring was followed in June and July with an explosion in the  Medfly population. The infestation quickly grew to over 1,300 square miles --  still the largest Medfly infestation in the state's history.  </P> <P> A flurry of fly trappings in Southern California this spring has Siddiqui and  other experts nervous that they are a harbinger of a bad summer.  </P> <P> Malathion loses some of its potency in hot weather, forcing the state to spray  every seven to 10 days rather than the semimonthly scheduled followed in cooler  months.,  </P> <P> The news of more pesticide spraying for some communities was greeted Monday  with derision.  </P> <P> "I don't believe anything they say anymore," Norwalk City Councilwoman Grace  Napolitano said of state officials. "What's to prevent them from spraying  again? It's asinine. They've got to be stopped."  </P> <P> Even among those who will see their last sprayings this week, the reaction was  grim.  </P> <P> "I'd like to say, 'Great, it's all over,' " said Pasadena City Director William  Paparian. "But is it really over? When will it ever be over?"  </P> <P> The panel of scientific advisers met in Los Angeles last week to review the  state's previous plan to phase out most spraying by May 9, which the scientists  had opposed as risky and premature.  </P> <P> Voss at the time overruled the panel, believing in March that enough sterile  flies would be available from breeding facilities in Hawaii by early May to  replace the pesticide applications.  </P> <P> MEDFLY TREATMENTS -- Planned spraying areas and areas designated for release of  sterile flies.

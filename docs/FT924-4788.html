			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Companies with British links relaxed about impact of row HONG KONG companies with British parents or with traditional British links remain relaxed about the impact on business prospects of the row over the future of Hong Kong. Sir Charles Powell, a director of trading group Jardine Matheson and former foreign policy adviser to Mr John Major and Mrs Thatcher, said: 'We have been operating in China and Hong Kong for 160 years, so tend to take the long view in these kinds of matters. 'We believe these short-term difficulties will be resolved and remain extremely optimistic about economic prospects for China and Hong Kong.' Sir Charles said Jardine supported the efforts of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to promote greater democracy. The group, however, believed this could only be pursued in agreement with China. 'It is Hong Kong's and China's best interests that these differences are resolved,' said Sir Charles. Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation ( P&amp;O) has operated for 125 years in Hong Kong where it has shipping and construction interests. The group said: 'We view the western rim of Pacific, with Hong Kong as a hub, as an area of great economic growth. 'Lord Sterling, our chairman, has recently returned from a very positive visit to Beijing which has reaffirmed our commitment to the region. Our shares are listed in Hong Kong and we are in the process of increasing our investment in the area. We are confident in the future for trade with Beijing and Hong Kong.' Costain, the UK construction group, is part of a consortium of Japanese, US and European companies which yesterday formally were awarded a HKDollars 9bn (Pounds 768.5m) contract to carry out reclamation and site preparation for Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok airport. Mr Wob Gerretsen, Costain director responsible for UK and international contracting operations said: 'There is little concern on our part as all of our work will have been completed and paid for by 1997.' Logica, the largest UK-owned software house, developed the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's computerised trading system and maintains an office of some 50 people there. Mr Colin Rowland, director of international operations, said the political row was not good for confidence either for prospective customers or the company itself. Banks with large investments in Hong Kong reacted cautiously to the dispute. Hongkong and Shanghai Bank said it would not change investment decisions as a result of China's statement because it saw it as part of a continuing war of words. It said banks were more influenced by China's Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.8bn) investment in airlines, power generation and hotels in Hong Kong through the Chinese International Trust and Investment Corporation, and Bank of China. Hongkong and Shanghai and Standard Chartered are among the largest investors in Hong Kong. Standard Chartered said it could not comment, but is thought to be taking similar view of China's statement to Hongkong and Shanghai.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Letter: Austria's farmers not so independent Sir, I am glad that David Richardson ('Touring Europe's green and set-aside land', March 2) shares my concern about the living standard of farmers in Austria, especially when the country, in the heart of Europe, becomes a member of the European Community. Nevertheless, I stress that Austrian farmers are not so independent as the article suggested. Most of them are organised in the Raiffeisenverband, an organisation paying a fixed price for their agricultural products. They are also supported and protected from foreign competition by the Austrian government - but that is not really independence. Austria will be a part of the European common market in the near future, in which the farmers will face international competition anyway. They should switch to a more specialised production, combined with a high level of quality. Austria should be part of the European family, as problems are solved more easily if you are a member of the family than if you are not. Finally, I would like to remind Mr Richardson that Austria does not only consist of farmers, although they are a very important part of the Austrian population.

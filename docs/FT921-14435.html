			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Letter: Explanation is needed Sir, Diane Summers argues that UK women find it far harder to follow careers than do their European counterparts because of a lack of public (tax-funded) childcare provision. ('The little things that mean a lot,' January 13). Could she please explain why, in that case, the UK has a higher rate of female participation in the labour force than any other EC country except Denmark?

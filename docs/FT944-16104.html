			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (3): Sliver of Zen philosophy - Information technology is an area of schisms There is a sliver of Zen philosophy embedded in the way that information technology standards are created. Let something go, and if it's really worth anything, it will come back as a standard. The great 'enabling' technologies of IT have been developed by companies who have made their software public. The SQL database language Structured Query Language was developed by IBM, International Business Machines, then the world's most powerful supplier of mainframe computing power. IBM shared the development secrets of SQL with the software market. It is now the de facto standard tool for making data accessible, and differing databases 'transparent.' The initial S is increasingly explained as meaning 'Standard'. IT is an area of schisms, where posturing about standards is part of a fast-moving commercial game: players jump in the right direction, or they are out. Unable to wait for an authoritative decree, users have stampeded into 'de facto' standards. Examples include PC DOS, the operating system adopted by IBM for its personal computer, that established the dominance of software house Microsoft and proved the foundation for a marketplace in applications. The Windows environment has fast succeeded as equally 'standard', although it is developed, owned and promoted by one company, Microsoft. Unix, the multi-user operating system, was developed 20 years ago (but never promoted) by a telephone company, AT&amp;T, which used to license it to universities, bugs and all. Despite its technical shortcoming it was adopted by dozens of mid-range manufacturers as a 'portable' operating environment. They believed it would be in everyone's interest to break away from proprietary systems and establish a common platform. It is now taken for granted in the IT community that applications running on one Unix computer can be transported to another with little or no change. The effect has been similar to that of PC DOS on the PC: an empowered marketplace, and a real choice of supplier for consumers, which has driven prices down. The process was not painless. The standards associated with Unix were once bitterly contended by two opposing camps. Now resolved, differences are hammered out by Posix committees whose jobs involve sorting out wearisome, but vital detail. X/Open is an organisation originally set up by suppliers to take care of the wider 'applications environment' (the tools and techniques that fall outside the actual operating software, but enable applications to run). It is increasingly driven by users, who are taking a voice in the direction of standards, traditionally set and maintained by developers. The various consortia and organisations involved in developing standards have in the past not been able to move fast enough to stay in line with technical developments, such as, most recently, multimedia and wireless communications. Three of the most influential standards bodies have taken steps to galvanise the process. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the international organisation for standardisation (Iso), and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) mounted a conference on the challenge of multimedia a month ago. 'International standards, are not an option, they are minimum requirement,' Mr Philip Dodds, executive director of the US-based interactive Multimedia Association told the gathering. Dr Hans Gissel, president of the IEC, stated the challenge:'Are we in the technical and standards communities sending the right messages to service providers about which technologies are available, which are immature, and which are stable?' It's a difficult question to answer, and one presently being addressed by the first Joint Technical Committee set up in 1987 by Iso and the IEC, (JTC 1). In addition IEC proposes to combine three of its existing IEC committees into a new one, covering sound, vision and multimedia systems and equipment. There is already a multimedia standardisation project within ETSI, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. IBM's director of standards relations, Mary Anne Lawler, has been chairman of JTC1 since 1991 and is proud of its speedy response. 'JTC1 has a reputation for producing standards faster than any other formal standards body. It is taking us three years to produce an IT standard, but we feel that could be even better.' She talks about mechanisms to include the work already done on 'publicly available specifications', and seems to leave the door open to the various consortia working on de facto standards. 'Multimedia is very fast-moving, but we have a successful track record: the MPG Motion Picture Expert Group is already in its second standard, MPEG 2.' MPEG and its companions are familiar to Mr Nick Dredge, software development manager at multimedia training company AirteQ. AirteQ is standards-aware, as the publisher of a multimedia training aid called FastraQ 9000 for companies undertaking BS 5750 certification (being renamed BS EN Iso 9000). But that is not enough, explains Mr Dredge. 'Proprietary tools are geared towards producing stand-alone applications, not to interoperability. Other organisations are also starting to build up libraries of multimedia assets and, like us, they need to know what assets they have and where they reside - an on-line multimedia database.' AirteQ's solution was a piece of software called Arkiver which catalogues and gives 'transparent' access to a library of video and audio material available across a network. 'We're working towards open architecture which takes away the constraints of the current chaos,' says Mr Dredge. 'Currently, the product is being evaluated by our peer group, because our intention is to get it accepted as a de facto industry standard.' Even the Association for Computing Machinery, the august US body which oversees the disparate IT community, has problems with the fractured nature of the multimedia market. It published the proceedings of a recent ACM computer graphics conference on three CD-ROMs, all needing different access methods. Anyone wanting to reference them needs a plethora of different multimedia protocols and acronyms: Adobe Acrobat and NPEG for case notes, Apple Quicktime and MPEG - Multimedia Program Extra Group for movie formats, TIFF for images, and three different tools for the organisation of the disc. Mr Martin Easterbrook, a systems engineer at Silicon Graphics, one of the companies at the forefront of multimedia, cites this need for different protocols to interpret data as typical of the irritations caused by lack of standards. 'The consumer ought to be able to buy a disc and plug it in without worrying how it is going to work,' he says. 'Official standards tend to move too slowly for the computer industry, and the unofficial standards tend to become political, with rival computers adopting opposite stances. The stance at Silicon Graphics is that we go for the de facto standard. Companies have to grab the standard and make it work for them.' Silicon Graphics is seeking to take part in the establishment of de facto industry-wide standards for multimedia. It is part of a group, Open GL (Graphics Library), working on making resources available to any applications. The group, including IBM, Microsoft and AT&amp;T, got together because the present 'official' graphics standard, FIGS, did not go far enough, and had got left behind by the fast rate of development in multimedia. The GL standard can openly be changed by a majority consensus, including associate members. Other subjects under discussion are standards vital to the development of the much-publicised 'video on demand.' The common terms here are JPEG, used to compress images and MPEG, which is faster because it interprets only the changes between one frame and the next. Various sub-committees of JTC 1 deal with imaging and computer graphics: one of the newest sub-committees, JTC 1-SC 29, is dealing with standards of digitally-coded representation for audio, picture, multimedia and hypermedia information. Cross-platform portability of multimedia and hypermedia is the subject of another new standard, Multimedia and Hypermedia Experts Group, MHEG, due for completion by the end of 1994.</p>

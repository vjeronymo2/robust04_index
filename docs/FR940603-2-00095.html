Kennedy International Airport (JFKIA). The Lead Agency for this Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) is the ADC. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is a cooperating agency with jurisdiction by law and actively participated in the scoping, drafting and reviewing of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and the FEIS. Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (&sect;1506.3, title 40 CFR) for Implementing Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Department of Interior, Departmental Manual at 516 DM 1.1&hyph;6.6, the Service adopts the above FEIS as prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Service used the information and analyses in the DEIS and FEIS to make its own, independent Record of Decision (ROD) for this project. Based on its independent evaluation and review, the Service has selected an alternative similar to the Integrated Management Program, Department of the Interior Policy (IMP/DOI) as its preferred alternative (FEIS, pp. 6&hyph;7 to 6&hyph;9). The conditions contained in the IMP/DOI are designed to minimize environmental harms and constitute an enforceable monitoring and enforcement program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> JFKIA is one of three major airports in the New York Metropolitan Region, servicing approximately 28 million passengers per year. It is located at the eastern end of Jamaica Bay, immediately adjacent to the Jamaica Bay National Wildlife Refuge, which is part of Gateway National Recreation Area (GNRA) [administered by the National Park Service (NPS)]. The interaction of birds and aircraft at JFKIA is a serious problem, creating significant hazards to human safety, as well as causing financial losses due to aircraft destruction, equipment damage, runway closures, and associated personnel costs. The proximity of the airport and wildlife refuge in a coastal location has contributed to an unusually high incidence of bird strikes at JFKIA. As early as 1975, a Service study concluded that gulls (herring, ring-billed and great black-backed) constituted the principal bird hazard at JFKIA. This problem was severely exacerbated by the establishment and rapid growth of a breeding colony of laughing gulls on the salt marsh islands in Jamaica Bay located at the southeast end of Runway 22R/4L. As the colony grew from 15 pairs in 1979 to more than 7,000 pairs in 1990, the number of laughing gulls involved in bird strikes increased from 2 to as many as 187 per year, and the percentage of bird strikes involving laughing gulls increased from less than 2 percent to approximately 50 percent. Other gulls accounted for approximately 25 percent of JFKIA's bird strikes. The 58 other bird species together (1979&hyph;93) have accounted for approximately 23 percent of the air strikes and 25 percent of the damage delays. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Throughout the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's, the PA and Federal, New York State and New York City natural resource management agencies have conducted activities to evaluate, control, and monitor JFKIA's bird strike hazard. These activities have included, but are not limited to the following: Experimental laughing gull egg-oiling project; international panel review; ecological studies; non-lethal harassment programs; and interim shooting programs. Despite implementation by the PA of a multi-faceted bird hazard reduction program and closure of nearby landfills, strikes by laughing gulls continued to increase. In response to the increase, a temporary, on-airport gull hazard reduction program was conducted by the ADC unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1991 through 1993. Between May and August of each year, gulls entering JFKIA airspace were shot. ADC biologists killed 14,191 laughing gulls in 1991, 11,847 in 1992, and about 6,500 in 1993. By the third year, this program reduced the number of bird strikes involving laughing gulls by more than 90 percent in the late 1980's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1992, the concern for potential cumulative impacts associated with the shooting program demonstrated the need to explore issues involved in reduction of the hazards of gull/aircraft interaction at JFKIA. Consequently, the preparation of this Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was initiated to explore all reasonable alternatives that might be implemented to reduce the number of gull/aircraft collisions at JFKIA in an effective, safe, environmentally sound manner that is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIS process, including early public participation, began in late 1992. The Notice of Intent to prepare the DEIS was published in the December 4, 1992  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . At that time, the Service became a cooperating agency. One scoping meeting and one public meeting were held at JFKIA. The Notice of Availability of the DEIS was published in the February 11, 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Prior to the release of the DEIS for public review, the Service reviewed several preliminary drafts. The comment period of the DEIS ended April 25, 1994, however, comments were accepted through April 28, 1994. The Service reviewed and commented on a preliminary FEIS, and all substantive comments were incorporated into the FEIS released to public. The Notice of Availability of the FEIS appeared in the May 6, 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Environmental Protection Agency granted a 16-day waiver in the 30-day comment period for the FEIS on April 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Preferred Alternative <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service's Preferred Alternative closely resembles the IMP/DOI policy, which is set forth in pages 6.6 through 6.9 of the FEIS. The Preferred Alternative contains more specific actions and time frames than are found in the FEIS discussion of the IMP, which appears on page 6&hyph;11. These more specific time frames are discussed below in the subsection entitled ``Service Actions'' within the ``Findings and Decisions'' portion of the ROD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

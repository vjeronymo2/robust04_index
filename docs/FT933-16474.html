			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / MPs condemn ITV over News At Ten proposals THE COMMONS national heritage committee yesterday rushed out a report condemning ITV for its proposals to move News At Ten to an early evening slot in the schedules. The committee said it 'deplored both the proposal to reschedule News At Ten and the evasive and wholly unconvincing manner in which representatives of ITV sought to justify that proposal'. The report came a day after senior ITV executives had been questioned by the committee chaired by Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour MP for Manchester Garton. MPs said the hearing had confirmed their worst fears and no justification for the move was advanced 'beyond arguments of financial benefit and audience retention'. The committee urged the ITV Council, due to discuss the issue of News At Ten on Monday, to reject unequivocally the proposal to make any change to the time at which News At Ten is shown. The Independent Television Commission has told the companies that News At Ten cannot be moved without its permission. Although the ITV companies have a legal opinion that their obligation is to run a main news bulletin during prime time - 6.30 to 10.30pm - they are unlikely to challenge the ITC in the courts. At Monday's meeting the ITV companies will kick the issue into touch by calling for much more detailed research. The committee said yesterday it would not comment on the legal issues but believed that ITV's moral obligation was clear. The companies had acknowledged that if there was indeed a legal requirement to keep News At Ten they would adhere to it. Men in the News, Page 6</p>

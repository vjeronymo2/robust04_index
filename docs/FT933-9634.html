			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Economics: Focus turns to UK recovery prospects ATTENTION shifts to the UK this week where a rush of figures for June and July may confirm fears that the recovery is slowing. The data includes a regional breakdown of the Confederation of British Industry's industrial trends inquiry, which sparked concerns that the pace of recovery was slackening when it was published at the end of last month. None the less, on balance economists expect unemployment to have fallen again in July by a modest 5,000 and foresee growth in consumer lending. Doubts about the strength of the recovery are reflected more in forecasts for manufacturing output. The median prediction is for a month-on-month fall of 0.6 per cent in June, although this would partly be a bounce back from the strong May figure, when output rose 1.8 per cent on the previous month. This is also a busy week for US statistics. The first indication of third quarter consumer spending comes on Thursday with July retail sales figures. These are expected to show fairly soft activity with fairly buoyant general sales offset by lower car sales. In France an increase in indirect taxes is expected to have raised the annual rate of inflation to about 2.2 per cent last month compared with 1.9 per cent in June. Although inflationary pressures in France are virtually dormant, some economists expect the markets to react badly to the higher figure since the comparison with German inflation will look less favourable to France. The rest of the week's economic releases and events follow. The figures in brackets are the median of economists forecasts and come from MMS International, a financial information company.

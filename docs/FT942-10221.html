			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Indian GDRs firm despite cancellation of VSNL India's overseas listed shares have been supported over the last few days by institutional buying which had been set aside for the cancelled Dollars 1bn Euro-issue by VSNL, the overseas telecommunications group, Reuter reports from Bombay. Analysts said that most Indian global depositary receipts (GDRs) - certificates representing domestic shares - had risen by between 10 to 20 per cent since last Friday. However, this follows a sharp decline in their value since February when many of the world's emerging stock markets fell back after the US lifted interest rates. Mr Ajit Dayal of Jardine Fleming India Securities said: 'Fund managers who have India-demarcated cash are buying those shares (GDRs). They are watching good corporate results and generally good economic fundamentals.' Twenty-two Indian companies have issued GDRs over the last three years, raising nearly Dollars 2bn from international markets. VSNL's Euro-issue, which would have been India's biggest, was abruptly withdrawn last week after fund managers balked at the high price set by the government. The domestic stock market has also been resilient over the past week: Bombay's BSE index yesterday added 10.70 at 3,769.72, after a 40-point advance on Monday.</p>

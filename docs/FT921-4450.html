			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Letter: Contradiction seen in UK trade policies Sir, Observers of trade policy, the Uruguay Round negotiations at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and 'EC-92' might be baffled at the contradiction between the UK's traditional preference for liberal trade policies and its policy and actions on bananas. It is easy to understand the historical roots at the pressure for protection. Those roots are largely driven by post-colonial concern, especially for the Windward Islands and Jamaica, which have been allowed to base much of their economies on a false security that has depended on protection and by the political influence and wealth of a few importers who have reaped high profits through their monopoly positions. Loud voices in the UK still cry out for a perpetuation of this privileged access in the face of efforts in the Uruguay Round to end similar preferences. What seems to be forgotten is that the current preferences are the remnants of practices that are clearly illegal under the Gatt. A 1973 Gatt Dispute Panel examined 'Dollar Quotas' maintained for several products by the UK. As a result of the panel's preliminary report, the UK agreed to eliminate the quotas under review. Specifically, quotas on rum, various citrus fruits and products, and cigars were terminated within two to four years. Unfortunately, bananas, one of the commodities in the original complaint by the United States, were eliminated from the complaint because the US did not have an export interest in bananas. There is no doubt, however, that the quotas on bananas were as Gatt-illegal as those removed on the other products. That illegality remains in spite of the EC's Lome Agreement commitments. Had history not excluded bananas in 1973, the EC would have less of a dilemma now and the UK would find itself in less of a contradictory position. It is to be hoped that UK policymakers and their EC colleagues will not seek Gatt-illegal solutions to their banana dilemma.

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Speedy transformation at SGS-Thomson - The turnround at the Franco-Italian semiconductor maker When SGS Microelectronics of Italy and Thomson Semiconductor of France started discussing a merger in 1986, the two companies had a lot in common. Both of the state-owned enterprises were losing market share, both were in financial difficulties and both were struggling to survive in an increasingly competitive industry, with entrenched US and Japanese market leaders and aggressive pretenders emerging in east Asia. Eight years on, the transformation has been impressive. The Franco-Italian group has moved into the black, expanded market share, and has moved to within striking distance of the world's 10 biggest semiconductor companies. It is at the head of the field in technologies such as automotive semiconductors, and Eproms, devices which store data without a power supply, and is preparing to take on Intel, the industry giant, in the strategically-important microprocessor market. The transformation has fed through to the bottom line. Mr Pasquale Pistorio, the Italian chairman of SGS-Thomson who has guided the company back from the brink, predicts a strong improvement in profits this year. In the first quarter, the group chalked up a net profit of Dollars 80m, half of the result for all of 1992. The second quarter was still better, according to the chairman. 'It is quite a turnround,' says Mr Pistorio. 'Many people felt that we were doomed to failure and that Europe could not compete at the top of the world semiconductor industry.' Given the problems of achieving a transnational merger and the struggle faced by many European companies in high technology sectors, the revival appears all the more striking. It raises two related questions; how has the turnround been achieved and will the restructuring prove a durable basis for continued expansion at SGS-Thomson. The backing of state shareholders, concerned to maintain a presence in a strategic industry, has certainly helped. Last year, SGS-Thomson received two capital injections of Dollars 250m each, which have helped bring its debt-equity ratio to below 30 per cent and ease the burden of financial charges. But the recovery has mainly been based on a fundamental reorganisation of the company's operations and a strong effort in R&amp;D. 'When we started we had sales of Dollars 44,000 per head,' says Mr Pistorio, well below the industry average, and about a third of the present level. The result was the closure of five plants in the first year of the merger, three in France, one in Malaysia and one in Singapore. The common factor behind these first actions was speed. 'There were some within the company who thought we should look at a time scale of two years to integrate the companies,' says Mr Pistorio. 'But I concluded it was best to move as quickly as possible. If you go fast then it is difficult for people to hesitate, and it prevents a long period of confusion for customers.' But in spite of the rapid pace of change, two important factors remained constant - commitment to a global manufacturing and sales presence and the emphasis on R&amp;D and innovation. 'We have never cut one person in R&amp;D and we have increased research spending as a proportion of sales to about 18 per cent,' says Mr Pistorio. Efforts were focused on closing the gap with market leaders in CMOS and VLSI technologies, used in a series of applications from microcontrollers to the compression of electronic signals. SGS-Thomson has also maintained its international operations. Last year, SGS-Thomson opened a state of the art plant in Crolles in south-eastern France. Another plant in Phoenix, Arizona, is in the installation phase, while one in Catania, Sicily, is under construction. This new capacity will help push up volumes in the company's more advanced product lines. But, as Mr Pistorio admits, there is still a long way to go. He says the technology and capital requirements of the sector mean that the industry will divide into two broad categories; general, broad range, semiconductor suppliers and small specialist producers. The dividing criteria, he reckons, will be market share, and the crucial level will be about 5 per cent, a few points higher than his company's present share. To lift the company out of what he describes as 'the grey zone', Mr Pistorio is banking partly on sales growth above the market average and on a further shift towards higher value-added products. April's decision to enter the microprocessor market, with devices to be sold under its own name, also reflect the move towards higher margin products. In other areas, however, the company's strategy is to develop partnerships. At the Crolles plant, for example, researchers from Philips work alongside counterparts from SGS-Thomson on the development of VLSI products. 'It is the only example of European semiconductor companies putting their leading edge research together,' says Mr Pistorio. As for new capital, the chairman finds it hard to disguise his enthusiasm for privatisation. 'Our shareholders have been very business-minded,' he says. There is no question, he concludes, that privatisation would make sense, but the 'if, when and how' is up to the shareholders. With both the French and Italian governments already embarked on ambitious privatisation programmes, and with the prospect of further increases in profits, the privatisation of the company now appears more a question of when and how, than if.</p>

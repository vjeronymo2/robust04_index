			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Loyalists hold to threat of retaliation Loyalist paramilitaries are prepared to match an IRA ceasefire with one of their own, but are holding back from taking the first step. Yesterday, in its first public response to the UK-Irish joint declaration, the Combined Loyalist Military Command, which represents the Ulster Freedom Fighters and Ulster Volunteer Force, said that 'in the absence of any response from the Provisional murder gangs' it would pursue its 'stated policy in retaliation to IRA violence'. Loyalist paramilitaries have carried out indiscriminate murders of Catholics in recent weeks, but security sources believe both the UFF and the UVF will scale down their operations before Christmas. 'They are waiting to see what the IRA does next,' one security source said yesterday. 'This is a holding statement.' While adopting an essentially reactive posture in military terms, yesterday's statement made clear that the loyalist paramilitaries also want to be seen as playing a part in setting the agenda. They are calling for the creation of a forum in Northern Ireland to bring together loyalist paramilitary leaders and unionist party officials, to protect unionist interests and act as a potential channel for demilitarising the province. The idea mirrors the Irish government's proposed forum for nationalists. Mr Jim Rodgers, a Belfast Ulster Unionist party councillor, said yesterday that loyalist paramilitaries were angered by what they saw as the emphasis on bringing the IRA into the political process. 'It is one-sided, as if the violence of the IRA justified it,' Mr Rodgers said. Republican sources yesterday again lowered expectations that the IRA would move quickly to declare a permanent cessation of violence, as the joint declaration demands. The sources said the 35-person national executive of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, may reach a 'considered position' on the joint declaration by early next week, following consultations with regional and branch offices. But both Mr Gerry Adams, the party's president, and his deputy Mr Martin McGuinness want to ensure that Sinn Fein's response has the backing of the IRA to avoid a damaging and potentially bloody split in the republican movement. A senior republican source said yesterday: 'We have got to get our response right even if it takes much longer than people expect or else we are all going to be in trouble.' The IRA's executive army council - which includes Sinn Fein officials and representatives of both sides of the border - is empowered by the organisation's constitution to declare 'war or peace'. But the consultation in the next few days will be extended to the IRA's army convention, which comprises active service men and women from each of the IRA's brigade areas. It is widely accepted within the republican movement that any cessation of violence must be endorsed by the convention if it is to be successfully delivered. The IRA disputes the portrayal of the loyalist paramilitaries as reactive, and is reluctant to abandon its operations unless the loyalists first declare a ceasefire. Security sources believe this unwillingness by each side to make the first move could undermine the peace process.</p>

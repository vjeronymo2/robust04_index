			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (3): 'Inflation is the dragon we have to slay' - Bankers and business leaders want the government to go further in de-regulating the economy Mr Omar Davies, Jamaica's finance minister, is haunted by two dragons: inflation and a depreciating currency. 'Inflation is the one which we have to slay, and once we do that, stability in the exchange rate will follow,' says the minister. 'The tools I have are blunt and powerful, but not many - monetary policy, fiscal policy and moral suasion - but the last works only if the first two are shown to be working.' Using a blunt instrument to knock the wayward and truculent economy into shape is not considered the best policy by bankers and business leaders, who argue that the government must go further in deregulating the economy, creating a totally free market and the stability which business needs for proper planning. This, runs one argument, would defeat the currency arbitrageur - another enemy the government thinks it can do without. The government is also concerned about the impact of inflation on its political stock. Steadily rising prices are unpopular and a progressive decline in real income erodes political support. But currency depreciation is not new to Jamaicans. The Jamaican dollar fell by 67 per cent in the 1980s - and by 83 per cent since. The latest fall would not have been so precipitous, argues Mr Edward Seaga, the opposition leader, had not the government moved too hastily in deregulating the foreign currency markets two years ago. 'The government has continued with the deregulation which was in progress when we left office in 1989, but this has not been properly handled,' he says. 'We did not intend to lift exchange controls until there were adequate reserves to defend the exchange rate. The government did it too early and this accelerated the depreciation of the currency.' One of Mr Davies's instruments has been the use of attractively priced government paper, which pays just over 50 per cent, to mop up liquidity. This has sent up commercial interest rates to between 60 per cent and 70 per cent. At the same time the government wants manufacturers to produce for export, to increase hard currency earnings. But the manufacturers say they cannot expand with such expensive money. It is a better risk to buy the government's fixed instruments. 'To say that this is a circle, vicious or otherwise, is putting it too highly,' a leading businessman cynically remarks. 'It is more like a dog chasing its tail.' Other assessments are kinder. Jamaican business has been bruised by government policies over the past 10 years - and Mr Charles Ross, executive director of the Private Sector Organisation, argues that there is one aspect of government policy which must be changed now. While the general direction of the government's economic policy is correct, he says, there is a need for greater fiscal prudence and an end to budget deficits. Mr Davies says the administration is on the way towards a fiscal surplus of just under 2 per cent of GDP for this year. Inevitably, much will turn on the performance of the important sectors of the economy. The three main pillars have been experiencing mixed fortunes. Tourism has managed to cope with the uncertainties of the international economic environment and has been growing steadily. Production of bauxite and alumina has been stagnant because of weak demand for aluminium, and low metal prices have cost the island's economy about Dollars 300m in earnings over the past three years. Of the main agricultural commodity exports, bananas have been improving, but the industry is threatened by a disruption of its lucrative European market. Sugar production has not risen appreciably in recent years; it is relying a good deal on the recent divestment of four state-owned mills. This performance has not generated the levels of growth which the government was expecting from its move towards rapid deregulation of the economy. Bankers have conservatively estimated GDP growth last year at less than 1 per cent. Mr Davies supports this suggestion of stagnation with an - almost inevitable  -analogy to cricket: 'I have not lost any wickets, but I have not scored any runs.' He expects to score this year, but not much, and is forecasting economic growth at between 2 and 3 per cent. Jamaica's external trade balance is worsening. A 22.4 per cent rise in imports resulted in the merchandise trade deficit widening to Dollars 830.3m between January and October of last year. A year earlier the deficit was Dollars 533.3m. Reduced earnings from bauxite and the government's decision a year ago to reduce import duties on motor vehicles have contributed to this. Figures for the 10 month period last year show imports of machinery and transport equipment up 45.7 per cent to Dollars 433.3m. Financing this deficit might prove too steep a task for tourism, income for the expansion of financial services into foreign markets, and overseas remittances. Money sent to relatives by the Jamaican diaspora - mainly in London, Toronto, New York and Miami - makes an important contribution to the ability of the island's people to survive these difficult times. But while many admit that it is 'large' and 'important,' no one knows the size of this part of the informal economy. (Mr Davies thinks it is second only to tourism as a source of foreign currency.) Mr Seaga contends that a better way of dealing with the trade imbalance is to correctone flaw in the government's economic policy, 'The government is failing not in the demand management policies, but in giving emphasis to the demand side and ignoring the supply side,' he says. 'Exports have been at the same level over the past four years, but imports have been growing.' Amid repeated statements by the government about concerns over inflation and currency depreciation, Mr P J Patterson, the prime minister, says the administration intends to stay the course and will not alter economic policy. There are signs of some stability, claims Mr Jacques Bussieres, the governor of the central bank. The exchange rate has moved only slightly since early December, reducing inflationary pressure, with indications that the rate could be below 15 per cent for the fiscal year which begins in April. There is also some comfort within the government over aspects of the foreign debt (higher per capita than many of the better known debtors in Latin America). A series of reschedulings and bilateral and commercial debt, and a regular respect for its obligations to its creditors, has seen the debt stock fall from Dollars 4.1bn in 1980 to Dollars 3.6bn last year. The price of Jamaica's debt on the international market has moved from an average of 36 cents in 1987 to 82 cents last year. Net international reserves at the end of last year stood at Dollars 12.5m, an improvement of Dollars 98.1m on a year earlier.</p>

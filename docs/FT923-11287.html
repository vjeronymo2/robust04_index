			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Building societies suffer heavy outflow of funds These graphs illustrate the story of the week. Building societies suffered a heavy outflow of funds in June, while National Savings had a good month, before the launch of the First Option bond increased their takings still further. The Building Societies Association pointed out that the outflow did not all go to National Savings - the second call for British Telecom shares will have had an effect, and there were also signs that many people were withdrawing savings in order to pay off debts, including mortgages.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Macao gets an army general for governor GENERAL Vasco Rocha Vieira, arrives today in the small Portuguese enclave of Macao on the southern coast of China to take up the post of governor. He has the task of trying to bring some administrative stability and progress to the territory, which returns to China in 1999. The 51-year old army general, who has been Portugal's minister with special responsibility for the Azores for the past five years, has an engineering background, was the army chief of staff in the late 1970s and worked in Macao earlier in his career. He is regarded locally as a popular choice and brings a reputation, which is rare in the enclave, of being a calm adminsitrator and free of corruption. He has started well by appointing two Macao people to top jobs. Macao's governors have a tradition of being accident-prone. The previous incumbent, Mr Carlos Melancia, looked more durable than most but had to resign last October after three years in the job because of corruption allegations. His predecessor lasted only a year and left after a row with Dr Mario Soares, Portugal's president, who directly handles Macao affairs. As is customary when governors change, new people are to be appointed to seven quasi-ministerial civil service jobs at the top of government departments with the rank of under secretaries. The most senior, covering economic affairs, is expected to be filled by Dr Vitor Pessoa, a Portugues economist who has been working for the past five years on World Bank and United Nations development projects. Located 40 miles across the Pearl River Estuary from the more prosperous and glamourous British colony of Hong Kong, Macao has a population of only 444,000 (Hong Kong has nearly 6m) on a land area of 17.4 sq km. Its economic propserity is largely based on gambling casinos and tourism, plus a light industrial base of textiles and toys. But unlike Hong Kong which is being destabilised by the prospect of its return to China in 1997, Macao seems to be gaining from the approach of 1999. A new phase of economic development has begun in the past few years, with major infrastructure projects, including a new airport. General Vieira's main job will be to push ahead with these developments while speeding up long delayed preparations for 1999 including the grooming of locals to take over the administration and translation of laws into Chinese.</p>

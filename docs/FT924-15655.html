			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Technology: Open outcry over heavy-duty phones  - Worth Watching While mobile phone companies strive to produce ever-lighter handsets, there is still at least one application where voice communications systems have to be built like freight trucks. Open outcry trading of options, futures and stocks can be brutal for both traders and their equipment. The Chicago Board Options Exchange has just bought 1,000 Exchangefone II telephones made by New York-based IPC Information Systems designed with a heavy duty, stainless steel casing to protect internal parts. Each has 32 line/feature select keys and two handsets with their own digital tonepad, function keys and display window. A trader can therefore conduct two conversations simultaneously, with lines and features available from either handset. IPC Information Systems: US, 212 825 9060.</p>

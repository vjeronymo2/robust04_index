			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / CSCE states to set up peace-keeping forces GOVERNMENT leaders at the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) will tomorrow agree to set up armed peace-keeping forces aimed at preventing the spread of conflicts in member states. The forces, drawn from CSCE countries, including the republics of the former Soviet Union, will involve civilian and military personnel acting as observers, monitors, or elements of larger military operations. The proposals, agreed early yesterday after four months' negotiations, are seen as an attempt to beef up the organisation's military and security role. Despite reservations by some diplomats that CSCE peace-keeping efforts would duplicate the role already played by the UN, British and US diplomats said the CSCE would complement UN operations. 'The CSCE will work more closely with the UN, the WEU (the nine-member Western European Union), the European Community and Nato, and must play a greater role in conflict prevention and crisis management,' a US diplomat said. But the detailed, 90-page document stipulates that CSCE peace-keeping operations would not entail 'enforcement action,' nor would any military mission be sent until a durable ceasefire had been established. In addition, the document rules out the establishment of a permanent CSCE army. 'Each conflict will be judged case by case,' said Mr Istvan Gyarmati, head of the Hungarian delegation. Another western diplomat added that it would require 'considerable political will and consensus to set up a force and deploy it in a member state.' Diplomats said the need for the CSCE to have its own peace-keeping mechanism stems partly from the sharp escalation in ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia and the Commmonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the need for it to define its role in the post-communist era. In response to the increasing violation of ethnic rights in the former communist states, the final document calls for the establishment of a CSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities - despite strong opposition from Britain, France, Turkey and the US. The primary role of the commissioner is to act as an 'early warning system,' through monitoring potential ethnic conflicts. President Boris Yeltsin yesterday pledged that Russia would pull its remaining 130,000 troops out of the Baltic states by mid-1993, a French official at the Group of Seven summit in Munich said, Our Foreign Staff reports. The announcement came after the CSCE and the G7 called on Russia to withdraw its troops from the three Baltic states. The CSCE's Baltic statement, agreed by all 52 members, follows weeks of intensive negotiations with Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. Diplomats said the statement referred only to the Baltic states, because other CSCE countries would not accept a general statement relating to the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from CSCE countries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A public communique has revealed that the Sandinist  National Liberation Front [FSLN] National Directorate supports a  proposal for a "joint coastal government," prepared by the FSLN  political commission in the North Atlantic region. "We totally  support the proposal," FSLN Secretary General Daniel Ortega  said. Last Tuesday, however, Stedman Fagoth, the Yatama  [Miskito, Sumu, and Rama Indians, and Creole groups  organization] leader and Rio Cocoa candidate for the Liberal  Constitutionalist Party, reacted with surprise to the proposal.    According to the document, the objectivies of the FSLN  proposal are "to secure respect for the people's vote through  proportional participation of each [political] force in the  regional government." It also aims to politically stabilize the  region by reducing signs of violence, threats, and terrorism.    The North Atlantic Sandinist leaders propose that the  minimum  bases for this government of unity be: security for all  residents, labor stability, proportional distribution of  positions on the Regional Council's board of directors, and a  consensus on the election of the governor. Also, to guarantee  the operation of municipal offices and the establishment of  mechanisms to reach "a joint definition on government action  with the participation of religious authorities and political  forces that do not obtain seats on the Regional Council."    As a means of furthering the implementation of their  proposal, the North Atlantic Sandinists suggest a meeting with  the regional authorities of the parties that won seats on the  Regional Council to discuss their proposal and the creation of a  government transition commission.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Oil output value falls THE VALUE of UK oil production fell heavily last month in spite of an increase in production. The fall is confirmed in the latest Royal Bank of Scotland Oil Index, which shows that the value of North Sea production was down 14 per cent last month compared with November. The decline in revenue resulted from a combination of falling world oil prices and weakness of the dollar, which left the sterling oil price at about pounds 10 a barrel. The average daily value of North Sea oil production fell sharply late last year from pounds 26.4m in October to pounds 20.3m in December.</p>

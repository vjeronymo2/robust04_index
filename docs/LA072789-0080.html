			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN END OF FEAR;  </P> <P> CHINESE NATIONAL GRANTED ASYLUM IN BIRTH CASE  </P> <P> A Chinese national who fled because he feared persecution for violating China's  birth-control regulations has been granted political asylum in the United  States.  </P> <P> Yun Pan Lee, 26, won permission to stay after San Francisco Immigration Judge  Bernard Hornbach determined that he would face harsh treatment if he returned  to China, where his wife had been discovered in hiding and was forced to abort  a pregnancy in the fifth month, Lee's attorney, Jon Wu, said. The ruling was  rare, Wu said, in that Chinese nationals seeking asylum on grounds of possible  reprisals for their opposition to the country's "one-child" rule have regularly  been turned down.  </P> <P> Wu said Lee, a carpenter who was staying in San Francisco and is currently  working in New York City, lived for months with the fear that he might be  deported and frequently cried when he showed the attorney pictures of his wife  and two sons.  </P> <P> "When the judge granted asylum, he got on his knees and bowed to the ground,"  Wu said.  </P> <P> Lee was arrested at San Francisco International Airport last October on charges  that he was carrying a forged passport. He was kept in jail until February when  Hornbach ruled favorably on his application for asylum. However, objections  were raised by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which appealed the  ruling.  </P> <P> The INS dropped the appeal last month. The announcement that Lee faced no more  hurdles in his attempt to gain asylum was made Wednesday in Washington by Sen.  William Armstrong (R-Colo).  </P> <P> Lee fled China last year after his wife became pregnant with a third child. Lee  said the pregnancy was unintentional. The couple had already been punished  because of an earlier accidental pregnancy in 1981, Wu said.  </P> <P> "They took away his work assignment, cut off his electricity, imposed fines and  cut off his food rations," Wu said.  </P> <P> Although Lee urged his wife to have an abortion after the second accidental  pregnancy in 1988, as a Roman Catholic she did not believe in abortion and  wanted to bear the child, Wu said.  </P> <P> Knowing that they would face further persecution for that decision, Lee decided  to seek another home for his family while his wife went into hiding to have the  child. But a villager reported Lee's wife to Chinese authorities, who then  forced her to have an abortion, the lawyer said.  </P> <P> Wu said he is working to reunite Lee and his family in the United States.  Because Lee has been granted asylum, he can eventually seek citizenship, making  it easier to bring his family here to join him, assuming that they are able to  emigrate.  </P> <P> "I've received a lot of tearful letters from his wife saying, 'Thank you for  this, you've brought us peace and harmony,"' Wu said.  </P> <P> Wu said he is in the process of contacting the U.S. consul general in  Gwangzhou, near Lee's family home in Fuzhou, about getting Lee's family out of  China. However, he said that might be difficult because Chinese officials  probably consider Lee a counterrevolutionary.  </P></p>

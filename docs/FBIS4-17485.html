			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- "In the first place,  partnership means not deceiving one another and not letting one  another down, taking account of partners' interests and not only  one's own, not trying to place oneself above others, and all  interested parties participating in a process of true  partnership on an equal basis. And those are the principles of  the Partnership for Peace program," Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev said at a news conference today.    The Russian defense minister believes that NATO's  Partnership  for Peace program has been over-publicized, although even the  masters of the program have not yet put forward its specific  principles and measures. Meanwhile, hundreds of scientific  works have already been written on this topic, thousands of  symposiums held, and millions spent on various visits, Pavel  Grachev noted.</p>

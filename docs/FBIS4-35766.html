			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri today said that the  recent Israeli aggression against al-Biqa' is within the context  of a continuous Israeli operation that seeks to steer Lebanon in  the direction Israel wants for the settlement. Hence, he added,  I would like to emphasize the following points in the name of  the Lebanese Government:    1. Lebanon in its entirety stands unified against the  Israeli aggression. The martyrs who fell in al-Biqa' are  martyrs of all Lebanon; they fell as they defended Lebanon's  unity, safety, dignity, and sovereignty;    2. Lebanon engaged in negotiations in order to liberate its  lands from occupation. It will not waive the right to liberate  the land and exercise sovereignty, even under military and  terrorist pressure and despite Israel's acts of piracy. Lebanon  will hold on to the positions it opted to assume with its  brothers, primarily sister Syria, until the Israeli occupation  fully withdraws;    3. The new aggression in al-Biqa' is aggression against  peace that undermines the regional peace process. Lebanon will  not agree to be one of the victims of aggression against  regional peace. Hence, it is entitled to consider any measures  to protect its existence, sovereignty, and the dignity of its  people; and,    4. The international community, particularly the states  sponsoring the regional peace process, are invited to adopt a  clear-cut stance in this connection to put an end to the Israeli  aggression and rescue peace. The Lebanese Government will  shoulder its responsibility in that connection and will do  everything possible to explain its stance at international  forums.</p>

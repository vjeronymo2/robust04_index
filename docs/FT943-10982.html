			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Cutting public expenditure The UK Treasury has long taken a robust - even brutal - approach to the appraisal of government departments' spending plans. A candid clash of opinion behind the veil of official secrecy subjects such plans to rigorous and searching scrutiny. That veil was temporarily lifted yesterday with the leaking of a letter from the Treasury to Mr Michael Heseltine, Trade and Industry secretary, on his department's programmes of support for industry. The letter was written three weeks ago by Mr Michael Portillo, at the time chief secretary, as part of the 'fundamental expenditure review' of the DTI. These reviews were launched in February 1993 to examine departments' long-term spending plans at a time of concern over underlying pressures for continuing growth in public expenditure. The aim was to find areas of public expenditure from which the state might withdraw altogether or where spending might be better targeted. The leaked extracts of Mr Portillo's letter appear to focus much more on the first part of the brief than the second. Mr Heseltine is castigated for offering no candidates up for the axe, apart from one where activity is already suspended. He is accused of supporting the sort of interventionism prevalent in earlier decades, which Conservative governments since 1979 have prided themselves on abandoning. He is urged to be much more radical in getting government 'out of businesses and individuals' hair'. Fundamental rethinking It is right that the Treasury should urge such fundamental rethinking on ministers as part of the current reviews. Yet Mr Heseltine deserves credit for having already detached his department from activities that are better suited to the private sector. He has taken the lead in privatising his research agencies, for example, rather than wasting time on market-testing. He has also undertaken to privatise coal and the post office (the latter with less than full-hearted support from some cabinet colleagues). As for the DTI's budget, it has been shrinking over recent years, from Pounds 2.2bn in 1988-89 to around Pounds 1.25bn this year. There is no doubt that more could be done to focus programmes of support for industry, to ensure that they are not displacing private sector consultancies or duplicating research that business would happily pay for. But there is a role for government in helping small and medium-sized businesses in getting into export markets or in tapping into what consultancy can offer. Selective assistance And in a world where countries compete for inward investment, there is also a role for regional selective assistance in bringing jobs to the UK's assisted areas. A recent study by PA Economic Consultants found that, between 1985 and 1988, the scheme had created or safeguarded at least 75,000 jobs at a net cost of Pounds 560 to Pounds 790 per net job year. The benefits of persuading Nissan to come to Sunderland, or Honda to Swindon, have reached far beyond the jobs created to bringing new work methods that have been copied in other UK industries. Compared with the Pounds 251bn the government will spend this year, the DTI's budget is almost insignificant. If the Treasury is to make a worthwhile impact on future public spending plans, it is the big spending departments - such as social security, health, education and the Home Office  -that will need to be tackled. Yet the early results of the reviews in these departments have been disappointing. In health and education, spending will rise in real terms over the next three years. Ministers continue to duck the question of how to fund the expansion of higher education: until they face it, spending will ratchet up. In the Home Office, the review has spurred the greater use of private finance in the prison service - but that will merely hold the budget constant. It is only in social security where real progress appears to have been made in whittling down the department's spending growth. No department can immunise itself from the pressures on public expenditure. And the demand to justify value for money in all government programmes should be unremitting. But the Treasury would be well advised to concentrate on some of the beams in Whitehall's eye before setting about removing the motes.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Rail freight wins Pounds 43m aid package A package of measures designed to improve the viability of rail freight and to encourage private operators to run freight services is to be announced by the government today. Grants to encourage companies to set up private freight terminals and to switch freight from road to rail are to be increased fourfold to Pounds 43m over the next three years. The government is also to auction off surplus freight locomotives and rolling stock to companies which want to enter the freight market. Details of the government's plans will be unveiled by Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, in a speech to the Chartered Institute of Trans-port. Mr Freeman is also expected to announce that a regulation raising the permitted weight of lorries delivering to rail terminals from 38 gross tonnes to 44 gross tonnes will be put to parliament before the end of January. It should become law by the time freight shipments begin through the Channel tunnel in March. The total grants of Pounds 43m to boost rail-freight shipments start at Pounds 13.3m in 1994-95 and rise to Pounds 15.4m in 1996-97. This money comprises the freight-facilities grant, an existing subsidy to help private operators set up rail terminals, and the track access grant, a new subsidy to help rail-freight operators meet charges for the use of track. The freight-facilities grant, which was previously applied to freight removed from urban roads and single-lane carriageways, has been extended to cover dual carriageways and motorways. It will be calculated on the basis of 5p per lorry mile saved. The Rail Freight Group, a lobbying organisation representing nearly 100 users of rail freight, transport companies and equipment manufacturers, welcomed the increase in grant but questioned the wisdom of spreading it fairly equally over the three years. The group said that if the first year's access grant were fully taken up, and committed for subsequent years, there would be none available for companies applying in years two and three. It also said the decision to extend the scheme to motorways was welcome, though the mileage allowance was only half of what it had been hoping for. The auctioning of surplus BR stock was also crucial to the entry of new freight operators, the group said. But it was important that usable assets were put up for sale and not just locomotives and rolling stock which were ready to be scrapped. Freightliner, British Rail's loss-making domestic container business which has been offered for sale, has attracted a good level of interest from potential private buyers, Mr Freeman said. Government subsidies to this company would continue. Trainload Freight, the profitable BR division which ships basic commodities such as coal, steel and building aggregates, is to be split into three regional divisions from April, transformed into companies in September and privatised in 1995.</p>

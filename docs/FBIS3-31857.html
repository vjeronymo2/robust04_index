Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) command and  Yasushi Akashi to immediately order the deblockade of the bridge  over the Sava river, close to Stara Gradiska, and warned that  the population of the region will no longer tolerate such  conduct which is pushing them towards death.    The Stara Gradiska bridge links the republic of Serb Krajina  (RSK -- formed by the local Serbs in parts of Croatia where they  are in the majority in response to Croatia's secession from the  former Yugoslav Federation), and the Srpska republic (RS) in the  territory of ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "By blocking the Pakrac-Okucani-Gradiska route, viewed by  the  Serb people as their sole lifeline, UNPROFOR has severed the  supply of food and humanitarian aid, and halted the transport of  the seriously ill to medical centres in RS and the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia," says the protest letter.    The letter asks whether "the peacekeepers were deployed in  this region to maintain a cease-fire and help in establishing a  lasting and just peace, or if they were brought in to threaten  the Serb people."    RSK Deputy Prime Minister Branko Lubovac told Serbian radio  Obrenovac that the Serb side fully controls the situation on the  bridge and expressed hope that it will be resolved in a peaceful  way, which depends on UNPROFOR.    He said that the Serbs have always been willing to take part  in a dialogue and expressed hope that Friday's top level meeting  between the representatives of RSK and UNPROFOR will give  concrete solutions to the current situation.    Over 4,000 U.N. troops from Jordan, Argentina and Nepal have  been deployed in western Slavonija, which is within the sector  west of the U.N. Protected Area (UNPA).</p>

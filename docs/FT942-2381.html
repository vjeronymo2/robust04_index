			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / TV watchdog seeks curbs on 'superhighway' The government has been urged to set up strong competition policies for the media and information industries in order to prevent abuse of power in the age of multimedia and information 'superhighways'. The urgent appeal has been made by the British Screen Advisory Council, the all-industry body set up to advise governments on the film, television and video industries. The council argues in a report sent to the Department of National Heritage and the Department of Trade and Industry that the convergence of media, computers and telecommunications is likely to alter the rules for the screen-based media business. If the 'cultural imperative' - the sum of the benefits of public-service broadcasting - is to endure, then tough competition policy will have to come before liberalisation and extensive changes in ownership rules. The council wants the powers of the Office of Fair Trading strengthened so that it can take more independent initiatives. 'To be truly effective, an enhanced OFT would need enhanced resources, additional powers and the political will that they should be used,' the council says. The remit of an enhanced OFT should include monitoring the market operations of private and public broadcasters in order to protect the public interest. It should also be able to allow private lawsuits for damages arising from the abuse of dominance and distortion of the market. No one should be allowed to use a dominant position to inhibit the growth of a competitive programme market, the council says. It also believes that the BBC must be free to pursue commercial ambitions as long as it continues to fulfil its public-service obligations. Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central Television and of the ITV Association, registered an objection to the council's policy on the BBC. The council believes that a flexible policy framework is needed to cope with developments, including digital compression technology. That will involve hundreds of television channels; high-definition, interactive and widescreen television; multimedia and virtual reality. Rather than dealing with each activity in isolation, general principles should be developed to manage the changes under way. The council says conventional broadcasting will become 'part, and a receding part, of the entire spectrum'. But technological change should not be allowed to obscure the role of public-service broadcasting.</p>

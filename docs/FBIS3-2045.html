			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Amy Liu and Angel Lau] </F>   [Excerpt] Four prominent dissidents have been detained in  Beijing in advance of next week's convening of the national  legislature.    Two dissidents, Zhou Guoqiang, an outspoken member of the  political reformist Peace Charter group, and Yuan Gongbing, an  editor of a banned book, were arrested in the past two days for  alleged illegal activities.    The arrests come at a time when a U.S. official in Beijing  has claimed Chinese leaders may be considering again whether to  abolish a law by which thousands of people have been made  political prisoners. Dissident sources said police also picked  up Qian Yumin, a fellow member of the Peace Charter group, early  Wednesday morning and activist lawyer Wang Jiaqi.    The detention of Mr. Zhou was confirmed last night by the  semi-official Hong Kong China News Agency, which said he was  being investigated for his contacts with hostile overseas forces  and anti- government activities.    Mr. Yuan, a Beijing University law lecturer, was arrested on  Wednesday at his home in the city by police after a recent  petition to the law committee under the standing committee of  the National People's Congress (NPC). He was alleged to have  committed criminal offences, a Chinese source told THE HONGKONG  STANDARD.    Analysts believe the detentions are related to the opening  of  the legislature, which in the past has been marked by a  tightening of security. The news agency said Mr. Zhou had  planned to distribute "cultural T-shirts" with slogans airing  grievances at next Thursday's opening of congress. In 1992, Mr.  Yuan sued the government for banning his book, The Tide of  History. The court refused to accept the case.    The arrests coincided with the current visit by United  States  Assistant Secretary for Human Rights John Shattuck to Beijing.  [passage omitted cites THE NEW YORK TIMES]</p>

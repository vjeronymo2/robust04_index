			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" from a speech by Colonel General Momcilo </F> Perisic, commander of the General Staff of the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia (FRY) Army, made at the program marking the day of  the FRY Army in Belgrade on 15 June -- recorded]    [Text] Today we are celebrating the day of the FRY [Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia] Army for the first time in the desire  and hope that the best part of our military and war history  could be incorporated into a safer future for the citizens of  our country, and above all, its youth.    The Serbian and the Montenegrin peoples have their authentic  national histories, however, there would be no survival for us  had we not united our flags of the same colors for a joint  future.    For centuries, our people have had to watch for and defend  itself from the conquerors, to ensure their biological survival  and living space with arms, bravery, and collective  intelligence. We have had our own national armies and each of  them -- the Serbian and the Montenegrin -- veiled history in  timeless epics.    July 16 is a symbol of the unification of the military  forces  of two peoples of the same blood and one of the foundation  stones in the heroic history, which confirms that only with  joint forces and in aspiration of the same goals can we defeat  any enemy.    There is a war going on in our vicinity. The Serbian people  in the Srpska republic and in the republic of Serbian Krajina  are fighting the decisive battle for their survival. The  preservation of their freedom and territory would not be  possible without the policy of peace pursued by the FRY. The  determination for peace has been made conditional on the manner  of outcome of the Balkan drama and we greet wholeheartedly all  the solutions that are leading toward just peace.    The enemies of the Serbian nation, unfortunately, want war,  by trying to transform their blatant military defeats into  diplomatic victories with foreign forces. Because of the just  struggle of the Serbs on the territories that they have  inhabited and created over centuries, our fatherland has been  punished. All the sanctions are now a dark symbol of the  confinement of an entire nation, and a squaring of accounts on  children, helpless, and ill people who are the innocent victims  of the ruthless intentions of the international superpowers to  reshape the Balkan territory to suit their interests.    Currently, the FRY is also being threatened with military  force. Some so-called humanists from the wide world have  demanded the bombing and further decimation of our population.  Unfortunately, they have been joined by some citizens of this  country, who have thus cast a curse upon their own nation and  their fatherland, and called for the [word indistinct] on their  towns and co-residents. This has never happened before in the  famous history of the Serbian and the Montenegrin peoples.    The FRY Army does not want a war. The participants of the  war know what it brings and what it takes away and that is why  peace is the goal of all our goals in the FRY. However, not a  single army that cherishes the traditions on which it was built  can accept peace at all costs and if the freedom, dignity, and  pride of the nation is endangered.    We are building an army of professionals that will protect  peace with its readiness for war and capability to win it, if it  is imposed on us.</p>

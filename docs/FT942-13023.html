			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / People: Usborne suspends pig director Usborne, the grain trading and pig production company, yesterday announced it had suspended on full pay Michael Brown, managing director of its Daisy Hill Pigs unit, pending the result of an investigation into substantial losses in the pig operations. 'As the managing director of the pig company, he has not yet been able to elucidate on why we've lost this money,' said Mike Adams, a director of Usborne and managing director of the grain trading side, but reported that Brown was co-operating with the investigation. Last week the company said that trading difficulties had been compounded by a breakdown in management control of the pig operations, including accounting systems. Richard Clarke, a farm business management consultant, has been appointed general manager with responsibility for day-to-day operations of Daisy Hill Pigs. 'With the breakdown, we're wanting to make a complete reassessment of what future policy should be,' said Adams. 'We're going to make further appointments.' Shares in the company, whose chairman is Lord Parkinson, the former Conservative cabinet minister, were suspended last week at 19 1/2 p after it warned of the first-half losses. The Daisy Hill operation markets 5,000 pigs a week and accounts for about Pounds 30m of Usborne's annual turnover, compared with Pounds 180m from grain trading.</p>

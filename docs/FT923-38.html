			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (14): New sector looks to the home office - The SoHo Market THE LATEST addition to the personal computer industry lexicon is 'SoHo', an acronym for 'Small-office, Home-office' and a password for the return to fast-paced sales growth, according to US personal computer manufacturers. A rapid increase in the number of people in the US who work from home is fueling the SoHo market and creating new opportunities to sell PC to individual customers. 'There are powerful forces at work which are creating this market,' says Mr Tony Santelli, head of International Business Machines PS/1 brand team. Families with working parents who use computers at work are likely to purchase a machine for their own use and share it with their children. Professionals who have lost their jobs are setting up home offices to do free-lance or consulting work. 'Telecommuting' from home offices is also an increasingly popular way to beat traffic jams that is encouraged by environmentally conscious employers. Lower prices are drawing these potential customers into the PC market. With fully configured systems selling for as little as Dollars 1,000, many more people can afford to consider a home computer. According to Apple Computer, some 14m US families can now afford to buy a home computer, of whom 7m have not done so in the past 10 years. The requirements of the SoHo market are, however, quite different from those of traditional business market segments, Mr Santelli says. Sold primarily through retail outlets, PCs aimed at the home and very small business market are pre-configured at the factory, with software already installed. The aim, he explains, is to enable the customer to 'get up and running in 10 to 15 minutes'. With recent additions to its PS/1 product line, IBM aims to get its share of the SoHo market, now dominated by lesser-known clone makers. Apple Computer has also launched a new range of Performa Macintosh PCs targeted at the same customers. Dell Computer is also offering products aimed at individual buyers with its Dimension line of PCs, sold via mail order and its Precision brand, sold in the Price Club, a warehouse discount store. Both companies have recently announced plans to offer their new products in department stores and consumer electronics stores where until recently only 'clones' have been sold. 'The traditional computer resellers were dominated by the 'brand name' products, so retailers became a haven for the clones,' Mr Santelli explains. 'We recognised that the retail channel represented an uncovered opportunity.' The so-called SoHo market is extremely price sensitive. People paying for computers out of their own pockets are more inclined to shop carefully and search out bargains. However, one of the primary concerns among this customer group, according to computer makers, is the fear of obsolescence. Therefore, although they are looking for good value they want to buy the latest technology and the average selling price is well above that for bottom of the range machines. In the US market, PCs based on Intel 486 microprocessors are rapidly taking the place of older 386 based machines as the highest volume products in all market sectors and the SoHo segment is no exception.</p>

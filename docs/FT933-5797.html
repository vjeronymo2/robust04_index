			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: The Limited plans shake-up THE LIMITED, the US clothing and toiletries retailer, will close or remodel as many as 360 of its Lerner New York and Limited women's clothing stores as part of a two-year restructuring programme. The company, which operates 12 specialty store chains and a mail-order catalogue business, said that it would take a Dollars 200m pre-tax charge against earnings this year after reassessing the carrying value of certain Lerner, Limited and Henri Bendel outlets. The provision would cover the cost of the closures, remodelling and asset revaluation. The company also announced that it had completed the sale of a 60 per cent stake in its Brylane mail-order division to Freeman Spogli, a California merchant bank, for Dollars 285m in cash. It said the disposal would result in a Dollars 203m pre-tax gain. Some of the proceeds are to be used to accelerate the store closure and remodelling programme which is expected to be completed by the end of 1995. In contrast to many restructurings, the company's refocus is expected to increase total employment, not reduce it.</p>

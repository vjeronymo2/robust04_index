			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Getting to grips with the Green Giant: Guy de Jonquieres explains the strategy changes at GrandMet Investors drew two reassuring conclusions from the Pounds 175m restructuring charge announced by Grand Metropolitan yesterday. It is seen as an attempt by the UK-based food, drinks and retailing group to improve its competitiveness, and evidence of efforts to extend Grand Met's successful brand management skills from spirits to other businesses. The fact that at least two thirds of the planned cost cuts will fall in the US also marks an admission that the transatlantic expansion strategy championed by Mr Ian Martin, the group's former managing director, has not lived up to expectations. Mr Martin, who last Friday lost the race to succeed Sir Allen Sheppard as Grand Met's chairman, masterminded the Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds 3.76bn) acquisition of Pillsbury, the US food group in 1989 and was responsible for improving its profitability substantially. However, Pillsbury's recent performance has been much more uneven, partly because of the impact last year of a sharp drop in fresh produce prices on Green Giant, the frozen vegetable division which is Pillsbury's largest business. Though prices recovered this year, after floods in the Midwest destroyed much of the vegetable crop, Green Giant has been subjected to the same intense pressures from the retail trade which have squeezed the margins of many leading US food brands. Green Giant has sought to re-build profits through increased marketing and by extending its brand to fresh produce. But events of the past year have underlined the difficulty of maintaining a large branded premium in a sector closely tied to the commodity cycle and subject to growing own-label competition. GrandMet insisted yesterday that Green Giant had a good future and it did not plan to sell it. However, the group also appears to have concluded that scope for increasing prices is limited and that margin improvements will have to rely heavily on cost reductions. Some observers believe Mr George Bull, who has managed GrandMet's food business for the past year, would have liked to adopt such a strategy earlier but did not feel able to until he was promoted to group chief executive on Friday. How much of the planned savings Pillsbury will be able to hold on to is an open question. As Mr John Wakely of Lehman Brothers pointed out yesterday, fierce retail competition is forcing many US food companies to hand over many efficiency gains to supermarkets in the form of promotional cash payments. The restructuring of Pearle Vision is the second big shake-up of the US optical retailer since it was acquired by GrandMet in 1985. It follows two years of losses, as budget-conscious consumers have spent less on the spectacle frames which provide most of Pearle's profits. Mr Kevin Feeney of stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite argues that the acquisition was always flawed. 'GrandMet thought it was buying a chain of opticians, when what it actually acquired was a fashion business.' Pearle has also looked an increasingly odd fit in recent years as GrandMet has sharpened its focus on internationally branded businesses - all the more because efforts to transfer Pearle's formula to the UK have been disappointing. The general assumption yesterday was that Pearle was being restored to profitability as a prelude to its eventual sale - an interpretation which GrandMet did not go out of its way to discourage. Though most analysts welcomed that prospect yesterday, many questioned the logic of injecting a further Pounds 60m into a business which has recently contributed nothing to group profits and which may not remain in the fold much longer.

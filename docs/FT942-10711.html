			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / International Company News: Khalid Salem Bin Mahfouz - Correction In an article in the International Companies and Finance section of May 5 1994 headed 'Mexican Banker Faces Civil Action', we wrongly described Mr Mahfouz as having pleaded guilty to charges arising out of the 'BCCI investigation'. We accept that last December the New York County District Attorney and the Federal Reserve dropped all federal and state criminal and civil charges against Khalid Bin Mahfouz in connection with their BCCI investigation. We apologise to Mr Mahfouz for any distress or embarrassment that may have been caused to him and his family by the error.</p>

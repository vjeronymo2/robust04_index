			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Matuschka sells its Frankfurt currency arm MATUSCHKA, the Munich-based financial services outfit run by Count Matuschka, continued its slimming-down exercise yesterday with the sale of its Frankfurt-based currency managing unit. The sale, to the business's managers and to Oechsle International Advisers, a Boston-based international fund management group, follows a series of disposals during the course of the past year. In June last year, Mr Manfred Meier-Preschany, a Frankfurt-based corporate doctor, was brought in to deal with the after-effects of over-expansion in the late-1980s. He recommended that the group pull out of currency trading, venture capital, property consultancy and other peripheral activities. Mr Meier-Preschany left at the beginning of the year and Count Matuschka re-assumed the job of chief executive. He has continued the rationalisation process. In recent months he has sold Matuschka-Capital, Matuschka &amp; Co, Zurich, and its stake in Techno Venture Management  - all venture capital operations. The Count bought out his partners, took his personal stake in the group up to 66 per cent and restructured the core businesses in a complex transaction involving EffectInvest, an Austrian private bank. Matuschka was once spoken of as one of Germany's leading independent financial services businesses and at its high-point employed more than 468 people. This is down to less than 100 people, although the irrepressible Count boasts of the group's strong balance sheet and has plans to expand the core businesses.</p>

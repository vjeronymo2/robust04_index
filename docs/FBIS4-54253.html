			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Subin Khuankaeo] </F>   [Text] Mai Sai, Chiang Rai Province -- Warlord Khun Sa's  Muang Tai Army (MTA) yesterday claimed responsibility for  blowing up the dyke of a reservoir to cut the water supplies to  the border town of Tachilek opposite Mae Sai.    An aide to Khun Sa said one of the MTA's five sabotage units  which infiltrated Tachilek was responsible for the explosion  along the ridge of the dyke, about one kilometre southeast of  Tachilek. The explosion took place at about noon Wednesday.    The blast destroyed the dyke so that the reservoir drained  into the Mae Sai River.    The deputy governor of Chiang Rai who inspected the border  opposite Tachilek, said the blast had caused water shortages in  the town.    The act of sabotage was apparently part of the resistance to  the ongoing suppression drive by Rangoon forces against Khun Sa  which has captured part of the Shan State.    An MTA source said about 1,000 government troops from the  77th Division in Shan Tung and 55th Division in Mong Yawng had  arrived in Tachilek on Wednesday night.    They were expected to be despatched to Doi Kong Mon, about  20  kilometres southeast of Tachilek, which was captured by the MTA  on April 18, in a bid to recapture it.    Heavy fighting in the area is expected very soon said the  source.    Chao Klwan Muang, head of the political section of Khun Sa's  MTA forces said at his command post at Doi Taw Kham near Doi  Kong Mon that the Burmese people were disillusioned with the  State Law and Order Restoration Council which took control of  the country in 1989.    He said the SLORC was nearing its end as the people had  suffered enough under its administration.    Chao Khwan Muang said government jet fighters had flown over  Doi Kong Mon but no airstrikes had taken place because of bad  weather On the Thai side of the border, government forces  comprising rangers, border patrol police, provincial police and  defence volunteers have been ordered on full alert along a  30-kilometre stretch opposite Burma to prevent soldiers from the  two warring sides and villagers fleeing the fighting crossing  into Thailand.    Villagers in Mae Sai district said about 300-400 Burmese had  already sneaked across the border to live with relatives in the  district.    A Border Patrol Police source said last night the border  with  Mae Sai was expected to be closed from today.</p>

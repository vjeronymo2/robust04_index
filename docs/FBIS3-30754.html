			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander </F> Luczak, deputy chairman of the Polish Peasant Party Chief  Council, by Ewa K. Czaczkowska and Kazimierz Groblewski; place  and date not given: "How Did It Happen? One Cannot Negate  Everything"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Luczak] The Democratic  Union, which is beyond a doubt the strongest party derived from  Solidarity roots, keeps suffering defeats. The Solidarity camp  failed to establish a party that would be a driving force for  the transformations. Practically speaking, it is hard to tell  what the social basis of Solidarity is now supposed to be. You  keep asking: "How did you manage to score the [election]  success?" I think the answer lies in the clarity of the social  groups that both parties addressed: The Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD] addressed urban residents, mainly laborers,  whereas we addressed residents of rural areas, mainly farmers.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] But Solidarity parties also addressed the  same social group.    [Luczak] But Solidarity units kind of went against all that,  and, in this way, they wasted their victory of 1989.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Don't think that what happened on 19  September was simply a matter of society displaying an opposite  reaction?    [Luczak] It is possible. We [the Polish Peasant Party  (PSL)] and they [the SLD] are both at the stage of adapting  ourselves to democracy. Before the elections, society supported  the previous system very vigorously, but now, after four years  have passed, society made a decision that now is the time for  us. Those who are in power are always more vulnerable to  criticism.    But I would oppose it when someone says that our parties are  postcommunist. Genealogy is what it is; everyone was born at  some point. Take a look at the origins of some Solidarity  activists. [passage omitted]    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] But isn't it so that the main reason for  the PSL's success [in the 19 September 1993 elections] was that  the party guaranteed to maintain the status quo in rural areas  and the areas' structure, that the PSL gave hope that nothing  would change and that what was going on for four years will be  slowed down, if not completely withdrawn?    [Luczak] My view is that, as is the case with many other  areas, agricultural changes must be evolutionary. Any type of  action aimed at gaining a fast result is doomed to failure.  Throughout the 1970's and the 1980's, the authorities were  afraid of farmers. They were afraid to interfere with farmers'  property so they maintained the status quo.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] So you [PSL activists] decided to echo the  authorities by saying: Let the rural areas remain the way they  are.    [Luczak] Belarusians or Ukrainians would give a lot in  return for being able to have the kind of rural areas we have.  We, on the other hand, have them but are not happy anyway.  Unless appropriate means are directed to rural areas, nothing  will come of policies written down on paper. Even if those  means are indeed directed there, I am terribly skeptical as far  as agricultural reforms are concerned. I can see that the  civilized world is helpless when faced with agricultural  problems.    [Excerpts] [RZECZPOSPOLITA] So, in your view, problems in  rural areas are unsolvable?    [Luczak] They can be solved, but that is very hard to do  because, with current technologies, one can lead to the kind of  growth of agricultural output that is almost without limits.  That, of course, causes rules of employment to change. There is  also a clash with routine ways of behavior, with attachment to  land, and with tradition.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] You promised before the [19 September]  elections that you would find such appropriate financial means  for rural areas, as well as subsidies and inexpensive credits.  But now it turns out that there is not enough money in the  budget; even your own Sejm deputies club is critical of that.    [Luczak] There is more money in the budget than was the case  last year, but there is still not enough for everyone. Those  who think that one can achieve progress in that area in a very  short time are wrong. The purpose of our election program was  to convince people, and my view is that it was done well. But  another issue is that the program's implementation must be  spread out over time.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Is it your view that the fall in popularity  rating for the United Peasant Party-PSL in the period preceding  the 1989 and 1991 elections was just temporary, or is it perhaps  the case that the PSL's current success is just temporary? What  is permanent?    [Luczak] Nothing in this world is permanent. We are all  just a passing phase.... Not to waste the great victory--that  is what wise behavior should be about, in this situation.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] All right, but we will have  self-governmental elections shortly.    [Luczak] Let it all boil there, in that melting pot. Then  it will turn out that some people are destined to be in office  two years, whereas other people four years. We have a democracy  now, and there is nothing permanent in a democracy.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] So you can imagine the PSL not being  permanent?    [Luczak] As a peasant movement, we have a hundred years  behind us, and I would not like to live long enough to see the  movement's end. I will always keep saying that the peasant  movement has achieved the most now, when you take a look at its  entire history. I think it is likely that, in the future, we may  be in the opposition, that we will be a party without successes.  But that possibility is a feature of democracy. The peasant  movement may go through a worse period of its history, but the  most important thing is that it be on the list of those parties  that will be permanently participating in the country's  political life over the next two decades.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Can you imagine a situation where a  completely different party would gain the votes of your  electorate, whereas you would disappear from the scene and  become a very small, a miniature kind of party?    [Luczak] It is possible theoretically, but I think we have  enough common sense in what we do to not let that happen.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] You are a class party, the last of your  kind. Will such parties continue to exist much longer?    [Luczak] There is a whole debate going on about whether we  are a class party or an all-nation one. An all-nation party was  being built beginning in the early 1940's, from the days of  Mikolajczyk. But the fact that it is so hard for us to detach  ourselves from the class nature is a consequence of tradition  and of various interdependencies linked to it. We are a young  society, genealogically speaking. The first generations made up  of laborers and intelligentsia are always very negatively  predisposed toward their rural origins. We gained big support  in rural areas; that group of people was convinced by what we  told them. But I think that, in terms of a party program, we  are not a class party but one whose program is for all social  groups.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Will the PSL "guarantee everyone  profitability of agricultural production through the selling of  their products?" You know where that quote is from--your  campaign leaflet.    [Luczak] There is nothing you can guarantee forever in a  market economy. Every artificial creation will prove impossible  to implement after some time passes. But it would also be a bad  thing if one were to discontinue measures aimed at guaranteeing  the profitability of production. Everyone wants to receive the  kind of payment for his work that would compensate for the labor  he invested. If you have a peasant investing more in his  production than what he receives after selling the product (I am  ignoring here his own labor for the moment), that is morally  repugnant and economically unacceptable, and, in that case,  perhaps one should guarantee the profitability of agricultural  production through administrative measures.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] That would be a complete return to the old  ways.    [Luczak] No one will do it generally and as a wide-sweeping  measure. But to promote agricultural production and to preserve  certain types of crops, one must create the right conditions to  make profitability clearly visible. But we will not go back to  quotas or uniform prices throughout the country.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Does a politician feel ashamed at any time?  I mean the kind of shame when he promises something during an  election campaign but later, when his party is in power and he  has the means to implement it, he fails to do what he promised.  I am saying that because you sound as if you assumed from the  very beginning that what you had talked about will not be  implemented.    [Luczak] You cannot approach politics in a way that is  detached from reality, nor can you, I would say, approach  politics in moral terms only. Politics has its own rules. One  knows from the very beginning that nothing contained in an  election program can be implemented right away. Such is the  case the world over.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Are you saying one should not believe  politicians?    [Luczak] Politics is an art of talking to society. There  definitely should be a certain margin of confidence, but not  "from wall to wall." There must be a certain margin, there must  be something that binds society together, something that will  make it...    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] ...Decide that the thing is lost?    [Luczak] Well, yes. Such are the rules of the game.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Your government implements to a large  extent the program of the previous cabinets.    [Luczak] It is a very good thing that there are no major  turning points; society would not stand for that.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] But, in that case, don't you think there is  room on the political scene for the kind of PSL the people think  it is or for the kind they voted for? While in power now, the  PSL is doing something different from what it promised.    [Luczak] How many times did we have radicals, socialists, or  Christian-democratic activists in power--I am talking about  other countries now--and then it seemed it was the end, but they  gained power again. There is something in nations, in society,  something...    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] ...Irrational?    [Luczak] No, I mean more like expecting a change. Once the  new governing team brings disappointment, nostalgia for the past  is born. It was better in the old days....    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] ...And we were younger then?    [Luczak] Exactly. So people say: Let us go back to that  now; let us not vote for those who are in power now.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] So that means party programs have nothing  to do with choices, but, instead, there are simply some stages?  A party leaves and another comes along. So, in your view,  party programs are completely meaningless?    [Luczak] You keep trying to make me say that election  promises are just black and white. That is not true. In my  view, when something is black only or white only, that is a very  bad thing because it gives rise to extremes--for instance,  communism or fascism. Poland has entered the kind of phase  where parliamentary coalitions will be establishing cabinets,  and, after gaining power, these coalitions will mark their  identity on the political scene not by making something black  and white but by approaching social needs and privatization  needs in a different manner. And once social moods take a swing  in the other direction, there will be different priorities  visible. Politics cannot be black and white. Countries that  want to be stable and play even a small role must counteract  extremes to enable them to keep moving down the same road but in  a slightly different groove. We may see that happen in Poland.    When it comes to election campaigns, they are based on their  own rules. During an election campaign, you must present  programs, you must speak through slogans because you are talking  to people who often see a politician for the first time. These  people would be bored if you tried to detail the program item by  item. So you must use simple words like "here," "now," "we,"  "nobody again," "never." But the people must understand that, if  a particular coalition is back in power, particular issues will  be focused on more.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What role did the church play in the PSL's  success in the most recent elections? Do you think the church  has reached the stage of regarding the PSL as "its own" party?    [Luczak] The church did not involve itself unequivocally on  either our side or anyone else's. I would regard it as a sign  that the church refuses to involve itself politically. The  church's neutral position during the election campaign--not  telling people who to vote for--objectively helped us.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] I am wondering whether the ability to  create the view among people that the PSL is both a left-wing  party and a Catholic one is not a prescription for your next  success.    [Luczak] That is a special trait displayed by parties active  in rural areas. We are a party that, from the very beginning of  its activity, has always wanted to have good rapport with the  church, in terms of both religion and the philosophy of life.  But, beginning with Witos, the PSL did not want to have the  church as its patron. Peasants wanted to decide on their own  which direction their policies should take. True, there were  cases of priests who wanted to be in command of the peasant  movement, but these measures ended in failure. Generally  speaking, the peasant movement was with God, but it refused to  act with the church as its patron.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] A politician said that we will have a  PSL-Belvedere coalition in power by year's end.    [Luczak] No, no.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] We will probably know the names of  presidential candidates at the end of the year. Will that be a  cause for disagreement with the SLD. In other words, will you  come up with your own candidate?    [Luczak] I cannot imagine the PSL running in the  presidential elections in the coalition. The PSL will come up  with its own candidate.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Who will that be?    [Luczak] [No response published]    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Will your candidate compete with the SLD's?    [Luczak] The governing coalition is one thing, but  presidential elections are quite another. Despite the  complexity of the issue, presidential campaigns are always very  personalized.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] The previous presidential elections  extracted a heavy toll on the Solidarity camp. Will these  coming ones have a destructive effect on the coalition?    [Luczak] At that time, the starting point was different--the  Solidarity camp constituted a whole that all of a sudden cracked  during the election campaign. Despite the coalition nature of  our government, I think we do not constitute a whole, either in  terms of ideology or party programs. The governing coalition was  set up for a defined period of time, with the goal of  implementing the tasks defined in the coalition agreement.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Don't you dream of a demonstration on Aleje  Ujazdowskie under the banner "Out with Luczak, out with [Prime  Minister] Pawlak, out with the PSL and [chief of the Office of  the Council of Ministers] Strak"?    [Luczak] I have a view on this that boils down to this:  When you dream of something, it will not come true. So may I  have only such dreams and not other kinds.</p>

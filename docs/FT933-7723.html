			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Printing division bolsters News Corp offshoot Correction (published 20th August 1993) appended to this article. PACIFIC Magazines &amp; Printing, an Australian offshoot of News Corporation, has come through a flat period with profit and dividend growth for the year ended June. The company yesterday announced a 13.2 per cent increase in net earnings, to ADollars 59.2m (USDollars 40m), on a 12.4 per cent sales rise to ADollars 661m. The dividend is going up from 10 cents to 20.4 cents a share. The result reflected a rise in pre-tax profit from ADollars 52.4m to ADollars 58.4m for the company's printing division. Pre-tax earnings from magazines eased from ADollars 46.3m to ADollars 44.9m. Directors said the results followed a contraction in magazine advertising and cost increases reflecting increased promotion and improved production quality. They said the company had spent ADollars 36m on acquisitions, and a further ADollars 31m on new plant in the year. This lifted interest-bearing debt by ADollars 17.3m to ADollars 221.9m. With much of this expansion concentrated in the Asian region, directors said they would continue to focus on this area. The result was helped by a reduction in financing charges, from ADollars 25.1m to ADollars 18.4m. Tax took ADollars 25.6m, against ADollars 21.3m previously. The company began trading in its current form in October 1991, and comparative figures were stated on an annualised basis. Australian Provincial Newspapers, the regional publishing group 15 per cent-owned by Independent Newspapers of the UK, has increased net earnings by 46 per cent to ADollars 6.5m for the June half. Sales rose 7 per cent to ADollars 67.2m. The interim dividend is up from 1 cent to 2.3 cents a share. CORRECTION Australian Provincial Newspapers is 25 per cent-owned by Independent Newspapers of Ireland, and not 15 per cent by Independent Newspapers of the UK as wrongly stated yesterday.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Fraser floats - New Issues House of Fraser, the department store chain which stretches from Inverness to Plymouth, is being floated off by its owners the Fayed brothers, valued at Pounds 413.3m, writes Neil Buckley. They will keep the chain's former flagship, Harrods, leaving House of Fraser with 56 stores trading under 17 names such as Binns, Rackhams, Dickins &amp; Jones and Army &amp; Navy. The share price announced on Thursday of 180p was at the bottom end of expectations. After the group unveiled pre-tax profits of Pounds 34.5m on sales of Pounds 721.7m for the year to January 31, most analysts had been forecasting 190p to 200p, valuing the group at between Pounds 436m and Pounds 460m. SG Warburg, broker to the offer, is thought to have been persuaded by the recent volatility of the stock market to go for the lower price. It equates to 16.2 times historic earnings and, on a notional dividend of 5p, gives a gross yield of 3.5 per cent. But, by setting the price at this level, the group has largely neutralised investors' concerns over the legacy of several years of directionless management, and over growth prospects. The shares look attractive and could well go to a small premium. Three-quarters of the 229.6m shares are being placed with institutions, with the rest offered to the public. Deadline for applications is March 25 and dealings start on April 6. Wainhomes this week became the latest housebuilder to announce terms of its flotation, writes Andrew Taylor. It is seeking to raise Pounds 30.5m from a placing and offer for sale priced at 170p a share and valuing the company at Pounds 106m. The issue follows Beazer Homes which, the previous week, announced details of its flotation plans. These valued the company at Pounds 463.4m, with shares at 165p. Compared with Beazer, Wainhomes would seem a little expensive on a notional yield of 3.1 per cent and p/e of 18.3 times on forecast earnings of 9.3p in the year to March 1994. The companies, however, are very different animals. Beazer is a proven national house-builder, producing nearly 5,000 homes a year. Wainhomes remains a small regional builder constructing fewer than under 1,000 homes a year, although this is expected to rise to 1,800 by 1995/96. The upside potential, therefore, is claimed by Wainhomes to be greater than Beazer. It has had a solid record during the recession and operating margins are at the top end of the sector. On that, basis it is probably worth supporting. The broker is NatWest Wood Mackenzie. Investors get the chance of taking part in the increasing sales of educational equipment in the UK following Nottingham Group's announcement this week of details of its Pounds 13m intermediaries offer, writes Simon Davies. The company is being valued at Pounds 81.4m and brokers say applications had to be scaled back for the Pounds 25m pre-placement to institutions. The pricing is attractive. At 155p, the shares are on a 1993 p/e (before exceptional write-offs) of 14.2 and a notional yield of 4.45 per cent. Goldman Sachs and James Capel are brokers to the offer, which closes on March 24.</p>

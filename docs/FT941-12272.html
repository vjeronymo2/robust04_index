			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Dragon breathes new life into Asia - International Asia's Dragon bond market started life with more of a whimper than a roar. But two years after its inception, efforts to create an active capital market serving the Asian region are slowly paying off. A Dragon bond is similar in structure to a Eurobond, but is listed in Asia (usually in Hong Kong or Singapore), targeted at investors in the region, and launched in the Asian time zone. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched the first Dragon issue at the end of 1991. Its aim was to focus attention on the development of a regional capital market, given that some of the domestic bond markets were either illiquid or relatively unsophisticated. In Asia's fast-growing economies savings ratios are high and central banks are flush with reserves: yet the problem remained how best to mobilise these funds so that they could be channelled into infrastructure projects in a rapidly-developing region. Typically, investors pour money into the region's stock markets: the ADB thought it might make more sense for these funds to be diverted into bonds and used to provide long-term, fixed-rate financing for construction and energy projects. Alas, it certainly did not work out that way in the first two years for the actual Dragon issues. A cursory glance at the list of borrowers in the Dragon bond market shows that the overwhelming majority are non-Asian names, such as General Electric Capital Corporation, Nordic Investment Bank, and European Investment Bank. Most of them wanted to raise their profile among Asian investors (such as central banks, bond funds and retail investors) by issuing debt in the region, thereby widening their investor base. Adding to the non-Asian flavour, investors complain about the poor liquidity which characterises these relatively small bond issues (most are for Dollars 200 to Dollars 300m), and the fact that the overall yield tends to be low (only 10 - 30 basis points above the US Treasury bond yield), reflecting the high credit rating of the borrower and historically low US bond yields. Hopefully, these grumbles will be resolved. Already, there are signs that more Asian names are gearing up to tap the market. The People's Republic of China launched a Dollars 300m, 10-year issue last October and other Asian names - including The People's Construction Bank of China - are rumoured. Those with a long-term interest in ensuring the success of the Dragon bond market claim that it was necessary for the non-Asian supranationals and triple-A rated names to make an appearance at an early stage. 'The whole process of establishing a market takes time and you need top-rated names to pave the way - you simply cannot just start a market with the lesser credits in the region tapping it first,' says one banker. As more of the lower credits in the region have the confidence to tap the market, Asian investors should be able to buy paper with a more generous yield. Where the development of the Dragon bond market has proved a success is in encouraging international banks to expand their operations in the region and to explore the domestic capital markets. Ms Ellen Miller, executive director of the bond syndicate at Lehman Brothers, London, points out that some of the international houses have become more involved in domestic instruments. International investors are also showing much more interest in the domestic debt instruments of countries such as Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. The more cynical bond specialists dismiss the Dragon bond as a mere marketing gimmick, but even they are prepared to admit that it has helped to focus attention on the development of debt markets in the region and should encourage Asian borrowers to eventually launch more large, global issues.</p>

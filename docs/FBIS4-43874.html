			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 22 (AA) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman  Ferhat Ataman said today that Turkey was to continue initiatives  and efforts so that U.S. aid is given in line with Turkey's  views.    Ataman told his weekly press conference that Turkey would  not  accept the linking of the U.S. aid to any precondition.    He also recalled that the House Appropriations Committee has  not approved the proposal passed by the House of Representatives  to suspend 25 percent of the aid to Turkey.    `In return the Senate committee decided to include a clause  in the text under which U.S. military material sold and  transferred to Turkey will not be used by Turkey for domestic  security and police purposes,' he said.    Ataman said that that decision was to be put before the  Senate.    `Since there is a difference between the text of the House  and the Senate, the committee has to review the issue,' Ataman  said.    `If the committee agrees on a conciliating text, this will  then be voted separately in the general assembly of the Senate  and the House and submitted to the approval of the president,'  Ataman said.    `However, if a conciliation is not reached,' he said, `it  was  likely that the previous practices on extending aid to Turkey  might prevail.'</p>

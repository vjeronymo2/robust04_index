			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / New look for banking industry: Banks have already found ways round laws Will scrapping the remaining barriers to nationwide banking hasten the reshaping of the US banking industry? The question has been debated in bank boardrooms for years. Now, with the final passage of the interstate banking law on Tuesday, it is time for the reckoning. In some ways, the adoption of full interstate banking should make little practical difference. Thanks to changes to state laws in recent years and the growth of finance company subsidiaries, many banks have already extended their reach around the country. The legislation that prevented interstate banking came in two parts. First, in 1927, the McFadden Act effectively prohibited banks from running branches in other states. The Douglas Amendment to the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act prohibited the takeover of banking companies in other states, unless those states' laws allowed it. At the time, none did. These laws have less force than they once did. In 1975, Maine became the first state to allow out-of-state institutions to buy local banks. Sixteen others have followed suit, while 26 more allow ownership by holding companies based in states which give reciprocal rights. States have also relaxed bank takeover laws in times of financial distress to let outsiders rescue troubled local institutions. In Texas, the three biggest banks succumbed to the real estate collapse of the 1980s. Chemical Banking of New York, NationsBank of North Carolina and BancOne of Ohio now control nearly 40 per cent of Texas's banking deposits, equivalent to Dollars 55bn (Pounds 35.4bn) at the end of 1992. This encroachment of banks across state lines through acquisition has taken hold rapidly in a few years. At the end of 1992, more than a fifth of all bank assets in the US were in the hands of out-of-state institutions, compared with just 6 per cent in 1987. Where they have not expanded through acquisition, banks have found ways around the legal barriers. One approach has been to hive off their fastest-growing consumer businesses, such as credit cards, into non-bank companies which can operate outside the scope of banking legislation. Chase Manhattan, the New York money-centre bank, owns a string of finance companies. 'We couldn't expand in the traditional way, we were prohibited,' says Mr Arthur Ryan, bank president. 'But in hindsight, we found that it was a very effective way of doing it.' Despite these inroads, considerable obstacles to interstate banking remain. One is the 'South-Eastern Compact', a loose arrangement between states in the region. Designed to protect local institutions from takeover by powerful New York banks, the compact has of late had the effect of hindering banks based in the region which want to expand elsewhere in the country. One by one, states in the south-east have already started to pass local laws to drop their restrictions. A second obstacle is the inability of banks to set up branches in other states. Only 43 of the US's 56,000 bank branches in 1992 were operated by banks from another state. For bank customers who regularly cross state lines, this causes great inconvenience. A customer of Citibank in New York, for instance, cannot deposit money in a branch of Citibank in Connecticut: it is a legally separate bank. The growth of automated teller machine networks has alleviated some of the inconvenience, but lifting the ban on setting up branches will make life easier for millions of Americans. A third obstacle to running an interstate banking group has been cost. NationsBank puts the extra administrative costs (of running a series of separate boards and meeting federal and state reporting requirements) at Dollars 50m a year, while BankAmerica puts its own extra costs at Dollars 75m. 'That Dollars 75m adds zero to the safety and soundness of the banking system,' says Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman of BankAmerica. For the banking industry, though, perhaps the most significant question is whether the new legislation will give added impetus to the takeover and merger wave that has been under way since the late 1980s. Some banks which are already active acquirers play down the significance of the law. Others, though, argue that the legislation could provide the spark which ignites another flurry of big acquisitions. Mr Robert Gillespie, president and chief operating officer of KeyCorp, which itself vaulted into the top 10 with a merger this year, says of the legislation: 'It doesn't change the economics of the industry, but it gives everybody an excuse (to make acquisitions.) No-one wants to get left without a chair when the music stops.' Some mergers are already being justified on the grounds that interstate banking will make local banking markets more competitive. Last month two North Carolina banks, BB&amp;T Financial and Southern National, merged to form an institution with assets of Dollars 18bn. These are issues being debated by bank boards around the country. Mr Leo Mullen, president of First Chicago, says: 'There is no essential reason why we have to merge, or be acquired. But having said that, there's no question that certainly (our) businesses benefit from scale. . . If we could hook up with the right situation, there's no doubt it would be useful.' And, although the pace of bank mergers has slowed in recent months, most senior executives in the industry expect the consolidation to continue. 'We will see a continuing acceleration of transactions, and the transactions will get bigger,' Mr John McCoy, chairman of BancOne, said recently. It is a view widely shared by his counterparts in other banks. The only thing they are not agreed on is, who will be next? KEY POINTS OF US REFORM INCLUDE: Bank holding companies may acquire a bank in any state, starting in one year. Banks in separate states may merge, from June 1 1997, unless either state has 'opted out' by passing a law to ban such interstate mergers. Banks could open new branches outside their home states only if states 'opt in' by passing a law to allow it. Foreign banks would have the same right to open new branches as US banks, whether they operate in the US through a separate subsidiary or through a direct branch from their home country. But foreign banks could be required to establish a subsidiary if US bank regulators deem it necessary to verify their capital adequacy. A separate measure would extend the statute of limitations to allow the federal regulators to revive claims against officials of failed savings and loans or banks in cases of egregious fraud or intentional misconduct, but not of simple negligence.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Whirlpool to cut 3,200 jobs in drive to save Dollars 150m a year Whirlpool, the US-based maker of washing machines and other home appliances, said yesterday it planned to eliminate 3,200 jobs in Europe and North America next year - some 8 per cent of its worldwide workforce of 40,000. It said the job losses were part of a cost-cutting drive that would save Dollars 150m (Pounds 91.4m) a year. In the short term, however, the re-structuring will hit earnings: the company said it would result in a pretax charge of Dollars 240m to fourth-quarter profits this year. The brunt of the job losses will fall on Whirlpool's European operations, where the existing workforce of 13,000 will be reduced by 2,000. The rest will be in the US and Canada, where the workforce of 23,000 will be cut by 1,200. Whirlpool, the world's biggest manufacturer of home appliances, said the move was aimed at increasing competitiveness. In Europe, it said, the restructuring was part of a process of integration that had been going on since the company acquired the Philips Electronics home appliance business in 1991. Recently, Whirlpool's financial performance has been strong. In the quarter to September, big increases in sales helped the company produce a 40 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 98m. But profitability in Europe has consistently lagged that of the company's US operations. Like other big manufacturers, Whirlpool has been trying to improve European profitability by reorganising on pan-European lines. As part of the process it has already consolidated most functions, including buying, product development, customer service, information technology and some manufacturing. Yesterday the company said it would extend the approach to sales and marketing and complete the process in other functions. The result would be job losses across all functions and geographic areas. However, no European factories would be closed. In contrast, the job losses in North America will come mainly from plant closures. Whirlpool said it was closing a plastic components factory in Columbia, South Carolina, with the loss of 500 jobs, and a clothes drier factory in Cambridge, Ontario, with the loss of 400 jobs. The remaining cuts would fall on salaried staff in US manufacturing. Whirlpool said production of the plastic components made in Columbia would be transferred to suppliers near its US assembly plants. Cambridge production would be transferred to the company's plant in Marion, Ohio.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Official sources have told this daily that President  Luis Alberto Lacalle and Interior Minister Raul Iturria  evaluated yesterday all aspects related to the attack on the  house of prosecutor Jose Luis Barbagelata. They agreed that it  was an action motivated by "a desire to create a political  event."    President Lacalle reiterated to the interior minister "his  total support" in "getting to the bottom" of the matter within  the framework of the investigations being carried out to find  those responsible for the attack, which was labeled "a political  issue."    The Artigas Guard claimed responsibility for the attack.  This is a clandestine group whose members identify themselves  as the intermediate commands of the Army. This group also  claimed responsibility for the attack against the studio of  former President Julio Sanguinetti in mid-1992, in addition to  other actions.    Military sources told this daily that the Army is continuing  the investigation ordered by Army Commander Daniel Garcia when  the clandestine organization released the so-called Bulletin No.  2.    A military source said: "No conclusion has been reached, and  therefore nothing certain can be said. The Artigas Guard is  being investigated, including its possible connections with the  Army if it has any, because its members call themselves the  intermediate commands." Military and government sources  indicated that "there is no evidence" to presume they are indeed  military personnel.    One of the sources said: "They call themselves intermediate  commands, but this has not been verified. It has also not been  verified what their composition is: whether they be civilian,  civilian and military, or military alone."    Army Commander General Daniel Garcia told this newspaper on  7  October 1993 that "the people responsible for the attack have  not yet been identified, but when this happens it will be known  because there will be a very big noise. Working in silence does  not mean we are not working."    He added: "The day we find the members of the so-called  Artigas Guard, or anyone responsible for any other irregular  event, we will react vigorously within the current legal  regulations."    The official sources noted that the investigation of this  case is being carried out by the Security and Investigation  Directorate of the Police Information and Intelligence National  Directorate and by the Technical Police National Directorate, in  cooperation with the Defense Information Service of the Defense  Ministry.</p>

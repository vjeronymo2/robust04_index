			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Reporting Currency of Foreign Private Issuers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Selection of a Reporting Currency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, the Commission's rules require a foreign issuer to present its financial statements in the currency of either its country of incorporation or of its primary economic environment. This requirement has been increasingly troublesome for foreign companies entering the U.S. market, and the staff has received a number of requests for accommodation. Some foreign issuers that have historically reported in their domestic market using the U.S. dollar seek to report on that basis in the U.S., but current rules would not permit them to do so in filings with the Commission. In addition, the issue of reporting currency is particularly troublesome for foreign private issuers that operate in several countries or have securities traded in a number of markets. For such companies, the country of incorporation may be a matter of convenience or may account only for a limited part of its business activity; no single economic environment may be dominant to its operations or shareholder base. In these circumstances, management may wish to select a reporting currency chiefly on the basis of its familiarity to and acceptance by the international markets. Some multinational companies state amounts in their financial statements in different currencies in different trading markets, either by choice or by mandate of the various jurisdictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To address these difficulties, the Commission is proposing to revise Rule 3&hyph;20 of Regulation S&hyph;X to permit a foreign issuer to state the amounts in its primary financial statements using any currency in which it reports to a majority of its nonaffiliated securityholders. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The amendment would require specific disclosure in a note to the financial statements if the currency in which the issuer expects to declare any dividends is different from the reporting currency, or there are material exchange restrictions affecting the reporting currency or the currency in which dividends are paid. The rule as proposed to be amended would not limit a foreign issuer's choice of reporting currency. Management should be in the best position to determine which reporting currency is most relevant to the issuer's investors, taking into consideration the effects of that choice on the measurement of operations in the hyperinflationary environments in which the issuer does business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An issuer could furnish to some or all of its securityholders financial statements with amounts in currencies other than the one selected as its reporting currency for purposes of filings with the Commission so long as it also delivered to a majority of its unaffiliated securityholders financial statements with amounts stated in the reporting currency used in its Commission filings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission recognizes that the choice of reporting currency can affect trends in sales, net income, working capital, and similar items depicted in the financial statements. Also, depending on the reporting currency, measurement differences arise if the issuer has material operations in a hyperinflationary environment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Such consequences of the reporting currency selection arise for domestic and foreign companies alike, particularly if they have substantive operations in more than one country. To the extent that depicted trends and reported results are affected by exchange rate fluctuations, explanatory disclosure should be provided in filings with the Commission as part of the explanation of the material changes from year to year required in management's discussion and analysis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> SFAS 52 requires that the underlying transactions of operations in hyperinflationary environments be measured in the reporting currency, which may differ from company to company, rather than in the currency of the operation's primary economic environment. Differences may also arise because some issuers, which prepare their primary financial statements in accordance with accounting principles of other jurisdictions, measure transactions using the functional currency of that business, with the results restated for changes in price-level and then translated to the reporting currency. An accommodation to issuers that account for operations in hyperinflationary environments using a method that differs from that required by U.S. GAAP is discussed in a later section of this release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 229.303.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has previously addressed accounting for transactions in multiple currencies, noting the significant differences in economic substance that may exist among subsidiaries, divisions, and similar operations that operate in different economic environments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  At that time, the Commission noted the need for registrants to provide more information about the material functional currencies of foreign operations, and observed that disaggregated disclosure about particular operations may be necessary in some circumstances. Also, in response to the requirements of Item 303 of Regulation S&hyph;K (``Management's Discussion and Analysis'') of Regulation S&hyph;K, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as well as the comparable sections presented in Item 9 of Form 20&hyph;F, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  registrants are expected to quantify and discuss material financial statement effects attributable solely to variations in currency exchange rates, as well as any material consequences of exchange rate changes on operations and business strategies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Financial Reporting Policy 501.09, ``Disclosure Considerations Related to Foreign Operations and Foreign Currency Translation Effects.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 229.303.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 249.220f.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment is requested on the need for accommodation with respect to reporting currency, and whether the proposed revisions adequately address these needs. Comment is also requested as to whether the financial statements, taken together with the disclosures described above, will provide investors with adequate and meaningful information. What additional quantitative or other disclosures may be necessary to fully inform investors regarding operations and transactions conducted in currencies other than the reporting currency? Comment is also requested as to whether the rule should be amended to allow only the additional latitude of use of the currency of the country in which a majority of the issuer's shareholders reside, or simply to allow the additional alternative of reporting in U.S. dollars even if it is not the issuer's primary economic environment. Are there circumstances in which the reporting currency should be limited to the currency of the issuer's country of incorporation, or whether the selection of a reporting currency should be affected by (a) the existence of hyperinflation in a predominant or significant currency used by the issuer, (b) a high proportion of operating cash flows denominated in a single currency, (c) exchange restrictions on the reporting currency or underlying currencies, or (d) other factors? Commenters recommending restriction of an issuer's choice of reporting currency should indicate the appropriate criteria or other measures that would identify situations warranting restriction of the reporting currency. Comment is also requested regarding whether the issuer should be required to furnish financial statements in the selected reporting currency to all unaffiliated shareholders, rather than to only a majority; whether the issuer should not be permitted to select a reporting currency for purposes of filings with the Commission which differs from that used in reports distributed to investors in other major trading markets; and whether a requirement limiting the issuer to a single currency in all distributions of its primary financial statements would be desirable or feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

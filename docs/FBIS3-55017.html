			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Regular Tuesday" interview with Prime Minister Adolfas </F> Slezevicius by unidentified correspondenton 4 January; place not  given -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [Correspondent] [passage omitted] As prime  minister and member of the Council for Coordination of Foreign  Policy at the Presidency of the Republic, what is your comment  on the importance of the Lithuanian president's letter sent  yesterday to Manfred Woerner, NATO secretary general?    [Slezevicius] I think that the statement made by the  president yesterday on TV has an exceptional significance and  meaning. Last year was important to Lithuania in all respects.  We became a member of the European Council on 14 May and an  intensive process of integration began into various economic  structures of Europe, including defense structures. This is a  long process. In June a decision was adopted in principle by  the Council of Europe concerning the possibility of us  concluding a free trade agreement with the European Union, as it  is now called after the Maastricht Treaty. Therefore,  yesterday's statement is a logical sequence of all the decisions  and actions which have taken place previously.    Our joint and coordinated position with our Baltic  neighbors,  Latvia and Estonia, has been voiced several times. This was  done at the meeting of the presidents in Riga and Tallinn, at  the meeting of the prime ministers, and in our declaration  signed jointly by our minister of national defense and his  counterparts on 13 September in Tallinn concerning our  orientation towards NATO defense structures.    This act [request to join NATO] is a logical sequence of our  entire foreign policy. This is especially important at the  present moment when we are the first former Soviet republic free  of occupying armed forces. This is of great importance. We are  now starting a cooperation with the above mentioned European  structures on a different level.    [Correspondent] Do you think we will join NATO soon?    [Slezevicius] Indeed some politicians urged us to rush into  NATO immediately. They believe that this is a very simple  process. I think that we should not be too optimistic about this  matter. This is a process, including, as it seems, one of the  stages -- Partnership for Peace -- which is a new initiative put  forward by the United States. We are convinced that this would  be the first important step proceeding towards a new type of  defense structures.    On our part we are conducting very intensive negotiations  with NATO leadership. Here the visit by Mr Linkevicius  [minister of defense] and his meeting with Secretary General  Woerner can be mentioned. A summit of NATO is to held in  mid-January, following this the president is to visit Brussels.  This will be the first visit by the head of a foreign country  aiming at the discussion of all these questions. It is evident  that our task is to intensify all these processes, which is what  we are currently consistently doing. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Italian bond dealers demand delivery ruling BOND dealers in Italy yesterday demanded an urgent clarification of the rules on settlement procedures following differences that emerged this week with some foreign counterparties over delivery. 'I have spent most of the past two days arguing with foreign customers about this', said one angry dealer in Milan yesterday. 'Reimbursement is not enough'. However, Italian traders contacted universally criticised houses which, according to some London-based dealers, have refused to recognise, on the grounds of late delivery, trades conducted during last week's turbulent markets. 'Milan may have different settlement rules than the Eurobond market, but a trade is a trade', said one dealer. The Italian government bond market has a three-day delivery period, unlike the seven-day period for Eurobonds. Moreover, the Italian system does not allow for bond borrowing, leaving Italian intermediaries highly exposed when foreign clients have been late to deliver paper. 'We had to replace the bonds our clients couldn't deliver, which was both difficult and expensive'. noted one trader. 'If they're trading in Italian paper, they should know what the rules are.' Many foreign banks plunged into the Italian market last week on account of the appealing spreads that emerged between the cash and futures markets, selling short in the cash market in the hope of buying back later. Italian traders involved were holding urgent talks with foreign clients over ways to resolve the disagreements. A few said they would be pressing for some form of token penalty on clients which failed to deliver bonds in time as well as the reimbursement of expenses. The International Securities Market Association (ISMA), is seeking to resolve the issue, while the Bank of Italy stated its strong disapproval of late delivery. Meanwhile, several London-based banks said they accepted demands for additional payments where they had failed to deliver, but would not accept claims that trades had failed. Disagreement over settlement procedures has been highlighted due to the high number of trades which were not completed due to turbulent market conditions last week, as the market fell several points following the result of the Danish referendum on Maastricht.</p>

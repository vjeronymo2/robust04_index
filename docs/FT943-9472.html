			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Poole makes the cleanest splash Poole in Dorset has the best beach in the UK, the Tidy Britain Group said yesterday. The two-year survey ranked 100 beaches. Half of them were classed in the top two categories and 19 in the worst, including both the north and south beaches at Blackpool. The Water Services Association, representing the sewage companies, said 20 of the 100 biggest coastal sewage clean-up schemes had been completed, and the remainder would be completed by 1996 at a cost of Pounds 7m per beach.</p>

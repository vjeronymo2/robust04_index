			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY BANDS TO DEBUT ON MTV  </P> <P> A couple of Orange County-based rock acts are scheduled to have videos debut on  MTV.  </P> <P> "Gettin' Close To God" by National People's Gang debuts this weekend on the  "120 Minutes" alternative-rock video program, which runs from 11:30 p.m. Sunday  to 1:30 a.m. Monday.  </P> <P> The video includes live concert footage shot at the Coach House in San Juan  Capistrano, plus an appearance by the band's manager, former Safari Sam's  impresario Sam Lanni.  </P> <P> On April 7, "Bombers (Can Open Bomb Bays)," from the debut solo album by former  Black Sabbath member Bill Ward, will air on MTV's "Headbangers Ball" show,  which runs from midnight to early Sunday morning, April 8.  </P> <P> "Bombers" uses a good deal of wartime footage in making a socially conscious  comment that's a rarity for heavy-metal clips. Split-screen effects showcase  performances by Ward on drums and his old band mate, Ozzy Osbourne, on vocals.  MIKE BOEHM  </P></p>

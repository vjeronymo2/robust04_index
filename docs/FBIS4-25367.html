			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 7 (CNA) -- Eleven Kuomintang members  of the National Assembly on Tuesday [7 June] joined hands with  their colleagues of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party  [DPP] to form the "Single Parliament Promotional Committee."    Eight DPP National Assembly members are in the group, as  well  as one nonpartisan member.    Taiwan currently operates under a dual-parliament system.  The National Assembly is in charge of revising the constitution  and electing the president, and the Legislative Yuan is  responsible for enacting laws and screening the national budget.    The DPP has been seeking to revise the constitution to  abolish the National Assembly in an effort to accomplish its  goal of a single parliament. The ruling party, however, does  not consider such a change a top priority in its political  reform program.    KMT National Assemblymen Cheng Yun-tang, one of the  committee  members, said the group will lobby hard to get the single  parliament proposal approved by the National Assembly. The  National Assembly is meeting in Yangminshan to discuss proposed  amendments to the constitution.    National Assembly members have already submitted five  proposals pertaining to changes in Taiwan's parliamentary system.    Another committee member, Chen Chen-shun, said that merging  the National Assembly with the Legislative Yuan would be an  easier way to achieve the goal of a single parliament.</p>

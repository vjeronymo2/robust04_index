			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Shakhnoza Ganiyeva from Uzbekistan, </F> including recording of remarks by K. Usmanov, head of  Uzbekistan's Radio and Television Production Association; from  the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] Ostankino TV's channel one and Russian TV were  disconnected from 0900 this morning until this evening in  Uzbekistan. The republican TV center did not receive these  programs either. I remind you that transmission of Novosti  programs has been partially disrupted here for almost a week.  During the day viewers in the republic have only been able to  see two editions of Novosti from Ostankino, at 1200 and 2100  local time. Other programs were screened without alteration,  but clearly, the chronic problem of non-payment has finally  caught up. We turned to the republic's communications ministry  for an explanation:    [Usmanov] The primary reason is that the Ostankino and  Russian TV companies owe the Uzbek communications ministry about  1 billion rubles for 1993. Second, no contracts have yet been  signed for 1994. We sent off telegrams asking these TV  companies to dispatch representatives so that contracts for 1994  can be concluded.    [Ganiyeva] Well, at the end of the day, a sovereign state is  entitled to relay or not to relay programs from Russia, but  what, in that case, can viewers do? They are starved of both  bread and circuses.</p>

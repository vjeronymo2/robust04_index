			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is also concerned about potential practical problems with this approach. For example, if a candidate's DOI occurs early in the election cycle, there will be a substantial gap between the DOI and the date of the convention. The purpose of the 10% rule (26 U.S.C. 9033(c)(1)(B); 11 CFR 9033.5(b)), under which a candidate becomes ineligible for additional funding on the 30th day following the date of the second consecutive primary election in which he or she receives less than 10% of the popular vote, is to discontinue funding of candidates who have not received substantial support following their initial establishment of eligibility. See 122 Congressional Record S.3787 (daily ed. March 18, 1976) (remarks of Sen. Taft). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A related concern is that, under these circumstances, the Commission may be well along in the audit of a candidate's campaign by the time the convention opens. Providing an additional matching fund period to such candidates could substantially complicate the audit process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If this approach were to be adopted, the Commission welcomes comments on who should be covered by the new provision, and during what timeframe it should apply. Should this be limited to expenses incurred by the candidate, or the candidate and his or her immediate family, or should it also include campaign staff? If the latter, should such staff be limited, either by number or position held in the campaign? The Commission notes that, where a number of candidates sought the nomination, the expenses of these candidates, their families, and accompanying campaign staff could be substantial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please note that the draft rules that follow do not include any specific regulatory language on this point. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Audits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Calculation of Repayment Ratio <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 9038.2(b)(2), committees are required to repay amounts received from the matching payment account that are used for non-qualified campaign expenses. The amount of any repayment sought under section 9038.2(b)(2) bears the same ratio to the total amount of non-qualified campaign expenses as the amount of matching funds certified to the candidate bears to the candidate's total deposits, as of the candidate's date of ineligibility. Repayment determinations under this section include all non-qualified campaign expenses paid between the committee's date of inception and the point when committee accounts no longer contain matching funds. Thus, the repayment amount is calculated by multiplying the total non-qualified campaign expenses by the repayment ratio, as determined on the candidate's date of ineligibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, this section does not serve its intended purpose when applied to a candidate that receives a significant amount of matching payments after his or her date of ineligibility. Section 9038.2(b)(2) does not take into account private contributions received by the candidate after his or her date of ineligibility. Consequently, when this section is applied to a candidate that receives a significant amount of private contributions after that date, it generates a repayment amount that does not accurately reflect the ratio of matching payments to private contributions actually received by that candidate during the courts of the campaign. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, section 9038.2(b)(2) is inconsistent with the statute when applied to a candidate who does not receive matching payments until after his or her date of ineligibility. Section 9038(b)(2) of the Matching Payment Account Act requires a candidate who uses public funds for non-qualified campaign expenses to repay a portion of the public funds he or she received to the Treasury. However, when section 9038.2(b)(2) of the regulations is applied to a candidate who does not receive matching payments until after his or her date of ineligibility, the rule arguably generates a repayment ratio of zero even if the candidate incurred numerous non-qualified campaign expenses. Thus, under the regulations, the candidate would not be required to repay any of those funds, even though the statute specifically requires repayment in this situation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9038.2(b)(2)(iii) of the proposed rules contains two proposed revisions that would address these situations. The first proposal would change the date for determining the candidate's repayment ratio from the date of ineligibility to 90 days after the date of ineligibility. A ratio determined on the later date would take into account most of the post-DOI private contributions received by the candidate. As a result, the ratio will more accurately reflect the amount of matching payments and private contributions actually received. This approach would also produce an accurate repayment ratio and repayment amount for those candidates that do not receive any matching payments until after their date of ineligibility. As a result, this proposed revision would address both of the situations described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second proposal, which is set out in paragraph (A) of this section, would take a narrower approach. Under this proposal, the Commission would treat all matching funds certified in response to matching payment submissions received as of the candidate's date of ineligibility as though they were certified as of the candidate's date of ineligibility. Treating these funds as though they were certified pre-DOI would allow the Commission to use these funds to calculate the repayment ratio, resulting in a ratio of an amount greater than zero that reflects the mix of public funds and private contributions actually received. The Commission could then use this ratio to determine the amount that the candidate is required to repay under section 9038(b)(2) of the statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

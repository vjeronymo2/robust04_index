			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Newspaper's air trip offer probed THE Advertising Standards Authority is investigating the Sunday Times's offer of free air miles to its readers after the authority received complaints alleging that the terms of the promotion were misleading and contained unreasonable restrictions. The authority said it had received 21 complaints from the public about two Sunday Times schemes since they were launched on February 21. That compares with only 14 complaints about Hoover's much-criticised offer of free flights to purchasers of its domestic appliances. The Sunday Times campaign promises '500 instant air miles for every reader'. Under one scheme readers are invited to collect vouchers worth 500 miles every week over a three-month period and send them in for redemption. The authority said readers had complained that the Sunday Times did not make it sufficiently clear that the air miles concerned could be used only towards the purchase of tickets to destinations specified by the newspaper. Among the destinations were Jeddah, Tehran and Abu Dhabi, which readers had pointed out were unlikely choices for a holiday. The Sunday Times confirmed that it had received a letter from the authority about its investigation, but had no comment until the outcome was known.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Disappointment at trade figures dampens gilts THE advances in European government bond markets of the past few days were consolidated yesterday as overnight news of strong demand for the latest US five-year auction brought further support to prices from across the Atlantic. UK government bonds opened marginally higher, with the benchmark gilt maturing 2003/07 at 116 25/32 . At that level, the Bank of England's latest 'tap' stock - with a 9 per cent coupon maturing in 2012 - was exhausted, having first been offered in early February. The tap has acted as a ceiling at the long end of the market, and analysts said prices were now free to rise higher - provided the Bank's next tap issues are in medium-term maturities, as traders expect. The generally positive mood of the gilts market was dampened, although not completely doused, by what were widely seen as disappointing trade figures. A 7.5 per cent fall in exports during January, while imports fell by only 3 per cent, was regarded as poor at this stage of the recession. By the end of the day, the 2003/07 bond had gained  5/32 of a point on the day, at 116 15/16 , giving a yield of 9.24 per cent. AFTER Wednesday's excitement, the US Treasury market settled down yesterday as dealers and investors set about consolidating the previous day's gains. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/32 at 101 19/32 , yielding 7.854 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/32 , yielding 5.342 per cent. the day was the Labour department's report of a 7,000 increase in the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance during the second week of February. The figure was above analysts' forecasts, but there was little reaction from the market, although the data did suggest that the February employment report, due out on March 6, will show evidence of a deterioration in labour market conditions. In the credit markets, the Federal Reserve arranged a series of overnight matched sale agreements in an attempt to drain money from the system and put upward pressure on the Fed funds rate. By later afternoon Fed funds had firmed, and were trading at the Fed's desired target for the rate of 4 per cent. IN the German government bond market, a sell-off at the shorter end and further buying in longer-dated bonds brought a steepening of the yield curve, indicating a new direction after the heavy buying at the shorter end in recent days. Analysts said that the move by investors further down the yield curve indicated growing confidence in the longer-term interest rate picture. Further indications that the Bundesbank intends to keep short-term conditions tight added to this feeling, even raising the thought in some quarters that interest rates could be set to move higher before they start to fall. Bund futures eased off late in the day, the March contract on Liffe ending at 88.34 compared with 88.41 at the open. THE firmness in the US Treasury market was leapt on with enthusiasm by the Japanese government bond market yesterday. Having closed at a yield of 5.385 per cent on Wednesday, the benchmark bond No 129 showed a substantial gain at the opening at 5.35 per cent.</p>

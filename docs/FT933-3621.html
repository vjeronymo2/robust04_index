			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Management: When commitment heads the agenda - Tips From The Top / In a new series, Sir Richard Greenbury of Marks and Spencer offers advice on conducting a board meeting The most important factor governing a successful board meeting is the quality of the board itself. If the members of the board are all people with a strong commitment to the company - and a real knowledge and experience of its operations - then constructive discussion will be possible and sound decisions can be reached. The balance of the board is also crucial and requires the right number of 'heavyweight' non-executive directors to bring an independent viewpoint, experienced judgment and knowledge not available within the company. They must have a range of skills complementary to the expertise of those who have made their careers within the business. Board meetings must be well-organised, held at regular points in the calendar, and the dates agreed formally at least six months ahead so that no one misses a meeting other than for exceptional reasons. Board meetings can take a long time, so air-conditioned boardrooms, comfortable seating arrangements and modern presentation systems are also important. There should be a clear agenda determined by the chairman; all relevant papers should be circulated in good time so that everyone comes to the meeting fully prepared. Indeed members of the board submitting proposals for discussion as formal papers should sound out their colleagues privately beforehand, thoroughly explaining their ideas. Board meetings must not be solemn affairs, although they should always be businesslike. There is a place for humour in the boardroom which helps one and all to keep a sense of proportion. Everyone should respect the authority of the chairman, but there is no need for every remark to be addressed 'through the chair' which tends to stifle discussion. The most fundamental requirement of a good board meeting is that everyone be encouraged to participate and allowed to express his or her views frankly and openly. In arriving at clear, agreed policy decisions the discussion must be completely free; indeed the more controversial the better, provided it is within the bounds of courtesy. If debate is lengthy the chairman should sum up the main arguments before requesting a decision. Should a vote be necessary, which hopefully is a last resort, the chairman should be the last one to declare his position. Once a formal decision is reached, directors are bound by law to abide by it. But it is equally important that they also give full and whole-hearted support. Minority views must be forgotten and for this reason particularly every member of the board needs to voice his or her opinion during the meeting, particularly if it is contentious. Board meetings should be confined as far as possible to taking strategic and policy decisions. Short separate weekly meetings of executive directors can deal with all sorts of matters which otherwise would tend to clog up the board meetings. These would include the current progress of the business, any topical issues and the day-to-day running of the company. Much can be done between board meetings by sub-committees of board members, supplemented by the relevant experts (for example, for capital expenditure, information technology and personnel). These sub-committees should be given the authority to act within strict terms of reference, reporting the action they have taken or requesting approval for significant decisions. There is no absolute magic formula. Every company has its own culture and metabolism, and different types of business require separate types of management style and approach from the board. Nevertheless all board meetings have the same objectives and responsibilities towards shareholders, staff and customers, and therefore must be conducted with total integrity as well as efficiency.

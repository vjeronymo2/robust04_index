			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Letter: Pay clamp on public sector will depress economy in short term Sir, David Goodhart's article on the government's attempt to impose a 1.5 per cent pay ceiling ('Public pay feels the squeeze', November 13) focuses on the possible longer-term impact of a restriction on public sector pay. But a pay ceiling, which is likely to have as big, or as little, an impact in the private as the public sector, also has immediate implications. First, if what amounts to a wage cut is carried through, this will do little to reflate the economy. Demand will be depressed further. Second, if wages are reined in but prices and profits are left where they are, this will do little to move Britain towards Mr Major's dream of a classless society. For example, how can a rise of between 7 and 8 per cent in British Rail and London Transport fares be justified against a maximum 1.5 per cent pay rise? Since 1979, the government has put forward some very good arguments about why government intervention in wage settlements does not work. These still seem to have considerable validity, despite this latest U-turn. Keith Flett, 38 Mitchley Road, Tottenham London N17 9HG</p>

Nakamura, 44, a House of Representatives member of the  opposition LDP, has refused to comply with a Tokyo District  Public Prosecutors Office request to submit to questioning  regarding his alleged receipt of a 10 million yen bribe from  major construction contractor Kajima Corp.    Diet permission is required for the arrest of  parliamentarians while the legislature is in session. The Diet  is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late  January.    Responding to reporters at the party's headquarters, Kono  said the party's response will "depend on the contents of the  request."    "We will listen to the request and respond properly," Kono  said.    Kono said it is "extremely regrettable" that Nakamura is  under suspicion for receiving a bribe. The party executive will  conduct its own investigation, he added.    "We will have to treat this seriously," he said. "The party  will have to straighten its collar and have the relevant bodies  look into it."    Meanwhile, Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama said the Diet should promptly grant permission to allow  prosecutors to arrest Nakamura.    "The Diet, if asked, should quickly give the go-ahead in  accordance with legal procedures," Murayama told a news  conference.    Murayama noted he will leave the matter up to the lower  house  steering committee, adding the SDP, the largest force within the  coalition, has no plans to hold an internal discussion on the  matter.    Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, one of the  seven coalition parties, also told a news conference that the  Diet should endorse the prosecutors' request for the arrest if  the allegation is true as media reports have claimed.    Tetsuzo Fuwa, presidium chairman of the opposition Japanese  Communist Party, told reporters the Diet should approve the  request.    He said it is natural for the prosecutors to conduct an  investigation to probe the scandal.    Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the Democratic  Socialist Party (DSP), another coalition member, told reporters  that the prosecutors' request is unavoidable since Nakamura has  refused to submit to questioning.    Yonezawa said he regrets the scandal has emerged at a time  when politicians are trying to establish higher ethical  standards, following enactment of an electoral reform package in  late January.</p>

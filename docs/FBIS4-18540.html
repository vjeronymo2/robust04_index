			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 5 (A.A.) -- Albanian President Sali  Berisha, who is currently in Turkey, said on Tuesday [5 April]  that Albania gave priority to friendly ties with Turkey.    Berisha spoke at a luncheon in his honor.    "Turkey and Albania have strong traditional, historical, and  cultural relations," Berisha said. "Albanian people will always  respect Turkish people and Gazi Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the  founder of modern Turkish Republic."    "He (Ataturk) founded the contemporary Turkish Republic with  his political and military genius, extraordinary courage, and  determination."    He also said Turkey is a strong, peaceful, and stable  element  in its region and played an important role in preserving peace,  security, freedom and democracy within the framework of North  Atlantic Treaty Organization.    The guest president spoke on Turkey's efforts in the Balkans  and said that Turkey can have a vital role in the crisis in  Bosnia.    "The concern that the war in Bosnia could spread to southern  parts of the Balkans affected the improvement of the reforms  that were put into practice in Albania," he said.    Berisha said its impossible to provide stability in the  Balkans without finding the true solution for Kosovo problem.    He said his country welcomed the presence of Turkish  soldiers  in Bosnia.

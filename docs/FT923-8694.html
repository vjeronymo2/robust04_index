			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Ecu dealers seek agreement on trading practices THE DOOM and gloom which had descended on the Ecu bond market, after weeks of price declines and evaporating liquidity, was partially lifted last week, as the market staged a 1 1/2 point recovery. However, traders are still adjusting to a new environment, following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty on June 2, which signalled the loss of the Ecu bond market's status as a government bond market. The 44 marketmakers in Ecu bonds recognised by the International Securities Market Association are meeting tonight in an effort to find a consensus on trading practices. Although market conditions have stabilised since marketmakers suspended trading for a day two weeks ago, the impressive liquidity once boasted by the Ecu bond market has not returned. It is 'clearly functioning as a market again', said Mr David Ovenden, Ecu product manager at JP Morgan, who chairs ISMA's Ecu sub-committee. 'But we need to work out what (bid/offer) spreads to trade on in the next few months.' In the wake of the suspension of marketmaking, forced by chaotic selling, marketmakers widened the spread between bid (buy) and offer (sell) prices to 20 basis points for the most liquid issues. Last week, the spread was successfully cut to 10 basis points. However, some deals (by the European Investment Bank and Italy) were removed from the list of most liquid benchmarks and the 15 basis point spread set for the next tier of bonds was not adhered to systematically. 'We have to strike a balance between the aggressive risk-takers and those who would prefer to see wider spreads,' Mr Ovenden said. 'But we have to be mindful of the technical realities - that is, the underlying business flows,' when setting spreads, he added. The fact is that in spite of the market's return from the brink, most analysts remain sceptical about the extent of buying by end-investors. Short positions in specific issues, or systematic support by sponsors of the market may account for at least part of the recovery, traders reckon. Indeed, many traders say that the former liquidity of the market - equal to some European government bond markets - was never justified by investor demand, but was artificially generated by the bullish stance of banks and securities houses, keen to establish a foothold in the European bond market of the future. Then, strategic motivation outweighed costs; now that the future of European monetary union is less than assured, banks' willingness to commit resources to the market is on the wane. Marketmakers have decided to find out what proportion of trading volume is generated by inter-professional dealing, by monitoring figures provided by Trax, ISMA's trade-matching system. By comparing these figures with the volume recorded by Euroclear and Cedel, the market's clearing houses, the ratio between investor-driven and inter-dealer business can be established. Many traders expect it will show the sector is still overbroked. Today's meeting could also herald the departure of at least a couple of firms from the throng of 44 marketmakers (Credit Suisse Luxembourg has already thrown in the towel). At least half the number of nominal marketmakers were not performing their intended function, according to dealers, with accusations of 'not picking up phones' still rife. In spite of the decline in liquidity, the market is still more liquid than any other sector of the Eurobond market, including the Eurodollar bond market. There are other positive signs. As the market rallied last week, the spread between Ecu bonds and the theoretical yield curve (based on the yields of the Ecu's component currencies) narrowed to about 15 basis points. Prior to the Danish referendum, Ecu bond yields were substantially lower than the theoretical yield curve, but during the panic selling of recent weeks, the pick-up of Ecu bonds over the theoretical curve rose to 35 basis points. Long-dated Ecu bonds - 15-year, 20-year and 30-year bonds - which substantially underperformed the rest of the market on the way down, also picked up lost ground last week. Dealers said that very long-dated Ecu bonds had undoubtedly been oversold, amid speculation that some might not be repaid. It is hard to fathom how strong support for the market is at current levels. (The 10-year OAT is yielding about 9.4 per cent, compared with 9.65 per cent a week ago.) Last week's rally was generated by a more buoyant mood in other European markets. In particular, the agreement on wages in Italy and two French opinion polls predicting majority votes for Maastricht in the September referendum. Neither piece of news marks a change of outlook for the Ecu market. Any potential setback, such as a rate hike by the Bundesbank, could generate an exaggerated response in the Ecu market. The Matif has increased the daily price fluctuation limit on its Ecu bond future contract from 150 basis points to 250 basis points, to take account of the market's increasing volatility. The exchange has increased the initial margin requirement from Ecu1,500 to Ecu3,000. The margin for a straddle, which consists of two opposite positions in the same futures contract with different delivery months, has been raised to Ecu6,000. These changes take effect on Wednesday. The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange has decided not to change its Bund futures contract to include bonds issued by Germany's Treuhandanstalt or the European Recovery Programme, the government agencies charged with funding the regeneration of the former East Germany. The Treuhand is due to make its debut in the bond market in the autumn, raising up to DM10bn. However, while the December and March contracts will not be altered, the Liffe board reserved the right to include the agencies' issues for the June 1993 contract. Germany's Deutsche Terminborse has announced that Treuhand bonds will be included under its rival Bund contract. Deliverability into the Liffe contract would have provided a further lift to demand.</p>

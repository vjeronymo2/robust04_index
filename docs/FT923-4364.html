			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Why Hayek speaks for everyone Mr Jack Kemp, the leading conservative in President George Bush's cabinet, once remarked that his political outlook had been transformed by reading Friedrich Hayek, the Austrian-born economist. In Britain, Lord Joseph and many others have paid similar tributes. Hayek's close association with rightwing politicians is understandable but in some ways unfortunate. He never saw himself as a conservative, and his books are not the exclusive property of rightwingers. Hayek, who died this summer, ought to have broad appeal. He articulated a compelling vision of the way society (a term he hated) works. In an ever more specialised age, his intellectual breadth enabled him to make valuable connections between different disciplines, including economics, psychology, politics and biology. You can gain insights from him without having to endorse his more extreme conclusions. As a bonus, he is great fun to read - if you like rigour and don't object to crankiness now and again. The easiest way into Hayek is through his last book, The Fatal Conceit (Routledge, 1988). This is not a substitute for earlier classics such as The Constitution of Liberty (1960), but it provides a highly readable summary of many of his central themes. One was the parallel he drew between economic and biological evolution. People once thought the complexity of the natural world proved the existence of a creator. Darwin showed how complex creatures could evolve from simpler organisms. Hayek saw himself performing the same role in social science. He spent much of his life explaining that the 'extended order of human co-operation' - his phrase for the complex of rules and institutions underlying capitalism - evolved spontaneously. As in biology, order was achieved without a central guiding authority. The hostility of many intellectuals to capitalism, Hayek believed, reflected a misconception of its character. Academics learn to construct solutions to problems. If you believe the existing (obviously flawed) economic and social system was consciously created, your natural response is to try to improve on it. In Hayek's view, the failure of new constructs such as socialism was inevitable because no group of people had ever possessed the knowledge needed consciously to design the existing system, let alone improve on it. The 'extended order' existed only because societies that happened to have adopted rules that allowed markets to flourish grew wealthier and more populous than those that did not. Hayek also strove to explain why free markets are sometimes seen as immoral. His answer was that mankind developed not as sovereign individuals but as members of clans. In the search for food and shelter, solidarity and altruism were crucial virtues; individuals survived by putting the group first. Today, people contribute mainly through their specialised functions in labour markets and by respecting abstract rules, such as property and wage contracts. If we all tried to treat our neighbours as ourselves, the system would break down. The trouble is that caring people find abstract rules unsatisfying. Hence many 'good' people instinctively dislike capitalism despite its proven ability to raise living standards. Of course, those who don't empathise with others (and would have been a menace in pre-industrial clans) have no such reservations. Opposition to the extended order, Hayek believed, also reflected a misunderstanding of the nature of freedom. Behind socialism lay the Romantic belief (originating in the writing of Rousseau) that man has to throw off social shackles, including institutions such as property, if he is to be properly free. Hayek saw more clearly than most that freedom is a matter of choosing the right kind of constraints. There are only two options: abstract laws which constrain everybody equally or arbitrary coercion by some group of one's fellows. He felt abstract rules were preferable because they created a 'personal space' - a realm in which one could act without fear of sanction. All of these insights are important and will probably be quite uncontroversial within a few decades. But they leave plenty of space for disagreement. For example, suppose we concede that Hayek is right to characterise capitalism as a spontaneous self-ordering process. This does not mean that 19th century capitalism has not been improved by the ad hoc evolutionary development of welfare states. Germany has moved further in this direction than the US and many would say it has gained thereby. Suppose we agree to abstract laws; that does not prevent supposedly independent judges subverting them. And Hayek should not be allowed to imply that an ingenious explanation of why we find markets heartless can absolve us of our responsibility to help the less fortunate. I can see no objection, even on Hayek's principles, to abstract rules mandating that the wealthy pay higher taxes than the poor. A left-of-centre Hayekian is not a contradiction in terms. I have only scratched Hayek's surface. I have not discussed his prescience in the 1940s and 1950s, in identifying the flaws in communism and also in predicting the stagflationary woes of the western democracies. He was a cold but brilliant fish. If you have postponed reading him because you regard him as a political extremist, my advice is to think again. There are few more challenging 20th-century thinkers.</p>

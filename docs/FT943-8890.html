			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Suite-talking the guests - A type of US hotel that offers more space Travellers to the US who need their hotel rooms to double as offices or showrooms, but who do not want to pay an excessive price for the privilege, are increasingly checking into all-suite hotels. Launched in the US 10 years ago, these hotels typically offer a sitting room as well as a bedroom, and usually include full breakfast in the price. The price of a suite is generally only slightly above that of standard rooms in comparable hotels in the same neighbourhood. Average daily rates for a suite in an upmarket hotel were about Dollars 97 in the first quarter of this year, according to Ernst &amp; Young, the consultancy. For an extended stay, the average rate falls to about Dollars 75 a day. 'Suites give travellers a bigger space for about the same price,' says Mr Steve Porter, marketing manager for Promus Corp's Embassy Suites, the largest all-suite hotel chain in the US. Not only are the rooms larger, the hotels are generally smaller, and built around a courtyard or atrium to give guests a more relaxed, residential atmosphere, Mr Porter says. There are 16 major all-suite hotel chains in the US, many of them operated by well-known hoteliers, such as Marriott, Promus Corp and Radisson. While US hotel construction has stagnated recently for lack of financing, all-suite properties are expanding, particularly hotels catering to the needs of travellers who stay four nights or more. These hotels often offer laundry and shopping services, and suites are equipped with small but functional kitchens. At the best chains, a guest enjoys the equivalent of a well-equipped, one-bedroom apartment for less than Dollars 100 a night. Marriott operates Residence Inns, the largest and most successful extended-stay chain in the US. Homewood Suites, run by Promus Corp, won top billing for overall customer satisfaction in a recent all-suites hotel survey by Consumer Reports Magazine. Experienced travellers say that, in addition to more space and a convenient breakfast, the all-suites hotels have two other winning features: location and consistently good quality. Because they tend to be newer properties, they are usually in better shape and have more modern equipment than older, full-service hotels. Built with business travellers in mind, all-suite properties are usually located in suburban areas near interstate highways or big airports.</p>

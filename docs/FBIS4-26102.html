			<p>BFN     [Text] Chengdu, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's  Sichuan Province plans to invest up to 100 billion yuan (about  11.5 billion U.S. dollars) in the construction of energy  projects before the end of this century in a bid to ease the  power shortage which is plaguing its economic development.    Rich in natural resources, Sichuan boasts the biggest  hydroelectric power and natural gas reserves in the country.    The province has mapped out an ambitious plan to exploit its  hydroelectric power, natural gas and coal resources. The  investment needed will come from the state, provincial and local  governments along with overseas investment and funds raised by  enterprises.    Already, power stations with a total investment of 30  billion  yuan (about 3.4 billion U.S. dollars) are being built across the  province. These power stations will be able to provide a total  of 6.5 million kw of electricity a year by the time they are  completed.    The province plans to set aside another 60 billion yuan over  the next few years on more such construction projects. Local  governments are also building smaller ones with a total annual  capacity of 1.3 million kw.    As China's second-largest coal producer, Sichuan is busy  developing coal mines which will be able to supply 2.97 million  tons of coal annually.    A natural gas field which can supply 1.3 million cu m of  natural gas a year has been completed, and another of similar  size is being planned.    Natural gas development and energy saving projects in China  have been listed as loan projects by the World Bank for the 1994  fiscal year with 255 million U.S. dollars in loans and 10  million U.S. dollars in free aid.</p>

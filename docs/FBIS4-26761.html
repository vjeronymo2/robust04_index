			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] An unprecedented number of senior generals have  gone abroad on diplomatic missions.    Western diplomats said this reflected the growing power of  the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in foreign affairs, normally  the preserve of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the  Communist Party's International Liaison Department. The  diplomats said they were particularly surprised by the  involvement of the regional commanders in "military-style  diplomacy".    Until recently, it was usually senior officers from PLA  headquarters who went on overseas trips. But on Wednesday, a  "friendship delegation" led by the Commander of the Chengdu  Military Region, General Li Jiulong, left Kunming for a tour of  Burma and Laos. A day earlier, General Wang Ke, Commander of  the Shenyang Military Region, departed for North Korea.    The heads of the various branches of the PLA also have been  unusually active in diplomacy. Air Force Commander General Cao  Shuangming and the Vice-Chief of the Navy, General Chen  Mingshan, are touring Egypt and Tanzania respectively.    In the past month, senior generals including the Vice  Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Zhang Zhen, and  Defence Minister General Chi Haotian have also made aggressive  statements about Taiwan. For example, while meeting a Zambian  delegation earlier this week, General Chi said it was absolutely  not permissible to propagate the scenario of "one China one  Taiwan".    Political sources said the "PLA lobby" had played a role in  the unusually strong language used by the Chinese media over the  past month to attack the "pro-independence" stance of Taiwan  President Lee Tenghui.    Apart from Taiwan, advice offered by the top brass has  affected the leadership's handling of issues such as North  Korea, sovereignty disputes over the Spratly Islands, and  Sino-American relations.    Western diplomats said the PLA, which had a long tradition  of  friendship with North Korea, wanted to use China's influence  with Pyongyang to exert pressure on Washington. The sources  said, however, the fact that so many generals were out of China  was a sign that the leadership was confident of political  stability in the near term.    Meanwhile, several members of the Politburo, including  President Jiang Zemin, Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji and Qian Qichen,  have gone on provincial tours in the past fortnight. The  sources said the leadership was "reasonably assured" that  patriarch Deng Xiaoping's health would hold up until the Fourth  Plenum of the Central Committee set for autumn.    A major mission of the trips by the politburo members is to  canvass the support of regional leaders for the economic  programme which will be tabled at the plenum.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Eduardo Dimas] </F>   [Text] For a few months now, we have been receiving  information on the United States' attempt to force the DPRK to  allow inspections of their nuclear facilities under the pretext  that this country is manufacturing or is currently in possession  of atomic weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency has  already checked those facilities on two separate occasions.  Nevertheless, the U.S. Government continues to insist.    Recently, the UN Security Council asked North Korea to  authorize inspections, which that government later rejected. The  UN Security Council's petition was not mandatory. That same day,  President William Clinton threatened to isolate the DPRK  internationally if they persist in that position.    At the same time, the United States began sending Patriot  missiles to South Korean territory and placed U.S. troops  stationed on the peninsula on alert. The South Korean defense  minister made militant statements in an obvious attempt to  intensify the situation. The North Korean Government also  mobilized its forces to reject any aggression. A state of war  has been created, which does not benefit anyone in the world,  especially the more powerful Asian countries like China and  Japan, or other countries known to possess nuclear weapons, like  India and Pakistan.    This situation has created a difference of opinion among  regional analysts. For some, this is no more than a diplomatic  arm-wrestling match, a contest for a more favorable position at  the negotiating table. Others believe a real threat of war  exists between the two Koreas, the consequences of which would  be unpredictable for the region and for the world as a whole.    The moderate positions of China and Russia, who on repeated  occasions have requested a continuation of negotiations between  Washington and Pyongyang, have reduced the possibility of a  harsher stance toward North Korea by the Security Council, in  accordance, as usual, with Yankee wishes.    In any case, for those who believe that in these times, war  is impossible because there is a new government in the United  States, I would like to read this paragraph from the book,  "Mandate for Change," a compilation by the Institute for  Progressive Policy affiliated with the Council for Democratic  Leadership, which is to be the leading book of the Clinton  administration.    It reads: The next key challenge for collective security in  the new period will be to give the United Nations the power to  use preventive diplomacy. It goes on to emphasize: Of course,  the United States should never renounce its prerogative to use  unilateral force when its vital interests are threatened.    Until now, what the United States calls UN preventive  diplomacy -- in other words, to do as it pleases -- has failed  in the case of Korea. Therefore, I ask myself: Can one dismiss  the possibility of a unilateral action by the United States? I  do not think so.</p>

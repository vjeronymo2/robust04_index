			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Volynskiy: "Most Illegal"] </F>   [Text] In Russia's entire history there has perhaps been  no other state measure conducted with so many violations of  morality and law as the 20 March through 3 April elections to  the St. Petersburg city assembly.    As we have already reported, in most of the districts not  even a miserly 25 percent of voters went to the polling stations  20 March. Matters were saved by the servicemen, whom A. Sobchak  had first deprived of electoral rights and then later granted  again. He used his own authority to extend the elections by a  further 24 hours. The soldiers and cadets were led in orderly  fashion to the ballot boxes but....    A few days later the city electoral commission announced the  figures: How many voters were on the lists and how many had  gone to vote. It emerged that in approximately half the  districts slightly more than 25 percent of citizens had turned  out and consequently the second round of voting would be held  here. Meticulous journalists nonetheless did a recount -- and  did not get 25 percent. A day later the city electoral  commission produced different, "improved," figures. Then 10  electoral blocs, movements, and parties issued a joint statement  demanding that the elections be considered invalid.  Incidentally, the elections were "valid" almost exclusively in  districts where members of the "Democratic Unity" bloc (a  pseudonym of "Russia's Choice") were running and it was they  who came out ahead.    The city prosecutor's office meanwhile lodged a protest at  the results and Mayor A. Sobchak admitted on television that the  elections were invalid but... immediately scheduled the second  round of voting for 3 April. The city awaited with interest the  decision of the city court, to which the city prosecutor's  office had appealed, demanding that A. Sobchak's directive on  extending the elections be repealed. The case seemed clear:  The mayor had no right to extend the elections since the  Russian president had authorized him to scheduled just one  single day for them. In turn the mayor's side asserted: If he  issued the statute on elections himself then he can make any  amendments to it. The mayor's lawyers avoided the question of  whether these amendments might contradict the president's edict.    The court decided they could. And it rejected the  prosecutor's office's claim. The prosecutor's office lodged an  appeal with the Russian Supreme Court.    Meanwhile the start of the second act had been announced.  But a turnout of 25 percent at the polling stations was by no  means compulsory 3 April. As the newspaper NEVSKOYE VREMYA  wittily noted, in theory just one person could go to the polls,  that would be enough. It cited interesting statistics from  which it emerged that the overwhelming majority of St.  Petersburg's population was quite unable to support the present  authorities.    Thus the St. Petersburg authorities have done everything to  ensure that the results of the elections, given a more serious  attitude toward them on the part of the law enforcement organs,  can be annuled at any moment.</p>

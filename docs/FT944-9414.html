			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Kohl stays chancellor in close vote Mr Helmut Kohl was yesterday re-elected chancellor of Germany, but with only one vote to spare after three of his own coalition partners voted against him in a secret ballot. Mr Kohl, 64, who received 338 of the 671 parliamentary votes, just one above the required majority to get elected in the first round, said after his re-election, 'I didn't expect all the votes from the coalition. It was the result I had expected.' The opposition Social Democrats, Greens, and reformed east German communist Party of Democratic Socialism all cast their combined 330 votes against him. There were no abstentions and only one deputy, of the SPD, was absent because he was in hospital. A smiling Mr Kohl, re-elected chancellor for the fifth successive time, stood to acknowledge the ovation from his own benches after Mrs Rita Sussmuth, speaker of the house, announced the result. Coalition deputies then broke into a rhythmic applause, while the opposition sat stoney-faced. Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the SPD, walked over to congratulate Mr Kohl, while the chancellor, in an unusual gesture, shook hands with Mr Gregor Gysi, leader of the PDS. But with a narrow victory, secured by Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union, its Bavarian sister party, who personally made sure every deputy would attend the vote, Mr Scharping warned that the next legislative period would be difficult for Mr Kohl. 'It will be tight now (for Mr Kohl),' he said. 'Making difficult political decisions with such a narrow majority will be like walking on a tightrope,' he added. He was also referring to the coalition's narrow parliamentary majority. It had a 134 majority in the last parliament cut to just 10 in this one. But the decision by three (unnamed) members of Mr Kohl's own coalition to vote against the chancellor suggests he will require, and try to impose, strict discipline across party ranks to push through his agenda. Mr Kohl's agenda for the next four years will be spelt out tomorrow when he addresses the Bundestag. The agenda, agreed at the weekend between the CDU, CSU and the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition, and which is called 'Making united Germany fit for the future' includes curbing the budget deficit, pressing ahead with privatisation, creating more jobs, slimming the bureaucracy, and social security cut-backs. At the same time, Mr Kohl will announce the new cabinet, which will be reduced in size. The Free Democrats are expected to retain the foreign and economic ministries, but it is still unclear if Mr Gunter Rexrodt will retain the economics portfolio. The FDP's bargaining position for its share of cabinet posts has been weakened following last month's federal elections when its number of Bundestag seats fell by 32 to 47, although Mr Kohl is more than ever dependent on them given the coalition's slim overall majority. Yesterday, Mr Werner Hoyer, general secretary of the FDP, announced his resignation, apparently because he is held responsible for the party's election debacle. His resignation will take effect next month when the liberals hold a special party conference to assess the disastrous results as well as a future strategy. Papering over cracks, Page 24</p>

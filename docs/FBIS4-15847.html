			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Rabotnova: "Shall We Begin at the </F> Beginning?"]    [Text] The Council of Electoral Associations has confirmed  its statement of 21 March, which discusses the illegality of the  spring elections to the City Assembly. The council continues to  insist on conducting in 1994 truly democratic elections to the  deputy corps, combining the voting with a poll of the population  concerning confidence in the mayor of St. Petersburg.    It is worth noting that the petition was signed not only by  those who lost but also by the "City We Love" movement, whose  candidates won in five districts, and also the "Our City -- Our  Home" and "Unity for Progress" movements, which also achieved a  certain amount of success. As we know, Aleksandr Shelkanov has  not changed his opinion about the illegality of the elections,  but the representatives of "Democratic Unity," "Business St.  Petersburg," and "All St. Petersburg" still hold the opposite  viewpoint.    Incidentally, the leaders of "Democratic Unity" are now in  Moscow--the question of the elections in our city is expected to  be discussed at today's session of the State Duma.</p>

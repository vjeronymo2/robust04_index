			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House The steadiness of Trafalgar House shares in response to the result of the Hongkong Land tender prompts the question of whether there is a floor around 85p. The answer is only a qualified yes. The wholesale rejection of the tender by institutional investors suggests they think the company is worth more. If Trafalgar House fails to appoint a board capable of unlocking that value, then, presumably, Land will eventually be back in part or in full. That said, one should beware of assuming the company can be turned round quickly or that the fortunes of the engineering and construction industries are at their nadir. Just because Trafalgar's assets are worth more than 85p per share now does not automatically mean they still will be in 12 months' time.</p>

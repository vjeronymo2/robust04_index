			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Warning over Saudi output SAUDI ARABIA, which has the world's largest proven oil reserves, will need to invest at least Dollars 18bn before 2000 to reach and maintain capacity of about 10m barrels a day, according to a report published yesterday. The London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies, which was founded by Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the former Saudi oil minister, believes the kingdom will be easily able to expand its current capacity of 9.6m b/d to the 10m b/d level by next year if the government chooses. But maintaining it at that level will be more costly, it says. Dr Manouchehr Takin, the report's author, said present Saudi spending plans suggested that the kingdom's additional capacity this decade will come almost solely from existing oil fields. But these will require substantial capital investment in order to maintain production levels, including the installation of costly gas or water injection systems. Operational costs in Saudi oil fields also appear to be higher than international norms, according to Dr Takin. The report notes that the need to maintain such high levels of spending, which will not add significant amounts to the country's oil production capacity, coincides with growing budgetary pressures within Saudi Arabia, brought about in part by large defence outlay. The report says there is little likelihood of new fields, such as the giant Shaybah field near the Abu Dhabi border, being developed in the near future because of their remoteness and lack of infrastructure to bring the oil to terminals. A growing Saudi dependence on older fields means the country will lose its ability to quickly make up for a sudden loss of output in other producing countries, as it did when Kuwait was invaded by Iraq.

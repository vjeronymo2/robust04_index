			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRESNO;  </P> <P> 4TH DROUGHT YEAR SEEN AS DISASTROUS  </P> <P> No one is yet predicting a fourth year of drought in Central California, but  the possibility is on the minds of many San Joaquin Valley growers and  irrigation water management officials. "There's no sense of panic at this  point, but if we don't get some rain in the valley and snow in the Sierra in  the next few weeks, that could change," Robert Leake, manager of the Fresno  Irrigation District, said Friday. A fourth dry year would be disastrous for  valley growers who depend on irrigation water for their crops. The panic could  start before the end of the year because most of the season's rain and snow  fall in December, January and February.  </P></p>

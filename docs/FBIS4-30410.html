			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Strong Yen Is Distorted Reflection of the </F> Economy"]    [Text] The dollar temporarily dropped to 99-yen [Y] in  European and U.S. markets and the "era of one dollar equals to  less than Y100" has arrived. Although the dollar dropped to the  Y100 level last August, significance of breaking the  psychological barrier is not small.    The yen-dollar exchange rate, which started at Y360 to the  dollar when Japan was in ruins after World War II, finally  dropped to lower than the Y100 level after going through the  Nixon shock, shift to a floating exchange rate system, Plaza  agreement, and other changes. Since yen's exchange rate reflects  Japan's competitive power, some people may take pride in the  rapid rise in yen's value.    However, we are certain that many businessmen have no reason  to take pride. Such a high exchange rate, if it takes root,  will shrink export companies' revenues and will have an effect  of retarding the economic recovery, which is about to bottom out  at long last.    A rapid rise in yen's value lowers stock prices and hampers  financial organizations' efforts to deal with bad debts. The  issue of bad debts may come up to the surface again and  undermine the financial system.    We cannot rule out the possibility of industrial stagnation  either. Following the rise in yen's value last year, quantity  of imported goods has increased rapidly. On the other hand,  companies, which produced goods for export, are quickly moving  abroad.    While major domestic auto makers are being forced to shut  down some of their plants, foreign auto sale in Japan is rapidly  expanding. The market share of foreign cars reached 8.6 percent  in May. It is possible that some 30 percent of new cars sold in  Japan may be foreign cars and the Japanese auto market may  become like that of the United States in the near future.    It is quite natural that amount of import increases and the  industrial relocation overseas progresses as the economy grows.  The only thing we can do to make up for such a  deindustrialization is to create new jobs.    In the case of Japan, however, we should not forget the fact  that our economic structure is distorted. Due to government  regulations and traditional business practices, prices of  imported goods do not go down enough. Export industries do not  hesitate to export goods without making profit just to keep  their employees. Because of these, the yen's exchange rate  tends to rise higher than its actual value and thereby forces  industries, which can remain in Japan, to move abroad.    Despite the Bank of Japan's intervention in Tokyo market on  22 June, the yen's exchange rate against the dollar reached the  highest in the postwar era. The government is trying to lower  the yen's value through coordinated intervention with other  industrial nations in foreign exchange markets. However, it is  said that the United States is skeptical about the effect of  such cooperation. Market intervention may temporarily stop the  trend of money market but it cannot change it.    The government should exert more efforts to correct causes  of  the excessively high value of the yen. It publicly promised  that it would map out economic measures, centered around the  idea of increasing public investments and easing regulations, by  the end of this month. It has no choice but to firmly promote  the process of deregulation to correct the distortion of the  current economy.    The dollar dipped below Y100 following the fall of its value  against European currencies. The weak dollar against major  currencies is the cause of strong yen.    Funds, which change hands from one country to another by  seeking profit, grew big. It is said that money, which amounts  to $1 trillion, was invested in British pound and Italian lira  at the time of the 1992 European currency crisis.    Due to concerns about the future of U.S. economy, this money  has begun to change hands from dollars to other currencies. For  fear of possible inflation in the United States and huge amount  of its deficit in the current account balance, the money is now  being invested in the yen and European currencies.    The dollar's further decline will not be beneficial to the  United States either. However, further interest rate hike may  create a crash like the Black Monday. The United States is also  in a difficult situation.    There is no remedy for the U.S. economy. It seems that the  only things the United States can do to emerge out of the  difficult situation is to steadily reduce its financial deficit  and to increase its savings rate.</p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Christmas and new year holidays inevitably keep the market at a virtual standstill. There are no wool sales and most textile producers are closed in the UK till next week. A subdued close to the wool selling season in Australia provided no incentive to trade buyers at the manufacturing end of the industry, though early reports do indicate encouraging consumer demand for clothing over the important Christmas season. Currency markets are not fully tested but further strength in the US dollar is already a feature and enhances wool costs in many wool-using countries.</p>

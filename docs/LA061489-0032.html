			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEGION / STEVE ELLING;  </P> <P> VALENCIA WELL-POSITIONED TO HELP RESEDA  </P> <P> Mario Valencia has done just fine for a guy who never really made it to first  base.  </P> <P> When Cleveland High opened its doors to its first freshman class in 1985 -- it  was previously a three-year school -- Valencia was included in the incoming  crop, although at 5-foot-6 and 130 pounds he was more akin to a weed. By the  end of his freshman season, however, Valencia had played eight positions --  everywhere but first base.  </P> <P> "Being 5-6 or 5-7, whatever I was then, it just didn't work out at first,"  Valencia said. "But I kind of filled in wherever they needed me."  </P> <P> Filled in like cement.  </P> <P> Valencia, who will graduate from Cleveland next week, became the first  four-year letterman -- indeed, the first four-year starter -- in the history of  the program. And after two weeks of play for Reseda's American Legion team, he  has once again proved his versatility.  </P> <P> "He basically plays wherever I ask him to," Reseda Coach Frank Des Enfants  said. "Sometimes I don't even know where I'm going to put him. He never whines,  he just goes out there and does his job."  </P> <P> So far, Valencia has played pitcher, shortstop, left field and catcher for  Reseda (5-2 in District 20 play).  </P> <P> A 5-7, 140-pound catcher? Care to try your luck?  </P> <P> Last Saturday, Encino-Crespi baserunners tested Valencia three times in the  first two innings. The result was three consecutive 2-to-4 putouts.  </P> <P> "Believe it or not, that's where I like it best," Valencia said. "I think I  call a pretty good game back there. With a pitcher, it's not just how hard you  throw, but where you put it and what you throw."  </P> <P> Too bad Valencia can't call his own game.  </P> <P> Reseda pitchers other than Valencia have allowed four earned runs and compiled  an earned-run average of less than 1.00. Valencia, who will start at 5:15 p.m.  today against Woodland Hills West at El Camino Real High, has allowed five  earned runs in 13 innings and is 0-2.  </P> <P> Offensively, however, Valencia leads the team with a .458 average (11 for 24).  He also tops the team in doubles (three), stolen bases (five) and runs batted  in (eight).  </P> <P> "I wouldn't be surprised if he plays every position before the season's over,"  Des Enfants said. "Not because we'll intentionally put him everywhere, but  because before this is over we'll probably have a need for him everywhere."  </P> <P> Gearing up: After three seasons as a starter at Westlake High, Mike Lieberthal  is building a head of steam heading into his senior season in 1990.  </P> <P> Lieberthal is 12 for 33 with three doubles, six home runs and 21 RBIs for  District 16 entry Westlake-Agoura (6-1-1).  </P> <P> Last season at Westlake High, he hit .408 with four home runs and 16 RBIs.  </P> <P> Habit of winning: For the fourth time in as many games, Sun Valley (6-1 in  District 20) won in its last at-bat, continuing its last-minute madness with a  doubleheader sweep of Foothill Valley on Sunday.  </P> <P> Last week, Sun Valley eked out one-run decisions against Panorama City and  Glendale and twice beat Foothill Valley.  </P> <P> How hot is this team? Sun Valley trailed, 4-3, with two out in the seventh  inning in Sunday's opener against Foothill Valley when right-handed-batting  Harold Whiteside singled in two runs to win the game.  </P> <P> What's more, Whiteside was hitting without a contact lens in his left eye. He  lost it while playing in the outfield.  </P> <P> "They could just as easily have been four losses," Sun Valley Coach Les Riley  said of the streak. "We better start waking up on time real soon."  </P> <P> No kidding. Next week, Sun Valley plays Woodland Hills East, Woodland Hills  West and Newhall-Saugus, all among the favorites to win their respective  divisional titles.  </P> <P> Welcome back: As a junior, infielder Ricky Banuelos was a reserve on the Canoga  Park High team that won the 1987 City Section 4-A baseball title. As a senior,  he was a starter. Last season, he did not play college baseball.  </P> <P> After Banuelos' first week of playing for Woodland Hill West, Coach Gary Gibson  must be wondering why.  </P> <P> In his first 10 at-bats, Banuelos had seven hits. After six games, Banuelos is  11 for 19 with a team-high 11 RBIs.  </P> <P> Add Sun Valley: Right-hander Eddie Chavez -- who led area City Section  relievers with four saves -- still knows how to pick his spots.  </P> <P> In two relief appearances totaling four innings Sunday, he picked up two wins.  </P> <P> Picking the wrong spots: It hasn't all been good news for Sun Valley -- the  team lost two leadoff hitters last week.  </P> <P> Shad Martinez broke his left wrist playing pick-up basketball Wednesday and  John Campbell strained a tendon in his left wrist against Glendale last  Saturday. The two had combined to steal nine bases in seven games.  </P> <P> Winning understudy: Newhall-Saugus right-hander Roger Salkeld's failure to show  for his team's doubleheader with Burbank on Sunday didn't rattle Glenn Terry.  </P> <P> Terry (6-3, 210 pounds) threw a one-hitter, struck out six and walked one as  Newhall-Saugus (4-1) beat Burbank, 1-0. He carried a perfect game into the  fifth inning.  </P></p>

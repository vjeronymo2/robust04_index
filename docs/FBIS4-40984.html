			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by observer Aleksandr Golts: "Korean Peninsula: </F> Is the Crisis Over?"]    [Text] "It is my personal opinion that the crisis is over,  and I am confident that Kim Il-song wants to ensure that the  crisis is surmounted," Jimmy Carter, former U.S. president,  declared after a conversation with Lake, the incumbent  President's assistant for national security affairs, and  Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state for  politico-military affairs. It was Carter who assumed the  mission of intermediary between Pyongyang and the world  community after the DPRK announced its withdrawal from the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA].    His unprecedented eight-hour conversation with Kim Il-song,  the DPRK leader, resulted in Pyongyang's proposals for settling  the crisis, which Carter took to Seoul and Washington. We are  talking, in particular, of a proposal to reduce the troops of  each of the Korean states by 100,000 men. The DPRK seems to be  abandoning its former demands for the unconditional withdrawal  of U.S. troops from South Korea and would now like their  numerical strength to be reduced in the same proportion as the  troops of the North and the South. In agreeing to a meeting  with the South Korean president, Kim Il-song would like  Washington to act as intermediary if the DPRK fails to find a  common language with South Korea.    Finally, the chief point. Kim Il-song, according to Carter,  will agree to freeze his nuclear program while "conscientious  talks" are under way, and has promised not to remove the IAEA  inspectors from the nuclear installation and to maintain in  working order the monitoring equipment installed there. In  return he would like to receive international assistance in  making the full switch from a graphite reactor to a light-water  reactor.    Official Washington has not gone into raptures over these  proposals. It has been declared that the United States will not  cease its efforts to introduce sanctions against the DPRK until  real progress has been made on the nuclear problem. According  to Gallucci, Pyongyang's fulfillment of a number of conditions  remains the key point. Above all, its pledge not to process  nuclear fuel, as well as permission for international  inspections of DPRK nuclear installations. If these demands are  met, Washington will agree to holding a third round of talks  with the DPRK.    Despite the emphasized restraint, a sigh of relief is  clearly  audible in all this. For, as the mutual threats escalated, the  situation was getting increasingly out of control. Many people  were losing their nerve. Witness the Japanese prime minister's  strange statement, to say the least, that his country possesses  everything necessary to create nuclear weapons! Yet the idea of  sanctions was clearly on the skids owing to the position of  China and, partly, of Russia, which reckoned (not without  grounds, as we see) that far from all means of persuasion had  been used. President Clinton was finding himself in a rather  foolish situation: Having raised his hand, he clearly could not  strike. This cannot pass without hurting the reputation of a  world leader.    The situation is still not entirely clear, and it is too  soon  to sum up results. But if the DPRK now permits inspections and,  simultaneously, achieves the realization of even some of its  proposals, then Pyongyang will be the obvious winner. If we  forget about the high moral ground, then the North Korean  politicians have played their game brilliantly. After  escalating the situation to the limit, they have promised to  sacrifice their nuclear program in exchange for de facto  recognition of the DPRK. You can be confident that it will not  even occur to anybody in the next few years to put pressure on  North Korea over human rights observance or anything else. In  politicians' brains it is being imprinted: Do not touch the  DPRK, and nothing will threaten the nonproliferation treaty.    Pyongyang is not being original in this. It has played the  game which Soviet diplomacy also played repeatedly and with  success in unforgettable times. The object of the deal here is  not nuclear might. The chief thing here is unpredictability in  the eyes of the other people in the game. It seems that even  now that the Cold War has vanished into the past it is possible  to sell your own unpredictability quite well....</p>

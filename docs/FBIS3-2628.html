			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yang Liu (2799 2692): "State Council </F> Makes Decision That Profits of Mainland Power Plants Invested in  by Foreign Businessmen Are Not Allowed To Exceed 12 Percent"]    [Text] According to a Beijing source, the State Council  made a decision not long ago which said that in Sino-foreign  joint-venture power plants, the investment returns of the  foreign partner should not exceed 12 percent. The Chinese side  may reject excessive demands made by foreign parties.    The source told this reporter yesterday that an official in  charge of the State Council had personally taken up the matter  involving a hydropower plant, a Sino-foreign joint venture in  Zhuhai. He instructed that the foreign party's request for an  18 percent return on investment must not be accepted. Later,  the foreign party lowered the return on investment to less than  15 percent, which was accepted by the Chinese side. However,  the State Council pointed out that the case should not be taken  as a precedent.    The source pointed out: "In recent years, localities have  tried by every means to develop Sino-foreign joint power  projects on a large scale. More than 300 letters of intent and  agreements have been signed over the past three years. However,  only a limited number of projects eventually have proved  successful."    He continued by saying that some provinces and cities were  overanxious for quick results, accepting the harsh terms  proposed by foreign parties, including high rates of return on  investment. This case has aroused attention of the State  Council.    Owing to a lack of experience during the initial period of  attracting foreign investment in power projects, some southern  provinces accepted the request by a Hong Kong company for a 50  percent return on investment and for fixing the price of coal at  90 yuan per ton for a long term.    According to the source, the State Council, in principle,  has  set the return on investment for foreign parties in Sino-foreign  power project ventures at 11-12 percent. If the foreign party  makes excessive demands, the Chinese side may reject the request.    China's total installed capacity was 167 billion kw by the  end of 1993, and 840 billion kw of electricity was generated  during the year. Of this, 671.5 billion kw was generated by  thermal power plants, 127 billion kw by hydropower plants, and  1.5 billion kw by nuclear power plants.    Last year China invested 52.2 billion yuan in power  construction, newly adding installed capacity of 12 billion kwh.  The state plans to invest 6 million yuan [as published] this  year and the newly installed capacity should be higher than that  in the previous year.    He continued by saying that the per capita consumption of  electricity in mainland China is 600 kwh, while the figure is  over 5,000 kwh in the United States and over 2,000 kwh in Hong  Kong, Japan, and Britain.    To meet the standard of intermediate-level developing  countries, where the per capita consumption of electricity is  1,000 kwh, he said, China will have to increase its installed  capacity to 1.2 billion kwh.    To vigorously develop power construction in the future, the  source said, China will pay equal attention to thermal,  hydropower, and nuclear power. At present, China is now  selecting sites along the coast for building nuclear power  plants. He continued by saying that high growth has been  registered in China's economy and industry. For this reason, it  is imperative to develop energy. On the premise of rationality  and mutual benefit, China is willing to cooperate with investors  from all countries to build more power plants in China.    He pointed out that progress has been smooth for the Zhuhai  power plant, built by Zhuhai in cooperation with Hong Kong's  Cheung Kong and other corporations. A number of large thermal  power plants will be open to foreign investment, and tenders  will be invited from all countries very soon.</p>

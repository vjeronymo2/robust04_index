			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / International Company News: Japanese share prices fall in London EVIDENCE of rising real estate debts and news of fresh investigations into securities deals, both emerging after Tokyo's close, sent prices of Japanese shares traded in London sharply lower, Reuter reports. Worried traders rushed to square positions before the weekend. 'The underlying tone is one of fear. Decent positions have been given up as a result,' said one dealer. The Nikkei-50 index fell 9.18 points to 1,272.65, following a 20.11 drop in the 225-share Tokyo index to 20,745.17.</p>

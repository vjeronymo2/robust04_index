Model A109A and A109AII series helicopters, that currently imposes a calendar life limit of 10 years and 6 months on the main rotor retention strap assemblies (strap assemblies). This amendment requires reducing the calendar life limit to 8 years. This amendment is prompted by additional service experience and analyses, that show the current life limit needs to be reduced from 10 years and 6 months to 8 years to prevent deterioration and subsequent failure of the strap assemblies. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the strap assemblies, loss of a main rotor blade, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> December 1, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This AD and any related information may be examined in the Rules Docket at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Mike Mathias, Aerospace Engineer, Rotorcraft Standards Staff, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Fort Worth, Texas 76137, telephone (817) 222&hyph;5123, fax (817) 222&hyph;5961.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 87&hyph;15&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;5681, (52 FR 27787, July 24, 1987), which is applicable to Costruzioni Aeronautiche Giovanni Agusta S.p.A. Model A109A and A109AII series helicopters, was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> on August 21, 1992 (57 FR 37914). That action proposed to require an 8-year calendar life instead of a 10 years and 6 months life limit on the strap assemblies, part numbers 2601521 and 109&hyph;0101&hyph;95&hyph;1, &hyph;3, and &hyph;105. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. However, the words ``since installation'' have been removed and the word ``total'' has been added to paragraph (a)(2) to further clarify that the TIS and the calendar years relate to the total time on the strap assemblies and not to the time since they were installed on the helicopter. Also, the terms ``calendar year'' and ``calendar month'' have now been defined in paragraph (a)(3). Finally, the average labor rate was raised from $55 to $60. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed with the noted changes. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 46 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 4 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $1,931 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $99,866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

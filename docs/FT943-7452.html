			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sycamore plans Pounds 1.7m refinancing Sycamore, the laboratory, office and garden furniture manufacturer, has announced a refinancing with the issue of Pounds 1.7m convertible loan stock and a Pounds 500,000 bridging loan, subject to shareholder approval. The refinancing is necessary because of continuing losses at the group, primarily at its Cygnet laboratory furniture subsidiary. Mr Andrew Johnson, chairman, said Cygnet had been placed in receivership and the group would now concentrate on its profitable Deanes office furniture business. Royal Bank of Scotland and Tufton Capital, a corporate recovery specialist, have agreed to subscribe to the new stock, which will be convertible into ordinary shares representing up to 80 per cent of the enlarged share capital. Existing shareholders will be able to subscribe to an amount equal to the number of shares that would arise if one third of the loan stock were immediately converted at a price equivalent to 90 per cent of the conversion price of the loan stock. The group also announced a Pounds 1.84m pre-tax loss for the six months to end-March, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 1.88m. Turnover fell from Pounds 11.1m to Pounds 9.7m, although sales rose 53 per cent to Pounds 4.7m at Deanes, which made operating profits of Pounds 408,000 (Pounds 140,000). In January the group sold HCL Fasteners and Ashworth Leisure for a total of Pounds 600,000. Mr Johnson said the first half did not include the full impact of Cygnet's receivership, or further 'substantial' asset write-downs. Losses per share worked out at 0.84p (1.89p) and there is no interim dividend.</p>

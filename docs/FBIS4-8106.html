			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- The people and the  leadership of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] are deeply  indignant over the shocking precedent set by NATO forces, under  the auspices of the [UN] Security Council, by the bombing of  Serb positions in the Srpska republic, with no prior notice and  no good reason, RSK President Milan Martic said today.    "We sharply protest this insolent action which has  undermined  all efforts to end the crisis in the territory of former  Yugoslavia by peaceful means," a statement stresses and adds  that NATO's attack on the Srpska republic has further shaken the  Serb people's confidence in the international community, which  was at its lowest level anyway, due to the international  community's partisan and biased attitude in the past.    "With this act of aggression the international community has  declared war on the Serb people, thus trying to force it --  under the threat of NATO's war machinery -- to accept solutions  which are in the interest of the other two warring sides and  detrimental to the Serb people," the RSK president warns.    The statement goes on to say:    ``The RSK people and leadership again express their full  support for our brothers in the Srpska republic and their  efforts to defend their freedom won in blood.    ``Those who committed this thoughtless act will bear the  blame for all the possible consequences of the bombing of the  Srpska republic on the further course of the peace process in  the territory of former Yugoslavia.    "At the same time, we warn all the relevant international  factors that the RSK will not tolerate any attempts to solve its  future political status through pressure and threats, regardless  from which side they come."</p>

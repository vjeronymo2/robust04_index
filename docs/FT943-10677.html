			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar issues surge A sharp rise in the dollar saw internationally traded stocks stand out strongly. ICI, still benefiting from recent strong figures, gained 23 at 860p, while Reuters added 21 at 489p, Glaxo 21 at 594p and Unilever 23 at 1046p. Unilever is due to report second-quarter results on Friday, and Strauss Turnbull reiterated its positive stance. The house forecasts a slight decline in profits to Pounds 588m but expects a second half boost from a recovery in European demand and the benefits of recent corporate restructuring. Cable and Wireless, another dollar beneficiary, received additional support from a Hoare Govett note which argues that the company's non- Hong Kong operations are valued at 'close to a five-year low' and a share price of 580p would reflect the true valuation more closely. The shares strengthened 15 to 451p. Household goods group Reckitt &amp; Colman, usually a niggardly market performer, jumped 25 to 613p as a reshuffle at SG Warburg prompted the house to boost its recommendation to buy from hold. The house acknowledges that earnings growth is not one of the company's big strengths but adds that the stock is on a 10-year p/e relative low and yield relative high and sees a short term 10 per cent upside in the share price. Insurer Commercial Union fell 9 to 539p on nervousness ahead of the expected rights issue needed to fund the acquisition of Groupe Victoire, of France. Among food retailers, bid target William Low slipped 4 to 336p as hopes for a counter-bid from Tesco receded slightly. J. Sainsbury, which last week bid Pounds 210m for the Scottish supermarket group, gained 7 at 419p. Tesco, whose Pounds 155m agreed offer for Low two weeks ago was trumped by Sainsbury, put on 6 1/2 at 243p. Tate &amp; Lyle advanced 7 to 442p, with Credit Lyonnais Laing said to be recommending the stock. A mixed trading statement from Burton was taken positively by the market and the shares ended the session 3 ahead at 59 1/2 p. Disappointing sales during the 22 weeks to the end of July were offset by better than expected gross margins. The company also said it was closing its 'IS' discount chain. Forecasts were edged upwards, with Hoare Govett now looking for Pounds 42m this year and Pounds 63m in 1995. The broker also upgraded the stock. Brewers and spirits groups responded to reports of increased sales during the recent spell of hot weather in the UK and the government's Green Paper on extending licencing hours. Bass advanced 13 to 568p, Grand Metropolitan 9 to 424p and JD Wetherspoon 19 to 395p. Agency broker James Capel placed the rump of the recent rights issue from Greycoat, 21.75m shares being sold to a range of institutions at 14 1/2 p. Greycoat firmed a penny to 15 1/2 p. Elsewhere, MEPC continued to benefit from reports of its finance-raising exercise in Australia, gaining 12 at 470p. Meanwhile, Capel, a re-knowned bull of the property sector, reported unexpectedly strong rental growth, particularly in London's West End and City office markets. The broker recommended Land Securities, up 16 at 673p, and British Land, ahead 9 at 432p, as being well placed to benefit from the renewed optimism. British Aerospace improved 10 to 511p after a positive note from Hoare Govett, the group's broker, landed on clients' desks yesterday. The focus of the circular is BAe's long term potential but the broker also increased its current year profits forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 170m. Margins worries at vehicle distributor Cowie Group sent the shares tumbling 12 to 256p, after the group reported a robust set of interim figures with profits up 32 per cent to Pounds 20.5m. Lex Service, which recently came under similar pressure following its results, relinquished 7 1/2 to 422p. Engineering company TI closed 15 up at 402p ahead of interim figures due tomorrow. Lucas Industries put on 8 at 203p, with a big buyer of the shares said to have been waiting in the wings. Resignation due to ill health of the deputy chairman at Hall Engineering left the shares trailing 13 at 180p. British Airways was restrained to a rise of only 3 at 421p in trade of 3.8m. Dealers reported some nervousness ahead of today's publication of July traffic figures. Yorkshire Chemicals, the colours and dye based group, jumped 29 to 421p after announcing first-half profits of Pounds 7.2m, at the top end of City expectations. Holliday Chemicals moved up 13 to 235p ahead of next week's interim results. Construction group Havelock Europa moved ahead 8 to 177p after it was chosen by Camelot, operator of the national lottery, to fulfil a substantial proportion of its requirements. Elsewhere in the sector, Smith New Court recommended housebuilder firms Bryant Group at 154p and Beazer Homes at 157p.</p>

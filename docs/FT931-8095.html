			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Beware of the IHT trap when selling your home - You can end up paying tax at 40 per cent YOUR HOME might be special to you and your family but that does not make it exempt from inheritance tax. And although the excitement has gone out of the housing market, you might still need to consider what, if anything, can be done to mitigate this swingeing levy. The first thing is to add up your net worth. If it is below Pounds 150,000 and you have not made substantial gifts within the previous seven years, your estate is likely to escape IHT. But if it is worth more than Pounds 150,000 when you die, IHT at 40 per cent must be paid on the excess. The next thing to consider is whether you mind paying this. There is an exemption for gifts between husband and wife, so IHT need be paid only when the surviving spouse dies. And there are many who prefer not to leave substantial sums to their children for fear of spoiling them; thus, they accept paying whatever tax is due. The third thing to appreciate is that in order to mitigate IHT there will, at some time, need to be co-owners. Whereas co-ownership between husband and wife does not usually cause problems, the same is not true where the ownership is split between parent and child. If, say, a parent wanted to move to a smaller house and sell the property, the child might insist on being paid his share - in which case, the parent could be left with too little money to re-invest in another property. There is also the risk of the child's interest being brought into account if he gets divorced or made bankrupt. IHT, however, is not payable only when you die. It is also chargeable on substantial gifts made within seven years of your death, and on all assets which you no longer own but continue to enjoy. Suppose you give your house, worth Pounds 300,000, to your two children and continue to live there. When you die, its value will be added to your estate and IHT charged on it. If your children sell the house after your death, they will have to pay capital gains tax on any increase in the property's value since you gave it to them (assuming the house is not their main or only residence). Your tax planning will, therefore, result in an increase in the total payable rather than a saving. Just because you can be taxed on gifts you continue to enjoy does not mean you cannot save tax on your home. But the schemes under which you can do so are complicated. If, for instance, you are fairly certain that you will not live as long as your spouse, you can create a will trust giving them a revocable life interest. When you die, the trustees then exercise their power of revocation over 90 per cent of the value of your house in favour of your children. In this way, it is possible to save IHT and CGT - so long as your spouse survives you by seven years and continues to use the house as a main or only residence. The only drawback here is that the spouse cannot be a trustee and might object to having so little control over the family home after your death. You could also find that the trustees want indemnities from the children if the surviving spouse is not to be charged rent for occupying the 90 per cent owned by the trustees on their behalf. If you have children but do not have a spouse (for whatever reason), solving the problem of IHT on your main and only residence is a little more complicated. It is possible to carve out a lease for yourself on the property and give away your remaining rights in it to the children as a reversion - subject to the lease. It would be structured so that its value would fall within the IHT nil rate band (up to Pounds 150,000); thus, no tax would be due when you die. In the meantime, the longer you survived, the more the value of the reversion would increase. Although theoretically straightforward, this scheme has difficulties. One is that the gift of the reversion could be taxed if you died within seven years. It is not possible to grant a lease to yourself without an elaborate legal structure; but even if you do, beware of falling into the tempting trap of granting yourself such a lease for life - a move that would bring the value of the property back into your estate. This means you must have a fixed term, which raises the problems of either outliving your lease or dying too soon. All these and other difficulties are not insurmountable, but this scheme is not for the faint-hearted nor the foolish. There are other ways to mitigate IHT on your main or only residence, but I know of none that is either straightforward or certain because of the complexity of IHT and CGT laws. Thus, many people decline to carry out any IHT mitigation scheme using their own home unless enough tax is at stake to make it worthwhile taking good advice to steer them through the complications.

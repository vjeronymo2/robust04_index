			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fluctuating milk prices behind Golden Vale fall Fluctuations in milk prices led to a 52 per cent drop in pre-tax profits at Golden Vale, the Irish diary group, although acquisitions lifted turnover at the interim stage. In the six months to June 30, pre-tax profits fell from IPounds 9.14m to IPounds 4.43m (Pounds 4.37m). Operating profits fell from IPounds 10.03m to IPounds 6.61m, which included a reorganisation charge of Pounds 1.52m. Turnover increased by 39 per cent from IPounds 184.5m to IPounds 256.1m, including a IPounds 77.9m contribution from acquisitions. Sales in the dairy and food products division were down from IPounds 164m to IPounds 154.6m. Mr Jim O'Mahony, chief executive, reiterated a warning first issued in June that pre-tax profits for the full year would fall by a third. The share price, which shed 30 per cent after the first profits warning, closed up 2p at 57p yesterday. He said however, that the doubling of the company's processed cheese business as a result of acquisitions, as well as the integration of its UK sales and distribution businesses, provided a sound basis for medium-term development. The fall in profits was caused by a number of factors, he said. The imbalance between the price paid to suppliers for milk and the market price of products caused a IPounds 2m drop in the contribution to operating profits from milk. However, production efficiencies and improved margins produced a IPounds 800,000 contribution from milk related products. A decline in volumes affected the contribution from processed cheese which fell by IPounds 700,000, while a reduction in margins in spreads cut that division's contribution by IPounds 600,000. An unchanged interim dividend of 0.6p was declared. Earnings per share fell from 4.66p to 2.3p. Acquisition talks with Vonkpol in Poland and Haslington in the UK had been abandoned, Mr O'Mahony said.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> DERBY HANDICAPPERS ARE VERY IMPRESSED BUT NOT CONVINCED  </P> <P> From horseman to analyst to grandstand fan, the handicapping theme for the  116th Kentucky Derby, featuring co-favorites Summer Squall and Mister Frisky,  seems to be: very impressed, not totally convinced.  </P> <P> The road that led here has been fraught with confusion from the outset of the  1990 season. Twenty-three horses won the 32 significant prep races run this  winter and spring; 10 of them will answer the starter's call Saturday.  </P> <P> Some are peaking. Some have peaked. Some are heading in the wrong direction,  and some just don't belong. But it's that way every year. The following is an  assessment of the Derby field, listed in post-position order:  </P> <P> 1 -- Dr. Bobby A. Trainer Steve DiMauro said this week that this race looks  like a tough spot for his horse. An honest, hard-working horseman, DiMauro has  a very good opinion.  </P> <P> 2 -- Killer Diller. Heartened by his victory in the Grade III Garden State  Stakes and his improvement in longer races this spring, the connections of this  Pleasant Colony colt are taking a shot. A very, very long shot.  </P> <P> 3 -- Pendleton Ridge. Well-meant and winless when he accompanied stablemate  Burnt Hills to New York this spring, he arrived here still a maiden. He has not  trained well at Churchill Downs following his driving fourth-place finish in  the Wood Memorial.  </P> <P> 4 -- Video Ranger. Some are encouraged by the fact that he closed ground for  place behind Mister Frisky in the speed-biased Santa Anita Derby. Usually,  that's a good tack, but not here.  </P> <P> 5 -- Mister Frisky. Freak or fraud, that is the question. Hall of Fame trainer  Laz Barrera is 2 for 4 in this race and seldom fires big-race blanks. Jockey  Gary Stevens jumped off Silver Ending, committing early to "the  longest-striding horse" he has ever ridden. But will the colt's 13 victories in  Puerto Rico mean anything Saturday? Did his three bias-enhanced victories at  Santa Anita prepare him for the grueling challenge, in which he will be tested  early, often and longer than ever before?  </P> <P> 6 -- Real Cash. He placed gamely behind Silver Ending in the Arkansas Derby,  showing marked improvement over his fainthearted Santa Anita Derby try. But he  is best with an early lead, which will be difficult, if not impossible, for him  to secure.  </P> <P> 7 -- Fighting Fantasy. The probable pacesetter, he was beaten 40 lengths by  Summer Squall in their two meetings. He has no chance to win but will take some  speedy contenders with him and help set up for the late runners.  </P> <P> 8 -- Country Day. A long shot with a chance, this wide-racing stretch runner  benefits from what figures to be a hotly contested pace, the added distance and  a jockey switch to Jose Santos. Still, he will need a career effort to win.  </P> <P> 9 -- Unbridled. This year's training star should have won Gulfstream's Fountain  of Youth, then rebounded to win the slowly run Florida Derby. A useful third in  the wet-track Blue Grass -- from which trainer Carl Nafzger considered  scratching -- he made the kind of effort reminiscent of Genuine Risk when she  finished third in the Wood as a prelude to her 1980 Derby victory. He is  peaking beautifully.  </P> <P> 10 -- Pleasant Tap. In the clever hands of Chris Speckert, this son of Derby  winner Pleasant Colony was an excellent second in Keeneland's Lexington Stakes  and is another expected to benefit from a lively pace. Forced to alter his prep  schedule due to virus, the question is whether he has had enough conditioning.  </P> <P> 11 -- Silver Ending. The "now" horse. Making his third start this year, his  Arkansas Derby victory two weeks ago was a career best and one of the better  prep efforts this season. Prepared masterfully by Hall of Famer Ron McAnally,  Silver Ending has the type of explosive mid-race move that has won many  Derbies. Like the other late runners, however, he will need a good trip.  </P> <P> 12 -- Thirty Six Red. No 3-year-old, including Saturday's co-favorites, has  shown his kind of courage. But his gut-wrenching victories in New York's Gotham  Mile and Wood Memorial do not figure to help him Saturday, especially since he  will have to force the pace from his outer position.  </P> <P> 13 -- Burnt Hills. Another who had his prep season altered by illness, he  bounced back from a disappointing third in the Gotham with a game second in the  Wood. But he seems to need the lead in races around two turns, and Saturday's  route seems a furlong too far.  </P> <P> 14 -- Summer Squall. No one has ever questioned this colt's ability. But class  is not the issue here; scheduling and regimen are. Forced to delay his 1990  debut when he bled following an early-season workout, trainer Neil Howard has  been forced to play catch-up. After a game debut behind the rapid sprinter  Housebuster, Summer Squall won the Jim Beam and Blue Grass with style. But that  schedule seems to have taken its toll. He has lost some weight recently and on  Wednesday failed to gallop out strongly following a short workout. The Derby  will be his fourth race in 49 days, and his outside position won't make his  pace-stalking trip any easier. It's a lot to ask, even of "the best horse."  </P> <P> 15 -- Land Rush. With more Derby experience than any trainer in history, D.  Wayne Lukas might finally be right on schedule. Given one month between the San  Felipe and the Blue Grass and three weeks between the Blue Grass and Derby,  Land Rush figures to run his best race. In finishing second to Summer Squall in  Lexington, Angel Cordero was forced to attack the easy-leading winner  prematurely or suffer certain defeat. When Pat Day set the leader down in  earnest, he sprinted away. Land Rush held his ground despite racing on the same  left-fore lead, failing to switch over and gain new momentum because he was  unsure over the wet footing. And if Unbridled has been the training star this  week, then Land Rush was a close second. His outside position is not as  detrimental as it looks.  </P> <P> 16 -- Power Lunch. Even the highly positive Lukas admitted he was considering  entering this colt in an allowance race on Saturday's card.  </P> <P> This handicapper's nightmare is a racing fan's dream: 1. Land Rush 2. Unbridled  3. Silver Ending 4. Mister Frisky.  </P></p>

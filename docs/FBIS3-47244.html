As President Kim Yong-sam and Japanese Prime Minister  Hosokawa, during the November summit, agreed in principle to  establish a new consultative organ to discuss economic issues,  the two countries have been engaged in mapping out plans in  details and recently reached a deal to found the organization,  according to a Foreign Ministry official on 9 January.    The ROK-Japan Organization for New Economic Cooperation will  comprehensively deal with various bilateral issues--including  economy, trade, measures to cope with a trade imbalance, and  cooperation in industrial technology--unlike its past way of  tackling bilateral economic issues by each field.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Central Asians pressed over aid and human rights THE US is stepping up its pressure on the central Asian republics for improvements in human rights, with a warning that aid will be tied to their records in this area. Mr Strobe Talbott, US ambassador-at-large with responsibility for the new states of the former Soviet Union, cut short a visit to Turkmenistan this week in protest at the imprisonment of four rights activists, and had a 'long and frank conversation' on rights in Uzbekistan. Mr Mike McCurry, state department spokesman, said the early departure was a 'strong diplomatic protest'. State Department officials denied that Mr Talbott had put off signing aid agreements with the two countries because of human rights abuses, but said that compliance with international human rights obligations would be 'a factor in our aid decisions'. US aid programmes amount to Dollars 73m (Pounds 47.4m) for Turkmenistan and to Dollars 17m for Uzbekistan. For the coming year, US aid to the former Soviet Union is under consideration in Congress, where some members have shown an inclination to shift funds away from Russia, the principal beneficiary so far, and towards the smaller republics. Congress has in the past placed conditions on the provision of aid to the region.</p>

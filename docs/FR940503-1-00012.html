			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 25, 1991, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 91&hyph;20&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8035 (56 FR 55230), to require a one-time ultrasonic and eddy current inspection of the high pressure compressor rotor (HPCR) stage 3&hyph;9 spool for cracks. That action was prompted by two reports of spools found cracked in service. That condition, if not corrected, could result in an uncontained HPCR stage 3&hyph;9 spool failure, which could result in damage to the aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received reports of five additional spools found cracked in service. Investigation indicates that the cracks initiated in sub-surface origins in the stage 9 bore region of the spool. These cracks form from metallurgical anomalies that result from reduced forging work associated with the sixteen inch billet material used in the manufacture of certain HPCR stage 3&hyph;9 spools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the investigation findings, and the higher than projected crack occurrence rates, the FAA has determined that the inspection schedule in the current AD should be accelerated, and a repetitive inspection requirement be implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;1000, Revision 2, dated September 9, 1993, and GE CF6&hyph;80A SB No. 72&hyph;583, Revision 4, dated September 15, 1993, which describe procedures for the ultrasonic and eddy current inspection of the HPCR stage 3&hyph;9 spool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 91&hyph;20&hyph;01, would retain the one-time ultrasonic and eddy current inspection of the HPCR stage 3&hyph;9 spool for cracks as required in the current AD, but would accelerate the inspection schedule, and introduce a repetitive ultrasonic and eddy current inspection requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 462 GE CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50/&hyph;80A series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 67 engines installed in aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 584 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $127,412 per engine. Based on these figures, and assuming that 3 of the inspected spools will require replacement, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,534,276.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

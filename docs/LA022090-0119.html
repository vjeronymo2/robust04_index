			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POINT COUNTERPOINT: PERSONAL HEALTH;  </P> <P> THE ABCS OF TAKING VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS  </P> <P> Popping a vitamin pill is as natural a habit as toothbrushing for legions of  Americans. By 1992, U.S. vitamin sales will reach nearly $6 billion, according  to marketing analysts, despite some softening of demand.  </P> <P> Skeptics say it's an unnecessary habit -- even potentially hazardous if taken  to extremes.  </P> <P> Proponents say regular intake of supplemental vitamins is especially vital,  since hectic life styles make it difficult to eat a balanced diet. They say  supplements can also help ward off colds and other ills.  </P> <P> The question's been debated for years, and there's still no consensus. Is  taking vitamins a waste of time and money? Here are two experts' views:  </P> <P> * YES: Dr. Fredrick Stare, professor of nutrition, Harvard School of Public  Health.  </P> <P> "Vitamins are a waste for the majority of Americans. Nobody in my family takes  them, nor do I know any colleagues who do. The average person has an adequate  diet. The focus should be on eating a variety of foods from what we call the  basic four food groups (milk products, meat/poultry, vegetables/fruits and  breads/cereals) and maintaining variety within the basic four."  </P> <P> Exercise can't hurt either, he says. "The trouble is, most people consume too  many calories in relation to their physical activity.  </P> <P> "You can live a long life without vitamins. The last time I took vitamins was  as a medical school student -- and then only because they were free samples."  </P> <P> * NO: Dr. Gershon M. Lesser, Los Angeles internist and preventive health  advocate.  </P> <P> "The average person, conscious of the need to reduce daily caloric intake for  weight maintenance and better health, is not likely to take in adequate levels  of needed vitamins and minerals on a daily basis. For example, a woman needs 18  milligrams of iron a day (although the current RDA specifies 15 milligrams). A  typical diet provides only about 6 milligrams per 1,000 calories, which means  an average woman must consume 3,000 calories a day, or twice the ideal. To  complicate matters, food has been aged, packaged, processed and bankrupted of  its nutritive value.  </P> <P> "Numerous studies have shown that appropriate doses of Vitamins A, C, D and E  protect against cancer, slow the aging process and heighten immune system  functioning, and that nearly 30% to 50% of us are deficient in one or more of  these vitamins at any given time. Vitamins aren't a substitute for good  nutrition. They are just good insurance."  </P></p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Last quark may have been found Physicists have found evidence of the existence of the top quark, the last of 12 subatomic building blocks believed to make up all of matter, the New York Times said yesterday, Reuter reports from New York. The newspaper said that, after nearly two decades of searching, an international team of 439 scientists at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, was due to announce its findings. If confirmed, the newspaper said, the discovery would be a big milestone for modern physics because it would complete the experimental proof of a theory known as the Standard Model, which defines the modern understanding of the atom and its structure. 'The exciting thing is that this is the final piece of matter as we know it, as predicted by cosmology and the Standard Model of particle physics,' Dr David Schramm, a theoretical physicist at the University of Chicago, was quoted as saying. 'It is the final piece of that puzzle.' If the top quark could not be found, the newspaper said, the Standard Model would collapse, forcing scientists to rethink three decades of work in which governments around the world had invested billions of dollars. Matter is made of atoms but, nearly a century ago, physicists discovered that atoms, long considered to be the smallest units of matter, were composed of smaller, subatomic particles such as protons and neutrons. These particles later showed signs of being made of smaller building blocks. The field was mired in confusion for many years until a unifying theory was developed by Dr Murray Gell-Mann, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology. He sought to explain the structure of subatomic particles in terms of new units he called quarks. He theorised that there were six different kinds of quarks and that the quark family was parallel to a six-member family of lighter particles known as leptons. Various combinations of these 12 particles are thought to make up all matter. Five of the six quarks were eventually found, but the sixth remained elusive for nearly two decades until the scientists at the Fermi laboratory found evidence of its existence.</p>

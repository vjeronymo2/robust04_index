			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / BBC regions to get 170 new jobs THE BBC yesterday announ-ced what it described as its largest ever single investment in regional journalism with the creation of 170 new posts at a cost of Pounds 5.5m a year. The announcement was made by Mr Ron Neil, managing director of regional broadcasting, on the eve of this year's Radio Academy Festival in Birmingham. Mr Neil said the money, part of a Pounds 40m package of investments in programmes across all radio and television this year, had been funded entirely from savings. The jobs, to be advertised internally and externally, are made up of: 41 new regional bi-media radio and television correspondents in areas such as health and education. 90 extra news producer posts deployed across the BBC's 39 local radio stations. A new researcher post on every local radio station to improve planning.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (3): Catering for leisure seekers - Societe des Bains de Mer is a Monegasque institution You could stay at the sumptuous Hotel de Paris and treat yourself to a three-star meal at the Louis XV restaurant. You might risk some chips at the Monte Carlo casino and stop for a cocktail on the terrace of the Cafe de Paris before dancing the rest of the night away at Le Jimmy'z night club. If you did all this you could spend a couple of days in Monaco - and a very pleasant few days at that - without ever leaving the properties owned by the Societe des Bains de Mer (SBM), the quaintly named leisure company which is by far the biggest single business in the principality. SBM is more than a business, it is a Monegasque institution. It is not only the largest commercial concern in Monaco (with sales of FFr1.75bn in its last audited financial year to March 30 1993) but is also the largest employer with a workforce of 2,600 in a country with a population of 30,000. Although SBM is a publicly-quoted company with shares listed on the Paris stock exchange, its ownership is dominated by the state. The Monaco government has owned 70 per cent of the group since 1966 when it bought all the shares amassed by Aristotle Onassis, the Greek shipping magnate who was one of the most profligate players at the Monte Carlo casino. Onassis had for years been buying up small stakes in SBM until eventually he had control and Prince Rainier decided the government should buy him out. Yet the relationship between SBM and the Monegasque state goes back far further than the mid-1960s. The company traces its roots to 1863 when Prince Charles III gave a 50-year licence to operate a casino in Monte Carlo to Francois Blanc, who had turned the Bavarian town of Bad Homburg into a glamorous gambling centre. Francois Blanc was charged with creating a casino and an hotel in Monte Carlo, which was then a delapidated olive grove on the hill opposite the royal palace. His company was christened, Societe Anonyme des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des Etrangers, or the sea bathing society and circle of strangers, as a euphemism to throw the French authorities off the scent in case they objected to Monaco's newfound zest for gambling. SBM has continued the practice of combining hotel ownership with casino operation. Its interests, which occupy a twelfth of the land in Monaco, include the Hermitage, Mirabeau and Monte Carlo Beach hotels, as well as the Hotel de Paris, together with the Opera, Sun Casino and the sporting, golf and country clubs. Raoul Biancheri, the present chairman, insists that the SBM will not deviate from its traditional role. 'Diversification isn't anything that we know about or are interested in,' he says. 'Our expertise lies in owning and operating casinos and hotels here in Monaco. That's what we're good at.' The company's cautious attitude towards expansion is possibly reinforced by the memory of its unsuccessful investment in Baudouin, a Paris stockbroker that collapsed in the late 1980s. Yet Mr Biancheri also rules out the less dramatic option of investing in hotels and casinos outside the principality. 'We're prohibited by our company statutes from becoming involved with gambling outside Monaco,' he says. 'It may be that a similar restriction applies to hotels. I don't know. But we're not a hotel and leisure company in the conventional sense. We really do have a very particular specialisation.' SBM has instead been investing heavily in its existing interests. It started to do so after a painful period in the mid-1980s when its profits fell, reflecting heavy losses at the casinos and low occupancy rates at the hotels which were then regarded as loss leaders for its gambling interests. The group embarked on an upgrading programme, beginning by luring Alain Ducasse, one of France's young superstar chefs, to the Hotel de Paris where he has since won three Michelin stars for the Louis XV restaurant. It has just completed a three-year investment scheme that included refurbishing the Hotel de Paris and the Hermitage, rebuilding most of the Monte-Carlo Beach Hotel and opening a new gaming room on the ground floor of the Cafe de Paris. SBM is now building a FFr100m new thalassotherapy centre, due to open next June. It is also considering plans for a brand new luxury hotel on the Larvotto peninsula, which would have 300 rooms and, possibly, a small casino in a project costing between FFr600m and FFr700m. Despite these investments SBM has not emerged unscathed from the economic recession of the past few years, although Mr Biancheri is convinced that the group would have fared even worse without them. SBM reported a fall in net profits to FFr171m for the year to March 30 from FFr229m in the previous year. Its audited accounts for the 1993/94 financial year are not yet available. However, Mr Biancheri confirmed that hotel occupancy fell slightly during the year as did gambling receipts. One consolation is that the occupancy rate at the SBM hotels is still higher than those of other Monaco establishments at around 54 per cent against 48 per cent. Similarly, its occupancy levels have not fallen as far during the recession, which would appear to endorse its strategy of upgrading its interests to stay at the top of the market. Moreover, Mr Biancheri says that business has picked up since the start of 1994 as the economic strains have eased. 'There's definitely been an improvement in trading since the start of this year,' he says. 'Hopefully we'll soon return to our normal level of activity. We also ought to reap the rewards of our recent investments. We've sewn the seeds. Let's see how they grow.'</p>

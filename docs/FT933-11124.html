			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report ALUMINIUM prices lost earlier gains yesterday afternoon as lingering concern over production at the former Soviet Union's Sayansk smelter faded. The market settled back into its previous restricted range with final London Metal Exchange business at an unchanged Dollars 1,219 a tonne for three months delivery. The TIN market seemed to be heading for a test of recent 20-year lows as the three months position closed Dollars 17.50 down at Dollars 4,917.50 a tonne. NICKEL prices consolidated in the afternoon, having earlier run into some overhead selling at Dollars 5,050 a tonne for the three months position. But dealers thought the technical recovery might yet run further towards the Dollars 5,200-a-tonne level. At the London bullion market GOLD and SILVER prices ended little changed but the PLATINUM price firmed another Dollars 2.65 to Dollars 409.25 a troy ounce. Traders attributed the continued rise in platinum group metal prices to follow-through from Wednesday's strong performance, during which October platinum futures in the New York market forged through various resistance levels ranging from Dollars 411.00 to Dollars 415.00 an ounce.

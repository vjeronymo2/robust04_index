			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysia plans big cocoa export drive MALAYSIA, the world's fourth biggest cocoa producer after the Ivory coast, Brazil and Ghana, plans a sales drive in China in an effort to diversify export markets and improve prices. Mr Lim Keng Yaik, the Malaysian primary industries minister, will lead a trade team to China in April. Last year China imported more than 40,000 tonnes of Malaysian cocoa, compared with 6,000 tonnes in 1989. According to Malaysian statistics, 70 per cent of China's cocoa imports come from Malaysia. The Malaysian Cocoa Board says the country produced 184,000 tonnes of cocoa last year, down from 230,000 tonnes in 1991. Cocoa prices stand at about MDollars 2,100 (USDollars 840) a tonne, up from MDollars 1,800 last August but down from MDollars 2,900 a year ago.</p>

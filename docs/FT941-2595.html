			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Markets: If only he'd gone to Dallas - London For some in British business, this was a week for moving on. Shareholders of British Aerospace met on Tuesday to vote on the sale of Rover to BMW. Some protested outside the meeting with a 23-year-old Land Rover and a 'Sale of Rover: Industrial Dunkirk' banner. Others protested with equal passion inside, voting 111 to 42 against the sale. But the proxies, mostly from institutions, swung it for a final count of 119.6m for the sale and 2.9m against. Of the board members who took the flak from shareholders, John Cahill, chairman, is retiring to Florida with Pounds 3.5m remuneration and George Simpson, Rover's chairman, is off to be chief executive of Lucas Industries in Solihull. If only Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, had gone to Dallas yesterday as planned, markets in the US and abroad could have ended the week on a quieter note and faced next week with less trepidation. The last time he cancelled a speech there to attend to pressing business in Washington was Black Monday, October 19 1987. His summons to the White House yesterday sent rumours coursing through global markets. Was President Bill Clinton trying to dissuade the Fed from raising interest rates? Or was the Fed trying to prepare the politicians for a big rate increase? The answer will not be known until after next week's meeting of the Fed's policy-making open markets committee. But the prospect of tighter US monetary policy, following reports this week of very strong US economic growth but subdued price pressures, knocked markets in London more than in New York. All week in London, gilts performed worse than bonds abroad, ending down about 1.5 points on the week. The main domestic economic news that harmed gilts was an unexpected pick up in the growth rate of average earnings in January, a factor that could delay UK interest rate cuts. For the first time in many weeks, however, equities managed to hold their own against a falling bond market. In spite of being badly unsettled yesterday by Greenspan and the expiration of derivatives contracts, the FT-SE 100 index finished the week up a net 26.2 points at 3,218.1 The other key UK economic statistic of the week was the 0.5 per cent fall in retail sales in February. This weakness could be taken, however, as a positive and rational action by consumers ahead of April's tax increases. Rather than suddenly curb their spending when their pay packets shrink, they are already adjusting their budgets, argue David Walton and Martin Brookes, economists at Goldman Sachs. Moreover, many people appear to be over-estimating the impact of the tax increases. Once they realise the true hit is smaller, they will feel more inclined to spend. As the chart shows, Goldman Sachs is forecasting that retail sales volume has been shrinking before the tax cut but will recover quickly afterwards. Concern over spending has dragged down the retailers sector in the FT-SE-A All-Share index. The improvement in finances of those people in work and with a mortgage will continue, the economists believe. They are forecasting 3 per cent real annual growth in post-tax, post-mortgage income in the four years 1991-94. Thus consumer spending will rise by about 2.5 per cent this year, the same rate as last year. Partly because of this strength in consumer spending, the main driver to the current recovery, GDP will rise 3 per cent this year and next. It remains to be seen whether the government and the Bank of England are as convinced as Goldman Sachs about the durability of consumer spending and economic growth. If they are, they might refrain from cutting interest rates soon. Rising demand was a theme running through many results results reported this week, most notably in the construction and building material sectors. Wimpey doubled its trading profits last year to Pounds 41m thanks in part to building 25 per cent more houses than a year before. The general construction sector's recovery is accelerating. Orders rose 30 per cent in the three months to the end of January from the same period a year earlier, to the best level since 1989. In the materials sector, Wolseley, Travis Perkins, Heywood Williams and Marley all reported this week sharp upturns in operating profits although some of them were hit by restructuring costs. For others, notably Wolseley, a little pick up in demand is going a long way. 'If you have a formula that seems to work, then it seems advisable to press on,' said Jeremy Lancaster, its chairman. By his standards that was a vague and subdued comment but he said he felt constrained by the Stock Exchange's new rules on disclosure. Restructuring - underway and complete - was a theme among other results in the busiest reporting week so far this season. United Biscuits faces the biggest task, taking a Pounds 121m charge mostly to sort out its Keebler subsidiary in the US. This left pre-tax profits down 28 per cent at Pounds 116.7m and the dividend unchanged at 15.3p. On a more modest scale, Simon Engineering reported a Pounds 160m loss for the year and said it would launch a Pounds 50m rights issue once it had renegotiated its bank debt. Sometimes, though, surgery alone fails to restore financial health. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi is now a lean global advertising group, reporting a return to pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.2m. But flat revenues indicate it is having difficulty winning new clients. In an business where up-beat morale is a crucial ingredient, one drag on performance appears to be tensions between some senior management and Maurice Saatchi, the chairman. He appears to have adapted less well than his colleagues to the Spartan regime.</p>

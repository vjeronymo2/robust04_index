			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 16 May -- The leaders of the defense  departments of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh should  issue an order today to cease-fire starting midnight 16-17 May.  An accord on this was reached in Moscow today during the talks  between the defense departments of the three sides, with the  mediation of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.    Questions of the first stage of settling the  Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict with a cease-fire and separating  the sides within the framework of the protocol that was signed  on 18 February this year were discussed.    Under the accords that will be signed by the leaders of the  military departments tomorrow, the lines of contact from which  the troops will be withdrawn beginning 25 May -- to a distance  of five to 10 kilometers, depending on the local conditions --  will be set. It is intended to create and set up by 24 May 49  observation posts along the demarcation line. Russian officers  will command the posts, but their companies will comprise  representatives of the sides, possibly of the CIS states, and  the CSCE. It is proposed that special peacekeeping forces of  Russia or the CIS states numbering around 1,800 should be set up  to guarantee the safety of the posts.    Moreover, a reserve of forces and weapons on the scale of  one  motorized rifle battalion will be set up.    It has been provisionally agreed that the peacekeeping will  be funded equally by Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh.    The parties agreed that the protocol on today's meeting  would  stipulate the commencement of the second stage -- elimination of  the consequences of the conflict, withdrawal from Azerbaijani  territory, and return of refugees -- immediately after the first  stage. The question of Nagorno-Karabakh's status will then be  decided at a political level.    General supervision of the peacekeeping has been entrusted  to  Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy minister of  defense. Plans for this peacekeeping operation are to be drawn  up by 19 May for approval by the Russian president and agreement  with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan.    For the first time, the talks were held with the press  present. The military delegations of the participants in the  talks were headed by Azerbaijani Defense Minister Mammadrafi  Mammadov, Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan, and Samvel  Babayan, the commander of the Nagorno-Karabakh self-defense  army. The Armenian and Azerbaijani ambassadors and Russian  Ambassador-at-Large Vladimir Kazimirov also took part.</p>

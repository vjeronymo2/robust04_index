			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASSISTANCE NEEDED IN FIGHTING GANGS  </P> <P> I am appalled! On the same day you were glamorizing gangs with three color  photos of a male model in "street savvy" clothes in front of a graffiti-covered  wall on the front page of the View section, more than 500 educators, parents,  law enforcement and judicial authorities and interested citizens were trying to  learn more about preventive and interventive measures with gangs at the Gang  Symposium in Downey, sponsored by the Los Angeles County Education Department,  Downey Unified Schools and the city.  </P> <P> Furthermore, I searched your paper for a report about the symposium and found  none.  </P> <P> In that same issue in the Orange County section there was a report of gang  sweeps by Santa Ana police that stated the gang population in Los Angeles  County as 71,000 and the number of gangs as over 700, but we were informed that  the members number 100,000 and the gangs, over 800.  </P> <P> Gangs are a symptom of alienated, turned-off, disenfranchised youth, and the  results of children being involved in them include canceled lives, terrorized  generations of families and many times, death. We need to educate citizens on  how to prevent gang participation and not use any type of media, subliminal or  overt, to entice them to join a life of destruction. Entire communities need to  get involved -- parents, teachers, counselors, law enforcement and judicial  people, businesses, service clubs, churches and government. And we need all the  help you can give us.  </P> <P> ESTHER I. HARRIS,  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

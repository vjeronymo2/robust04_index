			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Repaid loan notes boost Norex NOREX, the financial services group, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 31.6m in the year to June 30, against restated losses of Pounds 991,000, thanks to a Pounds 23.8m contribution from the redemption of secured loan notes. Global Marine repaid the loan notes held by Norex America (NXA), in which Norex has a 48 per cent stake, for a total of Dollars 99m gross, of which Pounds 23.8m fell in the year. Mr Kristian Siem, the Norwegian entrepreneur who is managing director of Norex and chairman of NXA, said that Dollars 29m of the Dollars 99m was used to repay bank loans. New debt has been acquired in NXA and in April Dollars 111.4m was supplied to Zapata Corporation of Houston, a provider of services to the oil and gas industries, through a cash loan and share purchase. Apart from the 48 per cent holding in NXA, which is involved in offshore rig investments, Norex owns Horncastle Executive Travel, based in Newcastle, and a 2 to 3 per cent stake in Lowndes Lambert, acquired when it sold Norex Insurance Brokers and Norex Financial Planning to the insurance broker for Pounds 8m gross. Mr Siem said that over five years shareholders' equity had increased 15 times, from Dollars 5m to Dollars 80m. This was the aim of the company, he said. 'It is asset appreciation-led, not specially concerned with income.' In spite of the need to preserve capital, it is proposing to pay a maintained 2p dividend. Earnings per share were 166.6p (losses 18.5p).</p>

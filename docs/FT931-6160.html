			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK business welcomes India's budget boost for trade 'IT IS one thing for the Indian government to talk about trade liberalisation and opening up its markets to foreign competition. Let's hope their customs officers get the same message.' This note of scepticism, in response to last weekend's budget package from Mr Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, came yesterday from the chief executive of a Yorkshire-based textile company with years of experience of trying to sell in India. The businessman, anxious not to offend, said experience showed central government initiatives did not necessarily have much relevance to those trying to win business on the ground in India. 'Unless the message that the rules are changing permeates right down through India's bureaucracy, no budget initiatives intended to boost trade will be any use,' he suggested. Despite such reservations, India's decision to go for an expansionary budget has been well received in the UK. Plenty of business is at stake. Mr Howard Davies, Confederation of British Industry director-general, who went with Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and a business delegation to India in January, called the budget measures 'encouraging'. Although import duty cuts seemed modest, and no action had been taken to reduce dividend withholding taxes (higher than in other countries), the budget made clear New Delhi's determination to encourage more overseas investment. Figures compiled by the Department of Trade and Industry show Britain sold Pounds 945.5m-worth of goods to India in 1992, including industrial machinery, power generating equipment, organic chemicals, metals, scientific instruments and transport equipment. In return, India exported to the UK products worth Pounds 862m during 1992, including yarns, textiles, finished clothing, footwear, tea, cocoa and animal feedstuffs. Expectations are high that trade in both directions can expand significantly. The January visit led to the Indo-British Partnership Initiative, intended to foster political and business links between the two countries. Mr Robert Evans, British Gas chairman, who is leading the new organisation, welcomed the budget. The measures would advance the considerable potential for trade with India and provide a 'kick start' to the initiative, he declared. British Gas is anxious to expand business in India. The company has just overcome competition from Europe and Asia to win exclusive rights from the Gas Authority of India to set up a Pounds 35m natural gas supply system in Bombay. A spokesman said India's consolidation of liberalisation reforms should further help business prospects. The power generation sector also welcomed the budget measures. Mr Graham Hadley, a director of National Power, said he was encouraged by the specific budget references to the power industry, which reflected the government's acknowledgment of that sector's role in India's economic development. He took a 'bullish' view of the proposals. 'The package offers further evidence the Indian government takes seriously the need to change the rules to attract inward investment, particularly for capital-intensive and infrastructure projects.' Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate which already has extensive food, tea and personal product businesses in India, said the budget offered 'very positive vibes' for future business. The government was 'clearly on the road' to further liberalisation and encouragement of trade growth. Companies such as GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group which has recently won a deal for a Pounds 140m high-voltage converter station to link regions of India's electricity system, are also keen to develop new markets there, and will welcome measures intended to make access easier.</p>

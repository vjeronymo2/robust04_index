			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Observer: Parting walls Compact, rich and handsome Stephen Walls, just gone down the gangplank from the good ship Arjo Wiggins Appleton, looks to be becoming a bit of a corporate flibbertigibbet - which, as any international executive knows, can damage even the best-managed reputations. No one can quibble about his 13-year apprenticeship at Chesebrough-Ponds in the US. He's also said to have done well while briefly running Plessey before GEC interrupted. But having helped to demerge Wiggins Teape Appleton from BAT and then meld it with Arjo-Prioux, 44-year-old Walls is again collecting his P45 and presumably another golden handshake. His French shareholders were not prepared to back a young man in a hurry. Were it not for the earlier resignation from the AWA board of Henry Wendt, SmithKline Beecham's respected chairman, Walls's reputation must surely have suffered more than it has from the latest boardroom bust-up. And even as things are, it's hard to judge his success as a near Pounds 400,000 a year boss; he has never stayed in one job long enough to be tested. Come to think of it, if only he were a bit younger, he'd probably make a better merchant banker.</p>

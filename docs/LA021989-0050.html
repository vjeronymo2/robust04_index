			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LAUGHING MATTER;  </P> <P> UCLA EXTENSION OFFERS COURSES ON WAYS OF FINDING AND USING HUMOR TO EASE  STRESS, COPE WITH ILLNESS  </P> <P> The students in the lecture hall at UCLA's Franz Hall were asked to pair off  and face each other. With their eyes closed and holding hands, they were told  to think about someone who causes them a lot of stress.  </P> <P> As some students' hands began to sweat and others tensed, they were instructed  to picture themselves walking up to that person.  </P> <P> "Get as close to that person as you can without touching them," the instructor  said. He paused a moment. "And now, on the count of two, drop a cream pie down  their shorts."  </P> <P> As the students broke out in laughter, their sweaty palms dried, their grips  relaxed and nervousness disappeared. Instructor Bob Basso explained that the  point of the exercise was to show that there is a correlation between a  person's physical and mental state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Laughter Over Stress  </P> <P> "Your thinking can change bodily functions," Basso said. "If you are laughing,  you cannot be stressed out."  </P> <P> How to find and use humor in everyday life is the focus of this UCLA Extension  course, which is the first class in a new sequential curriculum for  professional training in the art, craft and therapy of comedy.  </P> <P> The introductory class, called Funny Bone, is an eight-week course that costs  $195 and meets Tuesday nights from 7 to 10 p.m. through March 14.  </P> <P> Two other courses, Performing Stand-Up Comedy ($350) and Improvisational Comedy  Workshop ($350), are also offered. Additional courses are being developed and  will be offered this fall.  </P> <P> UCLA Extension is the continuing education arm of the university. It receives  no state tax money and is supported by student enrollment fees.  </P> <P> A university curriculum in comedy may be unusual, but Basso said it may be the  way of the future as more people turn to comedy for relief.  </P> <P> "UCLA Extension has always been on the cutting edge of every new trend," he  said.  </P> <P> Comedian Steve Allen, a recent guest speaker in the class, said that in a  magazine article he wrote in the 1950s, he observed that there were about 50  American comedians in show business. Today, he said, there are about 2,000.  </P> <P> "The reason for that particular mushroom growth in the professionally funny  population is that this is the first generation in history that has been  brainwashed with comedy literally from the cradle," Allen said. "In the old  days, 50 years ago, you could hear Jack Benny on the radio or see Bob Hope in a  funny movie.  </P> <P> "But it wasn't morning, noon and night. Now, there's comedy available as soon  as you get up in the morning and turn on the set. You can watch (Jackie)  Gleason reruns all day or Lucy (Lucille Ball), or whatever . . . you want.  There's cable, there's concerts, there's movies, and the young people want to  get into that.  </P> <P> "Humor is by no means something trivial. Did you ever notice how much they pay  comedians? Much more than presidents and Nobel Peace Prize winners. It's a  marketable skill and a very rare one."  </P> <P> Initially, Basso thought most of his students would be people pursuing careers  in comedy. But he found that about 90% of his class are people simply looking  to incorporate humor into their lives.  </P> <P> "Our society has never been more stressed out, more confused than now," said  Basso, an actor and comic who formed Laughter Therapy and Light Management, a  consultant service designed to help business managers lighten their management  style. "All these comedy clubs are not popping up for nothing.  </P> <P> "Today we have more comedy that is self-effacing. People are talking about  personal matters. We are making fun of it because if we take it seriously,  we'll go crazy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Therapeutic Effect  </P> <P> The therapeutic effect of comedy can also be used in treating physical  illnesses, Basso said.  </P> <P> At a recent session of Funny Bone, guest speakers included comedians Allen, Sid  Caesar and Bill Dana, who have all spoken and written books on humor and  health.  </P> <P> "There is an overlapping between what might seem purely mental factors on the  one hand and purely physical on the other," Allen said.  </P> <P> Two other guest speakers that night were Dr. Malin Dollinger, an oncologist who  believes in the therapeutic uses of humor, and Dr. Harold Benjamin, who heads a  support group for cancer patients called the Wellness Community in Santa  Monica.  </P> <P> Dollinger said he rarely tells jokes but that often patients do need a release  from the anxiety of their illnesses. He related a situation in which humor was  needed:  </P> <P> "This woman with cancer came into my office and was very upset because she  dropped her cancer medication into a trash compactor. This was a life or death  situation in her mind. She didn't realize that she could just get more pills.  </P> <P> "I very quickly assessed that I needed to say something to break the anxiety. I  told her I had bad news and good news. The bad news is that you've lost your  pills and now you'll have to get new ones. The good news is your trash  compactor will never get cancer."  </P> <P> Benjamin said there is probably more laughter in his Wellness Community than in  "most places you know."  </P> <P> "Laughter is simply a catch-all phrase for pleasant emotions," he said. "To  evoke a pleasant, relaxation state enhances physical well being."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Therapeutic Effects  </P> <P> Laura Owens, who had two successful operations for breast cancer, said: "The  laughter makes you feel better and relaxed. It counteracts the unpleasantness."  </P> <P> Another cancer patient, Mary Ann Simon, who lost a breast to cancer, said humor  has helped her deal with her situation. "I really find that it energizes me,"  she said.  </P> <P> Simon is enrolled in both the Funny Bone and stand-up comedy classes at UCLA  Extension. "I want to laugh," she said.  </P> <P> But humor is not only therapeutic for people with physical ailments. Some  students in Basso's class said they just want more humor in their lives.  </P> <P> "I wanted at least one night of humor in my life, and it has been more than I  expected," said Beverly Lewis of West Los Angeles, a bank trust officer.  </P> <P> "Banks are very unfunny places," Lewis said.  </P> <P> "I don't think I would be a comedian, but I really hope I can put the humor in  my everyday life," said Irene Bosco of Van Nuys, who is in real estate.  </P> <P> Lila Alexander of Los Angeles said simply: "I want to laugh a lot."  </P> <P> Basso said he doesn't care why people want to laugh, only that they do want to  laugh and that they start by learning to laugh at themselves.  </P> <P> "There is only one therapeutic use of humor," he said. "If you can't learn to  make fun of yourself, you will never have any true, consistent practical humor  skills. You reduce the threat of everyone else when you make fun of yourself."  </P> <P> And to make his point, he had his students stand up, touch the tip of their  noses with their right hand, with their left hand grab the earlobe of the  person to their left, and in a loud voice repeat:  </P> <P> "I will stop taking myself so seriously. I will make fun of myself. I will find  humor in any situation. I will never move an Indian holy man unless absolutely  necessary for my mental state."  </P></p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Imro probes adviser's role in alleged fraud Imro, the self-regulating body for fund managers, is investigating advice given by AP Black, a UK investment adviser, in relation to the provision of funds to a company in the Bahamas suspected of involvement in an alleged currency options fraud. US and UK investigators say the alleged fraud may have resulted in a loss of more than Dollars 90m (Pounds 60m) to investors worldwide. The investigation, involving agencies including the FBI and Britain's Serious Fraud Office, is focused on the activities of Mr William C. Dunn, a US-based commodities broker; his company Delta Consultants based in New Jersey; Delta Options, an unregulated investment company incorporated in the Bahamas; and Nopkine, a company based in the British Virgin Islands. Imro has told AP Black to cease trading as a precautionary protection for investors. It is examining whether directors of AP Black may have breached rules governing advice to customers. It is Imro's policy not to comment on any case until, and only if, it results in disciplinary action. In a letter to AP Black's lawyers last week, the SFO made clear that it was not contemplating any proceedings against any employee or director of AP Black. The SFO is continuing its investigation into the affairs of Mr Dunn in conjunction with the US authorities. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has alleged in a New York court that Delta, Mr Dunn, and the two offshore companies made 'false, deceptive, and misleading representations of material facts in connection with soliciting funds from customers and prospective customers'. The commission alleges that in July 1993 Mr Dunn, acting in his capacity as president of Delta Consultants, claimed to be managing Dollars 180m in customer funds invested in Delta Options. It is further alleged that in October and November 1993, Mr Dunn issued statements reassuring customers after they had expressed concern. According to the commission's complaint, notwithstanding these statements, customers of Delta Options have not been repaid in full and have not received profits. On November 26 1993, Mr Dunn and Delta Consultants told Delta Options that its customers had suffered losses of Dollars 95m. AP Black acted as a soliciting broker for the funds which were deposited in the name of Delta Options and traded through the New York branches of several European banks, believed to include Credit Lyonnais and Swiss Bank Corporation.</p>

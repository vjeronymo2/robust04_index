			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARTER HAWLEY HALE'S LOSS IS LARGER THAN FORECAST  </P> <P> Carter Hawley Hale Stores, hurt by flat sales at its department stores, on  Thursday posted a bigger-than-expected loss of $6.6 million for the third  quarter.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles company, parent of the Broadway and other retail chains, lost  $3.2 million during the same quarter a year earlier.  </P> <P> Its stock fell 12.5 cents on the news, closing at a 52-week low of $5 on the  New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Carter Hawley has been losing money in every quarter except the one that  includes the Christmas shopping season -- largely a result of the debt it took  on three years ago to thwart a takeover attempt. Along with hefty interest  expenses, it was hurt in the quarter ended April 29 by weak revenue.  </P> <P> Sales totaled $590.9 million, up 0.8% from a year earlier. Among stores open  for all of the past year, the increase in sales was just 0.3%.  </P> <P> The company attributed its sales performance partly to its decision to hold  down expenses instead of taking part in the rampant price-cutting that many  retailers are engaging in.  </P> <P> N. Richard Nelson, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago, said the  quarterly report prompted him to lower his 1990 earnings estimate for Carter  Hawley to around $9.1 million from $10.4 million. Still, he said, Carter Hawley  is in better shape than some of its debt-heavy competitors.  </P> <P> For the first nine months of the fiscal year, the company lost $480,000 on  sales that climbed 4.6% to $2.23 billion. The year-to-date results were hurt by  a charge of $10.5 million taken to cover expenses from the October earthquake  in the Bay Area.  </P></p>

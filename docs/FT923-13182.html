			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Enlarged Pelican improves to Pounds 0.45m The Pelican Group, a USM-quoted restaurant operator, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 453,000 for the year to March 31, against Pounds 446,000 which included Pounds 168,000 of property profits. Turnover improved from Pounds 4.72m to Pounds 6.32m. During the period the expansion programme continued and the group now has 17 restaurants and has recently acquired two further sites. Earnings per share fell from 7.5p to 3p reflecting last year's rights issue and shares issued for an acquisition in January 1991. The company is proposing to maintain its single dividend at 1p. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 204,000 (Pounds 92,000), mainly relating to the costs of the rights issue, left retained profits for the year down at Pounds 56,000 (Pounds 258,000).</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhu Baoxia: "Who: Intensify AIDS Efforts Now To </F> Stem Tide"]    [Text] The Chinese Government has been urged to take  further steps immediately to slow down the nationwide spread of  AIDS.    Michael H. Merson, WHO's executive director for the global  program on AIDS, suggested that the Chinese central government  should focus on preventing the sexual transmission of HIV, the  virus that causes AIDS.    Efforts should include expanded educational programs,  increased use of condoms, and the treatment of sexually  transmitted diseases.    And AIDS control work must not be confined to Yunnan  Province, where reported cases make up about 80 per cent of the  country's total.    Education and publicity campaigns should be carried out  regularly in all other parts of the country, especially in the  economic development zones and the coastal regions that have  experienced a sharp rise in transient populations, he suggested.    Merson is in Beijing to help the government work out  feasible  policies to combat AIDS.    He discussed the worldwide and Chinese AIDS situations with  State Councillor Peng Peiyun and officials from the Ministry of  Public Health.    He warned that, like other Asian countries, China faces the  possibility of a serious HIV and AIDS epidemic. Compared with  the size of the country's population of 1.1 billion, the number  of reported HIV infections and cases of AIDS is relatively low,  he said, but there is no reason for complacency.    Experience has shown that the actual number of infections  and  cases of AIDS is usually greater than the number of reported  cases, and the risk factors fueling this pandemic elsewhere in  the region also exist in China.    So far, some 1,159 HIV infections and AIDS cases have been  reported on the Chinese mainland. However, the actual figure  could be much higher because of limited surveillance work.    Experts warn that unless quick steps are taken now, the  number of cases will grow rapidly in the next six years.    However, the trend can still be slowed through extensive  AIDS-prevention publicity and education.  plays an effective role in preventing the spread of AIDS.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA GROWS CIRCUMSPECT AT MANY COUNTY FIRMS  </P> <P> Orange County companies plan to hang out the stockings for their employees  again this holiday season, but they may not be filling them as full as in years  past.  </P> <P> "We're watching what we're spending," said Paul Hitzelberger, marketing vice  president at Costa Mesa-based Del Taco Inc. The company plans more holiday  events, he said, "but not as high-ticket."  </P> <P> The attitude is in line with a national survey released Tuesday that said many  companies still plan parties, gifts and bonuses for their employees during the  holidays. But the scale of the celebration will be smaller, in reaction to the  ailing economy. The survey, conducted by the Alexandria, Va.-based National  Institute of Business Management, polled several hundred small to mid-size  companies.  </P> <P> Few plan to hand out pink slips during the festive season, the national survey  said, but those who have to make staff cuts will be breaking the bad news after  the new year.  </P> <P> Among the findings is that fewer companies will be tossing holiday galas for  their employees -- 72% this year, compared to 86% last year.  </P> <P> Del Taco, operator of a Mexican-style fast-food chain, traditionally puts on an  evening holiday banquet at a local hotel, Hitzelberger said. But this year  employees will share in smaller, weekly events that will include writing  letters to troops overseas and collecting items for Toys for Tots. And they  will sit down to a catered lunch in their offices just before Christmas.  </P> <P> On the bright side, the survey found that 65% of the firms plan to give their  employees more time off during the holidays. Since Christmas and New Year's Day  are on Tuesdays, many employers will observe Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve  as full or half-day holidays.  </P> <P> Jim Lofstrom, a spokesman for Allergan Pharmaceuticals in Irvine, said the  company is encouraging its more than 2,000 local employees to take their  vacations between Christmas and New Year's Day.  </P> <P> "It reduces vacation accrual and helps us meet our 1990 profit objectives,"  Lofstrom said.  </P> <P> In the national study, 52% of the firms surveyed said they will award year-end  bonuses, which will average $400. Last year, 66% awarded about the same amount.  The survey said 42% plan to give gifts to their employees, down from 53% in  1989.  </P> <P> Wayne Wright, owner of Incentive Associates Inc. of Laguna Hills, said some  companies are still offering their employees free trips as holiday rewards for  good work, but the destinations may be closer to home. "Instead of looking at  Paris, they may be looking at Hawaii," he said.  </P> <P> The national survey also showed a trend away from serving hard drinks at  company-sponsored parties, because of safety and liability concerns. This year,  51% say beer, wine and liquor will be served, down from 63% last year.  </P> <P> John Moffa, general manager of the Airporter Inn Hotel in Irvine, said liquor  is still being served at company parties this holiday season, but fewer bosses  are picking up the tab.  </P> <P> "There are not as many host bars; it's more on a cash basis, so (companies) are  saving a little money there."  </P> <P> Reuters contributed to this report.  </P></p>

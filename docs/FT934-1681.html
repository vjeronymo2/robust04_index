			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Observer: England's own goal So you thought Graham Taylor was to blame for failing to get the England football team into next year's World Cup. Wrong. The reason is much more simple - it's all the fault of the free market. At least that's the verdict of the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. Perhaps in an effort to improve its credibility among its supporters on the terraces, it has produced a report on the decline of the national game. Too-high ticket prices, fixture schedules dictated by TV companies, the decline of the small clubs are all the inevitable product of a system that leaves clubs, players and television fighting their own corner, says the think-tank. 'Free market policies have ruined our national economy. Now they threaten our national game,' argue Dan Corry and Paul Williamson. What the game needs is a 'dose of national planning'. Sounds familiar.</p>

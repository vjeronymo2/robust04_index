			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURDER RATE  </P> <P> You have made an error. You said the murder rate has risen by several percent  (Part B, Aug.2).  </P> <P> This cannot be true. We voted California Chief Justice Rose Bird and the  liberals out. We have the death penalty now. Therefore, there must actually be  a decrease in the murder rate.  </P> <P> LARRY JONES  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

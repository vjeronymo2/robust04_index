			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, 8 Jun (KUNA) -- Military officials in South  Yemen announced today that the northern forces have continued  their bombardment of Aden airport while the main oil refinery in  Aden is still on fire for the third successive day.    These officials told KUNA that a number of  surface-to-surface  missiles landed on Aden airport at dawn today. The airport has  for the last several days been under indiscriminate bombardment  in a move to prevent military aircraft from flying from it.  However, they did not report any casualties.    The Yemeni news agency in Aden has quoted security sources  as  having said that the village of Dar Sa'd, which lies 15 km from  the capital, was subjected last night to an indiscriminate  bombardment by the artillery of the northern forces which left  18 people killed and no less than 23 wounded. The agency said  the southern forces responded fiercely to silence the source of  the fire while resisting to check the advance of these forces  which seek to tighten the noose on the city from different  directions.    On the other hand the capital Aden was still suffering from  shortages of drinking water and foodstuffs, the prices of which  have skyrocketed dramatically, according to some Yemenis. Yemeni  citizens interviewed by KUNA said that the price of a kilogram  [kg] of potatoes has risen by five times its price before the  outbreak of fighting between the north and the south, with one  kg reaching 50 Yemeni riyals in the last two days. (One dollar  is the equivalent of 12 riyals at the official exchange rate)    An official in the government disclosed in Aden that former  Algerian Foreign Minister Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the envoy of the UN  secretary general, will meet with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the  secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, tomorrow or the  day after at the latest in Mukallah. Ibrahimi is due to arrive  in Sanaa today from Cairo at the start of a new mission to halt  the fighting which has been going on in Yemen since 4 May.  Ibrahimi's mission as the UN envoy begins in accordance with  Security Council Resolution 924, which calls for an immediate  cease-fire.</p>

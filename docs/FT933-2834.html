			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Italy increases 30-year tranche of global issue to meet demand OVERWHELMING demand for long-dated paper enabled the Republic of Italy to increase its first global bond offering by Dollars 500m to Dollars 5.5bn yesterday. As a result of this deal, which sets a record for a global bond offering, Goldman Sachs heads the Eurobond league table for the first time, according to IFR Securities Data, pushing Deutsche Bank, the long-time holder of this position, into second place. Joint lead managers Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers said the decision to increase the 30-year tranche to Dollars 3.5bn from Dollars 3bn was taken to satisfy demand from US investors who were buying Italian government bonds for the first time. The 10-year tranche remained unchanged at Dollars 2bn. Commenting on the bond issue, Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's treasury minister, said: 'Issuing a 30-year global bond shows the Treasury has the confidence that investors fully appreciate the government's work in improving public-sector finances and rigorously fighting inflation; two fundamental steps for Italy's economic recovery and for improving its long-term growth prospects.' He added that yesterday's issue was part of a strategy to renew Italy's presence in the international markets, extend the maturities of Italian public debt and confirm the intention to create a mix of domestic and international borrowings. 'The deal will also help to make Italian paper more liquid and contribute to the creation of new benchmarks for investors,' Mr Barucci said. Just over one-third of the bonds were placed with US investors, a larger proportion than expected. The remainder were sold to investors in Europe and east Asia. The lead managers said strong demand enabled Italy to achieve the lowest end of the indicated price range. The 30-year tranche will be priced to yield 80 basis points over the 7 1/8 per cent US Treasury due 2023, and the 10-year to yield 62 basis points over the 5 3/4 per cent Treasury due 2003. The success of the deal was mainly due to the shortage of 30-year paper in the US, brought about by the US Treasury's decision to issue fewer 30-year bonds. The pricing of Italy's offering was also widely perceived to be generous, which syndicate managers attributed to Italy's desire for a successful deal. However, the lead managers said the yield differential between the two tranches was narrower than that currently on the World Bank's 10-year and 30-year global bonds. Elsewhere, weakness in the French government bond market and tight pricing hampered the launch of the European Investment Bank's FFr2bn offering of 11-year Eurobonds. The bonds were priced to yield just eight basis points above the French government's 8 1/4 per cent OAT due 2004.</p>

Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai addressed the conference.    This year the customs sector was assigned by the state to  collect 8,500 billion dong in import-export taxes. At the  conference, the officials discussed various measures to  implement state regulations and orders on renovating economic  thinking in line with the party's open door policy; initiating  and submitting to the government new regulations and policies  that respond to the needs of the new situation; reforming  supervision mechanisms to ensure convenience for local residents  and foreign guests in traveling in and out of the country;  maintaining a smooth flow of trade; and suppressing smuggling  and tax evasion.    The sector will strive to fight corruption, and expel and  bring to trial those degenerate cadres and officials. The  customs offices will also pay more attention in improving  statistical work, upgrading facilities so that they can help the  government with effective macroeconomic management.</p>

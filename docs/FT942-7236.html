			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Reuters to broadcast news to Londoners Reuters, the international financial information and news group, plans to start broadcasting news and talk radio services to Londoners this autumn - despite losing last year's franchise battle for the commercial radio station. The UK media giant has agreed to buy London Radio News, the consortium backed by the merchant bank Guinness Mahon, which in September won the battle for the AM and FM licences then held by LBC. Reuters has paid less than Pounds 10m for the franchise, its first move into radio. The group said the deal continued its expansion of news services across all sectors of the media. Guinness Mahon claimed it had been well advanced in putting together a syndicate to fund the new station, but Reuters 'made us an offer we couldn't refuse'. Pressure on LRN may have been increased by the collapse into receivership of LBC. LRN last month bought LBC from the receivers to prevent a damaging gap in broadcasting and the dispersal of its 90 journalists. The Radio Authority will approve the change of ownership, but emphasised that Reuters would have to fulfil the conditions on which LRN was awarded the licences. Mr John Parcell, managing director of Reuters UK and Ireland, said: 'We regard these as the most attractive local radio licences in the country and they will be a showcase for Reuters news services.' Mr David Rogers, Reuters editor UKI, said: 'The FM service will have a news format unique to London and Britain, as developed by the founders of the LRN licence bid. The AM service will also be speech-based, and will include phone-ins, documentaries and discussion programmes.' It is not clear whether there will be a role in the new set-up for Mr John Tusa, former managing director of the BBC World Service, chairman of LRN.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Revenge of Kenya's Arab 'squatters': Leslie Crawford on trouble in an African paradise AS THE dhow sailed towards Lamu, an ancient Arab settlement off the Kenyan coast, the damage of recent riots came into focus: buildings on the waterfront blackened by fire and exposed to the elements without their traditional thatched roofs; donkeys scavenging in the rubble; groups of young men as taut as flintlocks, still defiant after the troubles. For more than a year, Lamu's 15,000 inhabitants have endured bandit attacks on the road to Malindi, their main link to the outside world and the island's economic lifeline. Eight people have been killed, causing bus companies to suspend services along the route. One Friday in August, after midday prayers, several hundred Moslems marched to the town square with the intention of petitioning the district commissioner for greater police protection on the Malindi road. He refused to meet them, and ordered police to disperse them. Nobody will say who started the fire. But the customs building and court offices were torched, and the strong south-east trade winds swept the flames over the thatched makote roofs of the Standard Chartered Bank, seafront restaurants, shops and Petley's Inn, the oldest hotel on the island. Kanu Hall, headquarters of Kenya's ruling party, was also set ablaze. It was the greatest destruction Lamu had seen since a war against the rival city-state of Mombasa in 1810. Hundreds of tourists were ferried to the relative safety of the mainland. They have not returned. 'The district commissioner treated us like animals,' says Mr Karim Rajan, a local guest-house owner. The DC is hated for his heavy-handedness, but even more so because he is a non-Moslem and a 'foreigner', a political appointee who comes from Kenya's hinterland. He has taken to sleeping on a navy patrol boat. The riots were not only about banditry. All along the coast, Kenya's Swahili people, Moslems of Arab-African descent, have been nursing a growing litany of grievances against the government in Nairobi. 'We are treated like third-class citizens just because we have Arab blood,' says Mr Mohammed Abubakar, the deputy manager at Standard Chartered in Lamu. Moslems, he says, are barred from holding top government jobs or senior academic posts. While local government is run by 'up-country' officials, the coastal provinces have been neglected. Not a single state school has been built on the coast since independence 30 years ago. And the coastal people have watched with increasing alarm as their land is parcelled out to powerful politicians, hotel developers, or resettlement schemes for mainland tribes. 'We are regarded as squatters, even though we have been here for 1,000 years,' says Mr Abdul Nassir, a soft-spoken carpenter who has emerged as the leader of Lamu's Moslems. 'All our attempts to get title deeds for our farms have been rebuffed.' As resentment grows, the coastal strip from Lamu to Mombasa is becoming fertile ground for radical Moslem groups. 'The up-country people used to call us sleeping dogs; now they call us terrorists, fundamentalists,' says Sheikh Khalid Salim Balala, one of the founding members of the 18-month-old Islamic Party of Kenya. Sheikh Balala has endured six spells in prison for his inflammatory speeches and calls for political strikes in Mombasa. He is a bit of an embarrassment to Kenya's mainstream Moslem leaders, and while many distrust his motives, he is winning a growing number of followers with his demands for Moslem political power. 'We are 8m Moslems in Kenya - one third of the population - but we are a dead community,' Sheikh Balala says. 'Our leaders have been docile and incompetent; they have done nothing for us. We deserve a greater presence in government, in academia, in all walks of life.' He does not shy away from being called a fundamentalist, but denies his party is being financed by hardline Islamic groups abroad. The government in Nairobi thinks otherwise. It has refused to register the party as a legal organisation, calling it a threat to the established political order. Kenya's lawless frontier with Somalia has also become a breeding ground for radical Moslem groups since the arrival of aid agencies from the Gulf. Diplomats and government officials say many of these relief organisations are merely fronts to promote sharia law among the thousands of destitute refugees in the border camps. The fundamentalist government in Sudan, recently placed on Washington's list of terrorist states, is also believed to be involved. So far, these groups have preached peaceful activism, but the threat of violence is never far from the surface. 'The government is doing its utmost to prevent Moslems uniting along the coast,' says Mr Nassir. 'But if there are no changes, and the government continues to respond to our demands with weapons, they will be responsible for the consequences.'</p>

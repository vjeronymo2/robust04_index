			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections  scheduled for 8 May 1994.    "The Griper" column reports that "nearly 100 former members  of the military during the previous regime met at a residence on  50th Street recently. Led by General Ruben Dario Paredes, there  were statements in support of the presidential candidacy of  Ruben Dario Carles. They formed an organization called Union of  Military Members in Favor of Civilian Rule [Union de Militares  Civilistas] to fight for their rights." It adds that "the first  meeting broke up amid strong discussions and disagreements."  (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 4 Feb 94 p 32)    Former Comptroller Ruben Dario Carles, presidential  candidate  for the National Renewal Movement, Morena, the Nationalist  Liberal Republican Movement, Molirena, and the Civic Renewal  Party, said his ticket is the best one so he does not see any  need to change it. Mireya Moscoso, presidential candidate of the  Arnulfist Party, PA, recently issued an urgent call to the  so-called civic parties to form a great alliance to face the  Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, in the elections. (Panama  City LA PRENSA in Spanish 5 Feb 94 p 1)    Morena convention delegates on 5 February unanimously  ratified the presidential ticket of Carles, Guillermo Quijano,  and Tomas Herrera. In a previous convention on 6 January, the  delegates had proclaimed the ticket of Carles, Gloria Moreno de  Lopez and Herrera, but due to the alliance with Molirena,  Guillermo Quijano was nominated vice presidential candidate  instead of Moreno de Lopez. (Panama City EL SIGLO in Spanish 6  Feb 94 p 12)    The presidential candidacy of Ruben Dario Carles was  officially registered at the Electoral Tribunal under the  "Change 94" ticket on 7 February. The ticket formed by Carles  and Guillermo Quijano as first vice president and Tomas Herrera  as second vice president was presented by Molirena President  Alfredo Ramirez. At the registration, Carles said that "we are  the best and we are going to win." (Panama City Circuito RPC  Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Feb 94)    PRD presidential candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares  registered his ticket at the Electoral Organization Directorate  on 7 February. He was accompanied by Tomas Gabriel Altamirano  Duque and Felipe Virzi, first and second vice presidential  candidates, respectively. Regarding the failure of the  government parties to establish an electoral alliance against  the PRD, he said that "nothing unites them because they do not  have a national objective." Representatives of the Labor Party,  PALA, and the Liberal Republican Party later presented documents  accrediting them as supporters of Perez Balladares' slate.  (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Feb  94)    The Papa Egoro Movement registered its ticket headed by  Ruben  Blades as the presidential candidate and Fernando Manfredo and  Ricardo Bermudez as its vice presidential candidates on 7  February. Blades said his movement has the possibility of  presenting a solution to the Panamanian people. (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Feb 94)    The PA presented the documents to register its presidential  ticket at the Electoral Tribunal on 7 February. PA President  Mireya Moscoso de Gruber was accompanied by leaders of the  Authentic Liberal Party, the Liberal Party, and Independent  Democratic Union, which support her presidential candidacy. The  registration of the PA's slate shows the failure to achieve a  national unity ticket with other parties. The PA president  said: "Unfortunately, I made a proposal which fell on deaf ears.  We wanted an alliance with several parties." Asked whether  this failure might favor the opposition headed by the PRD, she  replied: "Well, we are an alliance of four parties. I think it  is the alliance with the most parties. We are organized. We  will work and tour the entire country. We are sure we are going  to be the winners." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in  Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Feb 94)    Liberal Party President Roberto Aleman and Mireya Moscoso de  Gruber, president of the Arnulfist Party, downplayed Ruben Dario  Carles' chances of winning the 8 May elections because the  parties that support him "do not have the strength to take him  to victory." Convention delegates of the Liberal Party on 6  February unanimously approved a resolution to join the parties  that form the Democratic Alliance that nominated Moscoso de  Gruber as its presidential candidate. Moscoso de Gruber said  that Carles "is not a threat" to the Democratic Alliance formed  by her party, the Authentic Liberal Party, the Liberal Party,  and the Independent Democratic Union. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA  DE PANAMA in Spanish 7 Feb 94 p 1A)    The Popular Nationalist Party, PNP, does not plan to  register candidates to president, legislator or corregimiento  representative and instead will nominate several candidates to  mayors. PNP President Jorge Flores said it will nominate Ana Mae  de Endara for Panama City mayor and Manuel Burgos for San  Miguelito mayor. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 7 Feb  94 p 8C)    The final electoral registry presented to the political  parties on 6 February indicates that 1,496,323 citizens are  qualified to vote. Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes  said there will be 5,310 voting tables at 1,980 polling  stations. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 7 Feb 94 p 1)    Presidential Candidate Ruben Dario Carles said that if he  wins the presidency, in the first 100 days of his  administration, he will attack the main social problems such as  unemployment, crime, and drug addiction. He toured areas of San  Miguelito on the morning of 8 February. Asked about charges  that he blocked social development while he was comptroller  general, Carles stated: "I was the comptroller who had to make  sure that the money spent by the government would be used in  accordance with the law. I was not a minister. There was never  a shortage of money to do the things done well." He adds: "I do  not make promises that cannot be kept. I am not promising a road  from here to the moon. I am promising housing to solve housing  problems and create jobs. I make specific promises. We are  going to improve public services with available resources."  (Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 8  Feb 94)    Presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles stated that the  Panamanian university system is becoming more and more separated  from the technological and scientific realities in the modern  world. He said the universities have not bothered to analyze the  present and future job market so a thorough reorientation of  their scientific, academic, and research activity is necessary.  Carles' observations are stated in a document entitled, "For a  Government That Makes Decisions," in which he sets forth his  work plan. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 8 Feb 94 p 4)    PRD presidential candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares said on  7  February that "the bad politicians who are trying to smear his  reputation are doing so because they already 'know they will  lose' and they will be rejected by the Panamanian people in the  8 May elections." He added that "there are political leaders  who are trying to link him to the past, but they will be  rejected by the people because 'hunger and unemployment are not  in the past but in the present.'" (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE  PANAMA in Spanish 8 Feb 94 p 1)    Ruben Blades, Papa Egoro Movement presidential candidate,  announced that his artistic career will end when he begins his  task of governing Panama. When his ticket was registered,  Blades said the "Papa Egoro does not have economic means because  the party is born from the people's desires, not from economic  power."

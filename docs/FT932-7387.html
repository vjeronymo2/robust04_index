			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Abu Dhabi close to charges over BCCI THE GOVERNMENT of Abu Dhabi is close to bringing both civil and criminal actions against the key individuals from the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International who it believes defrauded it of Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.42bn). The government, which is the majority shareholder in the bank, is at an advanced stage of determining whether to sue for compensation former BCCI directors and employees it alleges stole money it entrusted to the bank through ICIC, a Cayman Islands subsidiary. The money came from the private departments of Sheikh Zayed, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, and Sheikh Khalifa, the crown prince. These men, along with the state department of finance and Adia, the state investment authority, hold 77 per cent of BCCI's shares. The public prosecutor's office is believed to be near bringing criminal charges against 13 individuals detained in the country since BCCI was closed in July 1991, including Mr Swaleh Naqvi, its former chief executive. The action comes as the liquidators to the bank at accountants Touche Ross are believed to be close to making a decision on whether to issue writs against the Bank of England for its role as lead regulator to BCCI. The liquidators have already issued writs for damages of more than Dollars 8bn against accountants Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, for their role as auditors to the bank, and of Dollars 10.5bn against the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, its former chief operating officer, for fraud and racketeering. The government of Abu Dhabi would itself sue the individual BCCI employees, while all other litigation is being handled by Touche Ross. Any proceeds will be split equally between the two parties. The prospect of new litigation comes as Touche Ross prepares for the election of a formal five-strong creditors' committee from 24 candidates this Thursday, at what is expected to be the world's largest creditors' meeting at London's Wembley arena. The committee will approve the firm's fees and sanction its future actions. Adia, the Abu Dhabi investment authority, which is owed at least Dollars 72m, has put up a candidate. Also standing is Mr Adil Elias, owed Dollars 2m, who is a member of the existing informal creditors' committee and who is opposing in the Luxembourg courts the settlement between Abu Dhabi and Touche Ross.

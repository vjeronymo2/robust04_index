			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Barclays chooses chief executive BARCLAYS has chosen a new chief executive from outside the banking industry, Sir Peter Middleton, the bank's deputy chairman, told banking analysts in New York yesterday. Analysts said that Sir Peter had told them that an announcement could be made as early as today because the executive had already been offered the job and agreed in principle. It now required only the formal agreement of the two companies' boards. Barclays is thought to have selected a British candidate to split the responsibility of running the biggest UK bank with Mr Andrew Buxton, its chairman. But analysts said Sir Peter did not disclose the executive's nationality. Speaking at an analysts' meeting following the bank's first-half results, Sir Peter said that Barclays had interviewed executives from commercial and investment banks, but had chosen an outsider with financial experience. The appointment is the culmination of a four-month search. Mr Buxton announced his decision to split his role as chair-man and chief executive following pressure from large shareholders. There has been speculation that Mr Charles Miller Smith, a director of Unilever, was among the non-bankers shortlisted by Barclays with the help of its headhunting firm Spencer Stuart. The bank said yesterday that it could not comment. If it cannot announce its choice today, the bank is thought likely to wait until next week. However, Sir Peter said that Barclays had hoped to make an announcement this week. He said Barclays wanted the new chief executive to build up the bank's central group function independently of its three operating divisions: personal and corporate banking, the BZW investment bank, and service businesses. Sir Peter, who is also chairman of BZW, said the new chief executive would be involved in Barclays' treasury function, the way in which it allocates capital to operations, and the reform of its management of credit and other risks. Barclays returned to profit in the first half of this year with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 335m following a full-year loss of Pounds 242m for 1992, and the cutting of its dividend.</p>

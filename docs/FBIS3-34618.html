Each deputy will  have an assistant who will be in charge of security, while the  duties of those responsible for Palestinian security will be  agreed upon by both sides at the Taba talks.    -- There will be maximum cooperation between the two sides  in order to assure coordination in all mutual matters.    -- Palestinian policemen at the terminal will be armed  with revolvers. Their locations will be decided at the Taba  talks. All the other Palestinian officials at the terminal will  be unarmed.    -- All the details pertaining to administration,  coordination of security, and the liaison offices at the  terminals will be discussed at the Taba talks.    -- The two sides will cooperate in Taba to find ways to  work out additional arrangements at the Rafah terminal.    -- Visitors who arrive at the terminal will enter Gaza and  Jericho as agreed upon, without interference by Israel.    -- Visitors who leave the terminal will do so without  interference from the Israeli authorities following a joint  Israeli-Palestinian inspection of the necessary documents, with  Israel having a veto right (over those entering and departing).    Arrangements for entry from Egypt and Jordan via the  Palestinian side of the terminal:    -- At the entry to the Palestinian terminal (into which only  Palestinians will enter) there will be Palestinian policemen and  a Palestinian flag.    -- Before entering the Palestinian terminal travelers will  hand over their personal luggage which will be placed on a  conveyer belt. Each side will have the right to inspect the  luggage in the inspection area, and if a need arises the luggage  will be opened for inspection in the presence of its owners and  a Palestinian policeman.    -- People crossing the Palestinian terminal will pass  through a magnetic gate. An Israeli policeman and a Palestinian  policeman will stand on either side of the magnetic gate, and if  any suspicion arises, each side can demand a body check at the  gate. Travelers will be inspected by a Palestinian policeman in  the presence of an Israeli policeman.    -- If a traveler's identification is suspected each side  has the right to question him. Interrogation is permitted if a  person has been involved either directly or indirectly in  criminal acts or planning a criminal act; in terrorism or  planning a terrorist act; in hiding arms, explosives, or similar  equipment; or in the case of someone bearing forged or invalid  documents or unmatching documents.    Document on the security of the Israeli settlements in the  Gaza Strip:    -- Israel is fully responsibility for carrying out all  activity required to prevent contact or to give chase, and is  committed to handing over Palestinians violating security to the  Palestinian authorities. Treatment of Israelis who violate  security will be handled exclusively by Israel.    -- There will be Israeli patrols and there will be joint  patrols in certain cases.    -- All the coastal installations will be Israel's  responsibility.    -- Responsibility for traffic along the east-west roads  from the settlements in the Gaza Strip to Israel is Israel's.    --Israel has the right to veto the entry of anybody it  suspects and also has the prerogative to use its right to  inspect documents to prevent the "right of return" by  Palestinians.</p>

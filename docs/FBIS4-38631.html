			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 31 May -- "For Russia the Balkans are not  just a dot on the map, but it has a place in our hearts", Ivan  Rybkin, the chairman of the State Duma, stated during today's  meeting with Karolos Papoulias, the foreign minister of the  Greek republic. "We want very much", the speaker of the lower  chamber of the Russian parliament noted also, "that there should  be no hot spots in Europe and even more so that the flame of war  should not burn in the fraternal Yugoslavia".    Karolos Papoulias assured Ivan Rybkin that on international  issues the positions of Russia and Greece are similar or fully  coincide and noted that his side is interested in "Russia again  taking a worthy place in the Balkans, which it used to occupy  earlier and which it is worthy of by right". Incidentally, he  admitted that "the European Union countries have committed  mistakes with regard to Yugoslavia and Greece bears  responsibility for it as well". At the same time Karolos  Papoulias stressed that "despite the fact that no-one likes  this, Greece will follow the same path as Russia in the matter  of a peaceful settlement in the Balkans".    The sides also discussed issues of interparliamentary  cooperation between the two countries and spoke about the need  to expand them.</p>

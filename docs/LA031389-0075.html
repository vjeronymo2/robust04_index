			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALESA AND POLAND'S CHIEF DEFEND TALKS  </P> <P> Solidarity founder Lech Walesa said Sunday that talks with the government can  be a bridgehead for democracy in Communist Poland, while Poland's leader, Gen.  Wojciech Jaruzelski, rejected suggestions that the talks marked a retreat from  communism.  </P> <P> Walesa, addressing the 135-member Citizens' Committee he organized in December,  said that despite many "doubts and question marks," agreements reached at the  talks can be guaranteed by participation of opposition groups in political life  for the first time since martial law in 1981.  </P> <P> "We should consider what we should do now, so that the round-table talks are a  bridgehead for further victories," he told the pro-Solidarity Citizens'  Committee that is seen as a shadow cabinet.  </P> <P> Walesa also urged moderation by union officials at the talks, saying  authorities should not be called to account for past failures and that a  compromise should be reached. "There is a favorable international climate for  Polish reforms," he said.  </P> <P> The Citizens' Committee later issued a statement approving the results of the  talks so far but noted that there have been stalemates in several crucial areas  such as local self-government, access to the mass media, the activities of  associations and some law and order issues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decision Defended  </P> <P> In a speech to Warsaw party officials Saturday night, Jaruzelski defended the  leadership's decision to negotiate with the union, which he suppressed by the  imposition of martial law in 1981. The government outlawed the union in 1982.  </P> <P> "We should reject ideas ascribed to our party that the solutions discussed (at  the table) were pulled from our throat," Jaruzelski said in the speech that was  carried Sunday by the official news agency PAP. "It is not an act of mercy. It  is not a gift for the opposition . . . it is simply a chance for Poland."  </P> <P> He said the options included "an iron fist," total surrender or an agreement  with the opposition "to ensure the strengthening of Poland and its harmonious  modern development. We have chosen the third road."  </P> <P> Calling the agreement "a first step," he acknowledged the severity of the  economic crisis in Poland, saying, "Further steps will give evidence if we are  really capable of achieving normalcy."  </P> <P> The Citizens' Committee met for the second time since it was formed to assess  the progress after four weeks of talks. Most members are taking part in the  talks, which are scheduled to produce an agreement on ways of the overhauling  of the political and economic system by April 3.  </P></p>

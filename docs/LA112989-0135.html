			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS ARE WARNED OF OBSTETRICS CRISIS  </P> <P> Saying that obstetric services at Los Angeles County hospitals are "critically  overloaded," county health department chief Robert C. Gates told a state  medical commission Tuesday that women in labor might be turned away from county  hospitals unless an immediate solution to the overcrowding problem is found.  </P> <P> "It's to the point now where we must seriously consider sending patients out to  other (private) hospitals because the overload is so great," Gates said at a  California Medical Assistance Commission hearing in Burbank. "Our system is  well beyond capacity and something must be done right now."  </P> <P> Gates' idea for turning away pregnant women followed a controversial plan  instituted in June by UCI Medical Center in Orange, where conditions on the  maternity ward have been described as not only overcrowded but also "unsafe."  </P> <P> As a result, UCI Medical Center officials on June 5 began an "obstetrical  diversion" program that is expected to continue indefinitely.  </P> <P> Whenever both the maternity ward and emergency room are full, hospital security  guards wearing badges and blue blazers ask women in labor to go to a different  hospital. However, those women are still admitted to UCI if they insist.  </P> <P> Gates told the commission, which oversees the state's Medi-Cal contracting  program, that he expects more than 46,000 babies to be delivered at Los Angeles  County hospitals this year, severely overtaxing a system in which possibly  35,000 babies "could be safely delivered."  </P> <P> Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center has a capacity for about 14,000  deliveries, but officials expect almost 25,000 babies to be born there this  year. Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, with a capacity of 6,000 deliveries, expects  to handle 8,000 this year.  </P> <P> "Right now we have patients (giving birth) in corridors," said Dr. Charles  Brinkman, chair of the obstetrics and gynecology department at Harbor-UCLA  Medical Center. "Some patients are sent home in 12 hours, some are sent home in  two hours. It becomes really battlefront obstetrics we're practicing."  </P> <P> Gates said that if the county is to remedy the situation, it must expand its  contract agreements to hospitals that do not provide Medi-Cal coverage.  Currently, private facilities with Medi-Cal coverage are able to accommodate  only 9,000 referrals from the county, he said.  </P> <P> Gates said the commission could also help by easing Medi-Cal guidelines, which  allow the county to send only low-risk patients to its contract facilities for  obstetric care. And a number of hospital officials asked the panel to provide  speedy reimbursements to obstetricians as an incentive to expand Medi-Cal  services.  </P> <P> Orange County hospital officials, including UCI Medical Center's acting chief  of obstetrics, Thomas J. Garite, have been making similar pleas to Medi-Cal  officials for months.  </P> <P> Since UCI's policy began, more than 20 "diversions" have been announced when  the maternity ward has been full, including one that began shortly after noon  Tuesday. About 40 women have elected to deliver at other hospitals since the  policy was enacted, a medical center spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Despite the policy, though, overcrowding has continued at the medical center.  In a maternity ward designed to handle 250 births a month, UCI Medical Center  counted 452 deliveries so far this month.  </P> <P> Gates, however, stopped short of saying that Los Angeles County would copy UCI  Medical Center's plan.  </P> <P> "I have a problem with the concept (of security guards) and would only do it if  there was no other alternative," Gates said after the hearing.  </P> <P> Both state and federal health officials have scrutinized UCI's diversion  policy, but while some are unhappy with it, they have not declared it illegal.  </P> <P> Before Garite and hospital director Mary Piccione enacted the "diversion"  policy, deliveries in hospital corridors were a regular occurrence, and  obstetricians complained there were not always enough oxygen tanks and fetal  monitors for their patients.  </P> <P> Garite also has asked Medi-Cal officials to consider special funding for a  proposed UCI "birthing center" -- a center for low-risk births -- that would  relieve crowding in the hospital's maternity ward. But Garite said earlier this  week that it will take "a major change in their thinking" to change Medi-Cal  rules and make such a center a break-even proposition.  </P> <P> While Gates was making his comments before the state medical commission, the  Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors adopted a motion directing him to  develop a plan within two weeks to reduce the number of births at county  hospitals. The current delivery rate "exposes patients to unsafe care and  expands the county's potential for legal liability," supervisors said.  </P> <P> Gates said that Los Angeles County's proposed "self-referral" plan would allow  county health care workers to refer women in labor to other contract facilities  "as long as it was safe for them to transport themselves."  </P></p>

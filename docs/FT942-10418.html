			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Public monitors 'abused office' Anti-corruption magistrates in Rome have requested that 16 senior members of the court of public accounts, the 132-year-old judicial body monitoring public spending, be sent for trial on a string of charges related to abuse of office and falsifying documents. The charges involve Mr Giuseppe Carbone, the court's chairman, and Mr Emidio Di Giambattista, the chief prosecutor, and relate to allegations of tampering with evidence in some of the most sensitive financial scandals of recent years. Mr Carbone has claimed the accusations are designed to discredit the operations of the court or relate to investigations that have already been shelved. The investigations began more than five years ago when two magistrates renowned for their zeal spoke out in the court, saying they were being forcibly transferred in order to stifle an investigation. An equiry was opened only to be quietly shelved. The cases allegedly tampered with included investigations into the conduct of the state-run railways in the 1980s, when controlled by Mr Lodovico Ligato (assassinated in 1989), and the Enimont affair. to pronounce on the price being paid by ENI, the state oil concern, for its purchase of the stake held by Ferruzzi-Montedison in their joint chemicals venture, Enimont. The court said the price was fair even though the market claimed it was 20 per cent higher than necessary.</p>

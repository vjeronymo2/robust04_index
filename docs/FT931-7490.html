			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Landed interest FOR MARGINAL voters in London and the south-east, the leasehold enfranchisement proposals now contained in the housing and urban development bill were one of the more tempting morsels in the Tories' shop window at the last election. But as the rumblings that preceded yesterday's second reading in the Lords demonstrated once again, this opportunistic assault on property rights sticks in many a Tory gullet. Though hedged about with qualifications, the leaseholder's proposed right to buy looks to the landed interest like a clear case of the government failing to uphold contracts freely entered into. Yet the argument about property rights was lost long ago when the 1967 Leasehold Reform Act first enfranchised many homeowners. When the Duke of Westminster subsequently took his case against the legislation to the European Court of Human Rights, he was told that the compulsory transfer of property from one individual to another 'might constitute a legitimate means of promoting the public interest'; and that 'the enhancement of social justice within the Community could properly be described as being in the public interest'. Since the government's chief aim in the present bill is to extend home ownership, that principle can be evoked here with equal plausibility. It is simply a case of unfinished business. The real question is whether the outcome is likely to be economically efficient and whether the terms of the transfer are just. At present the management of much of Britain's leasehold residential property stock is anything but efficient. Even at the top end of the market there is no shortage of bad landlords. The leasehold system has tended to grant full control to the landlord without imposing commensurate responsibility. Part of the case for home ownership is precisely that owner occupiers are more actively committed to the proper upkeep of the housing stock. And in the present instance, there is the further benefit that enfranchisement will allow many hitherto unmortgageable leasehold properties to attract conventional mortgage funds, adding flexibility to the housing market. The issue of justice is more complex. The enhanced value arising from enfranchisement is to be shared equally between landlord and leaseholder. That suggests that the landlord is the loser. But in practice the leaseholder faces big uncertainties and costs in the enfranchisement process. The verdict at this stage must be open.</p>

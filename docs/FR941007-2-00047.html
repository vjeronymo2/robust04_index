			<p><!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  To guarantee consideration, preliminary proposals must be received by January 18, 1995. Preliminary-proposals shall be considered as meeting the deadline if they are either: (1) received on or before the deadline date or, (2) postmarked on or before the deadline date. Preliminary-proposals which do not meet the deadline will be considered late applications and may not be considered. The preliminarily-accepted Showcase Demonstrations are projected to be announced by approximately February, 1995 and will be asked by DOE to provide final-proposals. The final proposals scheduled due date is approximately March, 1995. DOE is expected to finalize Showcase Demonstration project selection by approximately April, 1995. The initial Showcase Demonstration Workshop is scheduled to take place in May, 1995. It is envisioned that selected projects will have a duration of no more than 18 months, and therefore, projects are expected to be completed (the project's costs and benefits defined and validated) by September, 1996.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=69 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=18 g=1 f=1 -->  <USBUREAU>Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy</USBUREAU> <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 -->  <DOCTITLE>Motor Challenge Showcase Demonstration Projects </DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <AGENCY> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> AGENCY: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Department of Energy.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </AGENCY> <ACTION> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ACTION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice inviting participation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=59 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ACTION> <SUMMARY> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUMMARY: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is interested in obtaining proposals from industrial electric motor system end users for projects that are intended to demonstrate and ``showcase'' electric motor system energy efficiency, productivity, and environmental improvement in varied industrial or municipal facilities and settings. Projects selected by DOE will become ``Showcase Demonstrations'' and are part of a larger, Federally-sponsored (DOE) program that is an industry-driven collaborative effort called MOTOR CHALLENGE. The experiences and successful results to be gained from the Showcase Demonstrations will be used to encourage other U.S. industrial companies with similar applications to adopt efficient electric motor systems, and therefore, to increase the market penetration of efficient electric motor systems on a widespread basis within the U.S.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  To guarantee consideration, preliminary proposals must be received by January 18, 1995.

It is expected that industry participants will achieve increased electric motor system efficiency through the system integration of a variety of technology and application options including: energy efficient electric motors, adjustable speed drives, and motor-driven equipment (e.g., pumps, fans, and compressors) within industrial operations and processes. DOE is carrying out the MOTOR CHALLENGE program with industrial and manufacturing companies, municipalities, electric motor and drive manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, utilities, energy service companies, research institutes, other Federal agencies, state energy agencies, public interest groups, and other supporting organizations. DOE will be the Federal agency with the responsibility of selecting Showcase Demonstration projects, and will then develop an Agreement between the government and the respective selected companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Managers under the microscope - John Cuthbert devises a new way to measure performance Investors and financial advisers are often prompted to put their money in a particular unit trust by their perception of the management group's overall performance. But there is little evidence that unit trust groups grow or dwindle as a result of performance results alone - perhaps because investors and advisers have no authoritative source of information about group performance. I have devised a simplistic but easy-to-understand way of looking at management group performance. The method is called Management Group Value Added, or MVA. First, I adjust the performance of each of a group's funds for the riskiness of its investment strategy. The MVA is then the proportion of a group's funds whose risk-adjusted performance exceeds that of an appropriate benchmark. It measures a group's ability to add value consistently. A group with five funds, three of which exceeded the performance benchmark would, therefore, achieve an MVA of 60 per cent. MVA measures uses performance adjusted for risk because most people agree that it is almost impossible for a manager to beat a benchmark consistently. So, comparisons with benchmarks, such as the FT-SE-A All-Share index, are powerful tests of performance. MVA does have its drawbacks, though. Benchmark comparisons often can be flawed if they are distorted by 'special' events: the effect of the Japan market's long crash on the Tokyo Stock Exchange indices is a case in point. And, where large numbers of funds are involved, the MVA percentage score might have as much to do with a group's spread across a range of different investment strategies, and the likelihood of their outperformance at different stages of the economic cycle, as it does with managerial ability. I have studied the MVA performances of 88 unit trust management groups; here are some of the results. The smaller table shows the overall MVA scores (without taking specialisation into account) of the 10 top-selling fund firms of last year. Column two shows the percentage results. Column three shows the number of value-adding funds as a fraction of the total number of funds surveyed within that group. MVA comparisons should always take these two columns together. This is particularly important in assessing Fidelity and M&amp;G; their large fund ranges make comparisons with narrower benchmarks a fairer test. Barclays Unicorn, Legal and General and Mercury also have wide ranges, but remain poor performers on either comparison. The larger table allows for specialisation by breaking down the overall results for these groups into narrower investment categories. My complete study (only part of which is discussed here) reveals that there are 14 groups with zero MVA and a further 27 that have added value on only one or two funds. The study also reveals that the highest MVA scores are produced by small to medium sized firms such as Baillie Gifford, Capel-Cure, Dunedin, Perpetual, Schroder, St James and Stewart Ivory. All of these have cultivated independent, distinctive management and analytical cultures plus an ability to keep good managers. The most important finding of all, however, is the revelation that there is absolutely no relationship between the value of a group's funds under management and its MVA performance. In other words, size and reputation alone are no guide to a firm's investment abilities. Among the top 10 fund firms by size, for instance, there are only two firms that have MVA scores greater than the average. Indeed, Standard Life, until recently the largest manager of unit trusts, has an MVA score of zero.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MVA* BY INVESTMENT CATEGORY OF TEN TOP-SELLING UNIT TRUST FIRMS 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Equity   Equity Group              core    MVA    spec'list   MVA   Bond     MVA name              MVA %   fraction  MVA %  fraction  MVA %  fraction  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- M&amp;G                  25    (4/16)   57.1    (4/7)     0     (0/1) Barclays Unicorn   8.33    (1/12)   12.5    (1/8)   100     (1/1) Baring             33.3     (3/9)   66.7    (2/3)     0     (0/1) F&amp;C Hypo              0     (0/5)   100     (1/1)   n/a      n/a Fidelity             40    (4/10)   50      (3/6)     0     (0/3) Gartmore           57.1     (4/7)   50      (3/6)     0     (0/1) Legal &amp; General    12.5     (1/8)   100     (2/2)     0     (0/3) Mercury              30    (3/10)   0       (0/3)     0     (0/1) Perpetual            75     (6/8)   100     (2/2)   n/a      n/a Schroder            100     (5/5)   50      (1/2)     0     (0/1)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MVA: management group value-added  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Unit Trust Group MVA by JP Cuthbert  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------       MVA* OF TEN TOP-SELLING UNIT TRUST FIRMS 1993  ------------------------------------------------------- Group                    Overall MVA as name                    MVA % fraction  ------------------------------------------------------- Perpetual               80   (8/10) Schroder                75   (6/8) Gartmore                50   (7/14) Baring                  39   (5/13) Fidelity              36.8   (7/19) M&amp;G                   33.3   (8/24) Legal &amp; General       23.1   (3/13) Mercury               21.4   (3/14) F&amp;C Hypo              16.7   (1/6) Barclays Unicorn      14.3   (3/21)  ------------------------------------------------------- MVA: management group value-added  ------------------------------------------------------- Source: Unit Trust Group MVA by JP Cuthbert  ------------------------------------------------------- John Cuthbert is a freelance investment analyst.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: Royal Bank of Canada up 10% ROYAL BANK of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, has demonstrated the resilience of Canada's banking industry with a 10 per cent rise in first-quarter income. Despite a one-third jump in loan loss provisions, RBC lifted net earnings to CDollars 256m (USDollars 215m), or 73 cents a share, in the three months to January 31, from CDollars 232m, or 70 cents, a year earlier. Return on equity fell to 14.5 per cent from 15.3 per cent, due to a larger common equity base and extra dividends on two preferred share issues last year. Return on assets, which averaged CDollars 134.6bn in the latest period, improved to 0.76 per cent from 0.71 per cent. The rise in profits stems mainly from the bank's international operations and record earnings at RBC Dominion Securities, its 74 per cent-owned securities subsidiary. International income jumped to CDollars 97m from CDollars 73m, with return on assets surging to 1.4 per cent from 1.03 per cent. A bank official yesterday attributed the strong performance to higher loan fee and other fee income, wider interest margins, higher Third World interest payments, and the high quality of the bank's international assets. The US accounts for about 35 per cent of the bank's non-Canadian assets of CDollars 27.6bn.</p>

There is no doubt that in a short time Albania will present its  request for associate agreements with the European Union, he  added.    Minister Serreqi said that the talks with his Belgian  counterpart were characterized by a complete political will for  the positive development and the prospective of Albania's mutual  relations which are especially important for Albania in the  transition period. The two ministers had also agreed in the  talks to sign as soon as possible several agreements, such as  the agreement for the encouragement and protection of the  investments, the agreement for removal of double taxation, for  economic cooperation in different fields and the extention of  cultural and technical relations.    According to Mr. Serreqi, the visit of Mr. Claes to Albania  was important in many aspects. Mr. Claes came to Albania as a  member of the EU troika, being at the same time one of the most  selected partner in the talks on Albania's integration into the  European structures and its cooperation with the European Union.    Concerning the tense situation in the region, Mr. Serreqi  said that Albania's foreign policy was appreciated in the talks  and that they had fully agreed on their views and options  regarding a resolution to the Balkan crisis.    Mr. Claes said that a solution to the Kosova question is one  of the most essential components for the resolution of the whole  crisis in the former Yugoslavia, and at the same time it is the  only option which can bring about a definitive solution. Mr.  Claes said that the components of the crisis in the region  should not be separated and this idea had been also emphasized  in the troika meeting with representatives of Croatia and  Bosnia. Kosova, Mr. Claes said, is one of the components and  its question must be solved through granting it an extended  autonomy.    Answering a question in regard to the presence of the  international protectorate in order to guarantee the status of  the Kosova autonomy, Mr. Claes said he could not give any  opinion before the negotiations. But, he added that as in the  case with Bosnia-Herzegovina, the European Union will insist in  observing any agreement which can be signed. Mr. Claes said  that everything depends on what the parties will demand from the  international community.    Asked about what he meant by "an extended autonomy for  Kosova," Mr. Claes said that it is not the union which will  define what are the Albanians going to request, adding that he  was of the opinion that Kosova must be granted an extended  autonomy in political and cultural aspect. "For us," Mr. Claes  said, "this concept comprises not only individual but collective  rights as well."    Answering a question by a Belgian reporter, Mr. Serreqi said  that Kosova must never be considered as an interior problem of  Serbia. The war in Bosnia, Mr. Serreqi said, has left the Kosova  question in oblivion to some extend, but the crisis in former  Yugoslavia cannot be resolved unless a solution for Kosova is  found.</p>

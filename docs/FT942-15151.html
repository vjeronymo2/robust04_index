			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Selling gilts cheap Even rose-tinted glasses are getting cheaper, according to yesterday's UK retail prices data. A drop in the price of spectacles helped produce March's 0.3 per cent rise. But little rose-tinting is needed to distill a positive message from the overall data. Upward pressure on prices remains generally muted and there are welcome signs of easing inflation in the services sector. Clear evidence of a weakening economy will be needed for a base rate cut, especially now the Treasury has published details of the chancellor's monthly discussions with the governor of the Bank. But the moment at which the UK will have to start worrying about a US-style upturn in rates appears to have been deferred. That gave the gilts market heart ahead of the Bank's announcement that, after last month's floating rate issue, it was reverting to the conventional market for this month's auction. Still, its choice of a shortish maturity is an indication that conditions remain fragile. The Bank obviously also hopes that long rates will come down before it needs to tap that end of the maturity spectrum. One approach might have been to make the auction stock convertible into longer-dated paper. Convertibles appeal when the market is uncertain which way yields are heading. But if the Bank believes they have risen too far this year, the risk is that it could be giving too much away with a convertible. Against that background, its decision to continue funding short makes sense. The risk remains, though, that its anxiety to pick the right moment will prevent it locking in 25 or 30-year money at attractive rates, even when the market recovers.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As adopted, this provision has been modified in a number of respects to respond to concerns expressed by commenters. In particular, the amendments replace the proposed review standard with a requirement that dealers have procedures in place that provide reasonable assurance that they will receive promptly any notices of material events regarding the securities that they recommend. The events are any of the eleven events disclosed as described in Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5)(i)(C), or the notice of failure to provide annual financial information in accordance with an undertaking as described in Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5)(i)(D) with respect to that security. Many dealers currently subscribe to electronic reporting systems that give notice of significant events made public by municipal issuers. To comply with the rule's requirement, these dealers should make certain that these systems receive, directly or indirectly, material event notices for issues the dealer recommends. In addition, dealers should develop procedures to ensure that notices of such events will be available to the staff responsible for making recommendations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Commission's view, the recommendation provision, as modified, should substantially reduce the concerns of commenters with respect to compliance burdens and effects on liquidity. It also will help ensure that dealers will consider the material event notices that issuers produce, thus enabling them to have an adequate basis on which to recommend <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 143 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  municipal securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 143 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in the Proposing Release, most situations in which a dealer brings a municipal security to the attention of a customer involve an implicit recommendation of the security to the customer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, even though the amendments do not require that dealers directly review an issuer's ongoing disclosure before making each recommendation, the Commission agrees with those commenters that said that additional information made available by issuers will be taken into account by dealers making recommendations regarding that security, under the MSRB's fair dealing and suitability rules, and the antifraud provisions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 144 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition to the Commission's past interpretations of the responsibilities of dealers to have a reasonable basis for their recommendations, the MSRB repeatedly has emphasized that secondary market disclosure information publicized by issuers must be taken into account by dealers to meet the investor protection standards imposed by its investor protection rules. Specifically, MSRB rule G&hyph;17 requires dealers to disclose material facts of a transaction to the customer; MSRB rule G&hyph;19 requires dealers to ensure that any transaction recommended to the customer is suitable for that customer; and MSRB rule G&hyph;30 requires dealers to ensure that the prices set for customer transactions are fair and reasonable. In its comment letter, the MSRB noted that ``[i]f a dealer is not aware of major financial and other material developments affecting an issuer's securities, it is difficult or impossible for the dealer to comply with these requirements.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 145 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 144 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Letter of MSRB (emphasizing that, in the Board's view, dealers would be responsible for continuing disclosure information available in NRMSIRs even without the specific ``review'' requirement); Letter of Paine Webber.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 145 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of MSRB (noting the requirements of the MSRB's rules in commenting that the Proposed Amendment's requirement to review periodic information is not a practical option for dealers).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For example, if a dealer reviews an electronic reporting system for material events relating to a security, and finds that an issuer has submitted a notice that it has failed to provide annual financial information on or before the date specified in the written agreement or contract, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 146 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that fact would be a significant factor to be taken into account when the dealer formulates the basis for a recommendation of such securities. While the dealer would not be prohibited  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> per se  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> from recommending such municipal securities, notice that the issuer has failed to provide annual financial information would be the type of material information required to be disclosed to the customer pursuant to MSRB rule G&hyph;17. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 147 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Such a notice also would trigger a further inquiry by the dealer to assure itself that it is cognizant of the condition of the issuer or obligated persons, despite the absence of promised information. This also would be true if a dealer attempts to obtain an issuer's annual financial information, finds that it has not been submitted to any repository, and the dealer had no record of the issuer submitting a notice to this effect. In such cases, further research may be necessary or advisable prior to making a recommendation in the issuer's securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 146 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5)(i)(D).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 147 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> MSRB Manual (CCH) &para;3581.30 (interpreting MSRB rule G&hyph;17 to require that a dealer disclose, at or prior to a sale, all material facts concerning the transaction, including a complete description of the security).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1988 Release at n. 50 and accompanying text.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

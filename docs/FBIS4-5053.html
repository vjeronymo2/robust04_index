			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii told OECD leader Jean-Claude Paye Tuesday [5 April] the  Japanese Government is considering full-scale tax cuts in years  beyond fiscal 1995, officials said. The officials said Fujii  and Paye, secretary general of the Paris-based Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development, exchanged views on the  economic situation.    The government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has been  under pressure to implement tax cuts on a continuing basis to  stimulate domestic demand, thereby increasing market potential  for imports.    Fujii told Paye the government is considering full-scale tax  cuts in fiscal 1995 and onward, the officials said. Legislation  for a 20 percent reduction in income and residential taxes for  this year has already cleared the Diet.    Fujii was quoted as telling Paye the government considers it  necessary to raise the 3.0 percent consumption tax rate to help  ease the tax burden on middle-class wage earners, the officials  said. Paye, on a regular visit to Japan for consultations with  Japanese leaders, expressed hope that tax cuts will help  stimulate consumer spending in Japan and expand domestic demand,  they said.</p>

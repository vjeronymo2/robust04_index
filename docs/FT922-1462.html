			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (22): Shaky start for network leader - Unix ALTHOUGH IT is now central to many applications of computing, the Unix operating system has had a chequered history and arguably suffered from decisions made by Bell Labs, in the US, and its parent company AT&amp;T. Having developed Unix in 1969 as a multi-tasking operating system that could be portable to a number of different computer architectures, Bell and AT&amp;T decided to maintain rigid control over it. Licence fees were high - far beyond the barrier of economic sense for most computer suppliers or users. Few invested in it, to the point where universities, with their need to enable many computer science students to work at the same time, were the main Unix users. If not for the fact that students liked the system, it might have died through this marketing error. Working in industry after college, graduates started demanding the system or, if they joined a manufacturer, developing their own 'clones'. The result was many operating systems, with names usually ending in 'ix', that were broadly similar. Unfortunately, they were not similar enough, creating big problems for the computer industry and its users. Unix has, in theory at least, significant benefits, not least of which is its theoretical portability to different computer architectures. But because the initial marketing position was not changed until 1981, no single, unified version was available. Yet over this period, Unix developed into exactly what users wanted. Users started to rebel against being 'locked in' to one computer architecture from one manufacturer. No supplier, not even IBM, could furnish everything a user might need, and users realised that, to get what they wanted, computer systems had to be much more open. The first step was to identify an operating system that was not specific to a particular make of hardware, and the only real option was Unix. As suppliers realised this was what users wanted, a growing number of alliances and consortia were formed to fulfil these needs - such as Unix International, Open Software Foundation and ACE. The latest and most thorough incarnation of Unix - System V Version 4 (SVR4)  -is for the first time a single, unified implementation of the operating system. Now under the control of a separate company, Unix Systems Laboratories, the prime advantage of SVR4 is that the same source code is now available across the board. It is also relatively easy to port the system to a wide range of computers. This allows the possibility - not yet fully exploited by applications software companies - of making an application available on a wide range of different computer systems. Companies such as Oracle, Informix, Uniplex, Lotus and Word Perfect are now moving this way. A key advantage of Unix is its file structure, which allows large systems to be built with full file protection when many users are working on the same system. It is also well suited to driving high-resolution, high performance graphics systems. This has been at the heart of the growth of Unix workstations, initially in the CAD/engineering sectors, but latterly in financial management work. Unix can work equally well as a multi-user system or in a network. In the latter role, it is relatively tolerant of other systems, such as PCs. In fact, Unix can accommodate other operating systems by enclosing them in what is termed a 'shell'. This connects it to the host Unix environment. Unix has always been at the forefront of communications, particularly Electronic Mail. This is still one of its strong points. Unix's power and flexibility give it a leading role in network management and it is significant that the leading PC network software supplier, Novell, has been working hard to ensure connectivity with Unix. Its graphics handling and performance also make it the preferred system in many desktop applications, where the PC can be limited.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> FOX THREATS WRITER PLEADS GUILTY  </P> <P> A woman who sent more than 5,000 written death threats to actor Michael J. Fox  pleaded guilty today to three counts of making terrorist threats.  </P> <P> Superior Court Commissioner Sam Bubrick immediately sentenced Tina M.  Ledbetter, 26, to three years' probation and ordered her to undergo psychiatric  counseling.  </P> <P> Bubrick also freed Ledbetter from custody, where she had been since March.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Ledbetter, a Westlake Village shipping clerk, began sending  Fox the death threats in early 1988 because she was upset over the actor's  marriage to actress Tracy Pollan.  </P> <P> Fox, 27, rose to fame through the NBC sitcom "Family Ties." He went on to star  in a number of movies including "Back to the Future," "Bright Lights, Big  City," and this year's "Casualties of War" and "Back to the Future Part 2."  </P></p>

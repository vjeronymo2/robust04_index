In a tactical move, the Pakistani  delegation circulated a revised resolution on the issue  inserting a new paragraph which calls upon the Indian Government  to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights in Jammu  and Kashmir. However, speaking on behalf of the Indian  delegation, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, told PTI that India would not  accept any resolution on any aspect of Kashmir which is an  integral part of the country.    The European Union also said that the substance of the  resolution is still political in nature and will not change its  earlier stand of abstaining in case of voting.    Meanwhile, India has stepped up its diplomatic offensive at  the Human Rights Commission's session to expose unbridled  terrorism spurned by Islamabad in Jammu and Kashmir. The  minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid,  charged Pakistan with trying to involve the UN Human Rights  Commission in its blatant pursuit of political and territorial  ambitions. Mr. Khurshid said that Jammu and Kashmir is the  symbol of India's secular democracy and declared that India will  oppose Islamabad's politically motivated exercise. He said New  Delhi is making efforts to manifest still greater transparency  regarding the actual situation in Jammu and Kashmir.    The leader of the Indian delegation at the ongoing session  of  the commission, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, has expressed  confidence that the resolution moved by Pakistan would be  defeated when it comes up for voting.</p>

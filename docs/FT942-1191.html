			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Unofficial mail dispute spreads Postal services may be disrupted in many areas today after an unofficial strike by postal workers which escalated from a local dispute over staffing. Mount Pleasant, the biggest sorting office in London, was affected by the walkout, as were offices in Romford, Dagenham and Ilford, in Essex, Dunstable and Bedford - and Milton Keynes, where the dispute started earlier this week. The Royal Mail said yesterday that it might take legal action against the UCW communications union following an injunction against it requiring it not to take industrial action.</p>

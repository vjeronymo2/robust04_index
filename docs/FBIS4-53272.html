			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 17 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has  informed the United States that it will allow the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to check the fuel rods taken out of  its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon later, an official at  the North Korean mission to the United Nations said on Tuesday.    He said that although North Korea began to replace the fuel  rods of the 5mw reactor in Yongbyon, it will seal the spent fuel  and keep it under the IAEA's strict surveillance.    "We will then allow accurate measurement of the spent fuel  when we and the United States comprehensively settle the nuclear  problem in a package deal," he said.    The official reiterated the statement by a North Korean  Foreign Ministry spokesman that Pyongyang had to begin replacing  the fuel rods for reasons of technical safety. He also noted  that the statement emphasized that the nuclear problem can still  be solved through dialogue.    Thomas McLarty, chief of staff for U.S. President Bill  Clinton, told a TV news program last weekend that Washington  needs more information about North Korea's refueling and is  waiting for reports from the IAEA team, which began its  inspections on Tuesday.    The United States, however, may not have any alternative but  to study ways at the U.N. Security Council to impose sanctions  on North Korea if the IAEA inspection fails to come up with  satisfactory results, diplomatic sources said.</p>

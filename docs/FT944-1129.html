			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Cuba cuts budget deficit Cuba says it has managed to cut its bloated budget deficit in a drive to balance the state accounts, seven months after launching financial reforms. But a senior government official said big increases in production and efficiency were still needed to haul the sugar-exporting economy out of the doldrums. Mr Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance minister, told the National Assembly on Tuesday the state budget deficit had been slashed in 1994 to nearly a quarter of its 1993 level. He put the 1994 deficit at 1.4bn pesos (Pounds 897m), 72 per cent lower than the 1993 deficit of just over 5bn pesos. The government had boosted revenues by 25 per cent, largely by raising cigarette and alcohol prices, but also by introducing some taxes and increasing charges in selected public utilities and services. Another big saving was achieved in cutting by nearly 40 per cent state subsidies previously doled out to cover losses in agriculture, basic industry, construction and local government. Improved financial discipline by state companies had also helped to lighten the 1994 budget load. Vice President Carlos Lage said on Saturday he believed the government had managed to check the sharp decline of the economy that followed the collapse after 1990 of trade and aid flows from the former Soviet bloc. The National Assembly on Tuesday approved a budget proposal for 1995 that further cut the deficit to 1bn pesos, on estimated revenues of 11.68bn pesos and projected spending of 12.68bn pesos. While spending on health and education would increase slightly in 1995, the government would further reduce by nearly 35 per cent subsidies to cover losses by state companies and institutions A continuing budget black spot was the heavily subsidised sugar sector, where, following disastrously low harvests in 1993 and 1994, funds still had to be set aside to bankroll struggling sugar cane co-operatives.</p>

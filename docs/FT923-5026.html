			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Observer: Achtung If only he hadn't hit a German. Werner Niefer, retiring management board chairman of Mercedes-Benz AG, has been fined DM80,000 for knocking down a German tourist while driving one of his buses in Rome a couple of years ago. Stuttgart judge Hubertus Pauli found that Niefer - who took the wheel after entertaining some of Mercedes's Italian staff at a restaurant outside Rome - should have stopped before rounding a blind corner where the accident happened. A Mercedes spokesman said the wounded German tourist had not filed a civil suit, but he expected this would follow. Mercedes said that Niefer welcomed the completion of the two-year investigation and would accept the fine.</p>

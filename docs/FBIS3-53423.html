			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "A Political Analysis of the </F> Foreign Exchange Crisis"]    [Text] Even though dollar and foreign exchange rates are an  economic issue and fall within the framework of monetary and  financial policies, it is obvious that they are an important  instrument for the implementation of arrogant policies. The  recent crisis in foreign exchange is actually a political issue,  because with the protraction of this crisis the United States  expects the downfall of the anti-U.S. government in Iran. This  crisis arose immediately following the explicit remarks by the  leader concerning the United States. Foreign radios and the  mouthpieces of the policies of the West and of Zionism have  stated that by the end of 1993, the exchange rate would reach  2,500 rials to the dollar and that by the end of the Iranian  year it will reach 3,000 rials. Some have also said that it  should be 10,000 rials to one dollar.    Actually, the United States wants to use this method to  increase inflation and drive up prices. This will make the  people disenchanted with Islam and the revolution and force them  to agree to establish relations with the United States, thinking  that such relations will resolve all our problems. If the  Iranian statesmen are not willing to do so, they will be  overthrown! And a pro-U.S. regime will come to power!    It is very interesting to know that the dollar-rial exchange  rate is determined in the United States. As the United States  cannot establish direct contact with Iran, it operates through  the Dubayy foreign exchange market. At the outset of the  crisis, foreign exchange dealers have only been purchasing  foreign exchange and transferring these funds abroad--to  Dubayy--because a higher rate for the dollar can be obtained  there.    There is a clear answer to why this mechanism is being used.  Through the banking mechanism, the United States is instigating  inflation in Iran. With the rise in foreign exchange rates, the  prices of imported items increase. In turn, the high prices of  foreign exchange-related goods affect the prices of domestic  products, and inflation becomes a vicious circle.    It may be asked how the United States benefits from all  this.  The United States is ready to spend billions of dollars to  defeat an independent government. During 28 Mordad 1332 [19  August 1953 coup which overthrew Dr. Mosaddeq's rule] and other  similar coups, the United States showed that it is willing to  spend whatever is necessary to establish its new world order and  diktat. These financial interventions concerning Iran, however,  are made indirectly; in other words, the United States makes up  the difference in the exchange rate of the Iranian rial and pays  for it with its arrogant expenditures; and foreign exchange  dealers and the fugitive Iranian subservient elements who are  living in the United States are ready to invest billions of  rials in order to be able to return to this country and once  again take power.    Everything will be clarified by the end of this year [21  March 1994]. Inflation and high prices will assume crisis  proportions. In view of this, there are two alternatives. If  the people are unable to deal with the crisis and complain about  high prices and inflation, the government will either fall or  will have to accept the unwritten resolution of the United  States in this economic war. But if the people resist and  declare, as they did at the outset of the revolution, that they  will tolerate oil and electricity shortages and pledge  allegiance to the martyrs, then it is the U.S. Government that  will fall, because the crisis will be transferred to the United  States, which will then disintegrate.    The United States will, however, actually be harmed from two  directions in the process: On the one hand, it is spending  taxpayers' money in its futile attempt to overthrow the Iranian  Government; and on the other, if it fails it will be unable to  start a new propaganda wave because the United States is  actually playing with U.S. public opinion now and is showing its  people that it has been able plunge Iran's economy into crisis.  If it succeeds in defeating Iran, no one in the United States  will protest. But if Iran wins, then opposition inside the  United States will definitely grow.</p>

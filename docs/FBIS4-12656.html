			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by official PLO spokesman -- read by </F> announcer]    [Text] The city of Jerusalem, the capital of the  Palestinian people, has been isolated and besieged for several  days where roads leading to it have been closed, its national  institutions have been prohibited from carrying out their  activities and a siege of terror has been imposed around worship  sites. These measures were taken to make changes on the ground  and to force its people to flee after the Israeli authorities  closed doors of meting out their means of living in their faces  and preventing them from reaching their workplaces, using the  Afula incident as an excuse while ignoring their incompetence in  dealing with the Hebron massacre and its aftermath when settlers  committed more killings against Palestinians in the West Bank  and Gaza strip, an act in which the Israeli army participated.    This serious incident falls within a known framework of  policy practiced by the Israeli government entailing mass  punishment of the Palestinian people following the acts of  violence -- which cannot be avoided or controlled as long as  this government gives settlers a free reign to kill and carry  out acts of violence and terrorism, and as long as it does not  cooperate in eradicating explosive hotbeds through the peaceful  process, starting with moving settlers from Hebron. Such a  measure would calm sentiments and prove its rejection of the  horrific massacre and killings by settlers and the army while  hundreds of worshipers prayed in al-Ibrahimi mosque and which  spilled over into the West Bank and Gaza strip.    The PLO sees in that Israeli policy, which escalated the  collective punishment measures to the extent of resorting to  importing tens of thousands of Asian laborers, as being a source  of danger and threat to the whole peace process. Accordingly,  the PLO, while rejecting the Israeli policy, is concerned to  make the international community and Security Council states  stand up to these dangerous Israeli practices. It urges the  cosponsors -- the U.S. and Russia -- to intervene to relieve the  suffering, oppression, and killing of the Palestinian people,  and to save the peace process.    Events and incidents have proved that security precautions,  however big and severe, will not succeed in stopping violence  and crime. In the end, every party would be able to make bloody  penetrations which would complicate matters.    Accordingly, the PLO sees that the latest Israeli measures  are pushing matters into a path which run in the opposite  direction to the peace process. The inflexible parties in the  Israeli government have found their chance to destroy this  process, a matter which will drag the region into conflicts,  bloody and violent events, thwarting all dreams of security,  stability and peace.    We call on the international community, particularly the  American and Russian cosponsors, to intervene and put a stop to  the total massacre of our Palestinian people in the occupied  territories -- which affects the core of their daily lives  ranging from the attack on their sanctities and institutions, to  starve them, confiscating their means of living and preventing  them from moving around. These measures are harming all  Palestinian sectors, especially the health sector.</p>

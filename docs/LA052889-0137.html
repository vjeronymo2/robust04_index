			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'LIKE CHRISTMAS';  </P> <P> PHOENIX HOUSE'S DECISION ELATES NEIGHBORHOOD  </P> <P> To Janet Jackson, whose home backs up to the defunct Lake View Medical Center,  the Saturday before Memorial Day seemed more like Christmas.  </P> <P> Jackson and her Lake View Terrace neighbors fought for more than a year to  block the proposed 210-bed Nancy Reagan Center for drug-abuse treatment and  just when the battle seemed lost, the former First Lady on Friday backed away  from the fight, citing the neighborhood opposition.  </P> <P> And Phoenix House, the drug treatment organization that had proposed operating  the center, quickly announced that it was pulling out of the project.  </P> <P> "There's a feeling of lightness," said Jackson, 37, whose Luanda Street home  overlooks the 14-acre former hospital property. "It's almost like  Christmastime."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Community Amenity  </P> <P> Telephones rang repeatedly Saturday as neighbors shared their elation. They  talked excitedly about how the three-story building and its grounds might be  transformed from a white elephant into a community amenity, such as a library,  a senior citizens center or a theater. Others relived the battle, repeating  arguments that the center's drug-addicted residents would have posed security  risks to the area.  </P> <P> "It's just incredible," Jackson said. "We don't know what happened, but we know  it was a miracle here."  </P> <P> The neighborhood's battle had often seemed lopsided during the 13 months since  the politically connected Phoenix House announced plans to buy and renovate the  hospital, which had gone bankrupt in 1986.  </P> <P> Phoenix House had Nancy Reagan, who as First Lady had become the nation's most  well-known drug fighter, on its side. But it also had the money and prestige of  Hollywood, with such personages as Merv Griffin and Grant Tinker supporting the  center.  </P> <P> The racially integrated community around the hospital site -- a mixture of  aging tract homes with barred windows and almost-new homes with good views --  seemed an impossibly mismatched underdog. But residents from a variety of races  and income groups joined to fight back by lobbying Los Angeles city officials,  community leaders said.  </P> <P> Beyond the immediate vicinity of the site, Phoenix House had vocal supporters,  including City Council candidate Lyle Hall. But Lynne Cooper said opposition  was nearly 100% in her neighborhood.  </P> <P> Now that the battle with Phoenix House has been won, Cooper, president of the  Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn., one of two groups of organized homeowners  in the community, talked about the new challenges.  </P> <P> "We've got some momentum going now, and I think that will help us get a  community center," said Cooper, 28, whose three-bedroom home overlooks the back  of the hospital building.  </P> <P> "We felt we were fighting a losing battle," said Brian Cooper, 29. "But we kept  going."  </P> <P> The homes in the Coopers' neighborhood were built between 1984 and 1986.  Landscaping is maturing. Pools are going in. And home values have gone up  substantially, to between $170,000 and $200,000, real estate agents and  residents say.  </P> <P> But several residents said the escalation in value nearly halted last year when  it appeared that Phoenix House would win city approval of its plans. Although  some residents were ready to move away anyway, Cooper said, the proposed  drug-abuse treatment center caused them to accelerate their plans. In some  cases, residents said, houses sold for less than they were worth as residents  fled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Values Increase  </P> <P> Shirley Russell, a real estate agent active in the neighborhood, said homes  immediately next to the former hospital probably went up in value between  Friday afternoon and Saturday.  </P> <P> Phoenix House "was a barrier to getting the price that the houses were really  worth," she said.  </P> <P> Those not ready to pick up and move began taking precautions as well. Bob and  Joycelin Furgunson moved into their Luanda Street home three weeks before  Phoenix House officials confirmed plans to buy and renovate the property just  beyond their back fence.  </P> <P> They considered leaving, but feared that they would be unable to sell the house  for a high enough price. So they decided to erect tall trellises, plant rose  bushes and install an alarm system, something they had thought unnecessary in  what appears to be a serene suburban neighborhood.  </P> <P> "We were planning on fortifying the back yard," said Bob Furgunson, 38, a  sculptor and artist. He said he wanted to discourage Phoenix House residents  from coming on his property.  </P> <P> The Furgunsons said they would not have opposed a center for voluntary drug  treatment. But Phoenix House residents would have been assigned to the center  by courts and might have tried to escape, they said.  </P> <P> The Furgunsons and others insisted that their fight against Phoenix House was  not just another case of a neighborhood resisting an idea from outside. They  said they supported the program until they learned more about it.  </P> <P> The unity formed during the fight, the residents said, will be important in  continuing to battle drugs in the neighborhood and in fighting expansion of the  nearby Lopez Canyon landfill. They also want to make sure that whatever is  proposed for the former hospital site meets with the community's approval.  </P> <P> Now, however, the community is planning a huge block party.  </P> <P> "We've been promising ourselves this party for a year and a half," Lynne Cooper  said. "We deserve it."  </P></p>

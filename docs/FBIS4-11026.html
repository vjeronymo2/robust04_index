			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] Ruben Dario Carles, presidential candidate for the  Civic Renewal Party, Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement  [MOLIRENA], and the National Renewal Movement [MORENA], also  commented on the possibility of forming alliances.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Will there be  sufficient political commitment to create the alliance MORENA  and MOLIRENA have been calling for to establish a common front  against the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party]?    [Carles] Everybody agrees on that.    [Reporter] Will Mr. Carles be willing to cede the head of  the  ticket to the Arnulfists, considering they are sticking to their  stance?    [Carles] I do not want to talk about what others think. I am  saying the country knows our ticket is the best, from an  individual and collective standpoint. We have programs that are  not novels, works of fiction, songs, or poems, but facts -- the  result of our experience, knowledge, and capability. We have  the best team. You will not find any of them on any video. [end  recording]</p>

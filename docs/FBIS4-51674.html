			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from the "NHK News 7" program] </F>   [Excerpt] Prime Minister Hata is currently visiting Italy.  Speaking with Japanese correspondents in Rome this evening, Hata  ruled out holding general elections once the House of  Representatives is dissolved, asserting that the next general  elections should be held under the new electoral system. In  this way, the prime minister ruled out holding the general  elections under the present multi-seat constituency system once  the House of Representatives is dissolved.    While speaking with Japanese correspondents, Hata stated  that  generally speaking the Japanese prime minister possesses the  right to dissolve the House of Representatives as his sole  right, and the exercise of his right cannot be denied. The  prime minister went on to say: Now that a new electoral system  has been adopted, I believe the people hope the next general  elections will be held under that new system. However, some  politicians feel that if the next general elections are held  under the current electoral system, it will be easier for their  parties to increase their seats.    Touching on the need to make the people fully understand the  changes in the current demarcation of constituencies that will  occur after a bill on the demarcation of single-seat  constituencies is enacted in the Diet, the prime minister  stated: Most of the people already understand the need to  change the current demarcation of constituencies. The present  situation is somewhat different from that of five or six years  ago. A certain period of time is needed to make the people  understand the new electoral system.    While speaking with Japanese correspondents, the prime  minister stressed he will call on the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] to return to the coalition to secure a majority in  the Diet, stating: I intend to seek cooperation from the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] on our policies, and I  cannot deny the possibility of creating a new framework as a  result of policy cooperation with the LDP. The realignment of  political parties is under way, and there is a possibility a  grand coalition will be formed in the future. [passage omitted  on Hata's itinerary in Italy]</p>

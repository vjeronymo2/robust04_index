			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Renamed Ratners loses Pounds 27m in dull first half - Waiting for Christmas to put a sparkle in Signet RATNERS jewellery shops, lumbered with an image problem ever since their founder's disparaging comments on some of the merchandise, are fading from the nation's High Streets almost as fast as they sprang up in the heady 1980s. The number of stores bearing Mr Gerald Ratner's name has been cut by new management from a peak of 250 to 140. But like-for-like sales at the remaining stores were down 12 per cent in the first half this year. So a further 40 stores are to be converted into H Samuel branches, a more up-market format. By this time next year, only 60 Ratner shops will remain. In a further break with its past, the company won agreement from shareholders at yesterday's AGM to change its name to Signet Group. Mr James McAdam, chairman, described the Ratners shops as one of Signet's 'two problem children'. Its falling sales were in sharp contrast with the group's other jewellery chains - H Samuel and Ernest Jones - which were 2 per cent and 4 per cent ahead respectively. The group has 1,800 shops in total. The other 'problem child' is Salisbury's, the bags and luggage store, where like-for-like sales were down 8 per cent. A new management team has been installed and the strategy behind the chain is under review. The group cut its pre-tax loss in the six months to July 31 to Pounds 26.9m (Pounds 27.7m), while the operating loss from continuing operations fell 34 per cent to Pounds 11.7m. The reduction of Pounds 6.17m in the operating loss from Pounds 17.8m last time reflected a Pounds 4.4m real improvement, with the rest coming from exchange rate benefits. The pre-tax loss last time included a gain of Pounds 3.7m on the disposal of discontinued operations. Mr McAdam said that the first half results gave no real indication of the group's progress so far as its trading was so heavily weighted towards Christmas - but he would not be drawn into making any predictions for the Christmas season. Total turnover for the group rose to Pounds 399.7m from Pounds 363.1m. But at constant exchange rates turnover was down 3 per cent, reflecting the effects of the store closure programme. Like for like sales were, however, 2 per cent ahead. Last year's improvement in gross margins from 51.9 per cent to 57.2 per cent, thanks to lower levels of discounting in the UK and cost savings from store closures, had been maintained. In the US like for like sales were 5 per cent ahead. Total interest payable was up to Pounds 15.3m from Pounds 12.3m. With US borrowings - legacy of a 1980s acquisition binge, inflated by sterling's devaluation - net group debt rose to Pounds 332m at July 31 from Pounds 255.7m a year earlier. The loss per share was 10.9p, against a previous 10.6p. Dividend payments on preference shares remain suspended. There is no interim dividend. Mr Gerald Ratner left the group last November. Last month the company's annual report showed that he and his cousin Victor had shared pay-offs for loss of office of more than Pounds 1m last year. See Lex</p>

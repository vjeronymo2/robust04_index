More than 500  Togolese who settled at Folikope, (Kakakope), and (Aziatakukope)  near Pillar Six on the Ghana-Togo border last year have deserted  their homes following alleged widespread shelling of their  villages. The fleeing Togolese, including women and children,  are all being put up temporarily at the Roman Catholic primary  school. The Ketu district secretary, Dr. Andrew Amuzukpeglo,  has met with the leaders of the new refugee groups and has  promised them shelter at a refugee camp at Kliko, which had  accommodates more than 12,000 Togolese refugees.    Meanwhile, the fleeing Togolese say Ghanaians are the main  target of persecution under a house-to-house search being  conducted by Togolese soldiers in Lome. The reports speak of  Togolese soldiers demanding Togolese identity cards from each  household. In another development, Lome radio today announced  the reopening of Togo's border with Benin and Burkina Faso, with  that of Ghana still closed.</p>

To do a good job of issuing the  accountancy certificates, the following instructions are given  on issues related to submitting "accountancy certificate"  application forms:    1. Accounting staff (and those with higher ranks) who have  been assessed by their units as to their qualifications for  professional accounting work or their special academic  qualifications in finance and economics (vocational high  schools, high school special training courses, and  post-vocational high school professional certificate courses  recognized by the economic and trade sectors) and found to be  qualified for the basic requirements set out in Section 4 of the  "Notice on the Administrative Details for Accountancy  Certificates for Foreign Economic and Trade Sectors (Draft),"  may fill out their own "accountancy certificate application  form" (see Table 1 of the "Notice on the Administrative Details  for Accountancy Certificates for Foreign Economic and Trade  Sectors (Draft)" for the format), have it signed and marked by  their unit, and send it no later than 15 December 1990 either to  units under the ministry's direct authority, or commercial  chambers, associations, academic societies, or head companies to  which their unit is subordinate in the financial sector  hierarchy.    2. Units under the ministry's direct authority, commercial  chambers, associations, academic societies, and head companies  should collect the "accountancy certificate application forms"  from their subordinate units or staff of their own units and  compile a "comprehensive table summing up the status of  accountancy certificate applicants" (see Table 2 for format) and  send it along with the accountancy certificate application forms  to MOFERT no later than 20 December. MOFERT will issue the  accountancy certificates after verification.    3. Units which have not assessed the qualifications of their  accounting workers for professional accounting work and do not  have any accounting workers who possess any post-vocational high  school special academic qualifications in finance and economics  should put the work of accountancy certificate application on  hold. These units will be notified by the ministry of the  specific date to resume such work.    4. It is imperative that units process accountancy  certificate applications in time and in accordance with the  requirements of this notice. Late applicants must wait one year  to reapply.    Units are advised to implement the notice as stated [Signed]  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [Dated] 1  December 1990</p>

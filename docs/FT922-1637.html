			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Boycott threat over Cambodia talks A 32-nation ministerial conference on rebuilding Cambodia is due to open in Tokyo today amid conflicting reports about whether Mr Khieu Samphan, leader of the communist Khmer Rouge, will boycott the meetings. Hopes that the Khmer Rouge had dropped its opposition to the meeting, where pledges of nearly Dollars 600m for the reconstruction of Cambodia are being sought, were raised on Saturday when Mr Khieu unexpectedly arrived in Tokyo. However, Mr Khieu told reporters after a meeting of the country's Supreme National Council (SNC), which groups all four main Cambodian factions, that he would not attend. Subsequently, Kyodo News Service quoted a senior Foreign Ministry official as saying that he would. A boycott of the meeting by Mr Khieu would leave the Khmer Rouge even more isolated, as its refusal to participate in the disarmament phase of a UN-brokered peace settlement has already cast doubt on the future of the country. The Khmer Rouge has refused to lay down arms until Vietnamese troops have left the country. Vietnam says its troops have all done so. Today's conference is a centrepiece of Japan's efforts to play a larger role in seeking a solution to the Cambodian conflict. Tokyo is expected to pledge Dollars 150m to the effort and the government is looking at whether it should send troops from its self-defence forces to Cambodia. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, president of the SNC, said he would like troops from Japan to construct roads and bridges in his country under the control of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia.</p>

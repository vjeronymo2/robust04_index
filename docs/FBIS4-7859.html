			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dominika Wielowieyska and Waldemar Kumor: </F> "Rosati in Return for Budget; Peace at Top?"]    [Text] The coalition would no longer insist on  Rosati's candidacy, and it would also amend the neo-popiwek  [wage-controlling] law along the lines of what the presidents  wants. The president would sign the budget and also approve,  without any reservations, a new candidate for finance minister  put forward by the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. It is  possible that such decisions will be made as soon as tomorrow [7  April] if a summit meeting between Walesa, Pawlak, and  Kwasniewski takes place.    Prime Minister Pawlak is said to have promised the SLD that  he will do everything in his power to persuade the president to  hold such a meeting at the end of the week.    We learned unofficially that the prime minister told Sejm  Speaker Jozef Oleksy (SLD) yesterday that a meeting at the  Belweder "has very good chances of materializing."    Right before Easter, the prime minister telephoned Dariusz  Rosati, the SLD candidate for finance minister, and asked him  not to give up, despite the president's rejection of his  candidacy. Professor Rosati confirmed yesterday, while talking  with GAZETA WYBORCZA, that the coalition members continue to ask  him not to withdrawal his candidacy until the dispute is finally  resolved. But he is aware that his chances are slim.    "The president has already rejected the candidacy once,  and I do not think he will change his mind," Lech  Falandysz, minister of state in the President's Office, told us  yesterday.    The coalition wants to overcome the deadlock by suggesting a  deal: Perhaps it could give Rosati up, but it is waiting for  assurances from the president that he will approve the next  candidate submitted by the SLD. The coalition is also hoping  that the president will sign the Budget Law, despite his earlier  threats to veto the measure.    In return, the Polish Peasant Party and the SLD could show  remorse and admit that the neo-popiwek law, which was vetoed by  the president, requires amendments. It is true that both  parties intend to overrule the presidential veto, but the only  goal of that would be to move for an amendment to the law, using  urgent proceedings, and, in the course of the amendments, the  presidential reservations would be taken into account.    The issue is primarily about amending the legal provision  pertaining to the government's introduction of wage controls in  all companies, should "the country's financial stability be  endangered." The coalition is not sitting idly by. We found out  at the Finance Ministry that proceedings to amend the law have  reached an advanced stage.    The solution could satisfy both parties because the  continuity of wage controls would be maintained. The Sejm would  overrule the president's veto, and the law would then become  effective retroactive to 1 April, while the parliament would  amend the law within a month and a half.    Will Lech Walesa decide on a cease-fire? One does not know.  It is also hard to predict whether the coalition's leaders will  not begin arguing among themselves at the last moment once again.</p>

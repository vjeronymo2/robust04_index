			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> THYSSEN MOVING ART TO SPAIN  </P> <P> Baron Hans Heinrich von Thyssen, the West German steel billionaire, is moving  out of Lugano for artistic and financial reasons. Thyssen, who has long argued  that Switzerland does not offer any attractive tax advantages, is offering to  sell Villa Favorita, his home-cum-museum, to the town but officials declined to  comment on reports that the asking price is $30 million.  </P> <P> The baron also failed to convince both Lugano and Swiss federal authorities  that they should contribute to the cost of extending the villa if they want his  art collection to remain in Switzerland. Last year Thyssen decided to move the  most important works in his priceless collection to Madrid, his wife's  hometown. Unlike Switzerland, Spain readily agreed to build an extension to the  Prado museum to house the 1,400-painting collection, which is ranked second  only in the world to that of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.  </P></p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Elec plans expansion into Finland Yorkshire Electricity is to be the first regional electricity company to expand its core businesses of distribution and supply outside the UK. It announced yesterday that it was in discussions with the city of Turku, Finland, about the possible acquisition of its electricity distribution and district heating businesses. Mr Tony Coleman, group finance director, said he thought Yorkshire was 'about six weeks from a final decision' by the municipal authorities of Turku which has about 50,000 customers. He described the deal under negotiation as 'low-risk and sticking to our core skills'. It would be 'pretty arms-length', he added, involving mainly 'experience and expertise' after the cash contribution.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As of March 1, 1994, these forms were being processed by the Department's central processing facility. Approximately 85 percent of reporting agencies (3,655 HAs) are submitting paper forms. This extensive processing of paper forms has become a burden to the HAs as well as to HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To reduce the cost to the Department of processing this information and to improve its accuracy, the Department is issuing this proposed rule to require that the information be submitted electronically. The change is expected to contribute significant savings to the Department, in a time when budget contraints demand such savings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Housing agencies that report on paper have the time consuming task of completing the calculations which are prone to error. The Department edits the information on the forms. When errors are found, HAs are notified (by letter) and requested to make appropriate corrections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The time spent by HAs in initiating electronic transmission and making corrections to the electronic data submissions will be offset by future savings in the reexamination and reporting process, as well as increased accuracy and speed associated with the admission, reexamination and reporting processes, and the reduced number of HUD adjustments and paperwork required by these adjustments. This change to electronic submission of family data will also encourage HAs to automate other functions or to automate this particular function as they automate others, in the course of revising their own management practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule will require HAs to submit data electronically via telephone modem, rather than through tape, diskette, or paper. However, the rule also provides that the Department may approve transmission of the data by tape or diskette where the Department determines that the cost of telephonic transmission would be excessive. (It is contemplated that this would only occur in a few instances, involving very large HAs.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Voluntary Automation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several years ago, the Department began to develop a computer system to collect all rental assistance data and ensure the accuracy of subsidy payments. This system serves as the basis for the Department's electronic data transmission requirements in lieu of hard copy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In July 1993, the Department distributed a Form HUD&hyph;50058 Information Packet, which gave instructions for submitting the data electronically. The Department encouraged program participants to begin transmitting data electronically to HUD (via tape, diskette, or telephonic network). Approximately 600 housing agencies have responded by submitting the data electronically. Recently, the Department initiated a pilot test with 20 HAs using the telephonic network mode (via SprintMail_a commercial software package) to evaluate HA capability for data transmission. In addition, a test program (for use by all HAs) has been initiated to assure that errors are not introduced by the sender's software. Both processes will facilitate implementation of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These electronic transmissions consist of information requested on the forms, organized into various categories and transmitted in an ASCII fixed format (not field delimited). These fixed format ASCII files will deliver the data with the field lengths as specified by HUD in the July 1993 guide. (This guide may be obtained from the office listed above for program information.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department encourages HAs to begin electronic transmission as soon as the capability exists. An earlier electronic transmission will allow timely correction of errors found during the data load into the automated software. These corrections will then reduce the number of errors formerly found when manual information entered the Department's system. Early electronic transmission will also help minimize an initial surge of data in the system from the number of currently nonautomated HAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Action Required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nonautomated HAs (i.e. those who currently prepare the Forms HUD&hyph;50058 and HUD&hyph;50058&hyph;FSS manually) should immediately begin to obtain information on the cost of purchasing hardware or software, or both, to determine whether it is financially feasible to purchase these items or whether they should contract out the electronic transmission of data to another entity. These HAs must: (1) Complete the search and either purchase the necessary hardware and software, or sign service contracts, (2) complete their data loading, and (3) begin electronic transmission by one year after the publication of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

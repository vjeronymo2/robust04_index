			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Russia is Active Again] </F>   [Text] Russia has recently made a strenuous effort to  regain its influence. Moscow's representatives in the UN  Security Council and the CSCE have proposed several times that  Russia be regarded as the only peacekeeping force in the former  Soviet Union's territory. However, although the international  community has adopted a cautious approach, Russia's leaders  continue to insist on that view. It will be recalled that  several international meetings and symposiums have rejected that  idea.    Russia's military units have been deployed in Georgia with  the consent of that Republic's leaders. They have been assigned  to end the dispute between Abkhaziya and Georgia and establish  peace. However, it is common knowledge that they do not [words  indistinct]    Meanwhile, Russia's interest in Azerbaijan is gradually  increasing. That country's media organs claimed some time ago  that Russia wishes to establish a base in Azerbaijan but Baku  has failed to approve Moscow's proposal on the matter. The  media organs also claimed that Russia's troops will be deployed  in Karabakh. That, too, was a wrong report. It is common  knowledge that Azerbaijan's leaders are categorically opposed to  the deployment of Russia's troops in Karabakh. President Aliyev  and several other officials believe that the deployment of  Russia's forces may prolong the peaceful settlement of the  dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan and obstruct the  withdrawal of the Armenian armed groups from our republic's  occupied territories. In view of that, Baku is opposed to that  idea.    Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov, President Boris Yeltsin's  special envoy, arrived in our region a few days ago. He was  accompanied by Deputy Defense Minister G. Kondratyev.  Undoubtedly, their arrival was linked to Russia's deployment of  its peacekeeping forces in Karabakh. Baku outlined its position  and noted that the deployment of Russia's troops on the border  between Armenia and Azerbaijan would be more appropriate.  Azerbaijan's residential areas would not be fired on from  Armenia and the Republic's people would find an opportunity to  live in peace and attend to their daily work.    Russia made a new proposal for the peaceful solution of the  dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan in February. A  cease-fire agreement was reached, which would be put into effect  on 1 March. Undoubtedly, that was welcomed. Naturally, Russia  could have used that agreement to strengthen its influence.  Unfortunately, however, we wish to note that the cease-fire  agreement was short-lived. The Armenian side violated it, as it  has done so several times in the past. Meanwhile, Moscow was  expected to warn Yerevan to force it to remain committed to the  agreement.    It is common knowledge that Russia was eager to participate  in the effort made to end the dispute in Bosnia. In fact, it  has achieved its objective to a certain degree. Moscow wished  to use the experience it gained in Bosnia in Azerbaijan.    Meanwhile, it will be recalled that Baku has disclosed  several times that it supports the peaceful solution of the  dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Furthermore, it has  confirmed its approach through the steps it has taken thus far.  Nevertheless, Azerbaijan's leaders call for the liberation of  all the occupied territories and the removal of all the Armenian  armed groups from our Republic. It is only then that Azerbaijan  can hold talks for the solution of the problem. Moscow is  well-aware of Baku's position. It will be recalled that Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev supported Azerbaijan's draft plan and  described it as a constructive document that is acceptable to  all the sides concerned.    However, it seems that Russia is unable to relinquish its  ambitions. Moscow must comply with international agreements and  law. That is how it can regain its influence.</p>

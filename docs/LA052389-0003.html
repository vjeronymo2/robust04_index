			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STRUIKSMA ISSUES ULTIMATUM ON ROAD CLOSURE  </P> <P> If the result of a San Diego City Council committee hearing Monday is any  indication, closing a dusty dirt road in North County might turn into a  regional issue when the matter comes before the full council June 13.  </P> <P> After an hour of testimony for and against closing Black Mountain Road west of  Rancho Penasquitos, Councilman Ed Struiksma lost his temper and threatened --  in fact, promised -- that, if the east-west link between Penasquitos and the  coast is closed, he will push to shut the north-south Black Mountain link  between Rancho Penasquitos and Mira Mesa.  </P> <P> Struiksma, who represents Mira Mesa, argued that, if the east-west Black  Mountain link to Interstate 5 on the coast is closed, 2,000 more motorists will  become "transient traffic" on Mira Mesa arterials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shortcuts to Work and Home  </P> <P> He said that Mira Mesa's streets already are congested with traffic from  elsewhere using them as shortcuts to work and home. If Black Mountain Road to  the coast is closed, Struiksma said, he will seek closure of Black Mountain  Road to the south, inconveniencing about 10,000 Rancho Penasquitos commuters  who now use the route to avoid traffic tie-ups on Interstate 15.  </P> <P> His ultimatum came during a council committee hearing on temporary closure of  Black Mountain Road from Penasquitos west to Del Mar.  </P> <P> Struiksma pointed out that the city's aim in closing the "back door" route from  Rancho Penasquitos is to limit San Diego's liability for accidents occurring on  the 1 1/2-mile unpaved stretch that is labeled substandard under city  guidelines.  </P> <P> The route, which meanders through the undeveloped "urban reserve" -- land  precluded from development until after 1996 in the city's general plan -- is  used by more than 2,000 motorists daily to commute to the coast.  </P> <P> If the unpaved part of the road is closed, opponents argue, the traffic will be  added to the already congested arterials in Mira Mesa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only Outlet  </P> <P> "So, if we close one part of (Black Mountain) roadway, I hope we are prepared  to close two," Struiksma said.  </P> <P> Closure of Black Mountain Road at both its western and southern ends would  leave about 33,000 Rancho Penasquitos residents with I-15 as their only outlet.  </P> <P> Councilmen Ron Roberts and Wes Pratt favored closing the east-west section of  Black Mountain, citing the dirt road's safety hazards and the city's liability.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer sided with Struiksma, arguing that the unpaved  road should remain open until alternate routes, such as Carmel Valley Road and  Route 56 are opened.  </P> <P> Deputy City Manager Jack McCrory said signs will be posted on the dirt part of  Black Mountain Road warning motorists of the end of city-maintained roadway and  that they proceed at their own risk. He acknowledged that this may not protect  the city from lawsuits by motorists who incur property damage or injury on the  unimproved section of the route.  </P> <P> Roberts said the council, in closed sessions scheduled for today, will hear of  lawsuit after lawsuit filed by motorists who claim the city street where they  had an accident was substandard.  </P> <P> Black Mountain Road, Roberts said, "is one incredible liability this city is  carrying," which should be closed until money can be found to bring it up to  minimum city street standards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Balloon Firms Fighting It  </P> <P> Among groups opposing the closure were balloon-ride companies, which said the  road -- the only east-west connector in a 40-square-mile area -- is necessary  for the industry because chase cars must negotiate the area to arrive at  isolated sites where the balloons land, as well as members of Immanuel Baptist  Church of Rancho Penasquitos, who protested that their proposed church site  along Black Mountain Road would be inaccessible to half the parishioners if the  road were blocked.  </P> <P> Speaking in favor of the closure were residents of the Woodcrest subdivision of  Rancho Penasquitos, who said the safety of neighborhood children is threatened  by speeding cars and heavy trucks traveling through narrow residential streets  on their way to the road.  </P> <P> City staff members recommended the temporary closure of the road, listing as an  alternative the creation of another entry to the route from Carmel Valley Road  that would avoid the Woodcrest subdivision. Cost of the bypass was estimated at  $1.8 million.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 7 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The outline of the Ministry of Finance [MOF] draft  budget for fiscal year 1994 has been set, except for the  unresolved dispute on the income tax cut and the national  welfare tax.    The rate of increase for general operating expenditures will  be 2.4 percent, compared to the original budget for fiscal 1993,  representing the lowest growth rate in six years. However, all  requests for allocations for public work projects were approved,  showing consideration for the sluggish economy.    In terms of taxation, the expansion of preferential  treatment  for land replacement, and the strengthening of taxation on  corporate unaccounted expenditures and entertainment expenses  have been decided upon. However, coordination within the  government and among the ruling coalition parties on the income  tax cut and the accompanying tax hike has been delayed until 7  February, and if a conclusion is not reached, this may seriously  affect the schedule for the unofficial announcement of the MOF  draft budget (originally set for 10 February).</p>

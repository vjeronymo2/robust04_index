			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Beijing lifts many price controls CHINA has taken an important step towards liberalising the economy with the announcement that price controls have been lifted on 593 items and materials, ranging from soda ash to electrical machinery, agencies report from Beijing. The move will allow producers, most of which are state-owned, to determine their own prices according to market conditions. It reduces the number of commodities directly priced by bureaucrats in Beijing to 89 from the 737 at the end of 1991. While the reform falls short of establishing a fully free market, it reflects how swiftly China has embraced a call in January by Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, for economic reform and faster growth. China yesterday raised its estimate for economic growth during the first half of 1992 to a 12 per cent annual rate. Zou Jiahua, vice premier and head of the State Planning Commission, said the growth rate, up from an earlier estimate of 10.6 per cent and the original official 1992 target of 6 per cent, would require further reforms. Despite fears that the growth will push up inflation and cause a boom-bust cycle, Zou said: 'Supply on the domestic market is ample and retail prices are generally stable.' The national price index rose by 4.9 per cent in the first half of 1992 against the same 1991 period, he said. A State Price Bureau official, quoted by the official Xinhua news agency, said the latest liberalisation of prices 'would not have too great an impact on the prices of consumer goods'.</p>

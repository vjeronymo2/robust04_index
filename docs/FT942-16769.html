			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Predictable reaction Sir, Your publication of the letter (March 30) by Jersey politicians criticising your survey on the island (March 22) has aroused a predictable furore, with accusations of disloyalty and, in the case of the local press, the 'sin' of running Jersey down in front of outsiders. Such a response smacks more of a totalitarian than a democratic state. It would be unthinkable for an American to be treated this way for being critical to a foreign newspaper of political life in the US. Employed people are particularly vulnerable here. The close circle of local and imported managers and businessmen can make it difficult for those who do not 'toe the line'. They may be denied promotion or even lose their jobs. Any relief in unemployment is at the discretion of local connetables (mayors) or their committees, who can insist on households getting loans on their houses or moving to premises with lower rents. For employers there are plenty of replacements 'off the boat' for what is frequently low-paid work in an increasingly expensive place to live. Adrian A Walton, 'Le Pre', St Martin, Jersey, Channel Islands</p>

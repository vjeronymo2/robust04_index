			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Made strictly to order - Wine YOU want a Spanish Sauvignon that tastes like a New Zealand one? A white wine made from claret grapes? A Muscadet from the south of France? A Moldovan Chardonnay? No problem. New product development is not an activity commonly associated with wine. Until now, wine retailers have had to sell what comes out of the world's wineries, traditionally dictated by viticultural history, appellation laws, indigenous winemaking skills and the weather. But in the only sector of the wine market where there is real activity at the moment, the Pounds 1.99 to Pounds 5.99 a bottle bracket, this has been changing rapidly. A handful of middlemen have been creating new lines expressly for Britain's supermarkets and dominant off-licence chains. The key is to take expertise to the winery, and dictate rather than await what is produced there. This running up of special little wine numbers to order sounds quintessentially entrepreneurial, but no less a force than Allied Lyons took a serious interest two years ago, through its wine sourcing subsidiary International Wine Services. In a small office in Beaconsfield in the English Home Counties, the IWS staff regularly meets to pool observations from around the globe on what the wine buyer wants, and what specific wineries might be cajoled by an outside winemaker into producing (all of the above, for a start). The formula works only in certain areas, ideally those with a good supply of relatively inexpensive grapes whose technical potential is yet to be realised. That cuts out all of the classic wine regions, as well as most of the New World, but it leaves vast tracts of southern France, Iberia, Italy, South Africa, South America and eastern Europe, all of which are currently being combed for suitable wineries by IWS and its competitors. The obvious competitor is Hugh Ryman, son of former stationer Ryman, trained in Australia and now based in Bordeaux. He was not the first to harness the under-utilised skills of southern hemisphere winemakers for the European grape harvest, but he commercialised the Flying Winemaker concept into plaudits and vast orders from the likes of Whitbread's Thresher group and Majestic wine warehouses. New World winemaking techniques are applied to fruit grown in the south of France and eastern Europe to turn it into something the market, or at least Thresher's buying team, wants. He sells Britain a host of labels from Duras, Bergerac et al, and now he is making wines in Moldova for Australian wine company Penfolds. The targeted wineries have to be of a certain sort too. They should ideally be technically well-equipped - installing a winemaker for two to four months costs very much less than installing plant - and willing to let a stranger, typically a young Australian stranger, tell their staff what to do. This is probably the most significant limiting factor. As Guy Anderson, IWS's 30-year-old roving French specialist, admits: 'Some of these wineries are run by people who have been making wine since before I was born'. And IWS's latest recruit Kym Milne (ex-New Zealand via a stint for Hugh Ryman) found himself, prior to joining IWS, in the uncomfortable position of being installed in a winery where the management desperately wanted him but the staff were obstructive. Indeed it is only the winery ownership which stands to gain directly from increased quality, and increased saleability, of itswines (which is why the formula works particularly well in co-operatives). But once an outside team is installed in a winery, the proportion of wine made by the outsider tends to increase with each vintage as the winery owners see the truckloads being shipped out to the likes of Waitrose and Safeway. Perhaps the most obvious application of this new philosophy of shipping braincells rather than grapes is IWS's International Winemaker range for Tesco, all made by their most peripatetic oenologist Jacques Lurton but in places as dissimilar as Mendoza in Argentina, Rueda in Spain and Languedoc in France. It comes complete with his signature. So personalised is it that Tesco must be worried about him falling under a bus. The number of air miles this unmarried 34-year-old product of Bordeaux via Australia has to notch up each year suggests it would have to be an airport transfer bus, but Tesco is surely right to worry. Lurton has made so many wines for IWS, let alone those he makes with his brother for European customers under the JFL label, he must be heading for burnout soon. Scouting a new wine region from scratch can take months, but IWS is able to harness Allied's own tentacular international distribution network to save winery inspection time. All eyes east for 1993, but they know that, for volume, they depend more on refining the quality of familiar names than on constantly dishing up something new. I tasted some of the new IWS lines that will appear in British stores next week and can recommend those in the box. They may taste more of Roseworthy, Australia's oenology school, than of peasants and passion but they are, presumably, just what we want. SAUVIGNON RUEDA 1992. Pounds 3.99 Oddbins and Sainsbury. Pure gooseberry reek. You would never pick this aromatic dry white as Spanish. VIOGNIER 1992. Pounds 5.49. Tesco. A particularly successful Vin de Pays d'Oc supplying the Condrieu experience at two-thirds the price. DOMAINE DE BACHELLERY 1992. Pounds 3.69. Oddbins. A red Vin de Pays d'Oc made from Syrah and Merlot grapes given zip, life and a Drink Me ticket.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRIGHT VIOLATED RULES, PANEL TENTATIVELY FINDS;  </P> <P> HOUSE ETHICS COMMITTEE CITES SPEAKER'S FAILURE TO REPORT BENEFITS FROM TEXAS  PARTNER AS GIFTS  </P> <P> The House Ethics Committee has concluded tentatively that Speaker Jim Wright  (D-Tex.) broke House rules by failing to report as gifts a number of benefits  received from a Texas business partner, a source close to the investigation  said Monday.  </P> <P> The panel provisionally agreed with its special counsel, Chicago attorney  Richard J. Phelan, that the partnership was used to funnel gifts to Wright in  the form of an almost rent-free apartment, a Cadillac and an annual $18,000  salary for his wife, the source said.  </P> <P> House rules require members to report gifts of $100 or more on annual financial  disclosure forms.  </P> <P> The committee is still considering whether Wright circumvented a limit on  outside income for House members by promoting bulk sales of his book of memoirs  to political supporters, the source said.  </P> <P> The disclosure came as the 12-member ethics panel prepared to begin today what  its members hope will be their final week of deliberations on a preliminary  inquiry into the Speaker's financial affairs and conduct.  </P> <P> Its report, expected at the end of this week or next week, is widely expected  to present a "statement of possible violations," a finding similar to an  indictment.  </P> <P> Wright then would get an opportunity to present his defense. After that the  committee would issue a ruling or recommend that the full House take action  against him. A decision by the House to reprimand or censure Wright could force  him to resign as Speaker.  </P> <P> Wright has acknowledged that he may have used bad judgment or committed  technical violations of House rules without meaning to do so. He has contended  that his wife, Betty, earned her pay by doing research for a real estate firm  and that the use of the car and apartment were furnished as fringe benefits.  The Wrights later bought the car and the apartment.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a defender of the Speaker confirmed that the Ethics Committee was  focusing on Wright's complex financial ties with the Texas businessman, Ft.  Worth developer George A. Mallick Jr., and the controversial book publishing  arrangement that brought Wright $55,000 in royalty payments.  </P> <P> Rep. Martin Frost (D-Tex.) said that Wright's attorney, William C. Oldaker, had  prepared a document listing the alleged violations of House rules cited by  Phelan, along with a defense of the Speaker's position on each violation.  </P> <P> More than 50 members of the House already have been briefed on the issues being  considered by the panel, Frost said.  </P> <P> In a related development, CBS News reported late Monday that the committee  already has voted to accuse Wright of more than 30 ethics violations. A  spokesman for Wright, Mark Johnson, labeled the broadcast as "absurd" and said  the Speaker had no information of that nature.  </P> <P> Rep. John T. Myers (R-Ind.), a member of the ethics panel, declined to comment  on whether the committee has started voting on the charges against Wright.  "There's a lot of speculation," Myers said. "There's some truth to some of it  and some of it is just wrong."  </P> <P> He said that there is a good chance that the committee will issue its findings  this week but that the action could be delayed until next week.  </P> <P> "We're a long way from announcing our results," said another member of the  committee, who asked not to be identified. He said final votes had not been  taken on the allegations against Wright.  </P> <P> Wright initially brushed aside the charges against him as the work of  Republican extremists, but the Speaker and his friends now are taking them much  more seriously. Senior House Democrats, in fact, have said privately that they  are seriously troubled by press reports of the case against their leader.  </P> <P> Wright's business ties with Mallick grew from a friendship that started more  than a quarter-century ago in Ft. Worth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Business Partnership  </P> <P> The Speaker's wife was paid $18,000 a year by a Mallick-owned company in 1978  and 1979. From 1980 to 1984, she received the same salary from Mallightco, an  investment partnership created by the Wrights and Mallick and his wife,  Marlene. Each couple made contributions valued at $58,000 to finance a half  share of the venture.  </P> <P> In addition to the salary received by Betty Wright, the Wrights were allowed to  use a Ft. Worth condominium owned by the Mallick family, at first without  paying rent and later for a $22 daily rate.  </P> <P> The committee's special counsel contends that Mallightco was created  essentially as a conduit to allow Mallick to funnel income and benefits to the  Speaker and his wife, sources close to the committee said.  </P> <P> Although Betty Wright has remained silent on the matter, Wright has said that  she earned her salary by doing research on possible investments for the  company. Phelan reportedly has argued that she did little to justify her pay.  </P> <P> Although the Speaker reported the salary received by his wife as income on his  annual financial disclosure reports, he did not characterize it as a gift. He  did not list the use of the apartment or the 1979 Cadillac provided to his wife  during the six-year period.  </P></p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Canary Wharf tenants warn Major PROSPECTIVE tenants of Canary Wharf are warning Mr John Major that unless the Jubilee underground railway line is extended into east London they will reconsider their decision to move to Docklands. In letters to the prime minister, present and prospective tenants of the east London development, which is in administration under UK insolvency procedures, urge Mr Major to take action in helping to finance the extension of the Jubilee line. The tenants want the government to take advantage of the offer from the Canary Wharf administrators to finance a private sector contribution for the line by selling a building to the government. In the Commons yesterday, Steven Norris, minister for transport in the capital, said construction could not start until the eventual owners of Canary Wharf pledged to pay their contribution. 'We see no prospect of authorising the start of construction unless, and until, that contribution is assured,' he told MPs. The tenants, including the US oil company Texaco and investment banks Credit Suisse First Boston and Bear Stearns, said they opted for Canary Wharf on the understanding that the government was committed to regenerating London's Docklands, but now feared the area was trapped in a downward spiral. Before signing up for Canary Wharf, they had each been shown a letter from the chief executive of the London Docklands Development Corporation, the official body in charge of redeveloping the area, promising that Docklands would 'become the most accessible location in the central London area by 1992'. Docklands is now perceived as completely inaccessible, they said. Additional pressure to build the Jubilee extension come from a coalition of Docklands businesses and community representatives who sent Mr Major a petition backing the line. On Wednesday, government ministers and advisers - including Mr John Wakeham, lord privy seal, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury - are due to meet to evaluate the Canary Wharf offer. The environment department needs 350,000 sq ft to relocate the bulk of its civil servants and is considering three Docklands sites, including Canary Wharf. The proposal to sell the government a Canary Wharf building has broad ministerial support, although the Treasury is sceptical. An official there said the development had to demonstrate that it offered value for money. The administrators have told the government that if it wants to rent rather than buy, Canary Wharf could still contribute to the Jubilee line extension by raising new loan finance on any government-rented building. The 11 banks which have lent Pounds 576m to finance the development of Canary Wharf met yesterday to evaluate this rescue strategy. Property, Page 27</p>

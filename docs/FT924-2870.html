			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring benefits at Avon AVON RUBBER announced a 36 per cent jump in profits, before exceptionals, to Pounds 9.15m as the components and tyre manufacturer reaped the benefits of a year-long restructuring programme. Sales rose less sharply, from Pounds 227.2m to Pounds 232.2m, for the 12 months to October 3. At the pre-tax level profit came to Pounds 9.36m, compared with Pounds 965,000 after exceptionals of Pounds 5.76m. Project Nova, code-name for the restructuring, yielded cost savings of Pounds 3.5m in the year. Mr John Harper, finance director, said Avon expected to benefit by a further Pounds 2.5m this year. Total restructuring costs would not exceed last year's exceptional provision. In the year just ended, Avon benefited from a small exceptional gain of Pounds 208,000. Strongest performance came from the tyre business, which manufactures high performance products for the racing industry. Operating profits rose by Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 4.8m, helped by higher exports. Cadillac, the group's US car parts subsidiary, jumped Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 4.1m at the operating level. Mr Tony Mitchard, chief executive, said he was confident Cadillac had increased its share of the automotive market, with sales 19 per cent higher compared with a sector rise of just 9 per cent. Mr Mitchard said there was just one cloud over Cadillac's horizon. Avon was 'somewhat concerned about some aspects of its business with General Motors', which accounts for 30 per cent of Cadillac sales. It was likely, he said, that the vehicle manufacturer would try to put pressure on suppliers for lower prices. The group was actively seeking to expand Cadillac's non-automotive business, such as rubber grips for golf clubs. The inflatables business had been turned round from a Pounds 1.8m loss to a minor profit. Geographically, Mr Mitchard said the UK was Avon's most depressed market with profits down by Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 4.9m. The previous year had benefited from the Gulf war. By contrast, continental Europe and the US had improved significantly. Mr Mitchard warned, however, there were signs of worsening conditions in Europe, particularly in Germany. The final dividend is maintained at 11.5p for a total of 16.5p, the same as last year. Earnings per share improved from 1p to 29.2p. COMMENT Avon has won at least half the battle, with a well-managed restructuring completed on budget and on time. The good results helped to fuel the shares' rise from 410p to 435p. However, there are still some hefty questions hanging over the group, as evidenced by Avon's cautious approach to the dividend. Any improvement in the US economy - which appears to be the only real bright spot for 1993 - is likely to be depressed by price pressures from manufacturers such as General Motors. The same scenario is almost inevitable in Europe this year. On the other hand, Avon has spent good money on growth projects such as the joint ventures in air conditioning and anti-vibration. Forecasts are for about Pounds 11m with a prospective p/e of some 12.5. The shares look fully valued for the moment.</p>

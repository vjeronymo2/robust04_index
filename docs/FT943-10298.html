			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Derivatives seen as adding to market volatility A majority of respondents to a survey on the use of derivatives by institutional investors feel the instruments are causing an increase in market volatility. However, there was a considerable difference between the response from those who are users and those who are not; 41.4 per cent of users thought the effect was to increase volatility while 70.7 per cent of non-users also thought so. The survey, produced by Euromoney Publications, draws its conclusions from the responses of 220 participants which consisted of investment management companies, insurance companies, pension funds, banks and stockbrokers. When analysed by respondent type, commodity trading advisers were all users, as expected, but only 55 per cent of banks and 50 per cent of stockbrokers use such instruments. While only 59.7 per cent of investment managers were users, the figure for pension funds was 80 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> GLENDALE UNABLE TO STEM ROLLING HILLS TIDE, 63-49  </P> <P> Despite three starting players shorter than 5-foot-11, Glendale High was able  to neutralize Rolling Hills' high-powered offense for a quarter Friday night.  </P> <P> Then Rolling Hills began to do just that -- roll.  </P> <P> The taller Titans recovered from their slow start and knocked off Glendale,  63-49, in a championship semifinal game of the Beverly Hills tournament.  </P> <P> After being outscored, 12-8, in the first quarter, Rolling Hills (5-2) exploded  for 28 second-quarter points -- while limiting the Dynamiters (5-4) to seven --  to put the game out of reach early.  </P> <P> "The game got out of our tempo in the second period, and when they made a few  shots we started rushing," Glendale Coach Bob Davidson said.  </P> <P> Dex Puno led Glendale with 17 points. Center Jason Harper contributed 12 and  Ronny Apcar added 10.  </P> <P> Glendale will meet Buena, a 97-79 loser to Beverly Hills, in the third-place  game at 7 tonight.  </P> <P> In other tournament games:  </P> <P> Rio Mesa 69, Santa Maria 62 -- In a consolation semifinal, forward Eric Thomas  scored a career-high 36 points, grabbed 14 rebounds and blocked three shots for  the Spartans.  </P> <P> Palisades 49, Saugus 35 -- Forward Aaron Volpe scored 13 points to pace Saugus  (2-5), which limited Palisades to seven points in the fourth quarter but was  never able to trim the second-half deficit to less than 10 points.  </P></p>

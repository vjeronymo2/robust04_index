			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent  a note to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs on some  distortions in Polish publications.    The Polish Information Agency has been distributing at the  parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg a  publication entitled "Outlines of the History of the Polish  State," in which the Vilnius area is included in Poland.    The information and press department of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs states that attention is drawn in the note to  the fact that the distribution of such publications on the eve  of the meeting of the Lithuanian and Polish presidents cannot  but provoke a negative assessment by Lithuanian society and does  not contribute to the consolidation of good relations between  the two countries.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Nomura buys Slovak fund stake Nomura Securities has taken a substantial minority stake in VUB Kupon, a large investment fund in Slovakia, in one of the biggest foreign investments in the country so far. VUB Invest, a unit of Vseobecma Uberova Banka which manages the fund, said Nomura had bought just over 2.9m shares in VUB Kupon from the bank for Kcs750 each, valuing the transaction at Kcs2.18bn (Dollars 61m) and giving it a 26 per cent stake in the fund. The Japanese firm bought its stake from VUB, Slovakia's biggest commercial bank, after the National Bank of Slovakia ordered it to reduce its holding from 30 per cent. Under new banking rules, a Slovak bank cannot own more than 10 per cent of an investment fund. After the sale the bank owns 4 per cent of VUB Kupon. Some 300,000 private and institutional Slovak investors own the majority of its shares. VUB Kupon was set up during the first wave of voucher privatisation - which allowed Slovaks to invest in companies being sold off - in the former Czechoslovakia and is the biggest fund in independent Slovakia, with a portfolio valued at almost Kcs5bn. Its shares are traded on the Bratislava stock exchange and are priced at Kcs500. The fund's net asset value is Kcs1,460. The fund has substantial stakes in many of Slovakia's industrial companies which were partly privatised through the voucher system. Many private investors sold their vouchers to funds such as VUB Kupon, which then used them to invest in state assets being sold by the government.</p>

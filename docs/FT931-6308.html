			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brabant returns to the black BRABANT Resources, the oil and gas explorer being stalked by fellow USM company Aberdeen Petroleum, yesterday announced a return to the black with profits of Pounds 366,000 for the year to December 31. The turnround, which compared with a loss of Pounds 4.8m last time, was struck on sales 86 per cent higher at Pounds 5.4m. The improvement was largely due to the acquisition of producing assets from Monument Oil &amp; Gas in the second half. Brabant said it had increased average net oil production during the year by 52 per cent to 1,786 barrels per day. The Monument acquisition had left it well placed to fund future exploration, the company said. Brabant could 'rely on internally generated funds to support its exploration and development programme for the foreseeable future'. Mr Malcolm Butler, managing director, said the group could now begin exploring its own prospects, as opposed to ones dictated by obligations such as those arising through acquisitions. A substantial drilling programme, to be funded through cash flow, was planned for 1994. It was unlikely that the company would seek investment from shareholders for this programme. Any payment of a dividend would depend on exploration success - as in previous years there is again no pay-out.</p>

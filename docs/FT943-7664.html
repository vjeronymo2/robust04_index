			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Britain needs broadband network Sir, John Harper's personal view on the UK superhighway ('Riding tandem along UK superhighway', August 12) deserves national attention. Society at large, and most immediately within the OECD world, faces a challenge in how to reorganise itself as a necessary readjustment to the shift in comparative advantage in many industrial and commercial sectors to the Pacific Basin and Far East. The introduction of universal broadband access is one of the essential elements facilitating such a reorganisation. It would also provide the means for the OECD world to create whole new market sectors exploiting broadband applications as yet unimagined, and this would do more to generate new and lasting employment opportunities than much on the current political agenda. John Harper's recommendation that BT, Mercury, the cable companies and others with an interest in introducing universal broadband access join together to create a national broadband infrastructure separate from their competing service companies is very sound and has a good tradition in the history of international communications. The carrier community is quite accustomed to joining together to build common international infrastructure, whether submarine, cable or satellite, and to compete sometimes viciously over this infrastructure for customer service. Indeed, Intelsat and Inmarsat were founded by the carrier community and their governments to share risks in introducing what was then new technology with no certain market. Why cannot the various carriers playing in the UK market do the same to create the UK superhighway and why cannot the UK government and the industry regulator Oftel provide the necessary incentives? This is a national question requiring full national debate. Jonathan Solomon, executive director, Strategy and Corporate Business Development, Cable &amp; Wireless plc, London, WC1X 8RX</p>

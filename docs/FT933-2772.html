			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Georgian rebels launch attack MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, narrowly escaped injury from shells yesterday after rushing to Sukhumi, capital of the breakaway region of Abkhazia, vowing to combat rebels with his bare hands, Reuter reports from Tbilisi. The rebels were fighting their way into the city after breaching a seven-week ceasefire with Georgian troops in Abkhazia and launching a surprise attack on the capital and the southern town of Ochamchira. Russia, which brokered the peace deal and maintains troops in the former Soviet republic, warned the rebel Abkhazian forces to withdraw immediately. Georgian television said shells from Abkhazian forces hit a building where Mr Shevardnadze was meeting Georgian soldiers. It said one man in the room with him was injured. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary general, said he was 'extremely concerned' about the Abkhazian attacks. The peace process is under the auspices of the UN.</p>

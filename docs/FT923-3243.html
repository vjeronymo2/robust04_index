			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / European Bonds: German interest rate cut to spark volatile trading TODAY'S promised cut in German interest rates will kick off a week of volatile trading in European government bond markets in the run up the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. German yields, which were already falling last week as investors switched out of higher yielding paper, could now be set to fall sharply. The bond markets will be looking closely to the foreign exchange markets for their lead this morning. The central question for both markets is likely to be the scale of the promised German cut in interest rates. If speculators judge the cut too small, they will have a perfect excuse to launch further attacks on weaker currencies, principally sterling. They have been proved right once, so why shouldn't the same trick work a second time? But if the Bundesbank's cut is a substantial one, the ERM could yet end the week stronger than it started. Most analysts had given up hope of any significant German interest rate cut before the end of this year, so an earlier move could take the pressure off Germany's neighbours, possibly allowing them scope for interest rate cuts. Yesterday's monetary developments will influence the French referendum on Maastricht: if French interest rates fall this week, as the Italian government, at least, was suggesting last night, French voters may be more willing to give European monetary union the benefit of the doubt. If, despite this, France votes No, today's piece of damage limitation from the German authorities could be quickly forgotten. Before the weekend's excitements, some analysts were suggesting that bond markets in the D-Mark bloc should benefit from either result. Their arguments hold good, in modified form, even after Sunday's realignment. A No vote would raise the question of whether the lira had been sufficiently devalued, and perhaps call the pound's ERM rates into question. Both of these concerns would probably lead to outperformance by the German bond market - or at least, a predisposition by investors already in the D-Mark bloc to stay put. A Yes vote, on the other hand, would trigger a rally in the higher-yielding French, Spanish and Ecu bond markets, while the D-Mark bloc would initially be left behind. But since a Yes vote in France would still leave many questions unanswered about the future of the Maastricht treaty, some economists recommend taking early profits in higher-yielding markets and going overweight in bunds. German bond yields fell last week on the growing belief that the Bundesbank would eventually respond to the slowing domestic economy by cutting interest rates. The yield on the benchmark 8 per cent 2002 bond dropping to 7.82 per cent from 7.74 per cent. This compares with 8.13 per cent at the end of July. Yields on shorter maturities showed a bigger drop last week, of around 12 basis points. Last night's confirmation of what on Friday was no more than wishful thinking should fuel the rally in bunds. Its extent, however, depends on the size of the cut.</p>

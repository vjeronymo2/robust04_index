			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / TUC plans union subscription drive The TUC is planning a nationwide campaign urging an estimated 6m workers to remain union members and to carry on paying their subscriptions. Mr John Monks, who will become TUC general secretary in a fortnight, said the aim was to contact every union member. The move is in response to the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act which comes into force on Monday. Employers will only be able to deduct union subscriptions from a worker's wages under the check-off system if the worker agrees every three years in writing. The law will oblige employers to notify the workers of this as well as of any increase in union subscriptions and also to remind workers that they can withdraw authorisation for check-off at any time.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Helmut Schmidt: "Untying the Knot"] </F>   [Text] On 25 May Russian Defense Minister Grachev  presented the following demands to NATO: The North Atlantic  Cooperation Council should separate from NATO and in the future  guide and coordinate, together with the CSCE, both NATO and the  European Union [EU], as well as the CIS.    There is no doubt that this is a maximum position. Almost  simultaneously, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev presented in  the U.S. magazine, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, similar, but a bit more  vague ideas about the future role that Moscow is striving for in  the CSCE. In addition, the following things are remarkable in  his article:     -  The demand for the recognition of Russia as a  superpower, which advocates, just as does the West, democracy,  human rights, and responsible international action;    -  The term  "NATO-mania," which Kozyrev uses in connection with Poland, the  Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, but without citing these  states by name;    -  The West should recognize Russia's "problems  with Georgia and Tajikistan" and support the Russian role. Only  if the need for close cooperation in the CIS is recognized, can  a repetition of the Yugoslav tragedy be avoided. Kozyrev  equates the nature and structure of the CIS with those of the  EU;    -  The safeguarding of the rights of Russian minorities in the  "near abroad" is a real problem for Russia.     Both Russian ministers expressly do not speak about the  security interests of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,  Hungary (the so-called Visegrad states), and the three Baltic  republics. However, their statesmen are very worried about  domestic developments in Russia, which they fear might lead to  an imperialistic foreign policy and endanger the independence of  their states. They watch the current Partnership for Peace with  suspicion, because here Russia is placed on the same footing as  they are.    So far, the West has, however, shied away even from  promising  the four Visegrad states NATO memberships or a security  guarantee. The EU does expect to accept them as members within  a few years, but their future role in the framework of the  intended "common foreign and security policy" of the EU remains  unclear for the time being.    The West is facing a dilemma: On the one hand, it is in the  interest of all Europeans to effectively ensure the security of  the Visegrad states (and the three Baltic republics). For them,  a security policy condominium of the West with Moscow must not  come about, because the Poles, but also the Hungarians (because  of 1956!) and the Czechs (because of 1968!) would reject  Russia's position as a guarantor power. Neither have the four  divisions of Poland been forgotten in Warsaw, in which not only  Moscow but -- in addition to Vienna's participation three times  -- also Berlin was involved every time, nor has Prague forgotten  the invasion of German troops under Hitler and its consequences.    On the other hand, Moscow's demand for the recognition of  its  status as a superpower and for institutionalized cooperation  with the West is sensible. However, neither the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council nor the Partnership for Peace are suitable  for that as long as they both put Russia on the same level as  small states.    Conversely, the Russian proposal for giving the CSCE  executive powers rights to the fringe of the Pacific Ocean is  unacceptable; one just has to think of the effect on China. In  a few years everyone will recognize that the United States,  China, Russia, Japan, and the EU are superpowers. All five must  learn to respect each other in every way as big powers.    The North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which was  established  upon proposal by the United States, and the Partnership for  Peace may have been useful as improvised interim solutions.  Now, however, this concept rather proves to be a knot that must  be untied. It is time to invite both Russia and China to fully  participate in the annual G-7 meetings, the so-called  international economic summits. This would serve both mutual  understanding and Moscow and Beijing's legitimate need for  recognition.    Furthermore, the current system of security agreements  between the West and Moscow must be supplemented with a general  strategic consultation and cooperation treaty between Russia and  the West. The NATO Consultation Council would then remain an  episode.    Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia will soon  become members of the EU. Russia is not happy about this, but  it cannot object. It is only logical to put these states under  NATO protection. But do not water down NATO and the Atlantic  alliance!    Kozyrev has repeatedly warned against a return of the  centuries of Russian imperialism to get foreign policy successes  from the West, which are necessary for the reform forces in  Russia. However, despite all Russia's current economic and  political weaknesses, the West cannot avoid the actual  recognition of this gigantic country's historical, current, and  future role as a superpower.</p>

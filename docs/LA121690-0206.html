			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RIGID DISCIPLINE STRAIGHTENS OUT EX-CONS;  </P> <P> REHABILITATION: ANAHEIM'S CELEBRATE FREEDOM OUTREACH STRESSES RELIGION AND  REGIMEN. NO ONE HAS RETURNED TO JAIL.  </P> <P> Fourteen months ago in San Bernardino County Jail, Craig Hunton wanted to die.  </P> <P> At 30, he had spent half of his life addicted to injections of methamphetamines  and other drugs. His habit had cost him his wife, his three children, his home  and several years of his life spent in prison.  </P> <P> But now, after completing a religion-oriented rehabilitation program called  Celebrate Freedom Outreach, he is helping a dozen other ex-convicts learn how  to live.  </P> <P> "When I came into this program, in October of last year, it was do or die," he  said. "I realized I had lost everything, and my self-hatred was so strong I  couldn't live with myself any longer. I was dead. I didn't want to live. With  all these guys it was the same way."  </P> <P> Created and run by Bob Roll, a former convict and drug addict, Freedom Outreach  operates a home on North Bush Street, where convicts may live after they serve  their sentences, or where judges can send criminals as an alternative to jail  time. The program has also accepted substance abusers and homeless people with  no criminal records, program spokesman Steven Haymer said.  </P> <P> Twelve men share the four-bedroom Anaheim house, which has a pool and a  weightlifting area in the back yard. Most of them come from county jails and  prisons, Haymer said. Twelve other men have graduated from the program since it  began in January, 1989. None have been returned to jail, and half have joined  the program as staff members.  </P> <P> Rigidly enforced discipline plays a large part in keeping the men, who refer to  each other as "brothers," on track. They must rise by 6:30 a.m. for prayer and  breakfast, go to work during the day and have lights out by 10 p.m.  </P> <P> The program is aimed at gradually making the men self-sufficient by getting  them jobs and bank accounts. They are constantly monitored, and almost all of  their time is spent either working or in religious study or prayer. Telephone  calls and visits to the home are limited.  </P> <P> "We operate in grace and love, but there are strict guidelines," said Hunton,  who oversees the men.  </P> <P> A sign posted on the living room wall warns that residents will be expelled if  they violate the rules: no violence, no smoking, drinking, dating, radio or TV,  no staying out at night. Although an outcast member may apply for readmittance  after 30 days, he must persuade the staff that he will abide by the rules.  </P> <P> Bunk beds cram the rooms, with Bibles resting at the foot of most of them.  "That's our sword. We couldn't live without it," Hunton said.  </P> <P> On a recent morning at 6:30 a.m., the men shuffled one at a time into the  kitchen and made breakfast of cereal and hot coffee. They greeted each other  with "good morning, brother" as they dressed and shaved before a long day of  selling Christmas trees at four lots around the county.  </P> <P> In a room down the hall, Hunton had to rouse one straggler from bed, then make  sure that Buck Druckenmiller, 20, had enough money for bus fare to make an  appointment with his parole officer.  </P> <P> Toward the end of the average six-month stay, most of the men have jobs, while  the others work at community service projects. But the three weeks before  Christmas are devoted to selling Christmas trees to raise money.  </P> <P> Outside the Home Depot store in Fountain Valley, Jerry Sandoval, 45, and  several other Outreach members operated a tree lot one afternoon recently.  </P> <P> The dark scars on the inside of Sandoval's arms are testimony to his 30-year  heroin addiction. The Stanton native said that if it was not for the program,  "I'd be dead or drunk somewhere."  </P> <P> "I gave up on seeing my family," he said. But as a result of the program, his  parents and children have welcomed him back. And on a recent picnic with them,  he was able to get acquainted with his grandson, whom he had not known.  </P> <P> Deputy Public Defender Carolyn Forgey praised the program, saying it benefits  everyone -- the Outreach members, their families and the public.  </P> <P> "No question about it," she said. "If they redirect their lives, recidivism is  controlled. If you get into the fiscal aspects, jail costs are reduced. And  many of the individuals go on to help others recover. It has a good reputation  in the court."  </P> <P> She also said the program works because it focuses on every aspect of the  individual's life, instead of singling out a specific problem.  </P> <P> "They try an approach (working) with body, soul and spirit," Forgey said. "It  works on all of the issues, not just the drugs. There's a real loving,  supportive environment where healing can take place. They can establish their  sense of self-worth and become productive citizens. "  </P> <P> The $150,000-a-year operation is funded by local churches, fund-raising  activities by Outreach and the county's general relief fund, program spokesman  Haymer said.  </P> <P> Last year, the organization, which was then based in Garden Grove, made enough  money to open the home in Anaheim. The men moved to the Anaheim residence, and  the Garden Grove home was used to house two women.  </P> <P> Outreach plans to use the money made this year from the Christmas tree lots to  open a 40-bed home on a 57-acre ranch near Stockton and eventually to branch  out throughout the country, Haymer said. The organization needs about $150,000  for a down payment on the $425,000 property, which organizers expect to raise  within a year.  </P> <P> Last year, their lots were some of the busiest in Southern California, with  more than $250,000 in business, raising $20,000 for the organization.  </P> <P> For now, Hunton plans to continue his work for Outreach by preaching to inmates  in the AIDS ward of the California Institution for Men in Chino.  </P> <P> When he visits county jails and speaks to potential Outreach members, he offers  himself as proof that the program works.  </P> <P> "I remember when I was out there in the (jail) chapel in the orange jumpsuit,"  he said. "Now I'm there -- and I can walk out. That's what this is about:  setting the captives free."  </P></p>

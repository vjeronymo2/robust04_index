			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (22): The pains of privatisation - Russia: morale is low and the outlook bleak After a difficult year of adjustment to market economics, the future looks bleak for Russia's aerospace and airline industries. Despite having some of the best design capacity in the world, manufacturers are finding it difficult to raise the finance they need to produce and sell aircraft in world markets. The once-monolithic Russian airline industry, having split up into some 300 mini-carriers, has been hit by two serious accidents, which have dented already shaky international confidence in it. After prolonged indecision over the future of Russian International Airlines  -the international rump of the former monopoly, which continues to use the Aeroflot name - the government decided in June to sell 49 per cent to the airline's employees. In this first stage of privatisation, employees will be barred for an unspecified period from re-selling their stock, which they will be offered at a discount. The government does not plan to sell off any of its remaining 51 per cent stake for at least three years. 'In the next stage, I think conditions for foreign capital to invest will be created,' Mr Igor Desyatnichenko, deputy director for finance, was quoted as saying in a recent interview. In the meantime, the government has promised to give the dividends of its 51 per cent stake to the airline, to help it acquire new aircraft. But a question-mark remains over whether it will remain a single airline, following the decision to allow four of its subsidiaries the option of breaking away as separate companies. This decision coincided with a change of chairman at Russian International Airlines, with the replacement of Mr Vladimir Potapov, who had struggled to keep the airline whole, by one of his deputies, Mr Vladimir Tikhonov. The declared purpose of privatisation is to make the industry more efficient. But the collapse of the Soviet Union, in December 1991, only complicated its adjustment to market reforms launched just over two years ago. Newly-independent republics, as well as restless regions and even cities, seized control of locally-based fleets. But despite the lifting of controls on ticket prices, as part of the reforms, most of the so-called 'baby Aeroflots' lack the muscle and expertise to achieve international standards and re-equip ageing fleets. In January, a Tupolev aircraft operated by a tiny Siberian offshoot of the former Aeroflot crashed en route from the Siberian city of Irkutsk to Moscow, killing all 120 people on board. Morale and discipline have also suffered across the board. In March, 75 people died when an Airbus leased by Russian International Airlines crashed on a flight from Moscow to Hong Kong. Unofficial reports released at the time suggested that the pilot had been teaching his children how to fly. But publication of the results of an official inquiry have been postponed several times, fuelling suspicions of an attempted cover-up. A bright spot amid the chaos is the development of a few privately-funded airlines, such as Transaero, which offers western-style service at a small premium to that of its state-owned rivals. Pending state-owned airlines' inevitable restructuring as bigger companies, the government this spring made a start with privatisation when it auctioned part of Vnukovo Airlines, based at Moscow's domestic Vnukovo airport. Until July 1, privatisation of state-owned assets had been conducted through the free distribution of vouchers to the population. However, future privatisation, including that of Russian International Airlines, will be for cash only, with 51 per cent of the proceeds due to be ploughed back into companies. Lack of finance to re-equip fleets is the main problem facing Russian airlines, and is likely to remain so even after privatisation. It is also an obstacle for aircraft manufacturers, which were previously run and financed by the state. Even those airlines which have some money are finding it easier to lease or buy western aircraft, because of the favourable financing terms offered by western manufacturers. A cash-strapped government has yet to implement a long-promised industrial policy of selective support for its most promising industries, such as airframe manufacturing. In the meantime, two engine-manufacturers have teamed up with two leading Russian aircraft manufacturers in an attempt to mass-produce Russian aircraft with western engines and avionics. The most advanced project is an alliance between Russia's Ilyushin and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US. Their long-haul Il-96-M aircraft is currently undergoing tests for certification in Russia and the west. A similar aircraft, with Russian engines, the Il-96-300, is already being operated by Russian International Airlines on routes to the US. A separate alliance, between Russia's Tupolev, and Rolls-Royce of the UK, wants to produce the medium-haul Tu-204 with western engines and avionics. But it is still said to be seeking finance for certification procedures. According to Mr John Sharman, executive director of Spectrum Capital, the UK venture capital company, the Russian authorities have approached the British government for help in raising Dollars 20m for this purpose, on the grounds that this will help Rolls-Royce to sell engines.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: News Round-up Strategy The rise by the US Federal Reserve late on Friday of interest rates caused little surprise among most emerging market strategists. Mr Kevin Smith, a fund manager of Foreign and Colonial in London, commented just after the announcement that he did not expect the impact on Asian equity markets today to trigger a major sell-off. However, he said that the most vulnerable markets would be those with dollar exposure, such as Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia. Russia The government minister responsible for the privatisation programme has said that he hopes it will proceed, in spite of the country's political difficulties. The privatisation process started in late-1992, when vouchers were distributed which could be swapped for shares in state firms. Several oil and energy enterprises, a big car plant in Ulyanovsk, and the Novorossiisk shipping company are among the companies to be opened to public ownership. Zimbabwe The country's equity market remained strong last week - the industrial index almost attaining the 3,100 level - with some analysts forecasting that 4,500 would be breached this year. Mining shares have attracted investors with the sub-index also setting a new record high. Financial reforms, which were announced at the start of this year, falling inflation and lower interest rates have also underpinned the market. SE Asia Union Bank of Switzerland has signed a joint venture agreement with Finance One, the Thai financial services group. UBS will acquire 15 per cent of the expanded capital of Finance One's subsidiary, Thana One Finance and Securities. The price was not announced, but stockbrokers in Bangkok said UBS would pay Bt300m (Dollars 11.8m) for the first 5 per cent tranche. Bolivia A privatisation programme is in the early stages, with the government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada planning to sell-off six state companies. Under the scheme investors, to be selected by an international bidding process, are expected to take up to half the equity in each company at no cost, but would then have to invest in them. The remaining equity would be divided among local investors, and kept in private pension funds. Seoul Standard Chartered reports that the stock exchange will be seeking a 40 per cent deposit from institutional investors - including foreigners - before a purchase order for shares is made. This measure has been imposed in an effort to cool the market which, according to IFC data, rose 10 per cent in dollar terms last month. East Europe Another fund has been launched to tap the investment potential of central and eastern European countries. CS First Boston and Cazenove are seeking to invest in listed companies, and the Dollars 200m fund is expected to be the biggest of its kind. Some Dollars 150m is expected to come from international institutions, and the rest from the retail community. Further coverage of emerging markets appears daily on the World Stock Markets page.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Financial guidelines for exiles - How to . . . prepare for living abroad THE GRASS is not always greener over there. But there are opportunities to profit from leaving this country and working or retiring overseas. Financial considerations alone are unlikely to force you into leaving the country, but it could be lucrative, if you plan your finances carefully. According to Hill Samuel Investment Services there are around 3.5m British expatriates working abroad: 20 per cent in Europe, 26 per cent in Africa, and 51 per cent in North America. If you are staying with your employer, and are only leaving the country on an overseas assignment, the tax position can be very complicated. Fortunately, a new leaflet from the Inland Revenue (Going to Work Abroad? IR58) offers guidelines on the possibilities. Those who are abroad for a complete tax year (from April 6 one year to April 5 the next) and work full-time wholly outside the UK have a relatively easy time. Providing they do not make visits to the UK which average 91 days or more per year, they will be treated as not resident in the UK for tax purposes. If you are away for 365 days or more, but this does not include a complete tax year, life is more of a headache. You may get a 'foreign earnings deduction' of 100 per cent of your earnings for this period. This is Revenue-speak for saying your earnings will be free from UK tax. You can make return visits to the UK during a period abroad which qualifies for the deduction, but no single visit may last for more than 62 consecutive days and the total number of days spent in the UK must not be more than one sixth of the number of days in the entire qualifying period. This means that you will not always know at the time whether a given day, or period, can be counted as part of a qualifying period. The more certain you are about your travelling plans in advance, therefore, the better for your financial health. If your period working abroad does not extend for 365 days, you will almost certainly be liable to tax in the UK in the normal way. The greatest financial opportunities occur if you are away for more than one tax year. You will also need to find out about your new country's tax regime; there is obviously no financial point in moving to a high tax country. And you must work out your plan in advance. If you are selling assets and going to work abroad, it would be preferable not to complete the sale until after you have left the UK. Great care is required in this area and professional advice should be sought. Also defer income, where possible, until you are non-resident. If a gain is realised while you are still onshore, you will pay UK tax on it. Those without a large capital gain still have a formidable financial shopping list: Your House. This can be a painful problem. Eric Le Rossignol, managing director of Hill Samuel Investment Services' Jersey operation, explains that the rental income after deductions, if you let it, will be subject to UK tax. So the cost of hiring a good local estate agent is justified. If the agent receives the rents and pays the expenses, the amount on which the UK tax must be withheld can be reduced, according to Le Rossignol. Ask a solicitor to draw up a lease which ensures the property can be repossessed once you return to the UK. Bank Accounts. Once overseas, you will need a bank account. 'Offshore' accounts, based mostly in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, allow roll-up gross of tax. James Higgins, of Chamberlain De Broe, says offshore accumulators, such as Rothschilds or Hambros sterling money funds, should be used for deposits. As their name implies, these funds accumulate, or 'roll-up' funds, and do not distribute income. If you can afford to do so, it is worth putting money into such funds well before leaving the UK, as you can then withdraw them, once you have left the country, free of tax. Savings. Liberation from the UK tax regime allows various opportunities. As Higgins puts it: 'The whole point of being offshore is that you have not got a UK tax problem, and you can start choosing investments the way investments should be chosen. You just don't need to worry about tax.' Offshore centres have developed a formidable range of mutual funds, allowing broad investment. As these funds have a favourable tax position, they should, while they stay offshore, generally be able to beat onshore unit trusts and life products. Higgins suggests using offshore personal bonds, such as that offered by Royal Life International on the Isle of Man, as a shell for holding investments. Set-up fees need not be prohibitive if you use a non-commission product, he says, and you can then manipulate the funds held within them - they could even be used to hold building society accounts. However, the tax position of these bonds is under review, and administrative costs can become prohibitive - other advisers, such as Wilfred T. Fry of Worthing, are much more dubious about them. Le Rossignol also points out that distributor funds are a good home for savings as they normally offer automatic reinvestment of dividends, but will protect against liability for UK income tax on accumulated gains, if the saver has to return unexpectedly to the UK. Pensions. Many offshore products which call themselves 'pensions' are just glorified and over-priced savings schemes, according to Higgins. On-shore pension investment is usually only attractive for tax reasons in any case. However, pensions under Section 49 of the Isle of Man Income Tax Act 1970 are attractive for those who know they will be returning to the UK, because if taken as pension income, the annuity will be taxed like a normal annuity, rather than a 'compulsory purchase' or 'pension' annuity. This significantly reduces the amount of tax you need to pay. Le Rossignol says it is worth continuing to pay Class 3 national insurance contributions to ensure eligibility for a state pension when you return. He adds that those who do not know their employment prospects when they return might be best to advised to save their employer's annual bonuses and review the situation later - UK pension law, for example, is prone to frequent changes. This explains why most offshore products are single, rather than regular premium. Investment offshore is never risk-free, so beware inflated claims. As Le Rossignol puts it: 'Common sense rules on risk and return are not left on the ground at Heathrow.' But offshore regulation is tighter than it used to be, and many jurisdictions have tightened their regulations in the last ten years. Finally, you will need to follow developments in what is one of the most complicated areas of all financial planning. The Weekend FT carries regular articles by Donald Elkin, of advisers Wilfred T. Fry, which clarify the subtler technicalities of UK tax for expatriates. But talk to the Inland Revenue first.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Three Aberdeen hospitals to close Three hospitals in the Aberdeen area are to close with the loss of 700 jobs. Grampian Healthcare, a health service trust, said Kingseat at Newmachar, and Woodlands, in Cults, would close next April, and Arduthie Hospital in Stonehaven in 1996. The trust said 360 permanent jobs and 240 temporary posts would go and 100 would be transferred to Aberdeen.

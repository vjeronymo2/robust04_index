			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Letter: Backing for civil servants as non-executive directors (2) Sir, Many will profoundly disagree with David Elyan's view. Such private/public company links are usually beneficial. I would cite the Civil Aviation Authority, a nationalised service, with a board dominated by private sector non-executives as an excellent quid pro quo. I suspect this civil servant's fees will be paid to her principal employer. A recent survey for Pro Ned of non-executive fees showed: kept in full (47 per cent), paid to employer (30 per cent), salary offset (6 per cent) - with a significant increase in those paid to the principal employer when they had been directly or indirectly instrumental in the individual's non-executive appointment.

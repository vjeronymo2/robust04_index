			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 10 FEDERAL SUITS IN THRIFT CASE SENT TO PHOENIX;  </P> <P> COURTS: LEGAL ACTION BY BONDHOLDERS IN LINCOLN SAVINGS' PARENT FIRM ARE  CONSOLIDATED UNDER ONE JUDGE. ORANGE COUNTY CASES AREN'T AFFECTED.  </P> <P> The 10 federal lawsuits filed by bondholders who lost their investments with  the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan's parent firm are being transferred  from U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to Phoenix.  </P> <P> A court order by a U.S. administrative panel consolidates the cases before  Judge Richard M. Bilby, who has been overseeing the government's civil  racketeering case against former Lincoln operators as well as the bankruptcy of  the S&amp;L's former parent, Phoenix-based American Continental Corp.  </P> <P> Consolidating the cases before Bilby for all pretrial purposes is necessary "to  avoid duplication of discovery, prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings" and  conserve resources, according to the order issued Friday from the seven-member  Judicial Panel on MultiDistrict Litigation.  </P> <P> Moving the cases to Arizona made sense, the panel said, because American  Continental is headquartered there, many defendants and witnesses are located  there and a document depository holding more than 20 million pages of material  has been set up.  </P> <P> Nearly 22,000 small investors purchased almost $200 million in American  Continental bonds at Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches. The bonds  became worthless after the company filed for bankruptcy last April 13. Federal  regulators seized Lincoln the following day, and the S&amp;L is expected to  become one of the nation's costliest failures, with a taxpayer bill of $2  billion.  </P> <P> The bondholders filed 10 lawsuits in federal court and seven actions in Orange  County Superior Court. Their lawyers have been divided over the issue of where  the federal litigation should be consolidated. The Orange County cases are not  affected by the panel's order.  </P> <P> Joseph W. Cotchett Jr. of Burlingame and Ronald Rus of Orange had argued before  the panel to keep the federal bondholder cases before U.S. District Judge  Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles. They also have taken the lead in the state  court cases in Orange County.  </P> <P> "I think it's a tragedy for the investors," Cotchett said. "Many of them are  old and disabled, and all this is going to do is build in further delay. It  appears the investors' only recourse now is the Superior Court, where they can  invoke state statutes to get to trial quicker."  </P> <P> Other bondholder lawyers took a softer approach.  </P> <P> "The only reason we fought about it was because we didn't want to lose our  trial date of Aug. 13," said Kevin P. Roddy of Los Angeles, another bondholder  lawyer. "We didn't want wheels of justice slowing down."  </P> <P> The request to move the cases to Phoenix came from David B. Gold of San  Francisco, who filed a suit on behalf of bondholders last fall. He said Bilby  was a logical choice to hear the cases because he already is familiar with the  issues and has handled other massive, complex litigation, including bondholder  litigation over the failure of the Washington Public Power &amp; Supply System.  </P> <P> Most defense lawyers favor the move.  </P> <P> "It's good because it will put pressure on people to settle the issues," said  James J. Feder of Los Angeles, a lawyer for American Continental. "It's also  good to get this litigation in one place so lawyers can't play one judge off  another."  </P> <P> Feder said he expects other related litigation, including the state Department  of Corporations suit against three American Continental officers, to be  transferred to Bilby also.  </P> <P> In another legal matter involving Lincoln, accountant Jack D. Atchison invoked  his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify  on behalf of American Continental in a hearing challenging the regulatory  takeover of Lincoln.  </P> <P> Atchison was an Arthur Young &amp; Co. accounting partner who was the chief  auditor of Lincoln and American Continental in 1987 and 1988. He was later  hired by American Continental for more than $900,000 a year.  </P> <P> American Continental's chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., wasn't hesitant to  testify before the federal court in Washington, however. He testified, as he  has before, that government regulators, not he or his executives, ruined  Lincoln.  </P> <P> "I ran a perfectly legitimate savings and loan," he said. "It's hogwash to say  otherwise.  </P></p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays bought A healthy performance in Barclays shares on high turnover of 7m was attributed to Lehman Brothers which, dealers said, was advising a switch from National Westminster. Lehman would not confirm that its was making a direct link between the two high street banks, but analyst Mr Robert Law said he was a buyer of Barclays as the bank with the 'lowest price to cash flow multiple in the sector' and a holder of NatWest on the basis that its share price already reflected its performance. Barclays gained 5 at 502p, while NatWest was held back, closing unaltered at 481p. Composite insurer Commercial Union performed strongly against a faltering market as one securities house published an enthusiastic appraisal of the group. Mr Andrew Pitt, insurance analyst with Robert Fleming, reinstated his buy recommendation on the stock. He said the company had underperformed the market by 5 per cent over 12 months while the rest of the sector had outperformed and it was now on a prospective yield of 5.3 per cent. CU shares were 19 higher at one stage and closed 13 up at 606p after 5.5m traded. Building group Newman Tonks disappointed the market with a dividend cut in spite of reporting an improvement in half-time figures. The shares closed 6 lower at 154p, having recovered from a worse fall earlier in the session. Builders merchant Sharp and Fisher was wanted on expectations of favourable interim results on Monday. The shares climbed 13 to 123p. Shares in Westland Group were in demand following market talk and press reports suggesting that the company may be a bid target. The stock ended the session 6 better at 250p, with GKN, which has a stake of around 20 per cent in Westland, still suggested as the most likely suitor. GKN hardened 5 to 493p. The 3 per cent decline in interim profits at engineering group IMI disappointed the market, leaving the shares 7 lighter at 287p as analysts downgraded full-year expectations. Brokers also trimmed year-end forecasts for Williams Holdings, which reported a marginal increase in half-year profits. The shares weakened 7 to 326p, with volume climbing to 6.5m. International mining group RTZ lost 12 to 723p in nervous trading ahead of tomorrow's interim figures. Rothmans International 'B' rose 6 to 701p as the extraordinary general meeting approved the split of the tobacco and luxury goods arms. Zeneca added 6 at 760p as investors bought for the yield attractions. Bumper profits at Telemetrix lifted the shares 7 to 183p. Results from Hillsdown Holdings were enlivened by the attractions of the yield on the shares. The stock finished 7 stronger at 172p. After Thorn EMI's profits warning - contained in a circular to shareholders last Friday - the shares lost a further 15 to 968p as more brokers downgraded profits forecasts. Most were cutting around Pounds 20m from current year predictions. Croda International moved ahead 19 to 330p on a near 30 per cent boost in first-half profits to Pounds 18.5m. Hoare Govett changed its recommendation from 'undervalued' to 'buy' and raised its full-year forecast by Pounds 3m to Pounds 40m. The financial restructuring at UK Land, which involved a one-for-22 offer, sent the shares jumping 28 3/4 to 29 1/2 p. Other statistics, Page 29</p>

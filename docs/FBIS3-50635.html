			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "Good Afternoon From Mexico" newscast] </F>   [Text] The State Government of Chiapas has denied news  reports to the effect that the Mexican Army and the Zapatista  rebels are fighting 16 km from Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital  city. Television Azteca has interviewed Government Secretary  General Rafael Gonzalez Lastre, as follows:    [Begin recording] [Gonzalez] Thank you for this opportunity  to speak on this channel. Yesterday, we took it upon ourselves  to inform the people over radio and television. Today, we want  to urge everyone and all groups to be prudent. Today, more than  ever before, we must act in a serious, professional, and  responsible manner. We must not listen to gossip and comments  that seek to confuse the people and make them restless.    The city of Tuxtla Gutierrez and surrounding areas are  protected. There is no possibility at all that this transgressor  group will appear here. I have just said there is only one  small area in Altamirano municipality where there is some  unrest, and something very small is going on in Ocosingo.    [Reporter] Do you have any information on former Governor  Absalon?    [Gonzalez Lastre] Yesterday, it was confirmed to us that  General Absalon Castellano Dominguez, the former governor of  Chiapas, is being held by these persons. So far, we have no  information on his whereabouts, but we fully trust that our  Mexican Army will once again fulfill its duty and just as it  rescued the Solorzano family in Ocosingo, it will rescue the  former governor who also has the honor of belonging to our  Mexican Army.    [Reporter] Mr. Gonzalez: Have the five envoys of the U.S.  Embassy contacted you?    [Gonzalez Lastre] Representatives from the French Embassy  visited me on Sunday. We learned about the representatives from  the U.S. Embassy.... [pauses] but I have not had the opportunity  to meet with them directly and personally as I met with the  representatives of the French Embassy. I do want to guarantee  that the Chiapas State Government is ready to give all the  information and cooperation that its fellow countrymen might  need. [end recording]</p>

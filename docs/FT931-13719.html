			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Rao fails to put the militant Hindu tiger back in its cage: The prime minister's inability to inspire opponents of Hindu extremism after destruction of the Ayodhya mosque INDIAN Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao has so far failed to defuse the tensions which have gripped his country since militant Hindus tore down a mosque and unleashed a wave of inter-religious violence. In the six weeks since the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque, fighting in cities in northern India has exacerbated hatreds between Hindus and Moslems. In the past two weeks in Bombay, 600 people have been killed, more than 100,000 have fled the city, and hundreds of homes, shops and workshops have been razed. An uneasy peace has been imposed by tens of thousands of police and soldiers, but this week tension still hangs in the air. Offices close early so workers can get home before dark. Mr Rao has suppressed violence by deploying the security forces, but has largely proved unable to rally support for defending the ideals of religious harmony on which independent India was founded. Rather, the initiative has been seized by those who seek to profit from exacerbating the conflicts - chiefly the Bharatiya Janata party, the militant Hindu party whose supporters destroyed the Ayodhya mosque. Mr L K Advani, the BJP leader, wants an immediate general election to capitalise on the passions he has aroused. Mr Bal Thackeray, leader of Shiv Sena, the BJP's Bombay affiliate, warns Moslems that 'the Hindu tiger is out of its cage'. Many Hindus are appalled by such hate-filled talk and there has been no shortage of articulate condemnations of Hindu militancy. The violence has also prompted acts of heroism - in the recent surge in violence in Bombay, numerous Hindus shielded Moslem neighbours. Among them was Sunil Gavaskar, the former national cricket captain, who ran out of his home to save Moslems from a Hindu mob which had surrounded their car. Also, Indians recognise the economic damage being done by the violence and the uncertainty it generates. Bombay, the nation's commercial capital, will take months to recover, according to leading businessmen in the city. Some believe confidence will return quickly now that law and order has been re-imposed, but others are not sure. Mr F T Khorakiwala, sheriff of Bombay and owner of a department store group, says: 'If the communal discord escalates, Bombay will be worse than Beirut.' However, the government has failed to capitalise on anti-militant sentiment. Mr Rao says that he will act when the time his ripe. He claims the wide-ranging ministerial reshuffle he completed this week will help strengthen the government. The prime minister's critics, including members of the ruling Congress (I) party, say he has already left it too late to respond to the threat to the nation's stability. The prime minister himself has contributed to the sense that the government is drifting. Mr Rao is no orator, able to appeal to the population through speeches or television appearances. Nor has he been able to rally his cabinet around an agreed programme. The one politically brave promise that he made - to rebuild the Ayodhya mosque - seems to have been quietly shelved after it ran into considerable criticism inside the Congress party. But the prime minister's innate caution does not alone explain the government's inaction. India faces a fundamental challenge which, in the last six weeks, has grown bigger by the day. Like it or not, the BJP commands strong support in northern India, the region with the greatest Hindu-Moslem tensions. The mosque's destruction certainly alienated some of the party's moderate supporters, but many others feel inspired. The BJP suddenly has a clear sense of purpose. It also seems to have gained ground among the general public: according to one opinion poll, if a general election were held, the BJP's representation in parliament would soar from 119 to 170. Not enough to win power, but enough to vindicate (in narrow political terms) the mosque's destruction. Another indication of the quiet sympathy many Hindus have for Hindu nationalism is widespread public indifference towards a blatant pro-Hindu and anti-Moslem bias shown by the mainly Hindu police in dealing with the riots. Congress's failure to mount a strong challenge to the BJP is partly ideological. The party, which has ruled India for most of the post-independence period, advocates secular nationalism in which all races and creeds are treated equally. This vision, which had great appeal after independence, has been dulled by time and by the constant jockeying for power by various religious and regional interests. Moreover, over the past decade, Hindus have been unsettled by the international rise in Islamic extremism. The momentum generated by the BJP is not unstoppable. It has little support in south India, where few Moslems live, or in the east, where the left holds sway in West Bengal. The liberal intelligentsia sees the dangers of the BJP and is not afraid, in newspaper articles, to sound the alarm, even by drawing parallels with Germany and the Nazis. Moreover, it may prove difficult for the BJP to hold together the forces of Hindu nationalism for a long time - since Hindus are divided by caste and language. If memories of Ayodhya fade, BJP unity may fade too. However, outside the educated elite, the opponents of militant Hinduism are increasingly afraid to speak out. They also need inspiration - something Mr Rao has so far failed to provide.</p>

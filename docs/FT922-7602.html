			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / S African talks deadlock raises fears of new violence SOUTH AFRICA'S constitutional talks reached deadlock yesterday, dashing hopes for the early installation of a multi-racial interim government and raising fears of renewed political violence. A day of acrimonious discussions at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) left the government and the African National Congress divided over fundamental constitutional issues, but reluctant to end talks which are due to begin again today. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, and President FW de Klerk set up an urgent meeting last night to try to break the impasse. They were due to address the Codesa session this morning. Earlier, Mr Mandela indicated that pressure would be increased on the government through mass popular protest. Talks stalled over demands for what amounts to a white veto over the process of writing a post-apartheid constitution. 'The government has not in substantial measure moved away from its desire to exercise a minority veto over the future,' said Mr Joe Slovo, hardline leader of the ANC. The government accused the ANC of wanting to impose a Marxist constitution. However, Mr Pik Botha, the foreign minister, said: 'The ANC has got no choice. We have no choice. We must come to an agreement.' Even though the 19 political groups represented at Codesa have met almost continuously for the past week, negotiators have failed to agree on the decision-making process within the body elected to write the constitution. The ANC proposed that decisions be taken by a 70 per cent majority, with a majority of 75 per cent to approve the bill of rights. If agreement could not be achieved within six months, the ANC said decisions taken by simple majority should be submitted to popular referendum. The government accepted the majorities proposed by the ANC, but insisted on a 75 per cent majority on the contentious issue of South Africa's future status as a unitary or a federal state. It also rejected the idea of a referendum. The ANC is concerned that the government could muster an effective veto, in alliance with other ethnic minority parties, if decisions were taken by 75 per cent majority.

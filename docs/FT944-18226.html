			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Finland's Unitas struggles to trim deficit The depth of the 1992 crisis in the Finnish banking sector was highlighted yesterday when Unitas, the country's second largest banking group, announced heavier write-offs and another big loss for the first eight months of the year. The bank said its credit losses, at FM1.82bn (Dollars 374m), were FM137m higher than in the same 1993 period. It relied on lower interest rates, higher capital gains on equities and the acquisition of part of the Savings Bank of Finland to achieve a 14 per cent reduction in overall pre-tax losses, to FM870m from FM1.01bn. Banks in Finland, Sweden and Norway were overwhelmed by losses in 1992 after their economies fell into recession and real estate markets crashed. However, while banks in Norway and Sweden have returned to profit, Finland's leading banks warn they may not show black figures until 1996. Finland's domestic economy is still struggling to emerge from a three-year recession, in spite of a boom in the export sector. Mr Markku Pohjola, Unitas executive vice-president, said: 'In Sweden, the banking crisis was mainly related to the real estate market. In Finland, it has more to do with small and medium-sized companies which have gone bankrupt. The Finnish process has developed more gradually.' A large part of Unitas' credit losses in the first eight months was caused by the collapse of two groups - Haka, a construction concern, and Eka, a retail and wholesale company. Mr Pohjola said Unitas expected lower credit losses in the final four months, and an overall pre-tax loss that was roughly half last year's FM2.57bn. Next year the bank expects to break even before returning to the black in 1996. Non-performing loans totalled FM6.18bn at the end of August, down from FM6.84bn at the end of last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Mohamed Farah Aidid, chairman of the executive  council of the Somali National Alliance, SNA, and chairman of  the United Somali Congress, USC, attended the 'Id al-Adha  prayers with many Muslims. [passage omitted]    Addressing the congregation after the prayers, the chairman  of the SNA, Mohamed Farah Aidid, prayed to Allah to accept the  good deeds of the Muslims and unite the Muslims wherever they  are. [passage omitted]    While touring the various sections of the Ministry of  Information's headquarters, Mr. Aidid saw the destruction caused  by UN Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM] forces to Radio Mogadishu's  infrastructure on 12 June 1993. [passage omitted]    Aidid, addressing the people who attended the 'Id al-Adha  celebrations, thanked all those who attended the various 'Id  al-Adha parties and requested them to deliver his greetings to  all their friends and supporters.    Mr. Aidid narrated the long struggle of the Somali people  since 1943 in which the Somali people strived for justice and  self-determination. However, this has always been spoiled by  foreigners and their surrogates who had their own interests.  Talking about the struggle against foreigners and recent  meetings held in some Horn of Africa countries where ways of  finding a solution to the Somali crisis were discussed, he said  that from now on, as agreed, all meetings on self-determination  for the Somali people will be held in the country. This will  allow the Somali people to participate and to know who is  serving their interests and who is obstructing the achievements  of unity and progress.</p>

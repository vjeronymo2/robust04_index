			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices at Australian sales this week eased again, and the pace of the decline accelerated a little. The AWC market indicator was only 2 cents down at 430 cents a kilogram on August 18 but fleece wool eased in the 5 to 10 cent range. Trade comment mentions the Garnaut wool report, published last week, as an additional reason for market dullness. A fixed schedule for stockpile disposal by tender raises new uncertainties in a trade already unhappy about the inadequacy of world demand to absorb current production and stocks.</p>

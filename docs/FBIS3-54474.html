			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by 'Alireza Shemirani] </F>   [Text] Why have the acts of the supervisor of the Voice and  Vision organization during the last two weeks been followed by  numerous reactions, from the speaker and deputies of the Majles  to the chief of the judiciary, the Friday imams and the clergy,  various classes and guilds and the media?    So far the Majles has researched and investigated at various  levels in numerous instances having to do with the performance  of organizations, bodies and management, in implementation of  Article 67 of the Constitution. However, none have received  reactions on the scale of the latest incident. Perhaps this is  for the following reasons:    A. The performance of the Voice and Vision organization, as  the most important pillar of the fourth power, with its  effective and fateful role and society, has never been  officially examined and supervised in the period since the  triumph of the Islamic revolution. Since the revision of the  Constitution, the Voice and Vision organization has been under  the direct supervision of the vice-regent, and some have thought  that a body under the leader's supervision should not be studied  and subjected to research and investigation. At the time the  research and investigation of the performance of the Voice and  Vision organization was proposed, his excellency clearly stated:    "Study it carefully, do the research and investigation, and  study individuals, too."    B. After the research and investigation report was read in  the Majles, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization,  continuing his illegal measures, took an official position  against research and investigation on the Voice of the Majles.  He drew boundaries and directions for the Majles, and by  creating public controversy and intimidating the deputies, he  tried to keep the Majles from performing its lawful  responsibilities. He threatened that if things were said in the  open Majles sessions that he judged to be incorrect, they would  be answered in Voice and Vision programming.    C. The continuation of the illegal measures involving the  personal use of the Voice and Vision and the failure to heed  notices given caused the exalted leader to intervene and prevent  the radio broadcast of further installments of the answer to the  Majles from the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization.  The unworthy acts of the supervisor of the Voice and Vision  organization were that in subsequent portions of the answer to  the Majles and also on his answer to the statement given to the  press from the Majles public relations office, he made  inappropriate and distorted use of the Constitution and ordinary  laws to try to justify broadcasting his answer over the radio.  Instead of apologizing to the leader and the Majles and  realizing the illegality of his willful use of the resources of  the Voice and Vision organization, he continued to insist on his  position.    Did any of the Majles deputies, the Friday imams, clergymen  or writers who took a position on this matter prevent the  supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization from pursuing  the issues in the research and investigation through legal  channels? No, everyone said and wrote that if he believed his  honor had been attacked or if his rights had been violated, he  should pursue the matter through lawful authorities, but he  cannot violate the Constitution and ordinary laws, including  Article 49 of the Law on the General Policies and Principles of  the Programs of the Voice and Vision organization, which  emphatically prohibit any kind of illegal activity in the  country, by laying the groundwork for heresy that distorts to  high heaven.    Article 6 of the Law on the General Policies and Principles  of the Programs of the Voice and Vision Organization, which  happens also to have been cited by the manager of the Voice and  Vision organization, states: respect the human dignity of  individuals and refrain from affronting their honor, in  accordance with Islamic regulations." In the answer from the  Voice and Vision organization, which was broadcast over the  radio, this provision was clearly violated, and the honor of the  Majles deputies was affronted.    If it is to be established in an Islamic system, which  negates selfishness, that individuals can promote their ideas by  intimidating the nation's lawful bodies, the edifice will not  stand. This is the issue that took the issue of the research and  investigation of the performance of the Voice and Vision  organization beyond the ordinary course of events, and the  controversy will continue as long as there is continued refusal  to submit to the law.    The philosophy of research and investigation depends on the  proper conduct of affairs, the discovery of incorrectness and  distortions, and dealing with violators. Its purpose will be  defeated if the body or individuals being investigated and  researched heedlessly continue with what they were doing.    The roots of many problems and violations in some bodies and  organizations are to be found in selfishness and the failure to  submit to laws. If these roots are not cut off, they will grow  again and their branches and leaves will be everywhere.</p>

"Despite the  fact that a fall in production was predicted during the  transition to the market, today it does not have any clearly  expressed signs of a structure whereby individual sectors  develop rapidly, while others wind down because they are no  longer needed," the doctor of economic sciences noted in an  interview with your ITAR-TASS observer. Nevertheless, he  believes, the government is in a position to work efficiently  without introducing any kind of emergency measures in the  economy.    Responding to criticism from opponents, who see nothing new  in the presidential message or the government program based on  it, Aleksandr Livshits stressed: "I am convinced that it is not  superprograms that are required of the government, but the  implementation of commitments and its own decisions that have  already been adopted." "Everyone who is now trying to propose a  new program of action to the government is actually not wishing  it well," the expert believes, "because what we need at the  moment is not alternative ideas, but political will to perform  the tasks facing us."    As for the presidential message, then, from what Aleksandr  Livshits said, the publication of this document has made it  possible to offer society a considered strategy of action, whose  absence has been sharply felt since the beginning of the  transition to the market. According to the expert, this is the  basic innovation of the course. Second, the "innovation of the  message, as an initiative proceeding from the president, lies in  the fact that it proposes to plan a policy to track the price of  reforms. This means that the period of ramming methods of  reform is over and the period of considered actions is  beginning," the leader of the group of experts noted.    Third, he went on, the economic section of the message has  been met with "a moderately approbatory reaction by all  political forces apart from those who want to privatize the  entire economy within a month, or to reestablish the State  Planning Committee and the State Committee for Material and  Technical Supply in the same month." Thus, my interlocutor  summed up, the president's message meets the expectations of the  majority of society.</p>

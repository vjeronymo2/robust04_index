			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Story-driven stocks active on easier day Bourses mostly eased back after Monday's excesses, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT lifted BMW by another DM51 to DM790.50 for a two-day gain of 15.7 per cent. Without this, the Dax index would not have achieved its minimal, 2.22 gain on the session to 2,179.67, itself a 12.93 drop from Monday's post-bourse close. Monday's other main story-driven stocks, Degussa and Thyssen, fell DM10.80 to DM478and DM2.90 to DM259 after US-voiced reservations about aluminium production cuts late on Monday. Turnover fell from DM11.2bn to DM10.5bn. Mr Eckhard Frahm, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf noted that January's few gains in Dax stocks came in story-driven cyclicals as the index itself fell 3.9 per cent on the month. The drop would have been 10 per cent if the count had stopped at the low of 2,035.76 of January 24. PARIS edged lower but there were some wide fluctuationsas the CAC-40 index slipped 3.07 to 2,331.29. Euro Disney came back intofavour, rising FFr2.20 to FFr37.75 ahead of today's meeting by creditor banks on hopes that a resolution might be found to the theme park's cash crisis. Suez, too, defied the downtrend, FFr5.50 higher at FFr361.00 on news that it might be close to concluding the sale of its Groupe Victoire division. Paribas advanced FFr22 or 4 per cent to FFr563 ahead of tomorrow's full year results, whileLVMH lost FFr28 to FFr3,962 in spite of reporting an improvement in sales. AMSTERDAM saw a number of the heavily weighted stocks succumb to a combination of profit-taking, the weaker dollar and technical selling. The AEX index lost 2.97 to 435.74 after moving higher early in the session to set an intraday record high of 440.69. KLM fell back Fl 1.00 to Fl 46.40 ahead tomorrow's quarterly results. Hoare Govett maintained its buy recommendation for the airline earlier this week, noting that it has enhanced its competitive position in the sector through cost savings in recent years. The broker forecast a net profit of Fl 9m after a net loss of Fl 438m in the same period last year. Fokker continued to dip after the sudden resignation of its chairman, the shares losing Fl 1.00 at Fl 22.90 on worries that the boardroom shake-up might have an impact on restructuring proposals. MADRID dropped nearly 2 per cent, dragged down by the Banesto requotation which accounted for half the index fall, saidMr Chris Cooper at James Capel. The general index tumbled 7.04 to 351.27 as turnover rose from Pta47.7bn to Pta49.5bn. Banesto closed at Pta855 against a pre-suspension level of nearly Pta2,000, and a high and low yesterday of Pta895 and Pta850 respectively as it traded in 3.8m shares. One of the few winners was Telefonica, upgraded from hold to buy by Prudential Securities in the US, and Pta35 higher at Pta2,030. MILAN's Comit index, still encouraged by the calmer political outlook, rose 3.63 to a fourth consecutive high of 665.75 in spite of some profit-taking in blue chips. The market has risen by 4.7 per cent since last Thursday and Actinvest, an independent research group which does not believe that the left can win a majority in elections at the end of March, is forecasting that the Comit could reach 700 before the poll and rise to around 750 later. In banks, San Paolo fell L268 or 4.3 per cent to L10,400 after its results. Elsewhere, Benetton shed L1,358 or 4.9 per cent to L26,644 as it priced a placing of shares for foreign markets at L26,500 and Burgo, the papermaker, fell L558 or 5.1 per cent to L10,339 as its board approved a one for fiverights issue. ZURICH hit profit-taking after its five day rally and the SMIindex, which peaked at 3,181.7, finished 29.7 lower at 3,148.7 in active trading. HELSINKI continued higher, the HEX index adding 33.8 or 1.8 percent to a record 1,929.5, helped ahead by lower domestic interest rates. COPENHAGEN was also at an all time high, the KFX index adding 1.45 to 117.38, its advance attributed to lower interest rates and expectations of strong economic growth and increased corporate profitability. WARSAW dropped 9.8 per cent, the WIG index losing 1,653 at 15,227.9 following warnings by several politicians that the exchange was a speculative 'bubble'. Turnover fell by almost 60 per cent to 1,900bn zlotys as the bourse scaled-down most sell offers and suspended trade in five stocks because of waning demand. ATHENS rallied after five consecutive losses, the general index closing 28.79, or 2.7 per cent higher at 1,083.96. Trading was heavy with more than 4m shares changing hands.

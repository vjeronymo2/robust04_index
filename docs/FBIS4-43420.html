			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Paul Cambon article: "What Future for the Paris-Bonn </F> Axis?"]    [Text] What are the prospects for the Paris-Bonn axis  following the European elections? The Franco-German desire for  harmonization remains intact, but the differences in approach  persist with a view to the major date of the 1996  Intergovernmental Conference aimed at drawing up the initial  assessment of the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty.    Are the very different results of the European elections in  France and Germany likely to influence the strength of the close  cooperation between Paris and Bonn? The question is  interesting, but remains purely speculative. In any event Bonn  is merely observing that the votes received by the parties  supporting the European Union [EU] as stipulated by the  Maastricht Treaty added up to a generally higher score (a veil  is being drawn over the abstention rate) than that recorded by  the "yes" camp in the September 1992 referendum.    However, German diplomatic circles note, the emergence of  the  De Villiers [head of anti-Maastricht list] phenomenon is being  closely watched. Not so much with regard to its possible impact  on EU policy, but especially with regard to its influence in the  political game within the existing French Government majority.  "It is easy to imagine the deputy for Vendee trying to  influence a particular right-wing candidate in the presidential  elections to give his major European options a more critical  bent," a Bonn diplomat said.    We will have to wait and see whether this hypothesis can be  verified. Franco-German relations, as they have been designed  and have developed since the signing of the Elysee Treaty in  January 1963, are a factor that cannot be ignored: The  Paris-Bonn axis is a reality. Nobody on either side of the  Rhine dares to cast doubt on it, because it has asserted itself  and seems more vital than ever to meet the huge new challenges  which have been facing Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall,  the emancipation of the East European countries, and the  collapse of Communism in Moscow.    Despite occasional vicissitudes and frictions in relations  between the French president and the German chancellor (which  was the case between Georges Pompidou and Willy Brandt), the  past has shown that the Franco-German accord on promoting  European construction has generally worked well. Even if it has  often been the subject of criticism which is at times fierce.  "The French and Germans can sometimes achieve the impossible.  And often they do not please anybody," one of Helmut Kohl's  close aides commented half ironically and half bitterly, and he  added: "Our cooperation is certainly not perfect. It is still  exemplary." At the Elysee [presidential office], in Francois  Mitterrand's entourage, the same tone is taken, stressing that  "the convergence in Franco-German approaches is neither natural  nor spontaneous." Clearly, any agreement between Paris and Bonn  is the fruit of long and sometimes difficult negotiations, and a  vital compromise.    From 1 July the Germans and French will have successive  six-month terms as EU president. Even before the 12 June  election, speculation was rife both in Paris and Bonn about  achieving the greatest possible harmonization of the two  presidencies. Some idealists or at all events extreme optimists  talked of the possibility of a "joint presidency." The idea did  not gain ground and it seems that each has returned to  symbolically less spectacular but probably more effective ideas.  However, there is one certainty: Many nuances and many  differences remain between France and Germany on the major  issues awaiting the EU, not in the immediate future but at all  events by 1996, the year of the Intergovernmental Conference  responsible for making the initial assessment and assessing the  prospects for the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty.    These differences relate both to the nature of the European  institutional reforms (although each recognizes the need for  them), and the future of European construction, more  particularly, its aims and its expansion plans toward East  Europe which, of course, nobody disputes but which nobody at  present sees very clearly.    Helmut Kohl is a highly convinced and unreserved supporter  of  European construction. For almost ideological reasons. As a  Rhinelander, close to France, he experienced the sufferings of  war as a child. As a German, having long suffered the division  of his country, he could not conceive of Germany's new-found  unity other than in the framework of the kind of free Europe  desired and launched by Konrad Adenauer and General de Gaulle.  Helmut Kohl is a fervent integrationist. His European  convictions are also based on a fully egalitarian democratic  concept. This remark applies to his concept of strengthening  the powers of the European state institutions, namely the  Brussels Commission and the Strasbourg Parliament. Paris'  desire for integration is not in doubt, but, according to its  present state of thinking, it wants to see the powers of the  Council of Ministers strengthened and expanded. However, in the  upper echelons of the French state, it is impossible to detect  any very ardent enthusiasm for conferring a key role on the  European deputies.    There is still some division between France and Germany on  the currently rather abstract link being made between expansion  and deepening. The French take a Cartesian attitude and more  readily place the emphasis on the second element, whereas the  Germans do not see any fundamental contradictions. Quite the  reverse.    The fact remains that, over the past 12 months, the subject  of EU expansion, not only to the Central and East European  countries but also to Romania and Bulgaria and to the three  Baltic countries and Slovenia, has taken on a scale which some  people in France had clumsily underestimated. But even if the  integration of these various countries which have come in from  the cold is a matter of years, Germany, given its geographical  position, anxious not to be the last country in the East to be a  member of a military organization (NATO), very rapidly saw the  risks of a "gray area" grouping several countries between West  Europe and a Russia threatened with political and economic  instability. This same concern is shared in Warsaw, Budapest,  and Prague. To the extent that, over the last few months of  last year, Poland and Hungary requested integration into NATO.  They have done so in vain so far, but the future remains open.  And these same countries have also officially applied for EU  membership.    The facts are there, pressing. "France and Germany must  consider a planned and coordinated action," the Quai d'Orsay  [French Foreign Ministry] readily says. But for what Europe and  for what expansion which, it is feared, may be synonymous with  dilution? Such a serious question deserves a vast debate. A  variable-geometry Europe or an all-European free trade area?  Chancellor Kohl seems hostile to the second option. However,  it is not certain that he is a warm supporter of the first.    However, French diplomacy seems to be "working" more and  more  on the basis of this variable-geometry Europe, a formula which  is not new and which, at least in the monetary sphere, had  supporters in Germany. At the time there was talk of a  "concentric Europe." However, it is important not to confuse  things. The challenges facing the EU are of several kinds: the  common foreign and security policy, economic convergence, and  monetary union.    Although it is clear, but not easy, that an expanded Europe  must find the vital common denominator in the foreign policy and  security spheres, it is equally obvious that the huge gulf which  now separates the European Twelve or Sixteen from the fairly  long-term candidates for membership is not about to be bridged.  An illustration of this is that the per capita GDP among the  Twelve is currently $18,600 per year. It is only $3,000 for the  Visegrad group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovakia)  and $1,000 for Romania. And, according to expert forecasts, it  will take these countries a good 20 years to achieve 75 percent  of the EU's GDP. Provided that throughout this period the growth  differential for these East European countries is 4 percent  higher than the economic expansion recorded within the EU.    Expansion also implies a doubling of the Twelve's budgetary  contribution. A country like Spain would become a net  contributor. How can it be ensured that, faced with the scale of  such a financial commitment, immediate national interests do not  rapidly resurface? In Germany, for instance, during the election  campaign for the European elections, a good number of people  spoke out, especially among Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats,  demanding a review of the German budget contribution. The  argument put forward is that Germany, the EU's leading net  contributor, saw its annual per capita GDP fall from first to  sixth place among the Twelve under the effect of reunification.  "The thread of voluntarism must be taken up again," according  to one of Francois Mitterrand's close aides, who also describes  the "Maastricht Treaty as a forge for very tough metals." The  Maastricht Treaty would therefore become "a formidable tool" for  an ambitious plan. This is the conviction cherished by the  French president and the German chancellor, who are its  initiators. Once the parliamentary elections in Germany and the  presidential elections in France are over, the future will say  whether the Franco-German European faith is still as complete.  We can hazard a bet: We do not expect it to be altered too  much by the weight of reality and perhaps also the urgency to  find a solution.</p>

(Liechtenstein) and Frankenburg Inc. against the Russian oil  company Lukoyl. According to American legislation, a private  company cannot file a suit against a state company. This is  exactly what Lukoyl is--the state has the controlling block of  shares. Lukoyl is inclined to believe that the very fact that  the suit was filed with the court in January 1994 is an attempt  to discredit the company in international oil circles.    Lukoyl severed its relations with the Frankenburg Est.  company as far back as 1992 on the expiration of the contract  period, without any claims against each other. Besides  Frankenburg Est., the Canadian firm Calgary Overseas in the PO  [production association] Kogalymneftegaz was engaged in the  repair of wells, and is continuing this work to this day. Lukoyl  did not at all suspect the existence of Frankenburg Inc., the  other company mentioned. The appearance now of negative articles  in the Western press about the largest Russian oil company,  according to a statement by Aleksandr Vasilenko, chief of the  public relations office, is attributed by the Lukoyl leadership  to the reluctance of Western and American oil companies to have  the Russian firm participate in the development of the Azeri and  Shirak oil fields on the shelf of the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan.    It is well known that a protocol on intentions to develop  these fields was signed in November of last year between the  Government of Azerbaijan and a consortium of oil companies of  the United States and Great Britain, and in February of this  year a contract is supposed to be signed on the start of this  work on the Caspian shelf. The reserve of oil in these fields is  estimated at 50 million tonnes. The fields are considered the  most attractive on the territory of the former Union. And the  fact that the Russian firm laid claim to the development of  these fields even earlier, during Elchibey's time, was no secret  to anyone in the international oil market. It seems that  Azerbaijan's turn toward Russia with Aliyev's coming to power  compelled foreign claimants to Azerbaijan oil to be on guard.  They, of course, would like to play a more significant role in  the oil business of the former USSR.    The moral costs incurred by Lukoyl from the "organized"  scandal (this is what the company thinks) are obvious. However,  it is hardly likely that it will be deprived of a significant  share of the oil fields on the Caspian shelf. The final word on  who will participate in the developments, and how, belongs to  the Government of Azerbaijan, which is favorably disposed toward  Lukoyl and which is headed by Vagit Alekperov, an Azeri by  nationality and a former deputy minister of the oil industry of  the USSR. Trust in Lukoyl is also reinforced by the strong  support of this independent oil company by the Russian  leadership, which is of no small importance for official  Azerbaijan under the current political and economic conditions  in which the republic finds itself.    Lukoyl, laying claim to its share of participation in the  consortium, is not going there with empty hands. It opens up for  all its participants the possibility of transporting the  extracted oil through the Friendship oil pipeline, or through  the Novorossiysk port--until the new export pipeline proposed by  Turkey is built. According to the estimates of experts, the new  project will cost $1.4 billion. It would be cheaper to take  advantage of the proposal of the Russian company.    Lukoyl's claims to Azerbaijani oil have aroused the concerns  of Western oil companies. As has also, moreover, its activeness  on the world oil market. Already this year Lukoyl will begin  research and development of oil fields on the Tunis part of the  Mediterranean shelf. The right to development was granted Lukoyl  by the Italian company ENI, which has a license for this, in  exchange for the oil and gas bearing sectors of Western Siberia.  Lukoyl forces are also planning to begin exploitation of oil  fields in southern Egypt.</p>

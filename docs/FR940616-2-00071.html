The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Clinical Preventive Services. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Where to Obtain Additional Information <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is authorized under section 317(k)(2)(D) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(2)(D)], as amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Smoke-Free Workplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products.

Applicants must be able to demonstrate that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. They are laboratory medicine oriented;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A goal of their organization is to improve the quality of laboratory testing in POLs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. They have a long-standing interest in improving the performance of laboratory testing; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. They have a strong, specific interest in providing professional information to private practitioners with laboratories, thereby striving to improve the quality of laboratory testing in POLs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately $100,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund one cooperative agreement. It is expected that the award will begin on or about September 1, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to three years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period may be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to develop and provide professional and technical information and education to private practitioners with POLs, thereby helping improve the quality of laboratory testing available to the American public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In conducting the activities to achieve the purpose of the program, the recipient will be responsible for those activities listed under A.

Recipient Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Nationally, provide to POL physicians training that has been designed to improve laboratory performance. In the first budget year develop training modules related to the standards as set forth in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), designed to train POL staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Develop and implement mechanisms for communicating information directly to POLs relating to CLIA. These communications will provide accurate, concise, and rapid information that will give physicians access to new and/or revised CLIA regulatory provisions. In the first budget year, using the laboratory test categorization computerized database established by CDC, develop an interactive software program which is user friendly and can be queried by physicians for specific tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

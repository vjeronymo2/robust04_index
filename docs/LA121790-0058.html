			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 5 RECONSTRUCTION PLANS FOR COLISEUM PRODUCED;  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: IT WILL BE MORE THAN A RENOVATION. PROPOSALS MAKE IT CLEAR IT  WILL BE A FAR DIFFERENT PLACE.  </P> <P> After several days of work, a team of 13 prominent architects, engineers and  historic preservationists from around the country has produced five alternative  plans for reconstructing the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.  </P> <P> All of the plans lower the playing field, bring thousands of seats closer to  the action, provide for luxury boxes and elite club seating, maintain or  augment the stadium's famous tunnels and retain both the historic eastern  peristyle and the exterior walls.  </P> <P> But the plans make clearer than ever that the new Coliseum -- now a national  historic landmark as the only stadium to host two of the modern Olympic Games  -- is going to be a far different place.  </P> <P> It will truly be reconstructed and not just renovated. No matter where the  boxes are placed, on the rim or between new decks of seats, the facility will  have a substantially reduced seating capacity and a far different interior  structure.  </P> <P> Its major scoreboards may be moved from the columned peristyle to the west end.  The number of seats in the west end is apt to be greatly reduced. Front-row  seats are likely to be vertically separated from the field for the first time.  In one of the alternatives, the boxes would be constructed on top of an  entirely new structure built outside the present walls.  </P> <P> The alternatives developed during the four-day workshop, sponsored by an  unusual coalition -- the Coliseum Commission; the Spectacor Limited  Partnership, financiers and builders of the new stadium; the Los Angeles  Conservancy, a leading preservationist group; and the office of Mayor Tom  Bradley -- are only the beginning of the design work.  </P> <P> The alternatives vary sharply, mostly in the placement of the boxes, the  lowering of some seats, the establishment of new sight lines and seating tiers,  and the plans for providing new service concourses.  </P> <P> But even more radical changes may be incorporated in the final official plan,  expected in four to six months from the Kansas City architectural firm of HNTB.  Three of the firm's leading designers participated in developing the  alternatives released here late Saturday.  </P> <P> Also emerging from the workshop was the likelihood of a longer construction  period than officials had indicated.  </P> <P> Work cannot begin until the expected yearlong process of preparing an  environmental impact report is complete. A public hearing on the scope of the  environmental study is scheduled for the Sports Arena on Tuesday at 6 p.m.  </P> <P> In their 65-page report, the designers estimated actual construction would take  27 months, making it plain that the Coliseum's prime tenants, the Los Angeles  Raiders and USC football teams, will have to find somewhere else to play for  two seasons, not just one.  </P> <P> The time frame also makes it uncertain whether the new Coliseum will be ready  to host World Cup soccer matches in 1994, as Bradley and others organizing a  Los Angeles bid for the finals and semifinals have hoped.  </P> <P> Coliseum Commission Chairman Matthew Grossman said at the end of the workshop  that it may not be possible to begin construction until early 1993, which would  rule out the Coliseum for World Cup use. Even if construction were to start in  early 1992, it would be difficult to have the stadium ready in time, especially  since one of the HNTB designers estimated construction could take 36 months.  </P> <P> The loss of the Coliseum would not rule out a Los Angeles area World Cup bid,  but it would have to focus on the Rose Bowl, instead of offering both the Rose  Bowl and the Coliseum to the international soccer federation as had been  contemplated.  </P> <P> As last week's design sessions began, workshop leader Michael John Pittas,  formerly a Harvard faculty member and chief of comprehensive planning for New  York City, described the goal.  </P> <P> "Our work here is to find the middle ground between historic preservation and  building a state-of-the-art modern facility," he said. "We are generating  alternatives, not providing optimum solutions. We have to be sensitive to a  range of concerns."  </P> <P> Among the experts paid to come to Los Angeles to participate were Frank E.  Sanchis III, lead architect with the National Trust for Historical  Preservation; Michael Kwartler, director of Columbia University's Program in  Historic Preservation; Walter P. Moore, a Houston civil engineer, and George  Loschky, chief architect of Seattle's Kingdome. Among the Angelenos joining  them were structural engineer John Kariotis and architects Francisco Behr,  Craig Hodgetts and William Ellinger.  </P> <P> Loschky and others said from the outset that while Coliseum preservationists'  concerns in recent years have centered on retaining the peristyle and the  exterior walls, retaining the basic arrangement of the Coliseum's inner space  and its tunnels may be just as important.  </P> <P> Now, they noted, there are no abrupt differences, row by row, in the quality of  seats in the Coliseum. When club seats and luxury boxes are installed, that  will no longer be true; there will be distinct class differences between people  occupying adjacent rows of seats.  </P> <P> "The present oneness of the spectator group, the democratic character of the  Coliseum, is a prime issue," said Loschky.  </P> <P> Bob Harris, dean of the USC School of Architecture, contended that retaining  the tunnels in the new facility would be essential. "Coming through the tunnels  into an extraordinary new place would actually augment our sense of history,"  he said.  </P> <P> The exchanges between those being interviewed and the experts made evident many  strong, widely varying opinions, about what the new stadium should be like.  </P> <P> For instance, Deputy Los Angeles Police Chief William Rathburn, long  responsible for Coliseum security, expressed concern that in an earthquake or  other disaster requiring evacuation, the tunnels would prove dangerous. He said  he has long been concerned that stampedes there could result in fatalities.  </P> <P> Raiders attorney Amy Trask said: "We want an intimate facility where our team  can hear and play to the roar of the crowd and where the fans can feel they're  part of the action. We don't have that now. . . . We cannot overemphasize how  vital intimacy is to the Raiders."  </P> <P> On the other hand, USC Athletic Director Mike McGee said the school's focus is  on well-placed club seating, where the school can continue to sell the best  viewing at premium prices to loyal alumni who are supporting its scholarships.  </P> <P> Both the Raiders and USC representatives stressed the importance of increasing  the number of seats between the goal posts on either side of the field, noting  that these seats total only 22,000 now. The Raiders said they wanted a seating  capacity of 65,000 to 70,000; USC said it would prefer 72,000, temporarily  expandable to 85,000 for USC's big games.  </P> <P> Christy McAvoy, a member of the historic resources group of the Los Angeles  Conservancy, said she recognized that "the guts of this building have to be  renovated," but she pleaded with the designers not to construct any boxes or  other seating that would rise above the perimeter of the present stadium.  </P> <P> As the alternatives were developed, it became evident that not all desired  features could be incorporated within any of them.  </P> <P> Only one of the alternatives, for example, manages to boost the number of seats  between the goal posts to 50% of the total, or about 35,000, as the teams want.  Three of the alternatives do raise structures above the present perimeter.  </P> <P> Some alternatives are considerably more costly than others, although no figures  were given by the experts. Coliseum authorities have talked of budgeting $145  million for the reconstruction.  </P> <P> Although the emphasis of the workshop was on retaining the historic elements of  the present Coliseum, both an official of the U.S. National Park Service and  the chairman of the State Historic Building and Safety Board told the workshop  participants that there is no authority by their agencies to actually block  demolition of such features.  </P> <P> Linda Dishman, the representative of the National Park Service, said, for  instance, that the most punitive action the Service could take would be to  withdraw the national historic landmark designation if too little of the old  Coliseum were left standing.  </P> <P> But, she added, if federal authorities were satisfied that historic elements  were retained, the buildings of the new Coliseum might qualify for a 20% tax  writeoff.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOME POSSIBLE NEW ANGLES ON THE COLISEUM  </P> <P> The Coliseum, built from 1921 to 1923 and expanded for the 1932 Olympics, has a  seating capacity of 92,516. Its comparatively shallow bowl, and large spaces  between field and seats, is said to make it a poorer place to watch football  than the stadiums listed below. The seating and the space profile of each of  these stadiums, superimposed on the profiles of the Coliseum, show how fans in  the other stadiums are closer to the field and watching from a steeper angle  than Coliseum fans. All of the other stadiums also have luxury boxes, which the  Coliseum does not.  </P> <P> ARROWHEAD STADIUM  </P> <P> This Kansas City stadium was completed in 1968 and has a seating capacity of  78,097.  </P> <P> MILE HIGH STADIUM  </P> <P> This Denver stadium was expanded to its present capacity in 1977. It seats  76,123.  </P> <P> JOE ROBBIE STADIUM  </P> <P> This stadium, outside Miami, was competed in 1987 and has a capacity of 75,000.  </P> <P> TEXAS STADIUM  </P> <P> This stadium, at Irving, outside Dallas, has permanent seating for 63,855 and  can be expanded with temporary seating to 73,855.  </P></p>

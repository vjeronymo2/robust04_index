			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> TALKS ON FUCHSIAS, HERBS CAP BUSY WEEKEND FOR GARDENERS  </P> <P> This is a busy weekend for gardeners: Not only is it the height of the growing  season for most plants and vegetables, but shows and seminars abound.  </P> <P> Today at 9:30 a.m., the Sherman Library and Gardens in Corona del Mar is  sponsoring a lecture on summer fuchsia care.  </P> <P> These gorgeous, purplish-pink flowering perennials are at their peak now and  the Sherman Gardens is a splendid place to see them in full bloom.  </P> <P> Susan Brozowski, color specialist for the gardens, will lead the talk.  </P> <P> Most gardeners in Southern California plant fuchsias in hanging baskets because  of their growth form, Brozowski says, but you can also grow them in tree form;  they also do well planted directly into the ground. Fuchsias like dappled shade  with no midday sun, and heat is an enemy -- which is why fuchsias thrive in  coastal gardens.  </P> <P> "Good air circulation is a must," Brozowski says. "Otherwise, they get diseases  and insects."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Watering Is the Key  </P> <P> As with most flowering plants, proper watering is key. "Fuchsias like to be  moist in spring and summer," Brozowski says. "We water two or three times a  week at the gardens." She stresses that a light soil mix is important for  drainage, so the fuchsias don't sit in puddles.  </P> <P> Brozowski recommends a balanced fertilizer on a twice-a-month schedule all  through the blooming season. "We fertilize nine to 10 months out of the year;  we've tried feeding both more frequently and less frequently, and every two  weeks is best."  </P> <P> Fuchsias bloom only on new growth, so an annual pruning is critical, Brozowski  says. She suggests cutting the plants back to six inches of woody stems at the  end of November and then reducing watering to about once a week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keep Pinching  </P> <P> "When they start to leaf out again, keep pinching them back and start  fertilizing," Brozowski says. "Take the top two leaves off each branch, so  you'll get two branches instead of one." She says that at Sherman Gardens,  fuchsias are pinched back until late April or early May. "You don't keep going  after the same branches; you'll see which ones need it. And don't wait till the  new growth is too long."  </P> <P> When buds start to set, stop pinching but continue to be meticulous about  removing dead leaves to discourage mildew and pests.  </P> <P> The Sherman Library and Gardens is at 2647 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Corona del  Mar. Admission to the garden is $2 for all ages; the fuchsia talk is free.  </P> <P> Lure and Lore of Herbs -- Did you know that it's perfectly acceptable to sound  the "h" in "herb"? Have you heard that herbs were first used by cavemen, who  accidentally dropped fresh meat into thickets and discovered that it tasted  better when roasted?  </P> <P> Probably not.  </P> <P> But you will learn these facts and much more from a talk by Kirby Davis, an  herb specialist, Sunday at 2 p.m. at the South Coast Botanic Garden on the  Palos Verdes Peninsula.  </P> <P> The loquacious Davis is an expert on all aspects of herbs, from their history  to their cultivation to their use in the kitchen.  </P> <P> "Soil is very important," Davis says, "and six to eight hours of sunlight every  day are vital."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Best in Raised Beds  </P> <P> Davis says herbs need excellent drainage and do best in raised beds. She fills  her herb beds with a mixture of about half compost, one-sixth vermiculite,  one-sixth peat moss and one-sixth sandblaster-grade sand. "This type of sand is  a little more expensive but it's cleaner and the grains are bigger, which makes  for better water run-off," Davis says. "And the peat moss is a natural  inhibitor of bacteria."  </P> <P> The most popular herbs in Southern California, according to Davis, are thyme,  bay trees, parsley and basil, all of which do very well in our Mediterranean  climate. "People also seem to want tarragon but it's very hard to grow," she  says. "It just doesn't seem to seed well here."  </P> <P> Her favorite fertilizer is rabbit manure, because "it's so pure that it goes  right to work without burning the plants, and the digested alfalfa fiber amends  the soil." She likes fish emulsion but doesn't like the neighborhood cats it  attracts.  </P> <P> "Herbs are so fragrant that most pests leave them alone," Davis says. The only  exception is basil: Hungry insects seem to find it as tasty as do humans. Herbs  will draw aphids, which Davis thwarts with a steady stream of water.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bane of Gardener's Existence  </P> <P> And snails are the bane of an herb gardener's existence, Davis says. She  recommends either crushing them with your heel -- messy but extremely  satisfying when you discover all your new plantings mauled by the voracious  creatures -- or using "That's It," a poison that comes in tiny flakes and so is  less likely to be sampled by pets.  </P> <P> The South Coast Botanic Garden is at 26300 Crenshaw Blvd., on the Palos Verdes  Peninsula. Admission to the garden is $3 for adults, $1.50 for seniors 62 and  older, $1.50 for students with ID, 75 cents for children ages 5 to 12, and free  for children 4 and under. The herb lecture is free.  </P> <P> Bromeliad Show -- If you're planning to be down San Diego way this weekend, you  might want to stop by Balboa Park, 1549 El Prado, for a free bromeliad show and  sale. The show will be open today and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission  is free.  </P></p>

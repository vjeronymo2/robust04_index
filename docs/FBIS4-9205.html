			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Antun Vujic, chairman of the Social </F> Democratic Party of Croatia, by Sinisa Kraml in Osijek; date not  given: "Yugoslav Orthodoxy Can Be No Part of Us"]    [Text] If the aspiration for greater social justice  and broader democracy means that you are a communard, then that  is what I am, but so is the vast majority of people. On the one  hand, communards are persistently anathematized, while on the  other hand factories are being stolen, whereby the former serves  to ensure that no one objects to the latter.    The recently announced unification of the Social Democratic  Party [Stranka] of Croatia [SDSH or SDH] and the Social  Democratic Party [Partija] of Croatia [SDPH; formerly SDP, Party  of Democratic Changes] has been a frequent subject of newspaper  articles and commentaries in recent days. Regardless of the  connotations of the more or less well-intentioned articles, it  is a fact that the unification of the local right, and then of  the left as well, means that the Croatian political scene is  experiencing the beginnings of a process of fermentation and  crystallization of the numerous representatives of the political  will of the nation into a few basic parties that are  recognizable in civic democracies.    We discussed the unification of the SDH and SDP with Antun  Vujic, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia,  during his recent visit to Osijek.    [Kraml] What does the unification with Racan's party mean  for  the SDH and for you personally?    [Vujic] The unification of the SDH and SDP is a constructive  act which should finally give Croatia a democratic left and a  democratic right. There is no center. For example, the HDZ  [Croatian Democratic Community] is not the center, but rather a  way of organizing power. In addition, the unification has made a  reality out our expectations, meaning that the former League of  Communists of Croatia has been social-democratized and the  preconditions for much broader activity have been created,  whereby the SDSH contributes an additional, authentic, social  democratic image, while the SDPH contributes the best features  that "settled out" from the last multiparty elections.    [Kraml] What are the essential and organizational points of  reference under which the partially united Croatian left will  act, and who all can become a member of it?    [Vujic] Our essential task is to represent labor and  workers,  because we are in fact all united on the question of the state.    If the aspiration for greater social justice and broader  democracy means that you are a communard, then that is what I  am, but so is the vast majority of people. On the one hand,  communards are persistently anathematized, while on the other  hand factories are being stolen, whereby the former serves to  ensure that no one objects to the latter.    Our doors are open to everyone, except those who have not  yet  cleared up the issue of an independent Croatia and who think  that social democracy is some other form of ideological  labeling. To be more precise, there is no room in the unified  left for Horvat's SDU [Social Democratic Union] and Suvar until  they fully separate social democracy from Yugoslav orthodoxy and  old-style communism.    [Kraml] What does the recent announcement of a confederation  with Bosnia-Herzegovina mean for the SDH?    [Vujic] The problem is not the confederation, but rather the  question of why we have not fought for that, together with the  Muslims, over the past two years. Naturally, part of the blame  rests with the Muslim side, but also with many people on our  side. We are now getting a trimmed-back version of what we  should have gotten together as a whole.    Someone is to blame for one of the most tragic political  mistakes in Croatian history. It is the people to whom  destroying bridges is more important than moving forward across  them, together. Everyone should have known that  Bosnia-Herzegovina is older than the idea of its partition.    [Kraml] What does a unified Croatian left offer Croatia?    [Vujic] It offers the notion that everything will be  different, i.e., normal. That workers will have workers' rights,  businessmen businessmen's rights, that science will be  autonomous, that people will not be evicted from their  apartments, that farmers will finally get the land that belongs  to them, not to Hapsburgs and to people who fled Croatia, only  for their patriotism to awaken at a moment when they thought  that they could acquire something quickly. The left can also  resolve all national issues on a higher-quality basis so that  the Croatian state remains whole and internationally recognized.    [Kraml] What human resources is the Croatian left counting  on  in the future in executing its program goals?    [Vujic] Once the left finally gets going, it will be joined  by half of the HDZ members and half of the HSP [Croatian Rights  Party] members, because they too are Croatian workers--in larger  numbers than all those who are currently regarded as majority  Croats.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Letter: A certain truth about business leaders Sir, Mr Akio Morita's DTI innovation lecture, and the surprise he expressed that many UK high technology companies find themselves being led by chartered accountants, has produced the expected response from the Institute of Chartered Accountants (Letters February 15). Mr Davis seeks to explain the difference in the normal pedigree of business leaders in the two countries as being largely cultural. What is undeniable is that in the post-Second World War period Japanese industry has been more successful than British industry and, although the causal link between accountants and relative lack of success in the UK is no more proven than a similar link between engineers and the successes of Japanese industry, it does give food for thought. Consistently one of the most successful sectors of UK manufacturing has been the chemical industry and here data from the last Chemical Industries Association graduate recruitment survey may be of interest. In 1991, CIA member companies recruited in excess of 500 engineers and scientists and but four accountants (and not a single lawyer). Equally, however, before one gets too anecdotal, there are certainly examples where engineering enthusiasm appears to have bankrupted companies. Hence the need for an appreciation of both fields by business leaders. What, however, I believe to be a certain truth, is that it is far easier to teach accountancy to engineers than to attempt the reverse.

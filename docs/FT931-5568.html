			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM forced to defend Thatcher MR JOHN MAJOR was yesterday forced into an embarrassing public defence of Lady Thatcher's economic management during the 1980s as opposition leaders accused him of seeking to blame her for the recession. His disavowal of reports that he now regarded the economic downturn and the contraction of the country's manufacturing base as the fault of his predecessor followed renewed efforts by Treasury ministers to talk up the prospects for recovery. But Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, damped hopes of another cut in interest rates to coincide with the Budget. In their last appearance in the Commons before the March 16 Budget Treasury ministers also refused to rule out the possibility of increasing taxation by extending VAT to zero-rated items such as domestic fuel, food and newspapers. Looking distinctly uncomfortable, Mr Major told MPs he had been misrepresented in a newspaper interview in which he appeared to suggest Lady Thatcher had underestimated the importance of manufacturing industry. In the face of a sharp attack on his remarks by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, Mr Major added that a full transcript of his remarks showed that he had not disowned responsibility for interest rates of 14 per cent he 'inherited' when he became prime minister in 1990. Mr Smith taunted Mr Major at Commons question time over the comments made in an interview in The Independent newspaper. 'Having run out of excuses for the abject failure of your government's economic policies, you are now trying to pin the blame on your predecessor in whose government you were responsible for economic policy,' the Labour leader said. Earlier, Ms Helen Jackson, Labour MP for Sheffield Hillsborough recalled Mr Major saying in 1989 that he would take his 'own share of responsibility' and not seek to heap it on his predecessors. Mr Major retorted: 'Lady Thatcher did more to help British industry than the Labour party has ever done.' He added: 'As far as interest rates are concerned, I was referring to the legacy of the recession that we are curing and that has now hit every other nation in Europe.' During earlier exchanges, Mr Lamont underlined again his recent caution about the prospects for further reductions in interest rates, emphasising the importance of holding down inflation. The chancellor also pointed out that the Treasury's 'postbag' showed individuals evenly divided between borrowers who wanted still lower rates and savers who wanted a higher return on their deposits. Labour is to use its supply day next Tuesday for a debate on domestic manufacturing industry. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that the opposition would use the debate to show how 'the rate of decline in manufacturing has speeded up since John Major became prime minister'.</p>

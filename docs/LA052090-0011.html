The Children's Museum at La Habra,  12,000 square feet of hands-on fun. Located in an old Union Pacific train depot  with a new 8,000-square-foot wing, the museum has seven permanent and one  changing gallery, in which the exhibits change quarterly.  </P> <P> Currently running through June 2 is "Children's Arts Festival," featuring  community art work centered around a Mexican theme. (A transportation exhibit,  "Cars, Trains, Boats and Planes," will begin June 18 and continue through the  summer.)  </P> <P> On the museum's Nature Walk, children learn about animals from all parts of the  world; next door, at the Bee Colony, they can watch the busy bees. The Carousel  play area includes a place where kids can get busy themselves with Legos and a  player piano. The Science Station, a physical-science area geared toward  fourth- through seventh-graders, introduces the kids to a an oil derrick and  gas pumps and gives them the opportunity to try on the uniforms of different  members of the oil industry. There's also a Kids on Stage theater gallery and  the Pre-School Play Park for children up to age 5.  </P> <P>  Children's Museum at La Habra, 301 S.

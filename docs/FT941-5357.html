			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / BAe in talks with Giat over Royal Ordnance British Aerospace said yesterday that it had been in talks for some weeks with the arms manufacturer Giat, which could lead to collaboration in some form between the state-owned French company and the BAe munitions subsidiary Royal Ordnance. A BAe spokesman said the talks were exploratory; no agenda or timetable had been set and there was no guarantee of their outcome. He did not rule out the possibility of a merger between Giat and Royal Ordnance, but compared the talks with the protracted negotiations between BAe and the French Matra-Hachette group, which are expected to lead to the two companies merging their guided weapons activities. Royal Ordnance, sold to BAe by the government in 1987, is believed to be losing money in spite of extensive restructuring. It has been struggling to find export orders to offset declining defence hardware requirements in the UK. In January, BAe cut more than 400 jobs at the Ordnance's Chorley factory in Lancashire. The Ordnance now has a total UK workforce spread over 12 sites of about 4,500 compared with 16,000 at the time of the sale to BAe. A further 1,000 staff are employed in Germany The BAe spokesman said Royal Ordnance and Giat were investigating the possibility of pooling resources to improve the quality of their businesses. Both Royal Ordnance and Giat manufacture guns and ammunition. They compete in certain areas and might continue to do so even if co-operation was agreed, the spokesman said. BAe, which reported a loss before tax of Pounds 273m last month, has been refocusing on its core activities of defence and aerospace, selling off Rover Cars to BMW and also disposing of its Corporate Jets business and the Ballast Nedham group of construction companies. Giat, which recorded a loss of FFr400m (Pounds 45.81m) on sales of FFr11.3bn in 1991, was transformed from a defence ministry agency to a semi-autonomous state owned company in 1990. It is one of the group of state-owned companies that the French government is anxious to privatise. Neither Giat nor the French industry ministry were available for comment last night.</p>

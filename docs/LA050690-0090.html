			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERE'S HOW TO GET TO GOTLAND, SWEDEN  </P> <P> Getting there: SAS flies every day except Tuesday from Los Angeles direct to  Copenhagen (flights depart Copenhagen every every half hour for Stockholm).  Starting June 5, SAS flies every day. Call (213) 322-7100. American Airlines  has a daily direct flight from Chicago's O'Hare to Stockholm. Call toll-free  (800) 624-6262. TWA flies daily from New York City's Kennedy Airport to  Stockholm.  </P> <P> Transportation in Sweden: Note: Check the catalogue and ask for packages  including boat or plane transportation and accommodation. Gotlandsbolaget Co.  connects Visby and three ports on the mainland.

Tickets one way start at $25 per  person, with an extra fee for cars.  </P> <P> Linjeflyg Airline flies every other hour from Stockholm to Visby. The flight  takes less than an hour. Cost varies depending on season and the number of  family members traveling (young children may travel at reduced price).  </P> <P> Getting around Gotland: Car rental available in Visby. Bicycle is the ideal  mode of transportation on this flat, small island, with abundant smaller  country roads where farm tractors are the only motor vehicles in sight. An  eight-day bicycle rental starts at about $25 (including insurance). Or go for a  package including accommodations at a hotel or campsite. There is also a  network of buses serving the island.  </P> <P> Where to stay: Several possibilities from hotels, apartments, pensions, to  youth hostels, cottages and campsites.  </P> <P> Hotels central in Visby are Visby Hotel, (P.O. Box 2044, 621 02 Visby. Tel: 119  25). A package including ferry transportation (round-trip ticket) bath and  breakfast is about $75-$100 per person a night for a double room.

Tel: 912 20.  </P> <P> Events: In early August, during Visby's annual Medieval Week, history comes  alive with medieval plays and recitals performed in the old church ruins,  guided historic tours and citizens wearing period costumes.  </P> <P> The second week of July, at Stangaspelen sports competition, islanders compete  in sports dating to the Viking era.  </P> <P> When to visit: The peak tourist season is between midsummer and September. Most  Swedes vacation in July, which means you need to plan for accommodations. For  those who enjoy beaches and water sports, summer is the best time to visit.  Spring (April-May) and early fall are beautiful and compared with the U.S. long  seasons, ideal for visitors who wish to avoid the summer crowds.  </P> <P> For more information on travel to Gotland, contact the Scandinavian Tourist  Board, 655 3rd Ave., 18th floor, New York 10017, (212) 949-2333; or write for a  catalogue to Gotlands Turistservice, Ostervag 1, 621 45 Visby, Sweden.

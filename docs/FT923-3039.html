			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Delors pleads for future of EC MR Jacques Delors, the French president of the European Commission, pleaded with his countrymen yesterday to prevent the European Community from breaking up, pointing to yesterday's German interest rate cut as evidence that the Twelve defend common interests. He described the cut as 'a reassuring example, which shows that the Community is a body where unwritten rules are applied by everyone', adding: 'Please let's not break that up.' Implying that Germany took its time in making this gesture, only a week before the Maastricht treaty stands or falls in France's referendum, he evoked 'a Community spirit where, ultimately, member states have a bad conscience if they defend their own interests against common interests'. Replying to questions on Italy's devaluation, he recalled 'the victory of civic spirit over what I would call obscure forces' in France, when as French finance minister in 1983 he had devalued the franc. 'I hope I will be able to take off my hat (to French civic spirit) next Monday for a different reason,' he added. Speaking after negotiations with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on a trade and co-operation agreement with the former Soviet republic, Mr Delors warned that the EC's ability to take in new members would be badly damaged if the French voted No to Maastricht. Admitting that people blamed the EC for the recession, and feared the deflationary criteria Maastricht sets for economic and monetary union (Emu), Mr Delors defended his controversial plans to raise Community spending by a third as an antidote. These would double fiscal transfers to the poorer member states, and sharply raise spending on research and retraining, but are in effect being blocked by the EC's main paymasters, Germany, the UK and France. The package 'enables us to meet the objectives of Emu without its deflationary effects', Mr Delors claimed.</p>

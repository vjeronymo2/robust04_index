			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Barclays to launch telephone banking trial BARCLAYS IS to launch a pilot telephone banking service for 10,000 personal customers from July. It said yesterday this was one of a series of projects which would revolutionise the way it provided services over the next decade. The experimental Barclaycall service will operate from Coventry, offering telephone banking to customers from 39 branches. The bank is also extending its personal loans telephone sales operation across the country. The moves represent an integrated effort to transform retail banking and are likely to be examined by competitors trying to find ways of reducing costs while improving service. Mr Bill Gordon, managing director of the bank's UK branch network, said it had decided to offer a telephone back-up to branch services rather than establish a separate telephone bank on the model of Firstdirect, Midland's subsidiary. 'The customer still values being able to deal face to face with staff in a branch occasionally, and we want to maintain that at the same time as offering a new service over the telephone,' said Mr Gordon. Several large banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland are experimenting with telephone services. Barclays emphasised that it hoped to extend the telephone service to small business customers. Mr Gordon said the bank, which last year made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m, was trying to 'sharpen' its risk-management methods. Among initiatives disclosed to staff at Barclays' 2,200 branches yesterday are: Each cashier will have a terminal to authorise cash payment electronically from any branch. The system, which will be fully implemented by next year, will answer balance inquiries and be capable of transferring sums between accounts. Storage and handling of securities such as debentures over company assets and personal life assurance policies will be centralised. Data about securities will be accessed by local branch managers using computers. A personal computer-based risk assessment system for local managers to judge loans for medium-sized and large companies will be piloted in two regions in the second half of this year. A central database holding all customer records and capable of updating accounts immediately will be installed across branches by the end of next year, allowing accounts to be opened by a single entry of data. Staff in seven of the bank's 23 regions will work on a new risk-management system for personal loans. The bank is likely to start testing new risk management methods later this year before deciding on the changes to implement. Two branches in London will be test sites for the whole range of initiatives. Barclaycall will offer a series of services including bill payments, balance inquiries and amendment of standing orders. Barclays has established a new central sales and service unit in its banking division to develop services. The Barclayloan Direct service offering loans by telephone will start operating nationally later this year. Meanwhile, Bifu, the bank staff union, issued a writ yesterday against Barclays Bank claiming damages on behalf of 400 computer staff suspended without pay in March 1991 for refusing to take a loyalty pledge during an overtime ban. Mr Rob MacGregor, Bifu's assistant general secretary, said: 'It has taken a long time to collate all the evidence but we are now confident of success.' Mr MacGregor added that the bank would be 'called to account' by the courts for the 'disgraceful treatment' of its workforce. Barclays' AGM, Page 20</p>

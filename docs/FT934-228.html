			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Republicans demand more concessions Republican opinion in Northern Ireland appears to be hardening against the London-Dublin peace declaration, after a meeting of more than 300 activists suggested that there was no support for the declaration in its current form. The meeting, involving members of Sinn Fein and the IRA and other republicans from across the province, in Loughmacrory, County Tyrone late on Tuesday, provided the first public demonstration of attitudes among IRA and Sinn Fein supporters towards the declaration, issued two weeks ago by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds. At the meeting, attended by some of the 60 IRA prisoners on Christmas parole, speakers insisted that they wanted peace discussions, but that further explanations and concessions were needed from the UK government before the declaration could be endorsed. None of the speakers accepted the declaration in its current form. They indicated an amnesty for prisoners they regard as political prisoners was essential for any agreement, though Mr Brendan McFarlane, an IRA prisoner on parole, in-sisted the prisoners could not be used as a bargaining chip. Mr Richard McAuley, a Sinn Fein official, denied that the party had made a decision on the declaration, although he said that 'on one level' the meeting reflected the mood of the republican community. 'There is a sense of disappointment now that people have had a chance to look at the document and listen to what has been said by British ministers,' he said. Sinn Fein claims that a process of consultation is continuing with its members. But the main reason for the delayed response appears to be tactical, with republicans hoping to extract further concessions from London. The Tyrone meeting is likely to increase pressure on Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, to toughen his stance. The IRA's tactics were further underlined in its new year message to its followers in the Republican News newspaper. In the message, the IRA insists that it supports continuation of the broader peace process, but gives no indication of any readiness to abandon violence.</p>

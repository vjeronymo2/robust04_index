			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- North Korea on Monday  unveiled an ambitious three-phase plan to develop an  international port and industrial complex in the  621-square-kilometer area between Najin and Sonbong on its  northern border, which was made a free economic zone under  Decision No. 74 of the Administrative Council promulgated in  December 1991.    The North Koreans aim to transform the Najin-Sonbong zone  into a modern international trade center, fully equipped with  industrial, commercial, housing and tourism facilities,  according to a confidential document acquired by YONHAP.    The 40-page booklet is titled "Golden Triangle  Najin-Sonbong"  and was issued by the Committee for the Promotion of External  Economic Cooperation, formed early last year under the auspices  of the External Economic Affairs Ministry.    According to the three-phase plan that was initiated last  year, the communist country will boast an international-quality  port, roads, railways, airport, electricity, telecommunications  and industrial facilities in the zone and expand Chongjin port  by 2010.    To begin with, it will build a new 1,000-meter harbor next  to  the current 2,515-meter facility in Najin and add 32,399 square  meters of storage for an annual freight capacity of 10 million  tons in the northwestern port city by next year.    Between 1996 and 2000, the area's annual freight capacity  will be increased to 20 million tons, with another 3,500-meter  harbor to accommodate freighters up to 200,000 tons as well as  500,000 square meters of storage.    By 2010, it will be equipped with a terminal capable of  handling 40 million tons of cargo and also house 36 freighters  weighing 20,000 to 200,000 tons.    Sonbong port will have an annual freight capacity of 10  million tons by then while Chongjin port is refurnished to  support the international role of Najin and Sonbong.    The 168-kilometer Hoeryong-Haksong railway will be  duplicated  and tracks linking Najin to Kuryonpyong and Hunyong expanded.    Also on the drawing board is a scheme to realize North  Korea's ambition of linking up with China and Russia.    Railways will be modernized and expanded to Hunchun and  Khassan, bordering China and Russia, respectively, and  expressways constructed to connect Hoeryong, Chongjin, Najin,  Sonbong, Khassan (Russia), Onsong and Namyang.    In addition, North Korea will set up 100,000 electric  telephone and data exchange circuits in Najin and construct an  optical submarine cable linking Najin-Hunchun-Posyet.    The masterplan also includes a 300,000-kilowatt power  station, an international airport in Sonbong and elaborate  connections to Niigata (Japan), Vladivostok and Khabarovsk  (Russia), and Hunchun and Jilin (China).    In particular, North Korea is seeking foreign investment in  advanced technology and high value-added services in the booklet.    It is offering to rent a square meter of land in the  Najin-Sonbong zone for 1.2 U.S. dollars to 3.2 dollars and is  asking 59 dollars for land development of each square meter.</p>

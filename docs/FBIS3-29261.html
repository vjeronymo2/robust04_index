			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- The government on  Wednesday embarked on preparing a concrete strategy to promote  the South-North dialogue now that North Korea has disclosed the  willingness to accept inspections of its nuclear facilities by  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). An initial  strategy meeting was held at the office of South-North dialogue  under the chair of Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae on  Wednesday afternoon.    No contents of the talks were formally disclosed. But, a  government source said the attendees decided to try to resume  the deadlocked working-level talks at the earliest possible date  with an aim to materialize the exchange of special envoys next  month.    The strategy will be further reviewed by a  unification-related ministers meeting to be presided over by  Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang on Thursday, the source said.    At Wednesday's meeting, the source said, it was decided that  the South would propose to resume the working-level talks if  North Korea does not offer it first within next week.    The Seoul government hopes to resume the working-level talks  suspended since last October toward the close of this month or  early next month, he said.    If North Korea proposes the resumption of the talks first,  the South plans to cope with it flexibly even if North Korea  offers a meeting other than the exchange of special envoys, the  source said.    At the moment, however, there is no change in the government  policy to materialize the exchange of special envoys at the  earliest possible date, the source said.    "We plan to promote South-North working-level contacts early  so as to facilitate the first-round exchange of special envoys  next month if possible," a government official said.    Saying that officials of related government offices like the  National Unification Board have begun to work out a strategy for  the resumption of the South-North dialogue, he said the Seoul  government may be the first to propose the exchange of special  envoys depending on the attitude of North Korea.    Chong Chong-uk, senior Chongwadae [presidential offices]  secretary for foreign affairs and national security, said, "We  expect working-level talks will be resumed to discuss the  proposed exchange of special envoys soon after the International  Atomic Energy Agency began inspection of North Korean  facilities."    It has already been agreed that when IAEA begins inspection,  an inter-Korean working-level contact would take place before  long, Chong said.</p>

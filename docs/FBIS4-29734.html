			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Chuan Must Give Top Priority to National </F> Interest"]    [Text] At the end of what has seemed an interminable  protest by supporters of hunger striker Chalat Worachat, we are  left with a question of judgment: how can Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai reconcile his political principles with the call for  political reform by disgruntled MPs in the Phalang Tham Party  [PTP], the third largest partner in his coalition government?    There seems to be no clear consensus on such an important  question, as the 21 dissident PTP members, apparently with the  support of party founder Chamlong Simuang, threaten to withdraw  their support for the government.    The Prime Minister maintained on Friday that he still had  the  support of the PTP. But events in the Phalang Tham Party were  not encouraging.    A few hours before Chuan made his statement, three prominent  PTP members submitted their resignation from political positions  in the government.    The PTP members were apparently upset by the government  whip's decision on Thursday to block a motion tabled by their  colleagues seeking to set up a committee to draft a new  constitution.    The situation is made even more complicated by early signs  that tomorrow's meeting of the PTP's executive committee could  develop into a resolution to withdraw from the Coalition.    "We will leave it to Prime Minister Chuan to decide whether  to reshuffle the Cabinet or to dissolve the Lower House," a PTP  source told the press on Thursday night, after the 21  disgruntled PTP MPs held a meeting to discuss the government  whip's action.    Regardless of the outcome of the PTP executive committee  meeting, Chuan should consider the matter from the perspective  of whether his decision will be to the advantage of the people.    Many PTP members have been unhappy since the party decided  to  join the Coalition some 20 months ago. Many of the PTP's major  policy issues have not received the full backing of the  government. Among these issues are the decentralization of  administrative power, the traffic problems, and efforts to help  defuse the "Chalat crisis" by reforming the country's democracy  through the 21 MPs' motion.    The end of the protest by Chalat's supporters at least  offers  Chuan the chance of getting back on course, of mending ties with  his coalition partners. He can start by seeking a meeting with  Chamlong, and try to reach a settlement that will pacify those  MPs who keep the conflict burning.    If there's no hope of a reconciliation with the PTP, Chuan  may have to think about a new coalition lineup that may include  an opposition party. The issue is whether there will be a  simple conclusion to the move toward realignment. The formation  of new partnerships between political parties is always easier  said than done.    For a start, Chuan will have to consult with the three other  coalition partners, namely the New Aspiration, Seritham and  Solidarity parties. More importantly, the selection of a new  political partner must be carried out in the manner understood  by the people.    The country's economic development cannot be maintained with  an endless series of political manoeuvring. The political game  being played has caused people in business to feel uneasy.    In forming a new government, Chuan must also ensure that the  campaign for political reform -- set in motion by hunger striker  Chalat Worachat and pro-democracy groups is not stopped.  Learning from the Chalat fiasco, any new government must deal  squarely with establishing political ethics and firm political  foundations that will promote greater public participation in  grassroots politics.    The support of the people cannot be gained if politicians  were to make efforts at forming partnership for the sole purpose  of gaining control of the Government.</p>

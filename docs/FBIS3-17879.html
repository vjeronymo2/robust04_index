Yeltsin -- 14    V. Zhirinovskiy -- 5    G. Yavlinskiy -- 5    Ye. Gaydar -- 4    A. Sobchak -- 3    A. Rutskoy -- 3    M. Gorbachev -- 3    V. Chernomyrdin -- 1    Other -- 17    Not sure -- 45    B. Yeltsin as Russia's president is more often the choice of  people in the arts, pensioners and women in general, persons  over 55 with incomplete higher and higher education, and those  who were active in the 12 December 1993 elections and voted on  party slates for Russia's Choice and the Party of Russian Unity  and Accord.    V. Zhirinovskiy as president is relatively more often the  choice of the military and police, managers at various levels,  workers in commercial structures, men in general (twice more  often than women), persons under 40 with secondary education,  and those who were very active in the elections and voted  predominantly for Zhirinovskiy's and Travkin's parties.    G. Yavlinskiy as president is more often the preference of  the military and police and people between age 25 and 40 in  general, with higher education, who took part in the elections  at the average Moscow level and voted for Yabloko.    Ye. Gaydar as president would be preferred more often by  students, employees in commercial structures, arts and non-arts  specialists, persons under age 55 with incomplete or complete  higher education who were active in the elections and cast the  most votes against the political associations offered in party  slates and for Russia's Choice.    The other "presidential candidates" had an insignificant  number of supporters in this poll, which does not allow analysis  of their socio-demographic makeup.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / EC boosts food aid for 60m facing famine THE European Commission yesterday proposed a Ecu220m (Pounds 157m) increase in emergency food aid to 60m people threatened by famine, writes David Buchan in Brussels. Mr Manuel Marin, aid commissioner, said famine could have disastrous political consequences. It could destabilise newly democratic governments in Zambia, Angola, Namibia and El Salvador, while rocking stability of such countries as Zimbabwe and Lesotho which were traditionally self-sufficient in food. Zimbabwe yesterday announced nationwide electricity cuts of up to 10 hours, blamed on effects of drought.</p>

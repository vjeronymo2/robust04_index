			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Observer: Spanish practice A colleague flying to Spain with British Midland after Christmas was advised by the airline to telephone Avis about renting a car. Yes, said Avis, we have a special deal for British Midland customers: Pounds 400 for two weeks. When mild disbelief was expressed at the rate demanded, the reservations clerk responded immediately with an even more special deal of Pounds 200. the moral for prospective customers seems clear: when dealing with Avis, act on the company's slogan and try harder.</p>

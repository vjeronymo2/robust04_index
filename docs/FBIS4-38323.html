			<p>BFN     [Text] A senior official in the Chechen State Security  Department said that Russian troops were on the move in areas  bordering on Chechnya.    The department's deputy head Khamid Dzhalmaldayev said that,  according to the Chechen general staff, a Su-27 attack plane  unit had flown to the air base in Mozdok, North Ossetia.    He added that Russian Interior Ministry special troops whose  fire power is equal to that of a wartime infantry division had  moved into the Prigorodnyy District of North Ossetia.    Dzhalmaldayev thought that these troop movement had to do  with the latest events such as the attempt on Dzhokhar Dudayev's  life and efforts mounted by the Russian special services to  destabilize Chechnya.    Meanwhile, defense, interior and security chiefs told a  conference chaired by Chechen President Dudayev that the  situation in the republic was under control.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEWS  </P> <P> ****  </P> <P> DEXTER GORDON  </P> <P> "Doin' Allright", Blue Note  </P> <P> In 1961, when this date was recorded, the late Gordon had just returned to the  jazz scene after an absence of several years due to personal problems. As even  a brief listen to this effort will show, Gordon was in remarkable form, blowing  flowing, rhythmically-dynamic lines buoyed by his trademark hearty tone.  </P> <P> The program moves from medium tempos tunes like the Gershwin's pretty "I Was  Doing All Right" and Gordon's cooker, "For Regulars Only" (two takes) to the  exhilarating "It's You or No One," taken at a gallop. Gordon swings  majestically through it all, and trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and pianist Horace  Parlan add distinctively complex solo voices.  </P> <P> In a word, this reissue is, as Gordon liked to quip, "solid."  </P> <P> Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five stars (a classic).  </P> <P> ZAN STEWART  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- A "national  assemblyman" from the opposition Democratic Party of South Korea  exposed the fact that the puppet police had installed watch  posts around universities and was using them by stealth,  according to a radio report from Seoul.    He said 29 posts around Kyonggi, Songkyunkwan and seven  other  universities in Seoul and other universities had so far been  discovered.    These posts are disguised as "dwelling house," "store,"  "tong  office" and "tentative building," the "National Assemblyman"  said.</p>

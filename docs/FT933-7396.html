			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Cadbury strengthens its role in US soft drinks market CADBURY Schweppes yesterday moved to strengthen its position in the US soft drinks market with the Dollars 231.3m (Pounds 154.2m) acquisition of a further 20.2 per cent stake in the Dr Pepper/Seven-Up group. The purchase of shares from The Prudential Insurance Company of America brings Cadbury's shareholding in the US soft drinks company to 25.9 per cent. Cadbury made it clear that the investment was a prelude to closer trading links with Dr Pepper that would enable the two companies to compete more effectively against Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in the Dollars 47bn market. Mr Dominic Cadbury, Cadbury Schweppes chairman, denied that the shares had been bought as part of a takeover plan but added: 'I would not rule out a further step in the future but equally we have no plans for that.' Discussions will continue with Dr Pepper on areas for future co-operation. Some City analysts believe Cadbury's drinks brands, which include Schweppes, Canada Dry, and Sunkist, may be injected into the Dr Pepper operation, giving it a US market share of between 14 per cent and 15 per cent. Dr Pepper already produces the bulk of Cadbury Schweppes' soft drinks concentrates in the US. Cadbury also sees opportunities for developing sales of Dr Pepper's brands alongside its own soft drinks in other markets. Acquisition of the Prudential shares will be funded from Cadbury's cash resources and existing borrowing arrangements. The price is equivalent to Dollars 19 a share, a 9.4 per cent premium to Thursday's market price of Dollars 17.375. The acquisition is expected to dilute Cadbury's earnings in the first year by up to 2 per cent. Dr Pepper/Seven-Up is the third largest drinks company in the US with a market share of 10.6 per cent. It has been growing quickly, increasing sales last year by 7 per cent. The group reported a net loss, after extraordinary charges, last year of Dollars 8m on sales of Dollars 658.7m but its performance improved this year. Cadbury Schweppes, the world's third largest soft drinks business, had a 3.4 per cent share of the US market last year.

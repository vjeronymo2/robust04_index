			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GET ON WITH THE GUN BILL  </P> <P> When Gov. George Deukmejian asked the state Senate to delay passage of a  carefully drawn bill outlawing the sale of 55 specified models of semiautomatic  rifles, shotguns and pistols, he said the request did not signal a retreat from  his previously expressed willingness to sign a law banning military-style  assault weapons.  </P> <P> "My position is the same," Deukmejian said. "I am prepared to sign a measure  banning these dangerous weapons, but it must be a well-crafted bill." The  governor said that while he remained "receptive" to the measure's goals, he  required more time to "review its provisions."  </P> <P> Despite the fact that this landmark legislation already had cleared the  Assembly and was just hours from passage by the Senate, the bill's author,  David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), agreed to Deukmejian's request.  </P> <P> However, as result of his review, the governor now says he has reservations  about two of the bill's provisions: One of his objections is to language meant  to keep gun-makers from selling slightly modified facsimiles of the banned  weapons. He also is concerned because, under certain circumstances, people who  fail to register assault weapons purchased before the ban goes into effect  could be prosecuted for a felony.  </P> <P> Neither of these reservations seems insurmountable. After meticulous scrutiny  by both legislative chambers, the measure's facsimile provision purposefully  avoids prohibition of any gun with a legitimate sporting purpose. Similarly,  the registration requirement allows assault-weapon owners 18 months in which to  comply, and gives judges discretion to impose misdemeanor rather than felony  penalties on those who do not.  </P> <P> More pointedly, any effort to amend this bill now will force it back into the  Assembly, which passed it without a single vote to spare. This time around, the  chances of defeat are at least 50-50.  </P> <P> There is no valid reason to subject this vital, common-sensical law to such a  risk.  </P></p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Private reservations Since the government is intent on mopping up the lion's share of institutional cash flow in the gilts market, the onus of supporting equities next year may fall on small investors. Conditions are promising: on a prospective yield over 4.5 per cent, the equity market now gives bank and building society accounts a run for their money. A stampede out of deposit accounts has supported US equities at levels which look optimistic set against sluggish growth in corporate earnings. So far, though, UK small investors appear far from convinced of the allure of equities. True, unit trusts have seen healthy net sales since sterling came out of the exchange rate mechanism. But the best of the inflows from the public and independent financial advisers are into bond and money market funds. Last month's congestion at the retail end of the gilts market equally suggests bonds rather than equities have been the immediate beneficiaries of lower interest rates. That is hardly surprising. Judging by last week's results from M&amp;G, purveyors of equity funds have had a particularly tough year. It could take a few more months of rising shares and low interest rates before small investors demonstrate any real enthusiasm. If retail investors keep gilt yields down in the meantime they will indirectly benefit the equity market. But that is no substitute for hard cash. The best time for equity professionals to tap their retail sources is before the government starts funding in earnest from next April. From then on, higher bond yields may look all the more tempting. And the government will be fighting for every penny it can get.</p>

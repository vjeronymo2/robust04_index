			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Former BCCI officers charged in Abu Dhabi THIRTEEN former officers of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International have been charged in Abu Dhabi two years after the bank was closed following a multi-billion-pound fraud. The charges, announced yesterday, mean that Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the bank's former chief executive officer, could face a 36-year jail sentence if convicted on all counts. Mr Naqvi was among several senior officers in Abu Dhabi engaged on restructuring the bank at the time of its worldwide closure, initiated by the Bank of England, in July 1991. They have been held in police custody in the emirate for nearly two years. Charges have also been made against Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, the bank's founder, and Mr Zafar Iqbal, another former chief executive of the bank. However, Mr Abedi, now living in Pakistan, may never be brought to trial as there is no extradition treaty between the two countries. The charges include forgery, use of a forged instrument, breach of trust, irregular allocation of dividends, false entries in company documents and false entries in accounts. Most of the charges carry a maximum sentence of three years or a fine, but terms can run consecutively. The charges are the culmination of an investigation in Abu Dhabi that has been running almost two years. 'A case of this size and complexity is unprecedented in the emirates and the prosecutors wanted to prepare the ground in as much detail as possible before they went ahead,' said an Abu Dhabi official. A preliminary hearing has been set for October 9 when the court will decide whether the accused bankers should continue to be detained in the police club, as at present, or should be remanded elsewhere. It will also decide whether a trial should be held in public. The prosecution has been launched against 10 of the 13 officers who have been in detention. The three men who were released, Mr Saleem Siddiki, Mr Nadeem Habibullah and Mr Askari Khan, are on conditional bail and cannot leave the country as investigations are continuing. It was not clear last night whether Abu Dhabi would be approaching the UK about Mr Ziauddin Akbar, the former head of treasury at BCCI, who was among those charged. He is currently remanded in Britain on charges laid by the Serious Fraud Office.</p>

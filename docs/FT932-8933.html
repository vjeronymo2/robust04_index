			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Japanese offer tariff cuts to revive trade talks JAPAN HAS offered to cut customs tariffs on 770 industrial products as part of a new effort by leading industrial countries to breathe life into the Uruguay Round of multinational trade negotiations. Mr Yoshiri Mori, trade minister, announced the offer at an all-day meeting in Toronto yesterday with his counterparts from the US, the European Community and Canada. One western trade official immediately dismissed the Japanese trade proposals as little more than tariff reductions already scheduled to take place. Mr Mori said implementation of the proposal depended on 'improved offers' from other countries, including cuts in their 'peak' tariffs. All four ministers expressed optimism that yesterday's meeting had given the Uruguay Round a new lease of life. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, said the talks 'achieved everything we wanted and perhaps a little more. This meeting has increased the rate of progress and we are now in top gear. There can be no doubt of the momentum towards a Uruguay Round agreement.' The ministers plan at least two more meetings in the next two months in the hope of a breakthrough on the broad 'market access' agreement by the time leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries assemble for their summit in Tokyo in July. Mr Michael Wilson, Canada's trade minister, said the participants at yesterday's meeting agreed to aim for a 'positive outcome' to the long-stalled Uruguay Round this year. All four ministers declined to comment on progress or disagreements on specific subjects. Among the 770 products included in the Japanese offer are electronics goods, construction and farm machinery, chemicals and rubber. Mr Mori said tariffs on 700 of these items would be eliminated. The proposed cuts would bring the average Japanese tariff down from 1.9 to 1.6 per cent. The Japanese cabinet yesterday approved a Y2,188bn (Pounds 12.9bn) plan to finance the central government's portion of the Y13,200bn emergency pump priming package announced last month to revive the depressed Japanese economy, Charles Leadbeater writes from Tokyo. Most of the remainder of the package will be financed by a Y5,000bn expansion in funds from the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme, Japan's shadow budget which is funded by savings deposited in the postal savings system. The FILP funds will be used to finance an expansion in housing loans and small business funds.</p>

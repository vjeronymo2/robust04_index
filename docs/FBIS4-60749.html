			<p>BFN     [Text] Three commanders of the infamous Golboddin-Dostam  militia have recently joined the Islamic Army and Mojahedin  along with their men. According to reports reaching the BAKHTAR  INFORMATION AGENCY, three militia commanders, Commander Sayed  Taher, Commander Qader Shah, and Commander Hafif who were in the  ranks of the infamous Golboddin-Dostam militia in a battalion  located around the electricity project in Tashqhorghan, have  joined the unit of Commander Hamidullah [word indistinct] along  with their weapons and men. They expressed regret over their  past activities. The men from the Army post expressed their  indignation against the militia and pledged to continue the  jihad to the end until the complete elimination of the militia.    Our correspondent adds that since the failed coup d'etat of  Karmal-Golboddin-Dostam on 1 January until now, dozens of  militia commanders and men, having expressed regret over their  activities, have ended their hostilities with the Islamic State,  and continue their jihad and struggle against the militia  alongside the ranks of the mojahedin.</p>

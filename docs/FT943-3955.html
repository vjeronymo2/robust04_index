			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Change in regional prosperity predicted The economy will form a patchwork of boom-and-bust areas over the rest of this decade, making obsolete ideas such as the north-south divide, a leading forecasting company reports today. The Henley Centre identifies the 50 areas with the best and worst prospects and says the pattern of prosperity will become more polarised at a local level as divides emerge within regions. Within greater London, for example, the centre forecasts that areas such as Kensington and Chelsea and the neighbouring borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in will prosper, reflecting large numbers of professionals working in growing information industries and expanding small-business sectors. Waltham Forest, however, is among the bottom 25 because of a large overhang of negative equity in the local housing market and a greater reliance on more traditional industries. The three main southern areas - the south-east, south-west and East Anglia - account for 11 of the 25 winner areas and eight of the 25 worst areas. In the north-west, Liverpool is in the bottom 25 while nearby Warrington is in the top 25. The bright forecast for West Lothian in Scotland contrasts with a poor outlook for Cumnock and Doon valley. The factors it has considered include: Underlying dynamism as illustrated by past performance in creating employment. Labour supply and whether there is an expanding, younger workforce with up-to-date skills. The entrepreneurial skills base and strength of local business. The employment structure as reflected in the balance of growing and declining sectors in an area and the distribution of head offices of big companies. Communications. Many of the coastal areas in the bottom 25 are peripheral to national and international markets. London has been voted the best European city in which to locate a business, Healey and Baker, an international property consultancy, said. Its fifth annual European Real Estate Monitor left the rankings of the top six cities unchanged from last year. The next five in order were Paris, Frankfurt, Brussels, Amsterdam and Zurich. The rankings are based on a survey of 510 executives in nine European countries. Local Futures 94. The Henley Centre, 9 Bridewell Place, London EC4V 6AY.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The press service of Ukraine's president and  government has reported that another round of talks between the  government delegations of Ukraine and Russia concluded in Kiev,  having made considerable progress in drawing up an agreement on  the first stage of settling the Black Sea Fleet issue. Yuriy  Dubinin, the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry  ambassador-at-large and head of the Russian delegation, is of  the opinion that the meeting held was characterized by greater  mutual understanding and even the desire sometimes to reach a  compromise in order to resolve the extremely complex problem of  the Black Sea Fleet.    The sides agreed on a list of the amphibious means that are  subject to division, as well as the off-shore and shore  infrastructure items that associated with them as well as social  sphere facilities.    Valeriy Shmarov, deputy prime minister and head of the  Ukrainian delegation, underlined that a decision on the Black  Sea Fleet could only be taken in a package of accords which  would be approved by both heads of state.</p>

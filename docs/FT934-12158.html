			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Bank fraud victims greet decision with jubilation or dismay CREDITORS to BCCI were sharply divided yesterday at the outcome of the Luxembourg ruling, which will delay their receipt of any dividends from the collapsed bank. Mr Adil Elias was jubilant at the news. One of the three who brought the appeal, he is an engineering consultant fromOrlando, Florida, and has been at the centre of the campaign to fight for a greater contribution from the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder. He was also elected to the BCCI creditors' committee at a meeting of worldwide creditors in Wembley arena in May this year, when it was disclosed that the amount the bank owed him was almost Dollars 2m. The second man, who also stood as candidate for the creditors' committee but withdrew, was Mr Hal Skolnik, a creditor in his own right and a director of a company called Sheerbonnet. The third, Mr Assilaos Artiki, is a Greek insurance broker. Other creditors were clearly dismayed there would now be further delays before they received back any of the money they had lost. Mr Brian Smallridge, finance director of Bury metropolitan district council and one of the six members of the British creditors' committee recognised by the courts, said yesterday he was surprised and disappointed at the result. Bury was one of the 30 UK local authorities which lost money in BCCI. Referring to hopes that the UK government would seek a better deal with Abu Dhabi, Mr Smallridge said yesterday: 'We would be delighted if Mr Major could come back with a large amount of money, but I don't know what influence he has.' He expressed surprise that Mr Elias should claim support from most of the creditors, pointing to a ballot of creditors last year, in which 93 per cent of those responding approved of the plan. But Mr Tony Scott, secretary of the BCCI Depositors Association and a member of the creditors' committee, said he was pleased the Luxembourg court had taken 'an independent line', because the settlement had been 'grossly inadequate'. Now was the time for the creditor committees to take the lead, he added. Mr Donald Macleod, convener of the Western Isles council, which lost Pounds 24m as a result of the bank's collapse, expressed disappointment at the court decision. 'The council, in common with the majority of BCCI investors, agreed to accept the liquidator's proposal, not because it was ideal, but because it was the best offer available and, indeed, the only realistic course of action open to it,' he said.</p>

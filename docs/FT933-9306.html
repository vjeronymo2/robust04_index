			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Colombia's black city turns to green sugar - John Madeley examines ideas for making cane harvesting environmentally sound THE SUGAR industry around the Colombian city of Cali does not arouse many sweet feelings among the local population. Thick black smoke belches from the large sugar fields close to the city, creating a serious hazard for road users, affecting people's lungs and producing an ash that rains from the sky to blacken clothes. In an area where the daytime temperature averages around 25`C throughout the year, sugar-cane is continuously planted and harvested; before harvesting the cane is burnt - so the smoke and the ash rarely stop. Without damaging the crop, burning removes the leaves from sugarcane stalks and makes them easier for cutters to harvest. Concerned that this 'sugar by-product' is not contributing to a cleaner environment, the Colombian sugarcane industry's research arm, Cenicana, is trying to help farmers to clean-up the skies and harvest their cane 'green' rather than burnt. Sugar-cane production in Colombia is concentrated on 135,000 hectares in the flat lands of the country's Cauca Valley, near Cali. About a quarter of annual output is exported, earning some Dollars 140m a year. Costs of production are around 11 cents a lb, about 1.5 cents more than the current world price. A buoyant national market takes most of the output and accounts for the industry's profitability. Switching over to green harvesting may be desirable, but 'it will need major changes', says Cenicana's director, Mr James Cock. The crop is cut by hand and if existing varieties of cane continue to be used, the cutters would only harvest about 70 per cent of their current output. As they are paid for every tonne they cut, their income would fall by about 30 per cent. The answer, Mr Cock believes, is to develop new varieties that can be harvested 'green' as quickly as burnt cane. 'We have some very promising lines which we call self-stripping, where the leaves fall off.' It also helps if the new varieties are bred with thicker stems so that the cutters get more weight per cut; if they axe the same number of stems a day, they harvest a higher quantity of cane, so maintaining or increasing their income. Again, it helps if varieties can be developed that are more erect as this makes them easier to work with. The new varieties will also overcome other problems facing the sugar industry, believes Mr Cock. 'With the present varieties, we take a lot of trash, such as leaves, to the sugar mill, which interferes with the factory process,' he says. 'If we can grow varieties where the leaves just fall off naturally before harvesting, we can overcome a lot of these problems.' Cenicana is also trying to develop varieties that have a higher sugar content. 'If we have a higher sugar content per tonne of cane harvested, then we can accept slightly higher levels of trash,' says Mr Cock. There are other agricultural advantages in harvesting green, he points out. 'If we harvest green, we get a mulch which covers the soil and helps to conserve water and control weeds and may, in the long term, increase fertility.' A further benefit is that green harvesting leaves behind substantially more residues, which can be used for industrial purposes. Sugar residues are already used to make paper and could be adapted as an energy source, possibly to generate electricity. 'Residues might also be used to fuel the boilers in sugar mills, which would mean a saving of coal.' Although cane for sugar is grown in monocropping fashion in Colombia, it normally needs no pesticides. Biological control is the norm, with damaging pests controlled by beneficial insects. Mr Cock wants to see this biological control maintained but cautions that the change to green harvesting would create uncertainties. 'We would have to harvest green cane for several years before we could be sure that the biological control would still be effective,' he says. His other concern is that the breeding material used in the development of new varieties is not available in Colombia and is generally in decline throughout the world. 'Unless the genetic resources are maintained, then we may not be able to get the breeding material we need,' he warns. Cenicana is trying to develop its own gene pool in order to make crosses and breed new varieties. While sugar originates in Papua New Guinea, germplasm collections are now maintained chiefly in Cuba, France, India and the US. 'It will be a slow process but I think Colombia will eventually move over towards green cane,' says Mr Cock. 'Australia has taken a big stride towards eliminating burning.'</p>

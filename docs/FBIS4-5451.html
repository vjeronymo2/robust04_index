			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [7 April PASASON editorial: "New Step for Lao-Australian </F> Relations and Cooperation"]    [Text] By an invitation from His Excellency [H.E.] Khamtai  Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic  Republic [LPDR], H.E. Paul Keating, prime minister of the  Commonwealth of Australia, led a government delegation to pay an  official, friendly visit to the LPDR from 5 to 6 April. During  the visit, H.E. Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating and his  delegation were accorded a warm welcome by H.E. Prime Minister  Khamtai Siphandon and the multiethnic Lao people. H.E. Paul  Keating and the delegation paid a courtesy call on H.E. Nouhak  Phoumsavan, president of the LPDR, in an atmosphere of warm  friendship. It was considered a very significant event in the  history of good relations between Laos and Australia.    An official consultative meeting to exchange views between  H.E. Khamtai Siphandon and H.E. Paul Keating was held at the  Prime Minister's Office in Vientiane in an atmosphere of  profound friendship and mutual understanding. During the  meeting, the two prime ministers informed each other about the  domestic situation as well as lines and policies in their  respective countries, the lines and policies which serve as a  firm basis for effectively strengthening cooperation for the  benefit of the peoples of Laos and Australia, thus contributing  to the common trend of establishing and promoting peace,  stability, friendship, and cooperation among various countries  in the region and the rest of the world.    Noteworthy is that following the consultative meeting, the  two sides reached an agreement on investment promotion and  protection between the two countries. This agreement is  considered an important basis for improving cooperation between  the Lao and Australian peoples to a new level -- a level which  will bring about ever greater benefits for the two countries.  Following the meeting, the Australian Government pledged to  continue its support and assistance to Laos. Regarding this,  beginning in 1994, the Australian Government will establish a  47.5 million Australian dollar four-year aid project for Laos.  In addition, the Australian Government has decided to give,  through the WHO, gratis aid in the form of food worth one  million Australian dollars to Laos. It will also continue to  support and encourage more and more Australian businessmen to  invest in the LPDR.    During the visit, H.E. Paul Keating also attended the hand  over ceremony of the Border Control Station at the Lao-Thai  Friendship Bridge, which was built with gratis financial aid  from the Australian Government and people as a gift to the LPDR.  The assistance given to the LPDR by the Australian Government  and people in building the Border Control Station as well as the  Friendship Bridge and other projects in the recent past has  substantially reflected the long-standing relations of  friendship between Laos and Australia, which have fruitfully  developed with each passing day.    The multiethnic Lao people highly assess the effective  assistance in various fields given by Australia, and consider it  an important contribution to the development of economic  infrastructure for the LPDR. The multiethnic Lao people also  would like to wholeheartedly hail the glorious success of H.E.  Paul Keating and delegation on their visit to the LPDR, a visit  which will contribute to further strengthening the already  effective friendly relations and cooperation between Laos and  Australia for the benefit of the Lao and Australian people as  well as in the interests of peace, stability, friendship, and  cooperation for the development in Asia-Pacific and the rest of  the world.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter: "Don't Call Him a Big Brother </F> Gangster; He's a High-Ranking Government or Commercial Official"]    [Text] If one wants to understand how gangsters get  involved in Taiwan's elections, "the native place of  gangsters"--Yunlin County's local ecology and the gangsters'  unstable history--is a typical case most worthy of exploration  and study. Especially in recent years, among the local faction  in Yunlin County, under the law of the jungle's "struggle for  survival," the discard rate of local political figures has been  particularly high. To understand the strong figures who have  newly appeared on the political stage, I'm afraid we must search  the "Record of Instability in Western Taiwan" in the news  archives for society in the past one or two decades, and not the  local political records.    "First become a brother and then become a member of the  legislature" is the "mood of a drifter" on Yunlin's page. From  the local legislative council to the center's National Assembly  halls, there is no lack of "big brother-type" figures who in  these years made a big splash. After the recent elections of  county members of the legislature and of heads of townships and  towns, in Yunlin County inroads were made by more local  political figures who in past years were important armed  criminals or who were trained to be gangsters. Moreover, at the  side of local faction leaders there is even no lack of "wolves"  whose previous crimninal records as important armed criminals in  cases of robbery created a stir in their early years. Because of  the sudden increase in "huge profits" politically from "changing  to inferior election styles," these "brothers" who can frighten  people do not just engage in shootouts for control of gambling  halls and bars; they have expanded their undertakings to  aggregate construction, land brokerage, election canvassing, and  entertainment, and have established national connections of  enormous power. Ordinarily, local affairs amount at the smallest  to traffic accident settlements and disputes over debts and  business operations, and at the largest to local elections and  factional grievances. Provided that these "brothers" make their  appearance, everybody will be fearful and the dignified ones  will be the "black peacemakers." The recent election of the  principal and deput speakers of the legislative body is the best  example of this.    Precisely like the samurai films depicting Japan's Shogunate  Era, the leaders of local factions care for and harbor "samurai"  who excel in the martial arts in order to consolidate their own  political and economic domains. When each faction sticks to its  own position, the factions do not hesitate to develop their  "strength" by letting the "brothers" go into action on their  behalf. Last year there was even performed a play in which a  "venerable godfather-type" figure in the political world was  forced to withdraw from an election. This "retired" godfather in  that year may be said to be the "First Ancestor" who "pulled"  many "small brothers" into the political world; at the same time  he was also the benefactor who got cases dismissed for "little  brothers" wanted by the police, but the "little brothers" of the  hostile factions that had become big and strong forced the "big  brother to yield."    Opening the "Record of Instability in Western Taiwan," we  see  that in each of the 60th and 70th years of the republic there  was a sensational gangland robbery case as well as several top  news stories about factional fighting in society between "big  brothers." The figure with real strength now on the political  stage in Yulin County was not involved in these cases; rather,  he was the benefactor who, after the event, spared no effort and  lost no time in guaranteeing that the "brothers" got out of  prison. Therefore, after getting out, these "brothers"  gravitated to the side of the local politician.    In the 60th year of the republic, a "venerated" "model  brother" of Yunlin County who had committed armed robbery and  murder was sentenced to 11 years in prison. When in Chiayi while  being escorted to prison, he was forcibly freed by his father  and his subordinates Ting Jih-ch'ing [0002 2480 3237] and Hsu  Hsiu-ch'uan [6079 4423 3123]. This first case in the country of  a forcible freeing of a prisoner greatly enhanced the fame of  the "model brother" and Ting Jih-ch'ing along the underworld's  "grapevince," and established their positions in gangland. In  particular, the way Ting Jih-ch'ing's getaway car evaded police  roadblocks was enough to make him proud as a peacock. However,  after fleeing for a period of time, they were caught and  returned to prison. It is said that during the years that the  "model brother" was a fugitive he got financial aid from a  certain member of the legislature from Yunlin.    In October of the 70th year of the republic, when old Ting  Jih-ch'ing of the Read Sealine Gang in western Taiwan was  carousing in the Hungyulin Bar in Hsilo Town, his subordinates  for a time carelessly relaxed their guard, and Chang Chin-shu  [4545 6855 2885], a subordinate of "Little Lin" [1420 2651], a  member of the "tiger tail" "Central Plains Gang," which was as  incompaptible as fire and water with Ting's gang, fired three  shots killing Ting. Not long afterward, Chang Chin-shu was shot  and severely wounded in Paochung Township by Liu An-yuan [3966  1344 0337], a "hitman" instigated by Ch'en Lung [3086 7127].    After Ch'en Lung and Liu An-yuan were arrested, their  subordinate 15-year-old Huang [7806] X in collusion with Li  [2621], Lin [2651], Hsu [6079] and other "brothers," in July of  the 72d year of the republic, brandishing swords and guns in  front of Yunlin's local court, openly freed Liu and Ch'en, who  were being brought to the court for trial as the suspected  criminals in the shooting case. Among those taking part in this  action was Ting Hsueh-ching [0002 1331 4842], who once drove a  getaway car for Lo Ch'ing-chin [5012 3237 6930], an important  criminal. When he was in a reformator, Ting wrote a story about  an underworld drifter entitled "Wind and Cloud in Western  Taiwan."    Now the "model brother," who more than 20 years ago was  forcibly freed from police custody, has become an official of a  certain large entertainment company and a certain sandstone  plant, both in Yunlin. He was involved in an arms smuggling case  but was protected by a certain heavyweight member of the  Legislative Yuan from Yunlin. In recent years, although he has  not bothered to settle old gangland scores. when an election  battle heats up this "big brother" takes action to repay an old  favor or old injury.    Moreover, "Little Lin," a circular order for whose arrest  has  been put out, in legendary style ran for county legislature  member 12 years previously; later, after the strong protection  of a certain "godfather" got a case against him dismissed, he  was elected to be county legislature member, thereby beginning  the meteoric rise in his political career. And "model brother"  Ch'en, who 12 years before had been forcibly freed from police  custody, also this year was elected by a big margin to be a  Yunlin legislature member.    It is said that among the current members of the legislature  from Yunlin County, there has been an increase of four "big  brother types" who had been in police custody or who had a  previous criminal record. In addition, many "brothers" wha had  been involved in the forcible freeing of police prisoners have  now become "big brothers" who stick to the sides of a certain  government VIP. Furthermore, the chief of staff "black dog" of  Lin Lai-fu's [2651 0171 4395], who three or four years ago  headed the list of most wanted armed criminals, is said to be  the trusted lieutenant at the side of this government VIP, who  had gone abroad for medical treatment, and he has made this  "underworld" force the biggest faction in Yunlin County. Such  being the case, how could a local election not be a case of  "black heaven and dark earth"?</p>

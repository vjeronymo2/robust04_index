			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Means to a public spending end: The case for targeting pensions and child benefits at the most needy is becoming harder to resist As the government struggles to control the UK's growing public expenditure, increasing attention is focusing on the Pounds 76bn in next year's budget for social security. At more than 30 per cent of the total, it is the largest single item of spending, and more than double the amount spent on education, health or defence. Yet the scope for scaling back spending on social security is limited by pledges on the state pension and child benefit in the Conservative election manifesto. This promised that the two benefits, which together account for half the social security budget, would not only continue to be paid on the current basis but would also be increased each year in line with inflation. The logic of this has been challenged by some ministers and advisers. The state pension and child benefit are both universal benefits - flat-rate payments made to all who qualify regardless of need. Why continue to pay these expensive benefits to rich and poor alike, the argument goes, while stinting capital programmes which might enhance the long-term economic prospects of the country? Earlier this month, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, told the Tory party conference that he was prepared to see greater targeting 'to focus benefits on the most needy'. However, it appears that what Mr Lilley has in mind is means-testing invalidity benefit, paid to 1.4m long-term sick and disabled people, rather than the more expensive pension and child benefit. Yet there could be significant savings if the government were to end the universal payment of the state pension. This is a flat-rate payment of Pounds 54 a week for single people, Pounds 87 for a married couple, given to all pensioners who paid enough national insurance contributions during their working life. The cost of paying the state pension to almost all pensioners is enormous; at Pounds 27bn next year, it accounts for more than 10 per cent of public expenditure. Yet despite the cost, it is inadequate for many pensioners to live on. For example, 1.4m pensioners need to top up their state pension with means-tested income support. Another 2m qualify for housing benefit to help with rent and 3m depend on community charge benefit to pay some or all of their poll tax. Almost half of all pensioners still receive means-tested benefits to top up their state pension. However, the number who depend on income support has been falling, according to Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. 'The idea that all pensioners are living in dire poverty is outdated,' he says. One in 20 pensioner households is in the top 20 per cent of UK households in terms of disposable income and one in eight is in the top 40 per cent. Most of the income of these 'woopies' (well-off older people) comes from occupational pensions and savings. The richest 20 per cent of pensioner households in 1989 had an average gross income of Pounds 14,710, of which just Pounds 2,800 came from the state pension. The better-off minority can be expected to grow, says Mr Dilnot: 'More than two-thirds of men now retiring have some occupational pension income - and this averages Pounds 65 a week. And nearly half of all women approaching retirement age have some sort of occupational pension rights of their own in addition to any widow's benefits they would get from their husband's scheme.' Better targeting of the state pension could divert the money from the minority of better-off pensioners to the most needy pensioners - and perhaps save some of the Pounds 27bn budget. One option would be to target the state pension on older pensioners. They are much more likely than their younger colleagues to be at the bottom end of UK income distribution, since they retired when occupational pensions were less common. However, as the generation currently retiring with substantial alternative income grows older, paying extra to the over-75s would soon become just as untargeted as universal benefits for younger pensioners now are. The alternative would be to switch to means-testing. This could not be introduced overnight. Even wealthy pensioners will have made plans on the assumption that they will receive the state pension - and it would be unjust to sweep this away suddenly. The same applies to those approaching retirement who may have counted on the state pension for their old age. Any change to means-testing would, therefore, have to be phased in over a number of years. However, the current level of pension might be frozen for those already receiving it, rather than increasing it in line with inflation. Some of the almost Pounds 1bn saved could be used to increase means-tested benefits for the very poorest, with the rest contributing to the reduction in public expenditure. In future years, much greater savings would be available if the frozen pension was completely phased out with a further switch to means-tested benefits. Similar considerations apply to child benefit, the payment made to all parents of dependent children irrespective of income. The level is Pounds 9.65 a week for the first child, Pounds 7.80 for each subsequent child (lone parents get Pounds 5.85 a week extra for the first child). The total cost of child benefit will be Pounds 6.3bn next year. Child benefit can make an important contribution to family well-being in low-income households. In 1989, for example, it contributed 8 per cent on average of the gross income of the poorest 20 per cent of two-parent, two-children families. For the poorest 20 per cent of lone-parent families, child benefit accounted for over a fifth of their gross income. As with the state pension, the level of child benefit is insufficient to lift these poorer families out of poverty. The average gross income of the poorest 20 per cent of two-parent, two-child families was Pounds 9,000 a year in 1989, half the average for all non-retired households. For the poorest 20 per cent of lone-parent families, average gross income was just under Pounds 4,000 a year. However, child benefit goes to many families in the upper end of the income distribution. One in six families is in the top 20 per cent of UK households in terms of disposable income, and two-fifths are in the top 40 per cent. Better targeting could redirect the money from these better-off families to those for which current levels of benefit are insufficient to raise their income above poverty levels, as well as perhaps reducing the overall cost of child benefit. Despite the savings which might be made, there are two difficulties in moving towards greater use of means-testing: take-up and the impact on incentives. Means-tested benefits notoriously suffer from low take-up, either because people do not know they are entitled to claim them, or because of the stigma attached to applying for them. 'While child benefit reaches virtually all parents,' according to Ms Fran Bennett, director of the Child Poverty Action Group, 'the latest survey into the take-up of means-tested family credit for low-income families suggests that only half of those entitled to it were actually receiving it.' Part of the reason for this appears to be that many of the people who do not apply for means-tested benefits would be entitled to relatively small amounts or would qualify for only short periods of time. Any shift away from universal benefits would have to make much greater efforts to ensure that means-tested benefits reach more of those who need them. Means-testing also has damaging effects on incentives. Typically, means-tested benefits such as family credit or housing benefit are reduced by 70p or 80p for each extra Pounds 1 of net income. This gradual withdrawal of means-tested benefits can combine with income tax and other deductions to leave the individual little better off and in some cases worse off as his or her income rises. The Department of Social Security estimates that last year 660,000 people on means-tested benefits lost 70 per cent or more of each additional Pounds 1 of income. A small number of people in work would have been better off if unemployed. The disincentive effects can be just as damaging for savings, since any sensible means test must take account of capital as well as income. Under the present means test for family credit, for example, no benefit is paid to anyone with more than Pounds 8,000 of capital (other than the value of their home and certain other assets). People with less than Pounds 8,000 of capital are assumed to earn Pounds 1 a week in interest for every Pounds 250 over Pounds 3,000. This imputed interest rate is more than 20 per cent a year, much higher than could possibly be earned on it. Such an approach encourages those who might qualify for means-tested benefits to spend their capital or invest in assets such as a home which are not assessed for the means test. The consequences could be particularly damaging if the state pension was means-tested, offering a disincentive to save for retirement at a time when the government is anxious to promote personal pensions. 'Any move to means-testing for the pension would need to make sure that the return to private saving is not depressed excessively,' warns Mr Dilnot. Even if difficulties over take-up and incentives could be resolved, however, there remains the problem of the government's manifesto promises. A freeze in the state pension or child benefit or a switch towards means-testing would mean abandoning those promises. But if the Conservative government is unwilling to move towards means-testing, it could find itself uncomfortably outflanked from the left. Some leading Labour figures - including Bill Morris of the powerful TGWU general workers' union - have been urging the party to consider such a switch as part of the rethink after last April's election defeat. Labour then promised rises in the state pension and child benefit which would have cost over Pounds 3.5bn a year and required tax increases. Some party strategists are toying with a more selective approach to benefits, a fundamental change of approach for a party which has tenaciously defended universal benefits since the creation of the welfare state. There is little sign so far that the government is prepared to follow suit in such radical rethinking - hence ministers' focus on benefits for the long-term sick and disabled which are not protected by manifesto commitments. But with pressure on public expenditure now growing, criticism of universal benefits is likely to become increasingly difficult to resist.  -------------------------------------------------------------------             AVERAGE OCCUPATIONAL PENSION ON RETIREMENT*  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds per week (figures in brackets are proportion with occupational pension**  -------------------------------------------------------------------                                                         Single/ Year                              Married               widowed born            Men                women                  women  ------------------------------------------------------------------- 1900-04       40 (54%)             -  (4%)               - (26%) 1905-09       45 (56%)            34 (5%)               30 (30%) 1910-14       44 (61%)             29 (7%)              36 (33%) 1915-19       57 (57%)             29 (11%)             35 (40%) 1920-24       65 (70%)             29 (17%)             40 (46%) 1925-29        - (-)               31 (22%)             47 (49%)  ------------------------------------------------------------------- *  Average value of occupational pension received by men aged 65-69    and women aged 60-84 with income from an occupational pension. ** Proportions of men aged 65 and over and women aged 60 and over    with income from an occupational pension.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------                  HOUSEHOLDS IN EACH INCOME GROUP, 1989  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage of each type in following households*  -------------------------------------------------------------------                    Bottom     2nd     3rd     4th    Top                     20%       20%     20%     20%    20%    ALL  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Retired             52         45     17       9       7    26 Non-Retired 1 adult             10          7     10      12      17    11 2 adult              7         11     21      27      40    21 1 adult with children       10          6      2       1       1     4 2 adult with children       15         20     33      29      22    24 3 or more adults**             5         11     17      22      13    14  ------------------------------------------------------------------- *  Ranked by equivilised disposable income ** With or without children  -------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: DSS &amp; Pensions, Earnings &amp; Savings in the Third Age.

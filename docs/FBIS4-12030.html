			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political </F> Department, by Salwa Abu-Sa'dah in Cairo; date not given]    [Text] Faruq Qaddumi "Abu-al-Lutf", head of the PLO  Political Department, one of the organization's prominent  leaders, and indeed one of the strongest opponents of the "bad"  articles of the Oslo agreement, as he puts it, has given this  exclusive interview to AL-MUSAWWWAR. Hebron's massacre, its  repercussions, active influence on the peace process, and the  changes of priorities and concepts that it dictated,  particularly its undermining of the Israeli security theory, was  one of the chief issues he discussed. Neither Rabin's policies  nor the U.S. violation and circumvention of the text and  principles of the U.S. peace initiative escaped Abu-al-Lutf's  analysis. In the following interview he outlines the necessary  Palestinian negotiating method and sets forth the priorities of  Palestinian action after the Gaza-Jericho agreement is  implemented.    [Abu-Sa'dah] During the Arab foreign ministers meeting two  days ago, did you expect better results than the ones actually  achieved in connection with the Jerusalem issue and protection  for the Palestinians? What level of Arab action do you believe  is necessary to serve this cause?    [Qaddumi] The Arab group should handle the task of barring  U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This  group should also mobilize world support for our demands on this  issue, taking into account the fact that Jerusalem is part of  the occupied territories. The United States cannot turn its  back on the principles on which the peace process was founded.  These principles maintain that Jerusalem is part of the  Palestinian territories occupied in 1967. UN Security Council  resolutions specify this, too. Several weeks ago the U.S.  Administration submitted a message on human rights which  referred to the same point.    [Abu-Sa'dah] What do you say about President Clinton's  remark  that Jerusalem is Israel's capital?    [Qaddumi] The United States, explaining its reservations  about the Jerusalem paragraph in the relevant UN Security  Council resolution, says that Jerusalem is being left to the  final status negotiations. Actually this is a manipulation of  words. The United States must be an impartial intermediary and  must not interfere in such matters but must let the negotiations  take their course. There must be no alteration of the text of  UN Security Council Resolution 242 which considers East  Jerusalem part of the Palestinian occupied territories. The  United States should not give the impression to the world that  these territories are disputed territories in line with Israel's  pretension that it regained the Palestinian occupied territories  from Egypt and Jordan. The UN partition resolution that gave  Israel its own birth certificate declares that these territories  are Palestinian and belong to the Palestinians who have the  right to establish an independent state on them.    [Abu-Sa'dah] Will the PLO adopt specific steps to clarify  the  Palestinian opposition to any U.S. bias to Israel?    [Qaddumi] We have begun to take such measures. The Arab  League has been active in this regard. It organized a meeting of  the Arab ambassadors in Washington and formed a committee which  began a dialogue with the U.S. Administration, explaining that  the foundations on which the peace process rests must not be  changed. Otherwise the process of political settlement would  become flawed. The Arab group must also rally world opinion  around the idea that Jerusalem belongs to the three religions  and that East Jerusalem was occupied in 1967. The whole world  recognizes this.    [Abu-Sa'dah] What about the alternatives Palestinians have  to tackle on the issue of Jerusalem--negotiating it in the final  phase--and about the idea of internationalization that  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] raised some time ago?    [Qaddumi] Abu-'Ammar has not called for internationalizing  Jerusalem. These statements--if we can call them  statements--were fabricated by a foreign news agency. Jerusalem  in our view is part of the occupied Palestinian territories. I  am referring to Arab Jerusalem; it is the capital of the  Palestinian state. From the first moment, when we took part in  the Madrid conference, [former U.S. Secretary of State] James  Baker said that Jerusalem is part of the Palestinian territories  occupied in 1967. We are therefore mobilizing world public  opinion to emphasize this fact. Our vision is that east  Jerusalem must be the capital of the Palestinian state once it  is proclaimed. It is impermissible for any party to anticipate  matters and determine the fate of this city. Everyone should be  committed to the texts of international legitimacy and the UN  Security Council resolutions, which provide the basis for the  political settlement President Bush suggested on the basis of  Resolution 242. This resolution stresses the need to withdraw  from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967--east Jerusalem  was occupied in 1967--and definitely shows that whatever is  being said by the Israeli or American side in this connection is  jumping ahead of events.    [Abu-Sa'dah] Do you expect the Israeli response to the  disputed points in recent talks in Cairo--about the technical  details concerning the deployment of Palestinian forces in  Hebron--to be positive, or negative?    [Qaddumi] We know the policy Israel pursues and we know its  negotiating approach; it procrastinates and equivocates. Shamir  clearly said before that he wanted these talks to drag on for 10  years without taking a step forward. Rabin and the Labor Party  use a more flexible language that deceives many world circles.  He says that he wants to emphasize the security aspect in the  occupied territories and that Israel gives top priority to the  issue of security. He wants to blackmail the Palestinian  negotiator--as though it were Israel that is threatened--without  committing himself to the Oslo agreement. He even says that  these dates [not further specified] are not sacred.    After the ugly massacre--committed in Hebron through a  conspiracy between the settlers and the Israeli Army--it was  proved beyond a doubt that Rabin, who is in collusion with the  army, shows by his statements that Israel does not want peace.  All he seeks through these practices is to subjugate the  Palestinian people and eat up the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He  once again describes the Palestinian territories as Judea and  Samaria. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre proved that it is we,  and not the Israelis, who need security. The recent resolution,  904, demanded that protection for the Palestinian people be  provided. This rebuts Israel's claim to protect its security  against neighboring threats. The massacre has proven that  Israel is the chief cause of tension, that it procrastinates and  that it wants to devour the occupied territories. We reject that.    [Abu-Sa'dah] Therefore, you don't expect a positive Israeli  response to the points of dispute concerning the deployment of  the Palestinian forces in Hebron?    [Qaddumi] Israel is pursuing procrastination in the  negotiations. They sometimes agree on certain points, but later  on they disagree on these points. When we show flexibility and  accept specific points, they consider this a gain and they try  to gain more points. We reject this policy. They will make  other proposals that run counter to the provisions that have  been agreed upon. Israel procrastinates and it is not sincere.  We have no confidence in its behavior.    [Abu-Sa'dah] During the Cairo negotiations concerning the  deployment of the Palestinian forces in Hebron, Israel said that  it will unilaterally deal with the settlers the way it sees fit.  Do you believe that Israel will comply with its commitment  concerning the issue of settlers?    [Qaddumi] Israel must clearly adopt measures in this regard.  According to Resolution 904, Israel will disarm the settlers.  Israel must eliminate the settlements that cause instability and  obstruct the peace process.    Some settlements cause direct friction and provoke the  Palestinian people. These settlements must be eliminated.  There are 42 Israeli families, an Israeli school, and various  centers in Hebron. All these meant to provoke 120,000 Arabs who  live in the town and its suburbs. Many Israelis corroborated  these facts and demanded that this Israeli presence be  eliminated. Therefore, Israel must eliminate this. Israel  adopted some measures, including the imposition of a curfew on  Hebron and the occupied territories. This curfew must be lifted.  Israel must also end the siege on the West Bank, Gaza, and  Jerusalem, because these measures do not help create the  appropriate atmosphere for starting the negotiations.    The United Nations must send enough international observers  of various nationalities, such as Americans, Britons, Russians,  and the French, so that the Palestinian people feel secure.  These observers will supervise the questionable movements of  the settlers.    [Abu-Sa'dah] Now that the two sides have agreed on several  points regarding the Palestinian force, the deployment in  Hebron, and the international presence, should the talks resume,  do you expect Israel to withdraw by 13 April?    [Qaddumi] The question is not whether we are pessimistic or  not. The point is that Israel does not comply with the  agreement and does not honor the promises it makes, not even if  there is international verification of Israel's promises. In  the first place, Israel did not honor the Oslo agreement and did  not withdraw on 13 December. Rabin even boasts that these dates  are not sacred. Thus, for Israel, none of the points in the  agreement are sacred and require long negotiations. Since the  balance of power is in Israel's favor and it is the occupying  power, it does what it likes. But the cosponsors of the  conference must pressure Israel to implement this agreement in  full; that is, the withdrawal must take place on time on 13  April and the last withdrawal must take place in June so that  the elections can be held. They should have fully withdrawn  from Gaza, but they came to Cairo to seek a bigger area for the  settlements and to insist on their responsibility for security  at the crossing points, although the internal security and the  crossing points are two closely related issues. The crossing  points are the responsibility of the internal security and they  [the Israelis] are responsible for external security, which is a  like a seasonal issue that arises in case of an aggression  against the Israeli or Palestinian territories. They had an  agreement with Egypt, so there is no threat. But they insist on  interpreting the agreement the way they want and try to divest  it of its real substance under the claim of security.    [Abu-Sa'dah] How would you describe the magnitude of the  Palestinian rejectionists?    [Qaddumi] Everyone has the right to criticize, and the  Palestinian people have the right to voice their opinion  clearly. If I am one of those opposed to the Oslo agreement and  the bad points in it, the others too have the right to object to  it. But there are two kinds of opposition: The first is  objective opposition. The second is non-objective opposition  that involves insults. We are for the first. As to the  question of the negotiations, we have accepted them as a  political method to gain our rights, but resistance will  continue as long as there is a single Israeli soldier in the  occupied territories. We are entitled to defend ourselves and  resist this occupation. So, we respect the constructive  opposition as part of the national movement of the Palestinian  people that plays its role the way it sees fit, and we cannot  interfere in this. But we listen to criticism if it is  constructive. If we believe it is correct, we must take it into  consideration. We are going through a difficult peace process  and tough negotiations and we do not have any other alternative.  If we say we do not want negotiations, what would the  alternative be? It is true that the intifadah continues. We  have entered the negotiations to cut back on immigrants, contain  the settlement-building activity, and take part of our land,  albeit gradually. All this is important because time is passing  by, the settlements are built, and the immigrants are coming.  The settlement process has caused these phenomena to abate with  international pressure. We are committed to the political  settlement, but we cannot resume the negotiations before  Security Council Resolution 904 is implemented.    [Abu-Sa'dah] Do you think that Rabin's decision to consider  Kakh and Kahane Hay as illegal terrorist organizations will  affect the official conduct of the Israeli government and that  settlers will abide by the rules to be imposed on them?    [Qaddumi] The trend of racism and building settlements is  gaining strength day by day in Israel. This is what arouses our  suspicion about Rabin's ability to enforce actual measures in a  short time to prevent settlers from conducting acts of terrorism  and violence against the Palestinian citizens. He will not be  able to do that. Moreover, he does not want to take such  measures. This is clear in his hesitation concerning the Oslo  agreement. It showed on his face during the signing ceremony.  He looked as though he had been dragged to Washington against  his will by an U.S. order. This is the truth. This hesitation  was reflected in his responsiveness to the Israeli army  officers; he postponed withdrawal and began to impose  unacceptable conditions during the negotiations that produced  the foul Cairo agreement--the agreement that forced many  restrictions on us.    [Abu-Sa'dah] Can you specify what these restrictions are?    [Qaddumi] Giving the Israelis control on pathways; their  attempts to deploy more troops around settlements; granting more  areas to settlements; giving settlers freedom of movement;  cutting down the area of Jericho to less than 345 square km, the  area stipulated in the 1932 administrative division under the  British mandate; and other things they forced on us in violation  of the agreement. Rabin does not have the will. In the  meantime, he schemes with senior army officers. Peres said "we  were negotiating with ourselves." In other words, there was a  controversy among them on the stipulations of the Oslo and Cairo  agreements--which Minister 'Amr Musa calls the Cairo  declaration--because it was just initialed and not fully signed.  This agreement awaits the other part of handing over authority  to be complete.    Hence, we find that the measures Rabin is taking are  superficial and absolutely do not create a favorable or relaxed  atmosphere to keep up negotiations.    The ratio of those who support the Oslo agreement has  dropped  to less than 10 percent, if not five percent. How can such a  leadership lead the masses when these masses do not back the  agreement? That is all because of Yitzhaq Rabin. This gave  Israeli fanatics cards to play and encouraged them to commit  acts of violence and terrorism against the Palestinian people.  Rabin has bet on the fanatics; he has become almost one of them.    [Abu-Sa'dah] You disapprove of the Oslo agreement, but how  would you assess the peace process and the Palestinian  negotiating method, both with the Israeli and U.S. parties?    [Qaddumi] What we see happening before us does not make us  optimistic, something that will obstruct the peace march and  create a tense atmosphere that may lead to an explosion in the  entire Arab region. It will also affect Israeli society, where  there are voices calling for removing many of the settlements,  speeding up the withdrawal, and providing adequate security  measures so that the Palestinians may feel that Israel is  serious about peace. The differences within Israel will  increase. Yitzhaq Rabin has concluded an agreement with Shas  (an extremist religious party) under conditions that compromise  the Oslo agreement as well as the political settlement.    [Abu-Sa'dah] How?    [Qaddumi] Rabin and Shas agreed on five conditions, allowing  Shas to continue building the settlements, stating that they are  against a Palestinian state, and that they will continue to  establish settlements inside the occupied territories. We have  submitted a memorandum to the United States and Russia on this  recent Israeli agreement. Yitzhaq Rabin is still playing games,  maneuvering, and procrastinating. This policy and attitude by  Rabin will destroy the settlement and will increase tension to  the point of explosion.    [Abu-Sa'dah] What is the scenario that you think the  Palestinian negotiators should follow in this delicate stage of  the negotiations?    [Qaddumi] To insist on the political constants and on a  comprehensive withdrawal, discuss the settlements today and not  tomorrow so that measures can be taken to remove them, even if  gradually; to hand over power to the Palestinians immediately,  and to adopt immediate measures in the occupied territories in  general and in Hebron in particular so that our people there can  feel that there is a desire to establish peace.    [Abu-Sa'dah] It seems that the head of the PLO Political  Department does not expect the self-rule talks to resume. Is  this true?    [Qaddumi] That is a false statement. When we accepted the  Madrid conference, the United States told us that something must  be accomplished quickly, within one year: an interim  self-government that is more than self-rule and less than  independence. Thus, self-rule is rejected. There are twice the  number of our people as compared to Israelis in Palestine, and  this is clear. Thus, there must be sincerity in implementing  this agreement so that it can be fully implemented in the end  and an atmosphere of peaceful coexistence between us and the  Israelis can be created, not by creating obstacles,  difficulties, and procrastinating like Rabin is doing.    [Abu-Sa'dah] Has the Palestinian leadership started to  discuss the question of authority in the next stage after  getting a part of the land back in the first stage?    [Qaddumi] We have a popular saying in Arabic that we should  cross the bridge when we get to it. We are not after authority.  We just want our land back. We want our people, who were  wrenched from that land in 1967, to return. That is our major  concern. Another concern is to establish the pillars for the  security and peace of our people. After that, we can think  about the issue of authority. We are working on constructing our  institutions inside the occupied territories so that the people  can take on their responsibilities fully without any pressure or  threats.    [Abu-Sa'dah] I would like to ask you, Mr. Faruq Qaddumi,  about the political map of the Palestinian street with its  various parties and currents, and whether the Palestinian choice  during the first stage will be political pluralism or whether  this issue is not under discussion now.    [Qaddumi] From the beginning, there has to be free  democratic government and free economy. Everyone opposing this  course will be thrown outside it by history itself.    [Abu-Sa'dah] If you are thinking about pluralism, then you  are proposing dissolving the PLO. Is this a possibility?    [Qaddumi] The PLO does not necessarily need to be dissolved.  It is a haven for every Palestinian citizen and all the  organizations and institutions of the Palestinian people. They  have the right to stay within the PLO, and to discuss and  practice their duties through the organization. It is also  their right to explain and criticize every political decision in  a constructive way that serves the national movement and cause.    [Abu-Sa'dah] But what will the PLO's situation be like with  respect to the presence of political pluralism. What is the  proposed form for political action now?    [Qaddumi] It is the rule of the national front. During the  liberation phase, the national front will be formed. We insist  on the participation of all parties in this front. They are our  partners and have contributed toward the national struggle.  They participated with us in decisionmaking. It is their right  to work within the framework of this organization and to have  their specific responsibilities.    [Abu-Sa'dah] Very often in writings about the question of  Palestine and in talk among the Palestinian people, discussions  touch on the dictatorship in Palestinian decisionmaking. How  true is this and how can one avert it, if it is actually present?    [Qaddumi] In the stage of national struggle, central  democracy is the prevalent principle. To a large extent, it is  similar not to dictatorship, but is based on the national front  which will run all affairs.    However, we are on the threshold of a new phase, during  which we need to preserve freedom of speech and political  pluralism, as well as freedom to criticize and freedom of choice  for the Palestinian people. In other words, these democratic  features need to be adopted and the people need to feel that.  At the same time, we have all really started practicing them.  The issue of democracy is very important and we should not  close our eyes to it, to pluralism, or to free economy. In this  way, we can contain any individual behavior. However, at this  stage, while we are still scattered in all parts of the world,  it is not easy for us to construct our permanent institutions.  We are a nomadic revolution constantly on the move. When we  settle on our land, we will build our permanent institutions and  our democracy.    Such shortcomings will remain as long as we are dispersed.  We should not be harder on ourselves than is necessary. We  cannot hold general elections, and therefore we have to resort  to other methods until we are able to give our people a choice.  Our people are living under different conditions and in several  countries. They are under political, economic, and social  pressure because of their presence in those countries and they  are affected by those pressures, either voluntarily or  involuntarily. Some individual actions are caused by the absence  of the true form of democratic unity.    Our conditions create many failings and make a lot of the  actions of the leadership or individuals appear to be  individualistic ones. This is the reality.    We should not evade this reality but confront it and  continue  our efforts in this organization and tell whoever acts  unilaterally that they are acting unilaterally. If we look at  the Arab region and the Third World, we can see that the  leaderships there are not criticized as much as the Palestinian  leadership. We are nearer to democracy in its unrefined term.  We curse and exchange harsh words, therefore we are democrats.  The abnormal conditions of our people have created these  resentful ideas among the Palestinian people. We cannot change  them until we get back to the territories and then tell our  people: Be hard on your leadership because you are right in  seeing we have made mistakes.    [Abu-Sa'dah] How much are you convinced of your remaining  involved, when you are openly opposed to the Oslo agreement?    [Qaddumi] Being opposed to something does not mean running  away from the battle, regardless of the price. The Palestinian  cause is not served through statements or press writings. To  reach a common concept, we must get together within the  framework of the PLO and the establishment so as to have a  dialogue because a dialogue will remain one-sided if it is held  through newspapers and magazines.    [Abu-Sa'dah] What happened in the dialogue between the PLO  and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]?    [Qaddumi] No dialogue between us and Hamas has been held so  far. This does not mean that we have not made mistakes. We  have made mistakes. But the stage is really critical and we  must overcome many of the mistakes made by this side and the  other side. We must sit down and have a dialogue because  interaction can only come through a lively direct dialogue.  Many forces are trying to damage the PLO's credibility and its  ability to lead the Palestinian people. We want all our  brothers to participate in this dialogue even if they are  opposed to the Oslo agreement.    This is the lesser of two evils, because the PLO has lost  Arab aid and has been besieged politically, even by the Arabs as  a result of the Damascus Declaration after the Gulf war. Some  of us were of the opinion that we must get out of this  predicament. Many of us opted for the Oslo agreement, which I  oppose, as a way out of this dilemma. But as a responsible  leader, I cannot leave the others to navigate through the Oslo  agreement maze. I am a PLO official and I must be with them to  express my views frankly and clearly.    [Abu-Sa'dah] Even if such views are not accepted?    [Qaddumi] Even if they are not accepted. However, many of  my views are beginning to find acceptance. It is becoming clear  that many brothers have begun to realize that they were wrong  and that they were hasty in doing this or that. One of these  mistakes was that we made promises to some Arab states,  including Syria, for example, that we will take their views into  consideration. But Clinton insisted very strongly that the  agreement be signed on 13 September. Therefore, it was not our  responsibility. We approached Syria and Jordan. As to the  statement that everything was done secretly, the fact is that  there were several chances for a breakthrough in the  negotiations after they reached a deadlock. A breakthrough was  essential. The brothers achieved this breakthrough in the Oslo  agreement. They made an effort. But it is not true to say that  we lost everything, and that the Arab nation has lost the  military option. The Arab nation was in a deep sleep. We had  to have a breakthrough to bring about Israeli withdrawal. Enemy  withdrawal from any inch of land is a positive thing. If  negotiations were suspended, then immigration to Israel, the  building of settlements, and intra-Israeli accord would have  continued--a significant matter. We have created conflict among  the Israelis, and this will undermine Israel from within.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: CBI calls for moves on growth in Budget MODEST measures to help industrial growth in the March Budget were called for yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry. The employers' group said Mr Norman Lamont should resist the temptation to raise taxes significantly to reduce the government deficit. Any action of this kind might constrain the patchy signs of an economic upturn. The CBI wants the chancellor to extend beyond October the temporary increase in capital allowances that the Treasury announced in the Autumn Statement. Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee and chairman of engineering group GKN, called for lower interest rates to help the 'elusive' recovery. He said that only when growth was fully established should the government take action to reduce borrowing. 'Tax increases would give the wrong signal at a time when confidence is still fragile,' said Sir David. The CBI's preferred package of measures for the Budget would cost less than Pounds 1bn. The measures include continuing for the forseeable future the temporary scheme by which industrialists can write off 40 per cent of their investment spending against tax, rather than the normal 25 per cent. The organisation also wants the Treasury to reduce the burden of advance corporation tax on some big companies with overseas operations, under which they may be taxed twice on profits earned abroad. Other measures would step up support for exporters by lowering premiums charged by the Export Credits Guarantee Department. The CBI also wants the Treasury to reduce taxation on small companies by changing the rules on inheritance tax and capital gains tax. Sir David said that to pay for these measures the government might have to consider small increases in personal taxation ahead of the Budget. That could be accomplished through measures such as raising tax allowances by less than the inflation rate.</p>

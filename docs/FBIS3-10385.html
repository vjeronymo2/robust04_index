			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano; from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The president hopes that the implementation of the  so-called Sosa Plan will bring in 400 billion bolivares. The  Sosa Plan comprises five changes to the country's current tax  collection system. These changes are: taxes on luxury and  wholesale items, which will replace the VAT [Value Added Tax],  and modification of laws covering fiscal stamps, tax code,  income tax, and a temporary tax on bank debits. All of these  will allow the president, according to the finance minister, to  collect about 400 billion boliavares and reduce the fiscal  deficit to 2 percent of the GNP.    During his talks, Finance Minister Dr. Julio Sosa Rodriguez  explained that the tax on bank deposits would be effective only  up to 31 December and will yield 75 billion bolivares in six  months.    [Begin Sosa recording] It is a type of tax that one would  not  like to have permanently, but we have seen the results in other  countries where it has been applied. Therefore, what we are  going to propose is a figure, which I believe when applied for a  limited amount of time will not adversely affect savings. [end  recording]    The finance minister also expressed satisfaction with the  establishment of the fiscal police. According to the  Comptroller General's Office, current tax evasion hovers around  70 percent. It is hoped that with this new organization, tax  evasion will be reduced to at least 50 percent.    The finance minister also mentioned he did not understand  the  Senate's objection to Carlos Tinoco's candidacy to head Fogade  [Deposit Guarantee Fund] -- a candidacy proposed by the  president; nevertheless, Sosa said he would heed the decision.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SETS LIMITS ON IMELDA MARCOS' SPENDING;  </P> <P> FRAUD SUIT: SHE MUST HAVE APPROVAL FOR OUTLAYS EXCEEDING $10,000. THE ORDER IS  A MAJOR VICTORY FOR THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT IN ACTION SEEKING TO RECOVER $5  BILLION.  </P> <P> The Philippine government, seeking to recover billions of dollars allegedly  stolen from the country by its late president, Ferdinand E. Marcos and his  wife, Imelda, won a major victory Monday when a Los Angeles federal judge  placed new spending restraints on the former first lady.  </P> <P> Under the order by U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer, Imelda Marcos will  have to seek court approval of any expenditure exceeding $10,000, except for  the payment of attorneys fees and court costs. She will also have to report any  loan exceeding $10,000 and must file a monthly report with the court detailing  expenditures and accounting for all loans or gifts.  </P> <P> Pfaelzer acted on motions by lawyers for the Philippine government who, in a  massive civil fraud suit, are trying to recover $5 billion the Marcoses  allegedly looted from the island nation.  </P> <P> Ferdinand Marcos, who fled the Philippines in 1986 after Corazon Aquino was  elected president, died in exile in Honolulu on Sept. 28 after a long illness.  </P> <P> When the Los Angeles suit was filed in June, 1986, Pfaelzer issued a freeze on  the Marcoses' assets worldwide, pending trial.  </P> <P> In October, attorneys Alan D. Bersin and Michael R. Doyen of the Los Angeles  firm of Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson asserted in court papers that the Marcoses  and several of their business associates had violated the freeze on many  occasions. The attorneys, in urging the court to impose further restraints,  alleged in voluminous documents that the violations included transfers of  properties the Marcoses owned in New York and Hawaii and manipulation of  various foreign bank accounts.  </P> <P> "You've certainly made a good showing that the original order was violated,"  Pfaelzer said in granting the motion Monday.  </P> <P> The lawyers asserted that the Marcoses "fraudulently transferred" to Saudi arms  merchant Adnan Khashoggi ownership and control of two New York buildings, four  related corporations and at least one Swiss bank account in excess of $100  million.  </P> <P> The motion asserted that documents were illegally back-dated in an attempt to  transfer the Marcoses' holdings to Khashoggi while getting around Pfaelzer's  1986 injunction.  </P> <P> The court papers filed in October also alleged that the Marcoses violated the  injunction by spending $2.8 million and encumbering an additional $200 million  in their Swiss bank accounts to purchase arms for a planned invasion of the  Philippines.  </P> <P> The court papers further asserted that the Marcoses violated the injunction by  transferring ownership of their large Honolulu home to a corporation in  England.  </P> <P> Also named in the civil racketeering case against the Marcoses are Khashoggi  and others, including Robert Benedicto, a major shareholder in a California  bank. Benedicto is a fugitive from similar, but criminal, charges in New York.  </P> <P> The New York indictment, issued in October, 1988, alleges that the Marcoses,  Khashoggi, Benedicto, six others and California Overseas Bank engaged in a  massive racketeering scheme of fraud, embezzlement, bribery and obstruction of  justice.  </P> <P> Richard A. Hibey, Imelda Marcos' Washington-based lawyer, opposed tightening  the Los Angeles injunction on several grounds. He asserted that the alleged  violations occurred some time ago and that he should be allowed to  cross-examine some of the individuals who had filed written declarations in the  case.  </P> <P> Hibey also contended that, if his client were ordered to file monthly reports,  it would violate her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, because  such a ruling would require her to provide information that could be used  against her in a New York criminal fraud case set for trial in March.  </P> <P> Many of the allegations in that case are similar to the charges in the civil  case in Los Angeles. Both cases describe elaborate money-laundering schemes,  secret bank accounts in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Panama and other places, and  falsified documents designed to thwart investigators.  </P> <P> Hibey said the New York case alleges that there is no amount of money that  Imelda Marcos possesses that does not belong to the Philippine government.  Therefore, he said, any information she would provide in monthly reports to the  Los Angeles court could be used against her in the New York case.  </P> <P> Pfaelzer rejected the argument. The judge did, however, modify the original  proposal of he Philippine government, which would have required Imelda Marcos  to seek approval for any expenditure exceeding $5,000.  </P> <P> Hibey said he was "not surprised" by Pfaelzer's decision, which could not be  appealed at this stage of the case.  </P> <P> Bersin, one of the lawyers for the Philippines, called Pfaelzer's ruling "a  very important step forward" in the country's efforts to regain funds it claims  the Marcoses stole.  </P> <P> "We consider it a very important indication by the court that Mrs. Marcos  can't, with impunity, ignore the freeze order" issued by Pfaelzer in June,  1986, "with regard to assets the Philippines claims. It should have a  prophylactic effect."  </P> <P> If Marcos violates Pfaelzer's new order, she could be fined up to $1 million  for each violation. Hibey argued, to no avail, that the penalty would be  excessive.  </P> <P> The Philippine Commission on Good Government has been conducting an extensive  search to find assets it claims the Marcoses and their associates stole.  </P> <P> Bersin said Monday, "I can state with certainty we don't know where all the  assets are. . . . The Philippine government is aware of substantial bank  accounts in Switzerland and property in the United States."  </P> <P> Trial in the Los Angeles case will not begin until the New York matter is  resolved.  </P> <P> In addition to the civil racketeering charges, the Los Angeles suit alleges  that the Marcoses stole money from government-owned financial institutions,  converted to their own use foreign aid money designed to benefit Filipino  citizens and engaged in illegal money-laundering to conceal the funds from  authorities.  </P></p>

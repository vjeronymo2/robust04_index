			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Jerusalem"] </F>   [Text] Faysal al-Husayni, the autonomy's "minister on  Jerusalem affairs," yesterday declared war for Jerusalem. He  demands that "status quo" be preserved in the city and vows that  Arabs will pursue their struggle for city control. He is not  speaking of negotiations, he is speaking of control. Agreements  are the last thing on his mind, and he is, as a matter of fact,  saying precisely the same things his master 'Arafat did,  although he is using more refined phrases.    His remarks are neither baloney nor poppycock. They demand a  reaction, an immediate one. The required reaction is clear:  The Orient House offices must be closed down, all PLO offices  -- however they may be disguised or named -- must be moved from  Jerusalem to Gaza or Jericho, and an unequivocal clarification  must be issued -- in deed, not in words -- that the autonomy  will not penetrate Jerusalem, either overtly or covertly.    As far as we are concerned, al-Husayni's remarks, too, are a  call for jihad, a jihad without the commentators' smart-alecky  interpretations. The only difference between the PLO head and  his representative in Jerusalem is that 'Arafat made his remarks  in Johannesburg, in what he believed was a closed setting.  Al-Husayni dares make his statements in Jerusalem, striving to  do it as publicly as possible.</p>

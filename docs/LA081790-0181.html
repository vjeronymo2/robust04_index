			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ROONEY JR. LOOKING FOR A BREAK  </P> <P> Mickey Rooney Jr. has endured a series of false career starts, but his  autobiography -- "Which One's Your Mother?" -- and a couple of new country  songs might signal the break he has been looking for.  </P> <P> Rooney is still cautious even though his country songs "It Takes a Good Girl to  Get Me" and "There's No Easy Way Out of This Love" have been greeted  enthusiastically by record companies in Nashville.  </P> <P> "The people there are very interested," he said Thursday, adding that he  expected to sign a recording deal soon. But he is quick to temper his optimism,  citing past experiences.  </P> <P> "I've had eight record deals since I was a kid and it never went anywhere," he  said.  </P> <P> Rooney is the first of the actor's 10 children. His mother is Betty Jane Baker.  </P></p>

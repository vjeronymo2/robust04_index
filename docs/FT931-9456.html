			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Elf ordered to shelve proposed plant closure: State intervenes to protect regional economy THE French government has ordered Elf Aquitaine, the public sector oil group, to shelve the planned closure and relocation of a 480-staff laboratory and industrial site, in a rebuff to the autonomy of one of France's largest companies. This is the latest in a series of clashes between the public administration and Mr Lok Le Floch-Prigent, Elf's chairman, who has attempted to resist state intervention in the company since taking the post in mid-1989. It reflects the Socialist administration's growing anxiety over job losses as it strives to lessen the defeat it faces in next month's general election. The site at Boussens in south-west France is in the heart of a strong Socialist area, although the plans have provoked protests from all sides of politics. Although the move involves no job losses, unlike Hoover's recent controversial decision to close a plant near Dijon, Mr Paul Quiles, the interior minister, yesterday said it would have 'grave consequences' for the future of the region near the site. Mr Quiles is standing as a Socialist candidate in the nearby constituency of Tarn in next month's election. Elf yesterday insisted it had begun consultations on the relocation but had not made a final decision. The company hoped a negotiated solution with the government was possible. Elf is 51.5 per cent state-owned, with the rest of its shares quoted on stock markets in New York and Paris. Elf was planning to transfer the jobs on the site, an environmental laboratory and administration office, to other Elf offices in the south-west. The move was designed to save FFr100m (Pounds 12.6m) a year. Elf said it felt its plan had not been properly understood. Mr Quiles said the prime minister had instructed Mr Le Floch-Prigent 'to cancel the decision' because the move 'posed a problem to the government'. He rejoiced 'in this decision which proves the will of the government to see national companies fully assume their responsibilities'. Mr Quiles added: 'A national company cannot hold its shareholder, in this case the state, at arm's length.' The government has fought recently to limit job losses among France's top industrial companies both in the public and private sectors. In the past, however, it has not stepped in to force a group chairman to shelve a restructuring plan. French industry has cut costs far faster in this economic slowdown than in the last recession, a factor in the rise in unemployment to nearly 3m, 10.6 per cent of the workforce. However, this has aided French companies' international competitiveness. The direction to Elf could become a test of the future government's industry policy. While the right is economically liberal, it is just as anxious as the Socialists to limit job losses. Mr Le Floch-Prigent, a friend of President Francois Mitterrand, is also thought to be among the several state industry chairmen that a new rightwing government would consider for replacement in a general reshuffle of top jobs.

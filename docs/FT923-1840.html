			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / UK Company News: TVS founder attacks terms of US cable bid MR JAMES Gatward, founder and former chief executive of TVS Entertainment, yesterday criticised the terms of a proposed takeover by International Family Entertainment, the US cable television company, saying it failed to reflect the company's true value. Mr Gatward, who was ousted from his position at TVS in February 1991, said he had already been in contact with some of the company's private shareholders and expected to talk to others this week about the terms of the takeover. International Family Entertainment last week offered Pounds 38.2m to acquire TVS, the ITV company which lost its licence. The deal is worth 25p per ordinary share and 45p per preference share, and has the support of 30 per cent of shareholders. Mr Gatward is one of the largest private shareholders in TVS with 350,000 ordinary shares (out of a total of about 60m shares). He said the US cable television company's offer undervalued TVS, pointing out that at the end of 1991 TVS had net assets of Pounds 47.4m. International Family Entertainment is buying TVS primarily for MTM, its US production company which is responsible for programmes such as Hill Street Blues. MTM has been a thorn in TVS's side. Last year pre-tax losses jumped from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 26.7m in 1991. These included a further exceptional provision of Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 25.1m) against the programme stock of MTM.</p>

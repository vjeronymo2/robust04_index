			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Group restructure helps Amdahl Amdahl, the mainframe computer company, yesterday reported strong second-quarter results following a reconstruction of the group last year. Net income for the second quarter was Dollars 12.5m, or 11 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 23.7m, or 21 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues declined 15 per cent to Dollars 397m from Dollars 463m. For the half year, Amdahl earned Dollars 19.6m, or 17 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 775.7m. This contrasts with a net loss of Dollars 263.4m, or Dollars 2.32, and revenues of Dollars 843.9m in the first half of 1993 when the company took restructuring charges of Dollars 177.4m after tax. 'The restructuring efforts last year have brought our expenses into line with current market conditions, enabling us to generate profits on lower volumes of business,' said Mr Joseph Zemke, president and chief executive. In the latest quarter, operating expenses declined about 24 per cent from the same period last year, and gross margins rose to 35 per cent from 30 per cent a year ago. 'Our objective continues to be the strengthening of established businesses and the expansion of newer open systems, software and consulting endeavours,' Mr Zemke said. In May, Amdahl introduced a new line of massively parallel database servers developed by its alliance partners Oracle, nCube and Information Builders. During the quarter, the company began shipping data storage products purchased from Data General.</p>

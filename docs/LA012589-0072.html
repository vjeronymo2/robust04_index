			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACTEL'S YEARLY PROFIT A RECORD $1.19 BILLION  </P> <P> Despite flat fourth-quarter earnings, Pacific Telesis Group said Tuesday that  its 1988 profit topped the billion-dollar mark for the first time. Net income  for the year was up 27.1% from a year earlier to $1.19 billion, on revenue that  rose 3.6% to $9.48 billion.  </P> <P> The San Francisco-based company noted that its 1987 results were sharply  reduced by a number of one-time expenses. These included the costs of trimming  its payroll through an early retirement program and a state-ordered refund to  customers of the company's main subsidiary, Pacific Bell. Without those  one-time charges, 1988 earnings were up 6.4% from the year before.  </P> <P> Fourth-quarter net was $249 million, up from $150 million a year earlier.  Discounting the effect of the special charges in 1987, however, the results for  the final quarter of 1988 were "essentially flat," the company said.  </P> <P> PacTel Personal Communications, an unregulated subsidiary that provides  cellular mobile-phone and electronic-paging services, showed continued rapid  growth and increased profitability. The cellular-paging unit generated $381.1  million in revenue last year, up from $270.1 million in 1987, and contributed  $16.6 million to corporate profit, up from $5.7 million.  </P> <P> "Cellular has experienced explosive growth since we began acquiring properties  in 1985 and 1986," said Pacific Telesis Chairman and Chief Executive Sam Ginn.  "This is a critical source of growth for us in the future."  </P> <P> Since Pacific Telesis' formation five years ago after the breakup of the old  Bell System, Ginn said, the regional holding company's earnings have grown an  average of 7.3% a year.  </P> <P> Also Tuesday, Southwestern Bell, Pacific Telesis' counterpart in St. Louis,  said a strong fourth quarter helped increase net income for the fourth straight  year -- but only barely. The company earned $1.06 billion last year, just  topping 1987's $1.05 billion.  </P></p>

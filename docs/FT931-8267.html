			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (7): Smaller, ever smaller / A look at tomorrow's world of ultraportables WHAT'S next after personal computers? According to many in the PC industry, the future lies in hand-held devices that combine computer and communications technologies. Apple Computer calls them personal digital assistants, others refer to them as information appliances, but perhaps the best name is personal communicators. Whatever they are called, they are creating a great deal of interest among potential customers, and excitement within the computer industry where they are viewed as a potential multi- billion dollar market opportunity. Last May, John Sculley, Apple chairman, described his vision for personal digital assistants as the seeds for a Dollars 3,500bn industry that would be created by the 'collision of content, communications, computing and consumer electronics'. 'This isn't about taking a computer and shrinking it down,' he said. 'It's about starting with an entirely new set of principles built around intelligence, built around communications, built around complete intuitiveness . . . about building something that is as easy to use as an aim-and-shoot camera or a telephone.' The first version of the much ballyhooed Newton personal digital assistant is now expected to make its debut this summer. It will be an electronic note-pad, a hand-held device that 'intelligently assists the user to capture, organise and communicate information,' Apple says. At a recent demonstration of a prototype version of Newton, the device could decipher and store handwritten notes, automatically making entries in a personal calendar, send a facsimile message and send or receive electronic messages via the telephone. Apple says that the first version of Newton will be priced at 'well below Dollars 1,000'. It will be aimed initially at business executives, rather than the masses that Apple eventually hopes to attract with its easy-to-use technology. Price will be an important factor in the development of the market. It is generally agreed that to reach a broader market personal communicators will have to sell for less than Dollars 500 and preferably closer to Dollars 300. Bringing the expectations surrounding hand-held personal communicators down to earth is important, says Marc Porat, president and chief executive of General Magic, a three-year-old company that is developing software for personal communicators. 'I am a walking antidote to hyperbole and hysteria,' says Mr Porat. 'The public is tired of promises that the high-tech industry does not live up to.' It may be a decade, or even longer, before intelligent personal communications become a reality, he stresses. Nonetheless, General Magic has renewed interest in personal communications devices with its announcement of software that is designed to enable personal communicators from different manufacturers to exchange information. The company has developed Telescript, a programming language for communications software that it aims to make into an industry standard. Magic Cap is General Magic's software foundation for personal communicators. It provides a 'user friendly' face for personal communicators much as Apple's Macintosh did for personal computers. Companies backing General Magic, and planning to use its technology are Apple Computer, Motorola, Sony , AT&amp;T, Matsushita and Philips. Motorola, a leader in cellular telephones and paging devices, claims that it will be the first company to bring wireless communications capabilities to personal communicators. 'We believe there will be strong demand for fun and easy-to-use devices that will help people stay in touch with the office or with those at home,' said Pat Richardson, vice-president and director, Motorola Personal Messaging Products. 'Personal communicators will provide business users and ultimately the average consumer with the ability to communicate with anyone, anywhere in the world at any time.' Motorola's first personal communicator will be launched later this year, the company said. AT&amp;T has already staked its claim to the personal communications market through an alliance with Eo, a Silicon Valley start-up company that recently announced its first products - hand-held computer tablets with built-in communications capabilities. 'These personal communications devices will become as ubiquitous as the telephone or the television,' said William Warwick, president of AT&amp;T Microelectronics. He predicted that there could be as many as 1bn of the devices in use in 10 years. The question hanging over personal communicators is not whether they will become the next blockbuster electronics products but when. 'We think there are going to be billions of these devices out there, and at some point sales of these new devices will surpass those of personal computers. We are guessing what is going to happen before the end of the century,' says John Sculley.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Black takes largest single shareholding in Southam MR Conrad Black, Canadian proprietor of Britain's Daily Telegraph, has broadened his base in North American publishing by becoming the largest single shareholder in Southam, Canada's biggest newspaper chain. Hollinger, Mr Black's holding company, has agreed to pay CDollars 259m (USDollars 207m) for the 23 per cent stake in Southam previously held by Torstar Corp, another Canadian publishing group. Hollinger is prevented by a Southam 'poison pill' from immediately buying more of Southam's stock. But the deal fits the strategy which Mr Black has favoured in the past of gaining control of troubled companies by starting off with a minority stake. Mr David Radler, Hollinger's president, yesterday described Southam as an 'under-valued asset'. Hollinger owned about 5 per cent of the company in the 1980s, but sold the holding three years ago at about double the current market price. 'We still valued it as a serious asset, and as an asset we wanted,' Mr Radler said. Hollinger paid CDollars 18.10 for each of Torstar's 14.3m Southam shares. A Southam official said yesterday that the remaining shares were widely held, with no single block of more than about 5 per cent. The deal is expected to be finalised by the end of the year. Mr Radler said the purchase would be financed through 'normal lines of credit'. Southam owns 18 daily newspapers, with a combined circulation of 1.5m. They include the main English-language papers in Montreal, Vancouver and Ottawa. Southam also publishes trade magazines and owns a leading Canadian bookstore chain. The company has been in considerable turmoil lately as a new management team has sought to bring down costs and focus on core newspaper business. Southam posted a CDollars 186m loss in the first nine months of this year, the bulk of it stemming from a commercial printing division which has since been sold. Mr Black had been searching for a North American flagship to augment the three chains of small, mostly rural newspapers which Hollinger presently owns. He recently withdrew an offer to buy the bankrupt New York Daily News, which is now in the process of being sold to Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, publisher of US News &amp; World Report. Hollinger also has a stake, through the Telegraph, in Fairfax, Australia's second biggest publishing group, and owns the Jerusalem Post</p>

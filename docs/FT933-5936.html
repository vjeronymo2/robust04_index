			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Paris seeks protection against EC imports THE European Commission, which negotiated the Blair House deal, was expecting to receive last night or today the formal French proposals for changes. The main demands are understood to focus on ensuring adequate protection against agriculture imports into the EC, and guarantees that cuts in subsidised food exports will not bite deeper because of farm price and currency fluctuations. On imports, France can expect substantial support from its partners in resisting US ambitions for guaranteed market access for American produce. Neither Blair House nor the Uruguay Round 'final act' provides the sort of guarantees Washington wants in any conclusion to the Round. On farm prices and exchange rate fluctuations, France appears determined to protect its exporting potential, sources in Brussels say. As a result of last year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, EC cereals prices should converge on world market prices by 1997, meaning that the Community will be able to reduce - and perhaps even do away with - export subsidies. The 21 per cent cuts over six years in the volume of subsidised exports the EC has agreed with the US would not then be applicable, since there is no restraint on exports without subsidy. France is therefore understood to want additional guarantees that: relatively frequent big rises and falls in international farm prices will be factored into the agreement on subsidised food export cuts; there is a mechanism to ensure that currency fluctuations will not impede the Community from reaching world prices.</p>

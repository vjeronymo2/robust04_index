			<p>BFN     [Text] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd arrived today  for a two-day visit to the Czech Republic. He met Prime  Minister Vaclav Klaus in the late afternoon. Lucie Weissova has  more details.    [Weissova] After the meeting, Douglas Hurd told journalists  that the talks dealt with Europe's future, with the expansion of  European institutions, in particular the European Union and the  North Atlantic Alliance. The two politicians agreed that a  unified Europe should not become a superstate with Brussels as  its capital. Rather, it should be a union of independent states  that should be helped by this organization in efficient  cooperation.    Vaclav Klaus handed the British foreign secretary a personal  letter inviting Prime Minister John Major to visit the Czech  Republic.    Responding to a question as to whether the Czech Republic  could become a member of the European Union before the year  2000, Douglas Hurd said:    [Begin Hurd recording in English with superimposed Czech  translation] That is up to you. You initiate and you choose  gradual steps. The debate and the negotiations will follow. I  can only say that it is well possible. However, the initiative  rests with you. [end recording]    [Weissova] According to Vaclav Klaus, the Czech Republic  will  certainly submit the European Union membership application  before 1996, when the EU conference on institutional reform will  take place.</p>

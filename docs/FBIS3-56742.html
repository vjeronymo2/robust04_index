"I am repeating for the 37th time that I will not work in  this government", Volskiy told TASS on Wednesday. He did not  deny the fact that he had received the offer.    Volskiy's election bloc, the "Civic Union", lost the last  parliamentary election completely which proved that directors of  state enterprises which it united have no social support because  of the failure to ensure the minimum subsistance level to their  workers and to pay wages in time.    However, it is clear that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  and his First Deputy Oleg Soskovets want to rely on heads of  state run enterprises and farms in their future work. This  explains the offer to Volsky and a resolute support to Deputy  Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha who protects the interests  of collective and state farms.    President Boris Yeltsin, who has accepted the resignation of  Yegor Gaydar, the major reformer in the government, now insists  on keeping another reformer, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, in  the government. This caused a major disagreement with the prime  minister, as Fedorov insists that Zaveryukha be dismissed.    The decision on the final government composition is thus  delayed. The presidential press service announced on Wednesday  that consultations will continue today and in the coming days.</p>

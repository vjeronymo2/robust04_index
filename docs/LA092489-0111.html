			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2ND TIME'S THE CHARM FOR CHANNEL SWIMMER  </P> <P> An exhausted but triumphant Vicki Keith waded ashore in San Pedro Saturday  after becoming the first swimmer to complete the 22-mile crossing from Santa  Catalina Island using the butterfly stroke.  </P> <P> Wearing a swim cap emblazoned with the maple leaf of her native Canada, Keith  trudged onto Cabrillo Beach at 4:27 p.m., 14 hours, 53 minutes and 26 seconds  after wading into the chilly Pacific near Emerald Bay on the island.  </P> <P> "I never doubted I would make it," Keith said, "but there were three or four  hours there that I was concerned it would be after dark."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Determined Return  </P> <P> Keith said she was unable to see the beach through gray haze. Then, she said,  the shore finally broke into the view and she knew her arrival would be right  on schedule.  </P> <P> The swim marked a determined return for the 28-year-old school teacher who  failed to complete the same swim in July, surrendering to excruciating pain in  her joints after more than 19 hours in the water.  </P> <P> This time, Keith said she was sore but was able to continue. Unlike July's  attempt, she said her performance was not daunted by jet lag.  </P> <P> The swim capped a summer in which she completed three major marathon swimming  feats -- crossings of the English Channel, the Juan de Fuca Strait separating  the state of Washington from Victoria, British Columbia, and now the Catalina  Channel -- all with the butterfly stroke.  </P> <P> The stroke, in which both arms flail forward in the air and are then pulled  through the water, expends so much energy that Keith said she had been told  that swimming the channel would be impossible. She added that she hopes to  start swimming again as soon as today -- and can't wait to return to using a  regular crawl stroke after months of butterfly stroke training.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Thought of Sharks  </P> <P> Keith said the trip generally went smoothly and her spirits remained high. But  in the black, 68-degree seas of early morning, she said thoughts of a shark  attack kept running through her head.  </P> <P> "The first hour and a half, the only thing I could think about was sharks," she  said. "I was looking everywhere." She said she saw anchovies and jelly fish --  being careful to avoid a sting -- and was even trailed by a school of dolphins  without ever encountering a shark.  </P> <P> Keith was accompanied along the way by a crew aboard the support boat, "Cold  Spaghetti" out of San Pedro, and a team on paddle boards to authenticate her  feat for the record books. She was aided by near-ideal weather conditions --  relatively calm seas and mild currents -- and she credited her navigator for  choosing a successful route. She stopped several times along the way and  treaded water as she talked with the crew and took quick gulps of hot chocolate  or bites of fruit cocktail. Then she would resume the long, lonely ordeal --  churning along with 24 to 28 strokes a minute.  </P> <P> Dave Clark and Margaret Dickson, observers for the Catalina Channel Swimming  Federation who went along to verify the swim, said Keith was in such a good  mood that she teased members of her crew.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 63rd to Swim Channel  </P> <P> She becomes the 63rd swimmer to cross the channel, albeit the first to use the  unique stroke. The fastest crossing ever was made by Penny Lee Dean, swimming  from the mainland to the island in September, 1976, in 7 hours, 15 minutes.  </P> <P> In attempting the marathon swimming feats, Keith was trying to raise money for  local charities that include the Pediatric AIDS Clinic at County-USC Medical  Center and the UCLA Children's Artificial Limb Bank. Her representatives said  they did not yet know how much money she raised.  </P></p>

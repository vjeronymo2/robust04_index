			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Hundreds of shrimpers dismantled a coastline boat blockade but warned that it  would resume Tuesday unless the federal government eases a law requiring them  to use turtle excluder devices in their nets. Tee John Mialjevich of Gretna,  La., founder of the 2,000-member Concerned Shrimpers of America and organizer  of the blockades that began Saturday, asked the shrimpers on marine radios to  move out of shipping channels while Gulf Coast lawmakers meet today with  Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher. Most shrimpers from Cameron, La., to  Port Aransas, Tex., have complied with the request. But some shrimpers  continued to block the Brownsville Ship Channel near Port Isabel at midday, the  Coast Guard said.  </P></p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Mexico's road scheme takes its toll: A privately built network is charging so much that traffic shuns it THE Mexican government set out in 1989 to achieve what no other country has managed; persuade the private sector to build 2,500 miles of four-lane toll roads in six years at little or no cost to the taxpayer. Since then, about 1,500 miles of private toll roads have been completed, and another 1,200 are being built, for a final cost of about Dollars 8.5bn. Whereas Mexico used to have a handful of four-lane motorways, soon there will 36. Travel times between key cities - Mexico City-Acapulco, Monterrey-Laredo, Merida-Cancun - have been cut by half or more. But cars and especially trucks are shunning the new roads, put off by some of the most expensive tolls in the world. Cars pay on average the equivalent of 25 US cents a mile to use a toll road in Mexico, four times that in the US. With construction costs also way above forecasts, banks have been left with hundreds of millions of dollars of under-performing loans, and construction companies with toll-road equity worth far less than book value. Some roads are so under-used that it has been suggested that capital may have been better spent on other infrastructure projects, such as electricity, water or ports, all vital to Mexico's economic growth. Losses have also made domestic investors reluctant to finance the remainder of the government's master plan of 8,000 miles of motorways, considered vital for Mexico to benefit fully from the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement. While the government hopes foreign investors will finance the remains of the programme by buying up securitised highway bonds, interest so far has been cool. The blame is being put squarely on the government. It set tariffs too high, made concessions too short, and was too hasty and casual when making estimates for costs and traffic. The estimate for the 160-mile Acapulco-Cuernevaca highway, due to open next month, has increased from 2.46bn new pesos (Pounds 520m) to 5.8bn new pesos. On the Plan de Barrancas toll road in the east of Mexico, traffic has been 55 per cent less than that planned. The banks, state-owned until the past two years, readily accepted their political masters' orders. Although Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, turned down 19 of the 20 projects it was offered, others, such as Bancomer and Banca Serfin, the second and third largest, were all too happy to oblige. 'There was a strong suggestion from the government to support the programme,' says an official whose bank was involved in financing several important toll roads. Even since the banks have been privatised, government pressure appears to continue. On a recent trip to Oaxaca, President Carlos Salinas announced that Alfredo Harp Helu, joint head of Banamex, would finance the toll road to Oaxaca - a deal that has still to be finalised. Construction companies generally earned margins on building the roads - of about 25-30 per cent - that exceeded or equalled the proportion of the capital they were required to invest in the toll roads. Consequently, the probable return on their equity was, for many, less important than the immediate construction profit they could make and report from building the road. The construction companies would like to sell their equity but, given current problems, this would imply taking a loss. Mr Jose Luis Guerrero, vice-president of finance of ICA, which has stakes in some 1,000 miles of highways, admits that 'so far revenues have not been sufficient to sell off our stakes' (bar one). But he is confident with time people will warm to using toll roads, traffic will increase, and that 'the possibility of a write-off does not exist in our opinion'. The government has agreed to extend concessions to the toll roads for up to 30 years from an average of less than 10, when its revenue and construction forecasts have proved inaccurate, (as has almost always been the case). However, in some cases toll road revenues are not covering interest rate costs. Unless traffic picks up fast, investors in those roads will never recoup their capital, whatever the length of the concession. The unpopular roads tend to be the shorter ones, or city by-passes that save lorry drivers little time. A Transport Ministry official says it will offer concessions to build extensions to such roads in the hope this will increase traffic on them and will also, by February next year, enforce rules preventing heavy lorries using free roads. But if toll roads continue to lose money, the private sector, namely banks, and not the government would have to recapitalise the projects at its own expense, according to the official. For new roads, the government is changing the way of awarding concessions, granting subsidies if the road would not otherwise be profitable. The government is now telling the bidding consortiums to estimate the costs of construction, and make traffic forecast demands. It is also thinking of offering concessions for a fixed period, and selecting a consortium that offers the lowest tariff for the road, rather than the other way round, as now.</p>

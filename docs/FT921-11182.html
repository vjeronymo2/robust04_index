			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / China spurns human rights interference LI PENG, China's hard-line premier largely blamed for the bloody 1989 crackdown on the democracy movement, insisted in the UN last night that human rights were a national matter not subject to external criteria. Addressing the Security Council at its summit meeting, he said China valued human rights and was ready to discuss them and co-operate with other states, 'while reserving differences'. China opposed interference in internal affairs 'using human rights as an excuse'. President George Bush arranged a meeting with Li in New York last night, ignoring sharp criticism by members of the Congress and others who said he ought first to have demanded Chinese concessions on human rights and other issues. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, had said earlier that the US intended to press China to fulfill commitments to curb exports of missile technology. Mr Bush would be seeking a letter confirming China's pledge to sign the non-proliferation treaty and observe the guidelines of the missile technology control regime (MCTR). Chinese officials have said they will abide by provision of the MTCR but only if the Bush administration lifts sanctions on the sale of American satellite parts and high speed computers. These sanctions were imposed last spring after the US learned that China had secretly delivered launchers for M-11 missiles to Pakistan.</p>

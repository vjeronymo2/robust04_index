			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / US Money and Credit: Budget victory provides comfort IF THE Clinton Administration heaved a huge sigh of relief as the budget deficit package squeaked through the Senate on Friday night, the nation's bond markets probably shared the sentiment. It is not as if anyone is starry-eyed about the impact of the Clinton proposals. However, on balance, better that this package is implemented than more weeks of uncertainty. Despite the eventual narrowness of the president's victory in Washington, bond traders had been edging towards the assumption that the package would pass all week. Confidence began to set in on Tuesday, with the result that the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose by over half a point, pushing its yield down to 6.51 per cent. That represented the lowest closing level since the Treasury began regular auctions of the 30-year bond 16 years ago. Even then, however, convictions were quickly unsettled, and some of Tuesday's early euphoria died away in the late afternoon. For the next three days, the market fluctuated apprehensively, although by Friday evening most market participants said that passage of the bill was largely factored into bond price levels. The long bond itself ended the week with a yield of 6.53 per cent, down from the previous Friday's 6.56 per cent. Despite economists' debate over the value of the Clinton proposals, the package is generally seen as bullish for bond prices. In theory, at least, higher taxes should slow the economy, while any check on the deficit implies less government borrowing, making existing bonds more valuable. However, while the media spotlight was fixed on Capitol Hill last week, bond traders were equally interested in the release of a string of economic statistics. The most important data came on Friday, in the form of the July jobs report, although the figures contained few surprises. Broadly speaking, the report reinforced the impression of an economy in modest, but steady, expansion. Payroll employment increased 162,000, while the unemployment rate slipped from 7 to 6.8 per cent. This was close to market expectations, and commentators were quick to note that the fall in the unemployment rate was helped by a decrease in the size of the labour force last month. Statistics released earlier in the week presented an equally comforting picture. Manufacturers' new orders rose 2.6 per cent last month, but much of this was transportation-related and the underlying increase in the manufacturing sector was modest. Similarly, the National Association of Purchasing Managers' report for July remained below the critical 50 level - rising only slightly from 48.3 in June to 49.5 last month. (Readings above 50 suggest that the manufacturing economy is expanding). Small wonder, then, that few economists are really concerned about the impending price data, which will be unveiled this week. Thursday will see the release of the July Producer Price Index. Most pundits are talking of a 0.2 per cent increase in the 'core' rate, which excludes food and energy costs. On Friday, the expectation is for a similar rise in the 'core' Consumer Price Index, which would match the average monthly advance notched up over the March-June period. If those predictions prove correct - and coupled with last week's unalarming jobs numbers - almost everyone concurs that the Fed's monetary policy will simply stand on hold.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Government loses close election in Belize MR Manuel Esquivel, a 53-year-old businessman, is to be sworn in by the weekend as prime minister of Belize, following a narrow victory by his United Democratic party in the general election on Wednesday. Preliminary results yesterday gave the UDP 15 of the 29 seats in the Central American state's assembly, with 13 for the People's United party of Mr George Price, the long-serving prime minister. A recount was under way in one constituency. The result suggests a miscalculation by Mr Price, who called the election 15 months before it was due. He had hoped to be returned to office on the basis of steady economic growth in the former British colony. Also, the PUP had done well in recent by-elections. In the month-long campaign, however, Mr Esquivel's UDP closed the gap, arguing that Mr Price's administration was corrupt. He charged the government with having given Belizean citizenship and voting rights to thousands of refugees from neighbouring Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador,in a bid to win the election. Mr Esquivel also proposed free education, from primary school to university, as well as income tax concessions. The PUP's loss has raised questions over the political future of Mr Price, who has dominated the politics of the country of 200,000 people for 40 years, and has been its political leader for all but five years since 1954. If Mr Price steps down as PUP leader, he is likely to be succeeded by Mr Said Musa, foreign minister, or Mr Florencio Marn, a former deputy prime minister. Mr Esquivel, who was prime minister in 1984-1989, is not expected to bring any great political changes to Belizean domestic affairs. During the campaign, however, he accused the Price administration of making too many concessions to Guatemala in an effort by the government to bury for good a 130-year-old Guatemalan territorial claim on Belize, which Guatemala recently declared that it had relinquished. The opposition leader suggested the suspension of legislation which grants Guatemala access to the Atlantic Ocean through Belizean territory.</p>

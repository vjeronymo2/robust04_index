			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: US defence contractors agree deal Martin Marietta is to buy the space systems business of fellow defence contractor General Dynamics for Dollars 208.5m in cash, the two US companies announced yesterday. The deal, which had been rumoured in the industry for several months, allows Martin Marietta to enter the market for intermediate-sized rockets. It already produces the Titan rocket, which is used to launch heavy satellites. General Dynamics makes the smaller Atlas-Centaur launch system. The sale underscores the sharply differing strategies of the two companies to cope with shrinking defence spending following the collapse of the Soviet empire. General Dynamics has shrunk by selling off large parts of its defence business, while Martin Marietta has been an aggressive buyer. Its acquisitions include General Electric's aerospace unit for Dollars 3bn last year. General Dynamics will retain ownership of the space division's real estate, including a 40-acre tract in San Diego with a Dollars 50m book value. The space division had 1992 sales of Dollars 500m, employs 3,700 and has a backlog of around Dollars 2.5bn.</p>

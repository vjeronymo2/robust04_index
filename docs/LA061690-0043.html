			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> IRAN;  </P> <P> TEHRAN BANS ONLY OPPOSITION PARTY  </P> <P> The Iranian government has banned the country's only remaining legal opposition  party after arresting eight of its members, an exiled Iranian group said in  reports monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus. The reported actions against the Freedom  Movement signal the final crushing of any organized domestic opposition to the  cleric-led government, the sources said. A ruling by the revolutionary  prosecutor in Tehran declared the group illegal, according to Ali Safavi,  spokesman in Baghdad for the Moujahedeen or Holy Warriors, an Iranian  opposition group based in Iraq.  </P></p>

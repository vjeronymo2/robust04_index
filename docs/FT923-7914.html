			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Equities stage an intraday recovery AFTER a week on the downgrade, the Eurotrack 100 stopped retreating for about six hours yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr Roger Palmer, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson, said that the recovery coincided with an estimate from the German economics minister, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, of a one-half to one per cent drop in second quarter west German GDP, compared with the first three months of 1992. While bourses were preoccupied with the French Maastricht referendum in six weeks' time, said Mr Palmer, indications that the German economy was slowing down might have allowed them to look beyond it to the prospect of lower interest rates in the early spring of next year. FRANKFURT duly broke down through 1,550 on the DAX. However, said market makers, the very fact of an intraday low of 1,526.35 brought technical aspects to bear. People expected the market to rebound when it hit 1,530, and this coincided with a stock and futures shortage. The DAX closed just 12.03 lower at 1,540.98, and the DAX future was trading around 1,550 in the later part of the afternoon. Turnover rose from DM5.1bn to DM6bn. The insurance group, Allianz, which has the heaviest individual weighting in the DAX, fell DM66 to DM1,665 at once point, closed DM36 down at DM1,695 and recovered to DM1,720 in the post bourse. Among second liners Lufthansa fell another DM5 to DM90.50, and into speculative territory as a decision on a sharp cost cutting programme is awaited at the end of this month; Linotype, however, produced a recovery and rose DM17.50 to DM371.50. AMSTERDAM worried over KLM's results which came in worse than expected, and the CBS Tendency index closed 0.4 down at 111.8. Analysts noted that the airline's core business remained relatively strong while associated companies, such as the US carrier NorthWest and Air Littoral of France, which had made large losses, had sapped profitability. Mr Philip van den Berg of Goldman Sachs said that he had changed his recommendation on the airline from sell to hold yesterday. KLM closed down Fl 1.30 at Fl 27.70, but off the intraday low of Fl 26.00. Nedlloyd slipped further on nervousness ahead of next week's interims, closing down Fl 1.60, or 4.5 per cent at Fl 37.70. The stock has dropped 41 per cent since its 1992 peak in February. Downgrades from US brokers contributed to Polygram's 70 cent fall to Fl 45.10. PARIS closed at a new low for the year, the CAC-40 index falling 7.69 to 1,722.36, but off an intraday low of 1,712.08. Turnover remained weak at some FFr1.4bn. With a clutch of first half results results there was plenty to keep the market busy. Hachette was one of the biggest losers of the day, down FFr9 or 7.3 per cent to FFr114 after reporting a decline in sales, while Remy Cointreau lost FFr3.0 or 4.6 per cent to FFr170.0 for the same reason. Michelin slipped FFr3.90 to FFr205.50 in spite of a sales rise; weakness in the European tyre industry has led some analysts to issue sell notes on the major producers. Suez finished down FFr4.80 at FFr235.10 after announcing a 10 per cent slide in turnover. Eurotunnel bucked the trend, up 70 centimes to FFr32.50 as confidence returns that negotiations with contractors may soon be resolved. MILAN closed the August account with an power cut, which caused a two-hour failure of the screen market. In addition, anxiety in foreign exchange where the lira is under heavy pressure spilled into equities, and the Comit index fell 2.87 to 398.28, threatening its 1992 low. An Italian cabinet meeting in Rome was expected to announce several measures to stimulate the equity market, but dealers were still not enthusiastic about short-term prospects as the market closed yesterday. COPENHAGEN was forced down by the Danish finance minister, Mr Henning Dyremose's threat to go to the polls in premature autumn elections over the 1993 state budget. In spite of a rally in mid-afternoon, after the prime minister, Mr Poul Schluter, ruled out the prospect of snap polls, the CSE index still closed 5.04 lower at 293.16. MADRID was unimpressed by good CPI data for July and the general index closed slightly weaker, off 0.27 at 205.49.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 13  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1027.85  1028.72  1030.04  1031.74  1033.65  1035.71  1036.33  1035.59  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          Day's High  1037.47            Day's Low  1027.55  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Aug 12        Aug 11        Aug 10        Aug 7         Aug 6    1037.76       1044.92       1049.68       1067.01       1078.71  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

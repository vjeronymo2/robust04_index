According to the same communique,  practically the only thing left is to fix the date to establish  the new institutions, which will be done, according to the  communique, after consultations are held with the RPF.    On Monday, 28 February, the RPF made known in a press  release  its reaction to Mr. Enoch Ruhigira's communique. It is a  categorical refusal to take part in institutions which would  only be an extension of the dictatorial rule of Major General  Juvenal Habyarimana, and thus the very negation of the spirit of  the agreements signed in Arusha seven months ago. The RPF  communique reads as follows:    [Passage omitted] It was in a climate of fear that the  leaders of these parties agreed on 27 February to decisions  which they had rejected on 23 February. As it is clear that  President Habyarimana resorted to terrorism and intimidation --  with the murder of one opposition leader and the massacres  perpetrated throughout last week -- to weaken the leaders of  these political parties, the RPF challenges the conclusions of  the so-called compromises won by President Habyarimana under  these conditions.    These compromises are all the more unacceptable as their  spirit contradicts that of the Arusha peace accord, which was  aimed at initiating radical reforms in the structures and  functioning of the Rwandan state in order to eradicate the  dictatorial practices President Habyarimana wants to safeguard  by manipulating political parties, imposing on them elements  loyal to him as representatives within these institutions.    The RPF once again condemns the barbarous acts perpetrated  by  militias in the pay of President Habyarimana and announces that  it will not take part in a government put in place on the basis  of compromises reached by means of terror. Concerning the  deputies at the transitional national assembly, the RPF will not  accept any list other than the one approved by the  constitutional court on 4 January. Similarly, the RPF requests  that the right of the prime minister-designate of the  broad-based transitional government to choose the ministers for  his government team -- as was planned for 5 February -- be  restored before President Habyarimana launches a policy of  escalating intimidation. [passage omitted]    Issued in Mulindi on 28 February 1994    Signed by Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, RPF chairman</p>

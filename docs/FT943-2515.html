			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Arts (Openings): Oslo The Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra celebrates its 75th anniversary on Friday with a royal gala performance of Schoenberg's 'Gurrelieder' conducted by its long-serving music director, Mariss Jansons. The orchestra's recent recordings and tours have won it an enviable reputation - but given Jansons' increasingly high profile in the world's musical capitals, Oslo will be lucky to hold on to him for much longer.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A QUESTION OF FAITH;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: CHURCH CALLS MOVIE ABOUT A MOLESTATION SCANDAL 'DISTORTED,' BUT  FILMMAKERS DISAGREE.  </P> <P> Using terms like "distorted fiction" and accusing the filmmakers of having "an  agenda" to make the church look bad, Roman Catholic officials and observers are  taking sharp exception to a new HBO movie based on a 1980s sex scandal in a  Louisiana diocese involving a priest and dozens of boys.  </P> <P> The movie, "Judgment," premiering tonight at 9, focuses less on the  molestations and more on the attempts of the bishop and his vicar general to  cover it up.  </P> <P> The scenario revolves around a family (the Guitrys, played by Blythe Danner and  Keith Carradine, with Michael Faustino as the son) and their flamboyant  attorney (Jack Warden), who battle the entrenched power of the diocese.  </P> <P> Although names are changed and events juggled, the plot closely follows a case  that caused a sensation when it surfaced in 1984 at the Lafayette diocese deep  in Cajun country. Father Gilbert Gauthe admitted molesting 37 children,  including altar boys and parish Boy Scouts, and was given 20 years in prison  without benefit of parole.  </P> <P> Although Gauthe attracted the most celebrity, seven priests eventually were  removed and the diocese and insurers reportedly paid families more than $22  million in settlements. The family on which the movie family was patterned won  $1,025,000.  </P> <P> The revelations were the first pedophilia case of such scope to scandalize the  church. There have been many others reported since. Jason Berry, a prominent  investigative reporter in New Orleans who specializes on Catholic affairs and  is completing a book on pedophilia and homosexuality in the church, estimates  that the church has paid between $100 million and $300 million in 100 child  sexual settlements in the last six years.  </P> <P> In the movie, the Guitrys join other families seeking financial settlements  from the church, but insurance lawyers insist that the church not give the  families spiritual solace, on grounds that that would constitute an admission  of liability and damages would be costlier. The Guitrys are very devout but  grow furious that the bishop and his staff had known about the abuse but kept  giving the offending priest new assignments within the parish. They break from  the group and hire an attorney. Then the case becomes public.  </P> <P> Asked to comment on "Judgment," Msgr. Alexander Sigur, new vicar general of the  Lafayette diocese portrayed in the movie, referred The Times to a written  statement that he made to written questions from Sister Mary Ann Walsh, media  editor of the Catholic News Service. She had supplied him with a copy of the  film.  </P> <P> "Only a part of the film," Sigur responded, "is based on fact and the balance  is distorted fiction. . . . The portrayal of the church's reaction to that  priest's conduct is totally distorted."  </P> <P> The truth, he said, is that "immediately" upon receiving notice that the priest  was accused of committing these pedophilic acts, he was removed and "criminal  proceedings were instituted." He also disputed how the movie "fictitiously  depicts" the church as "callous" about the victims.  </P> <P> Getting a movie made on the events at the parish was problematic. Executive  producer Steve Tisch ("The Burning Bed," "Risky Business") said that he and  producers Ron Hershman and Dan Wigutow pitched the idea to CBS and NBC and were  turned down. ABC, however, declaring itself not turned off by the controversial  theme, ordered a script, Tisch said.  </P> <P> But later, Tisch said, when he asked for some assurance that "top management of  Capital Cities," which owns ABC, would fully support the project, "a top  network executive . . . took it to a top Cap Cities executive -- who said that  it (the movie) is not going to happen at ABC."  </P> <P> An ABC spokesman said that the project was dropped because the network had done  two other molestation movies ("Deadly Silence" and "Unspeakable Acts") and that  "it did not go up the corporate ladder," as Tisch described.  </P> <P> Hershman, who previously produced a segment on the Louisiana parish scandal for  the CBS news magazine "West 57th," and Wigutow then met with HBO and got a  go-ahead when Tom Topor agreed to write and direct. Topor had written the  Broadway play and screenplay for "Nuts," which has an incest theme, and "The  Accused," about a gang rape.  </P> <P> First-time director Topor has only seen an early "rough cut" of the film  because, he related, he was fired late in the production after battles with his  producers and was replaced by veteran director David Greene ("Roots," "Fatal  Vision"). But he stands by what he saw that far, he said.  </P> <P> Relevant sources who were asked to pre-screen videocassettes of "Judgment" had  many criticisms -- erroneous church liturgy, faulty legal references, a mixing  of time frames.  </P> <P> A longtime New York City news reporter, Topor agreed that some people might  find distortions in the movie and said that he did make "certain  extrapolations": "The question is whether I distorted its emotional essence or  its narrative essence, and I don't believe I did."  </P> <P> J. Minos Simon, the attorney portrayed by Warden, thought the portrayals were  "excellent," but maintained that the filmmakers were "generous" with the  bishop.  </P> <P> "His agony was not over wanting to tell," he said. "His agony was over the fact  that the secrecy lid was lifted and he was exposed for the first time." He  contended that the bishop knew about Gauthe's "proclivities" but kept  transferring him within the diocese "to a fresh new lot of victims."  </P> <P> Simon had an informant -- not a priest and not one who was blackmailed into  helping, as shown in the movie -- who discovered diocese files which revealed  that at least 24 priests, about one-fourth of the priest population in the  diocese, were homosexual. This information, falling into Simon's hands,  "jarred" the diocese and forced it to admit liability, Simon said.  </P> <P> Veteran reviewer Henry Herx of the Catholic News Service complained that the  film makes no attempt at balance in treatment of the clergy, "not even one good  priest." He commended the filmmakers for focusing on the "agonized family  rather than the sexual crimes of the clergyman."  </P> <P> The candor of the film won't offend Catholics, but they're likely to be "much  more sensitive" to the treatment of the church as an uncaring bureaucracy, he  said.  </P> <P> Father Gregory Coiro, a public affairs official in the Archdiocese of Los  Angeles, found the movie priests "stereotypical and unrealistic." He said that  while the subject should not be covered up, "I really feel that the people who  made this movie had an agenda, and I'm sorry to say but I think their agenda  was to make the church look bad."  </P> <P> He said that the priesthood has its failures "as in any other profession.  There's 55,000 priests in this country and a person who doesn't know this could  very easily get the impression -- especially with (recent widely reported  scandals involving priests and even archbishops) -- well, 'My God, the priests  are all a bunch of perverts.' Thing is, most priests are very, very hard  working and very, very caring and none of that is addressed. It's almost like  all priests are guilty by association."  </P> <P> Berry, who did the first in-depth reporting on the Louisiana case, said that  while the film contained "gross distortions" from the facts of that case, a  drama can't be held to the standards of investigative news.  </P></p>

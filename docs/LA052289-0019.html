			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> SOUTHWEST CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY IN PASADENA  </P> <P> The Southwest Chamber Music Society's four pieces by 20th-Century Americans  Friday at the Pasadena Public Library underscored the pleasures still available  in works from the non-experimental ranks of composers.  </P> <P> Pianist Albert Dominguez opened with Five "Anniversaries" by Leonard Bernstein.  These cleverly wrought trifles sparkle with rhythmic vigor and melodic charm;  Dominguez brought control and clarity to his playing.  </P> <P> He later offered Elliott Carter's Sonata (1946). The pianist capitalized on the  work's frequent and marked contrasts. He delivered the powerful pronouncements  with authority and the gentle interludes with sensitivity.  </P> <P> Wide contrasts also abound in Copland's "Vitebsk," and violinist Kimiyo Takeya,  cellist Richard Treat and Dominguez effectively made the most of them.  </P> <P> Though each work on the program falls within the pale of American  neoclassicism, Halsey Stevens' Trio No. 2 provides a textbook example of the  style. The three easily conveyed the work's breezy lyricism and ebullient  vitality. TERRY McQUILKIN  </P></p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Beghin-Say buys spices supplier BEGHIN-SAY, the French sugar and foods concern controlled by Italy's Ferruzzi group, has bought Ducros, the family-owned French foods group specialising in spices, condiments and infusions. Ducros, which had sales of FFr1.6bn (Dollars 290m) in 1990, is Europe's leading supplier of spices. The company is the market leader in France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, while having significant market shares in other parts of Europe and in Africa, according to Ferruzzi. A price for the deal, in which Beghin-Say was advised by Colker, Gelardin, a new private investment bank, has not been disclosed. Ferruzzi is preparing a complex merger between Beghin-Say and Eridania, which is still subject to separate court-approved valuations in France and Italy and has yet to be approved by shareholders. The purchase of Ducros will increase Eridania-Beghin-Say's coverage of the European foods business, where the group already has a commanding position in the market for sugar and edible oils. Following the acquisition, Beghin-Say's turnover is set to rise to over FFr8bn. Meanwhile, the deal offers Ducros access to the Ferruzzi group's financial resources in order to stimulate further growth. Ducros offers complementary technological expertise to Beghin-Say. Ferruzzi, which is in the process of divesting a number of activities, has identified the agro-industrial business, grouped under its Eridania subsidiary, as one of its core businesses. 'The group sees value in further acquisitions on a case by case basis,' said one banker closely involved in the latest deal.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Jail madness England's prison population is rising sharply. Since the beginning of last year, the numbers have increased from 41,000 to 48,000 and are still going up. Over the past six weeks, jails have become so overcrowded in some parts of the country that prisoners have had to be kept in police cells. At nearly one prisoner for every 1,000 people in the country, the UK in 1991 had a higher proportion of its population in jail than every Council of Europe nation apart from Hungary. The rise in prison numbers stems from a hardening in public attitudes to crime. The idea that society was being too soft on criminals has been picked up by judges and reflected in their sentencing policies. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has also seen the opportunity to play to the public mood by promising a crack-down on crime. He has instituted policies designed to send more offenders to jail and make prison life more austere. This is a marked u-turn from the policy of reducing the prison population pursued by previous Conservative home secretaries. One fear is that the mounting jail population will lead to such overcrowding that there will be another round of prison riots like that at Strangeways in 1990. This fear was voiced by prison governors in their annual conference yesterday. Mr Derek Lewis, the prison service's director-general, says it is wrong to talk about a crisis. But he admits that the situation is difficult. The growth in the prison population has delayed reforms to end overcrowding and 'slopping out', where prisoners do not have toilets in their cells. While prison capacity is being expanded to cope with the increased numbers, army camps and other contingency arrangements may have to be deployed to house prisoners if numbers rise faster than expected. All this carries a greater risk of rioting, Mr Lewis acknowledges. Even if the risks of riots are exaggerated, the overall policy of increasing prison numbers is madness. Violent criminals must be jailed so long as they are a danger to the public. But there is no sense in putting non-violent criminals for long periods behind bars. Not only does it cost the taxpayer about 10 times as much to keep a prisoner in jail as to monitor a community service order. There is little evidence that prison helps rehabilitation. Mr Douglas Hurd, when home secretary, used to say that jail was an expensive way of making bad men worse. It is time Mr Howard abandoned his demagogic policies and imbibed the wisdom of his predecessors.</p>

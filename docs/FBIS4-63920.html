			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Semyon Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The Cosmos 2281 satellite  fired off with a Tsiklon-3 three stage booster from the Plesetsk  cosmodrome on Wednesday, failed to come into orbit.    ITAR-TASS learnt at the press centre of Russian Space  Military Forces that the switch-off of the propulsion unit and  the separation of the third stage were not registered.    According to calculations, the satellite as well as the  second and the third stages of the booster dropped in the area  of the East Siberian Sea where the fall of the second stage had  been planned.    The launching was made in the interests of the Russian  Defence Ministry. An interdepartmental commission has been set  up to examine possible reasons for the failure.</p>

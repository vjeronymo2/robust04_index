			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Observer: Poor example If the Bank of England really wanted to give a lead on corporate governance issues, it could start by shaking up its own court of non-executive directors. Take Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of non-executive director pressure group Proned. He has been on the court for 22 years and Warburg's Sir David Scholey has been a director for more than a decade. Good men as they are, isn't it about time that they set an example by standing down and letting someone else have a go? A four year term is long enough. Meanwhile, Sir Christopher Hogg's appointment to the Court is the clearest sign to date that he has made it into the ranks of the great and the good. But he is still only 55 and his non-executive chairmanships of Reuters and Courtaulds are hardly full-time jobs. Taking on the chairmanship of British Aerospace would have been a more worthwhile but more demanding task than accepting an invitation to sit at the Bank of England's Court.</p>

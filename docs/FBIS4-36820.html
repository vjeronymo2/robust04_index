			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz today explained  Lebanon's official stance on the peace talks following press  reports of U.S. intervention in this matter. Minister Buwayz  has categorically denied that the United States or any other  party has proposed to Lebanon that it hold separate or  collective talks with Israel. He said so far we have not  received any new U.S. offer to resume the talks. He stressed  that U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Mark Hambley did not discuss  this subject during his meetings with Lebanese officials. Nor  did the U.S. Ambassdor hint, insinuate, or deliver a message on  this subject.    Regarding the Palestinian Yusuf Sha'ban, who is accused of  assassinating [Jordanian diplomat] Na'ib al-Ma'aytah, and  Sha'ban's new confession that he was behind the bombing of the  Pan American plane over Lockerbie, Minister Buwayz will leave it  to the court to take measures regarding this subject. He noted  that judicial proceedings will begin if this claim is true.</p>

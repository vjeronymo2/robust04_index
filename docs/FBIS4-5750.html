			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia and the Philippines should keep their  channels of communication open and accessible at all times in  order to manage and maintain good relations. The fundamentals  for this to work is to ensure that there must be constant  contacts and discussions between both sides. UMNO [United  Malays National Organization] party youth chief Tan Sri Abdul  Rahim Tamby Chik said this at a meeting with President Fidel  Ramos and representatives of the Lakas [Strength of the  Nation]-United National Christian Democrats-United Muslim  Democratic Party youth leaders at Malacanang Palace in Manila.  Describing his visit as another process to enhance the existing  good relationship between the two countries, Tan Sri Rahim said  it was important the countries make concrete efforts to get to  know each other better all the time. He said the need to ensure  that relations remain cordial is even more so as both Malaysia  and the Philippines are poised to transform into a higher  economic level. A strong relationship between the two nations  should also inevitably contribute to a more prosperous, stable,  and peaceful region.</p>

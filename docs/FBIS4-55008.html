			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] Under the title "We Would Join New  Federation Only With the Republic of Srpska" the Belgrade daily  BORBA publishes in its 6 April issue an interview with Fikret  Abdic, leader of the self-proclaimed autonomous region of  western Bosnia, conducted by reporter Nena Ivankovic.    Asked to give his opinion of the "`new marriage' of the  Croats and Muslims in former Bosnia and Herzegovina" and whether  the the autonomous region of western Bosnia would join that  federation, Abdic states that "every effort leading to the  ultimate objective, a lasting peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  deserves praise. Thus, I praise the recent Washington agreement  between the Muslims and the Croats, provided that it is not  another Croat-Muslim coalition aimed against the Serbian  people." When asked whether the autonomous region of western  Bosnia would join the Muslim-Croat federation, Abdic responded:  "We'll wait and see the Serbian reaction. If the republic of  Srpska joins this federation, which I personally doubt, the  autonomous region of western Bosnia would become part of that  federation. However, I personally think that the European Union  peace plan will be reactivated. Perhaps it will be modified a  little, and adapted to the U.S.-Russian plan."    In response to Ivankovic's observation that it appears that  the "great powers" are recommending the "restoration of some new  Yugoslavia," Abdic states "we all must realize one thing:  Economic reintegration of the former Yugoslavia must happen. It  must, because it is in the interest of all the peoples, not just  one. It appears to me that the sides are moving in that  direction. To be sure, too much blood has been spilled. It will  be hard to restore mutual trust, but I think it will be  restored. The Serbian-Croatian agreement on the normalization of  relations is the first link in the chain of a return to mutual  trust. The restoration of a new Yugoslavia is, therefore,  possible, but only in an economic form; politically, it  certainly is not."</p>

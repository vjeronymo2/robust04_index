			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SEWICKLEY REPEATS AS HOUSEBUSTER FADES  </P> <P> Sewickley, who had not won since last year's Vosbergh Stakes, scored a 4  1/2-length victory over Sunshine Jimmy Saturday in the $236,800 race at Belmont  Park.  </P> <P> Sewickley, ridden by Angel Cordero Jr., closed strongly while 1-5 favorite  Housebuster tired abruptly in the stretch and faded to sixth.  </P> <P> Sunshine Jimmy, under Chris Antley, closed in the final strides to wrest second  place from Glitterman in the field of nine 3-year-olds and up.  </P> <P> Housebuster shadowed pace-setting Glitterman into the stretch while the leader  set fast fractions of 21 3/5 for the quarter-mile and 44 for the half, but  faded as Sewickley rallied.  </P> <P> Trainer Flint Schulhofer said he does not plan to run Sewickley in the  Breeders' Cup Sprint, but might start him in the NYRA Mile at Aqueduct Nov. 3.  </P> <P> The victory was the first in eight starts this year for Sewickley, who covered  seven furlongs on a fast track in 1:21 to earn $142,080. The winner returned  $14.20, $7.40 and $4.60. Sunshine Jimmy paid $11.20 and $9.40, and Glitterman  returned $11.80.  </P> <P> Housebuster's trainer, Jimmy Croll, said his colt "didn't warm up well. He  looked like he was a little crampy. He injured himself."  </P> <P> It was found after the race that Housebuster had suffered a cut on his left  hind leg in the far turn.  </P> <P> Jackie Wackie won his first stake, the $55,250 Foolish Pleasure for 2-year-olds  at Calder Race Course.  </P> <P> Saddle Tramp, a 15-1 shot, finished second but was disqualified and placed  fourth for impeding Franklin Me inside the sixteenth pole. Ballroom Romeo came  from last to finish third, and was moved up to second.  </P> <P> Ridden by Heberto Castillo Jr., Jackie Wackie ran a mile and 70 yards in 1:45  4/5 and paid $3.80, $3.80 and $2.80. Ballroom Romeo paid $10.40 and $5.20.  Franklin Me returned $3.  </P> <P> Earn Your Stripes, overcoming injuries that limited him to only one race over  the past two year, raced to a two-length victory in the $150,000 Bay Meadows  Budweiser Breeders' Cup.  </P> <P> The victory was worth $84,700 to the 6-year-old horse who suffered from bone  chips in his ankle after a successful campaign as a 3-year-old that included a  victory in the $130,000 Pomona Derby.  </P> <P> Ridden by Patrick Valenzuela, he easily passed Frost Free down the stretch to  win his eighth race in 23 career starts.  </P> <P> Earn Your Stripes finished six furlongs in 1:08 and paid $5.20, $2.60 and  $2.40. Frost Free paid $2.40 and $2.20. Just Deeds paid $3.60 to show.  </P> <P> Capades, champion New York-bred filly in 1988 as a 2-year-old and again in  1989, has been retired after sustaining a serious injury in a workout at  Belmont Park. Her trainer, Richie O'Connell, said the 4-year-old granddaughter  of Damascus suffered a broken left-front cannon bone.  </P> <P> After victories this year in the Grade II New York Handicap at Belmont and in  Atlantic City's Grade II Matchmaker Stakes, Capades retires with 11 victories,  nine seconds and two thirds in 27 career starts and earnings of $1,015,006.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> DINOSAUR POWER RATING HIKED  </P> <P> The forelimbs of the ancient carnivorous dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex appear to  have been more powerful than previously thought, paleontologists reported last  week at an evolutionary biology conference at the University of Maryland.  </P> <P> The new theory suggests that the small forelimbs of the dinosaur, once thought  to be little more than weak vestigial extremities, could grasp prey weighing  400 pounds.  </P> <P> Moreover, each of the forelimbs ended in two opposing claws that could tightly  hold struggling prey, allowing the dinosaur to sink its razor-sharp teeth into  the prey.  </P> <P> Matthew B. Smith of Montana State University and colleagues analyzed the most  complete Tyrannosaurus skeleton ever excavated, discovered 18 months ago in  eastern Montana. The bones include the first example of the dinosaur's forelimb  and claw. They studied muscle patterns left in the forelimb bones and  correlated the thickness of the scars to the size that the muscles must have  been present. Calculations revealed that the Tyrannosaurus could have lifted  400 pounds and each forelimb was as thick as a human thigh.  </P></p>

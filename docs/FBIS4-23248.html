			<p>BFN     [Text] Abuja, 27 April (NAN) -- The federal government  today banned forthwith any pre-constitutional conference  meetings to allow for the unfettered election of delegates who  would participate at the actual conference.    Inaugurating the 16-man election committee for the  constitutional conference in Abuja, the head of state, Gen. Sani  Abacha said that the government allowed previous meetings so as  to give ample opportunity for ideas to evolve and memoranda  produced at such to be forwarded to the national constitutional  conference commission for collation. Though he announced that  all political meetings were still banned, Gen. Abacha said that  individuals could canvass to be elected as independent  candidates in their various conference- district constituencies.  No one should be left in doubt as to our commitment and  determination to find an acceptable and lasting solution to the  problems that have bedeviled our great country in the past many  years," Gen. Abacha said.    The head of state said that the decision to set up the  committee was informed by the need to evolve a reliable election  culture in the country. He urged the committee to ensure that  the spectrum of elected candidates was broad, independent and  representative, and that they should be persons who were  conscious of their responsibility to peace and the progress of  the nation. Abacha said thet the elecion process must be  completely above board, leaving no shade of doubts in the minds  of anybody, adding that stiff penalties must be set to  discourage the activities of bloc and parochial interests. He  said the committee must ensure adequate publicity of their  operations so as to properly educate delegates.    The head of state urged the committee to delimit the  constituencies in conjunction with the states' administrators  and supervise and conduct the elections with the assistance of  the states and local governments. He also urged them to  enunciate the guidelines of the elections which should ensure  equity, justice and fair play, and screen intending delegates in  accordance with constitutional provisions to discourage people  with criminal records from participating in the conference.  Gen. Abacha said that the committee should take any other  action that would ensure a smooth and fair election. The  election is expected to produce 273 members, three from each of  the 90 senatorial districts and three from Abuja, while 96 will  be appointed by the government.</p>

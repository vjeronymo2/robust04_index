			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / International Company News: Mitsui chemical, petrol companies in merger talks MITSUI Petrochemical Industries and Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals are in talks about a possible merger that could create one of Japan's largest integrated chemicals companies. The two companies confirmed yesterday that talks were underway, although they said no details of any possible merger had yet been agreed. The idea of a merger between the two companies, both part of the loosely structured Mitsui group, has been discussed for 20 years. Downturn in the worldwide chemicals industry and in the Japanese economy has recently made a deal more attractive. Both companies saw profits fall steeply in 1991, and are expected to report further profit declines in the fiscal year which ended last month. A merger would have a certain industrial logic. Mitsui Petrochemical is a bulk producer of petrochemicals. Mitsui Toatsu is a big producer of resins and other industrial chemicals, but lacks a naptha cracker, which means it has to buy basic feedstock from outside suppliers. Combined sales of the companies would be about Y770bn (Dollars 5.78bn), putting it among the top ranks of Japan's chemical companies, and increasing its international competitiveness. The combined company, however, would still be relatively small by world chemical industry standards. Mr Toshihiko Nakajima, analyst at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The biggest problem is how not to violate the anti-monopoly act.' Mr Nakajima said the two companies' combined production of phenol accounted for between 40 and 50 per cent of the Japanese market, well over the 25 per cent limit set by the Fair Trade Commission. There were also doubts about how much would be achieved by a merger, unless the companies were able to rationalise the business. Japan's lifetime employment system at big companies makes it difficult for them to spin off operations and reduce manpower, even though in this case there would be obvious potential savings. And even though the companies have reasonably close business ties, outright mergers between different companies with individual management cultures and histories have often proved difficult in Japan.</p>

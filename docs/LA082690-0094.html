			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE BEGGAR BY NAGUIB MAHFOUZ TRANSLATED BY KRISTIN WALKER  HENRY &amp; NARIMAN KHALES NAILI AL-WARRAKI (ANCHOR: $7.95)  </P> <P> Although Nobel Prize-winner Naguib Mahfouz is regarded as the premier novelist  of the Arab world, little of his work is known in the West. Originally  published in 1965, this newly translated novel focuses on the moral failure of  the Egypt intelligentsia after the overthrow of King Farouk.  </P> <P> The central character, Omar al-Hamzawi, has lost all commitment to the ideals  he espoused as a young man. Material success has supplanted the missionary zeal  for socialism for which he once risked jail; the dreamy poet-revolutionary has  been transformed into a property owner and a man of means. When a nagging  emptiness begins to torment him, Omar embarks on a series of vapid liaisons  (his fleeting relations with women could scarcely be described as love  affairs). But an encounter with an old comrade who has preserved his belief in  his ideals -- despite years of imprisonment and torture -- forces Omar to  confront the irrelevance of his existence. Mahfouz continually shifts the  narration among the first, second and third persons to offer differing  reactions and create a fluid, almost Cubist perspective.  </P></p>

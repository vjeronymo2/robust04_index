			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Observer: Fantasy podium Jeffrey Nichols, managing director of the American Metals Advisors consultancy group, has been digging into the pitfalls of speaking at conferences. He revealed yesterday - at the Kalgoorlie Gold Conference  - what he felt was a key piece of market research on the matter. Apparently the first speaker at any conference has the full attention of 98 per cent of the audience but by midday that drops to between 60 and 70 per cent. By the time the last speaker of the afternoon addresses the audience, no more than 20 per cent are paying attention; the other 80 per cent are by that stage deeply engrossed in their own personal sexual fantasies. So that's why all their eyes are closed.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / IG Metall says 100,000 strike over pay in east THOUSANDS of workers in eastern Germany yesterday took to the streets to protest against the decision by steel and engineering employers not to pay agreed increases aimed at bringing wages in the east up to western levels by April 1994. IG Metall, Germany's largest union, said that about 100,000 workers had walked out, with stoppages reported in more than 220 factories in the states of Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia, as well as east Berlin. The union is hoping the wages row will help mobilise eastern German workers on other issues. IG Metall, which is losing members across Germany, also wants to show it still has political muscle. 'We have to show the employers that we will not allow them to break this contract reached in March 1991,' said Mr Michael Bohm, spokesman for IG Metall in Berlin. 'The employers are determined to break the tradition of collective wage bargaining.' The union is also concerned about living standards in the east. Easterners pay western German prices, while wages in the region are 70 per cent of levels in the west. This is why the union is still demanding the increases agreed in 1991 - a 26 per cent pay increase for engineering workers and a 21 per cent rise for the steel sector. However, such pay increases do not reflect productivity, which, on average, is 70 per cent below western German levels. Economists fear that high labour costs in eastern Germany will drive away investors, increase unemployment - already 18 per cent but about double that counting those on jobless schemes - and severely undermine any hopes of an economic upturn in the east. A renewed round of talks last month broke off after employers tried to negotiate for 9 per cent wage increases, which is about equivalent to eastern Germany's expected inflation rate this year. 'Our answer is simple. Since our members are going to lose their jobs, we might as well fight for these large pay rises so that they can have higher unemployment benefit once they are out of work,' said Mr Bohm. It is not certain eastern German workers feel the same: many have said they would accept low wages in the short term, much as workers in the west are doing, in return for jobs and investment. Both sides, and former communist managers who were party to the wage equality contract in 1991, would probably concede the agreement was flawed. For political reasons eastern managers wanted high wages and the western employers were worried that lower wages in the east would make eastern Germany more competitive. The unions felt that higher wages in the east would help to keep wages high in western Germany. The economic circumstances in eastern Germany were different in 1991 too, when it still had markets in the Soviet Union. The markets are no longer there.</p>

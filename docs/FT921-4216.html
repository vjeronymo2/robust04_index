			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Scottish Enterprise gives Lecs more cash SCOTTISH Enterprise, the body at the centre of the network of local enterprise companies (Lecs) which handle economic development and training in Scotland outside the Highlands, is cutting its share of the network's budget for next year and giving proportionately more to the Lecs. The core body, now called Scottish Enterprise National, is to take Pounds 65.2m, or 14 per cent, of the network's Pounds 462.6m budget. It began last year with 17 per cent of the budget. Three of the larger Lecs - Glasgow Development Agency, Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise, and Grampian - have had their budgets reduced. Lanarkshire Development Agency, grappling with the problems of the closure of steel plants including Ravenscraig, will receive Pounds 50.2m. Glasgow gets Pounds 58.1m. Other Lecs, including Ayrshire, Dunbartonshire and Forth Valley, also receive increases.</p>

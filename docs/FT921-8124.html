			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese win coal price cut AUSTRALIAN COAL exporters have been forced, for the second year in succession, to accept a price cut for steam coal shipments to Japan. The new price - for deliveries in the 1992-1993 financial year - is USDollars 38.90 a tonne, fob Australia, 95 cents down from the current year. Australia is the key supplier of both steam coal, largely used for electricity generation, as well as coking coal for the Japanese steel mills. The contract was set up by Chubu Electric Power, the lead negotiator for the Japanese utilities, with the Queensland coal producer MIM and Ulan and Drayton of New South Wales. While the Australians may express some disappointment with the price fall, it could have been much worse. A recent spot tender from Scottish Power was awarded for Australian coal of this quality at Dollars 31, fob. These prices will flow on to some 17m tonnes of Australian coal burned in Japanese power stations as well as setting the Australian price for Taipower in Taiwan and South Korea's Kepco. The one small gain claimed by one of the major steam coal producers last week was that the price reduction was less - albeit marginally - than the Dollars 1 cut for semi-soft coking coal. It is from excess coking coal, however, that the steam coal market is now threatened. This year's Japanese steel mill settlements saw a 10 per cent cut in tonnage from Australian and Canada for hard coking coal and much bigger cuts for soft coking coal. As these coals can readily double up as very high quality steam coals and as many existing mines are planning extensive expansions in output (for example, Australia's biggest producer, BHP-Utah, alone is lifting production by 7m tonned to 38m tonnes over the next few years), there is a danger that unbought coking coals, combined with expanding steam coal production, could swamp the market. UK coal imports in 1991 rose to 19.5m tonnes from 14.7m tonnes in 1990. Steam coal imports - mainly for power generation - rose by 69 per cent to 9.2m tonnes. Of this 6.3m tonnes went into Liverpool, largely for PowerGen's Fiddlers Ferry station (1.3m tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes the previous year) and the Thames power stations of West Thurrock and Tilbury (both National Power) and Kingsnorth (PowerGen).</p>

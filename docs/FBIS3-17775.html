This was disclosed to  Interfax on Monday by a member of the drafting team.    The source said that the document suggests renouncing early  elections, potentially destabilizing constitutional amendments  and the politically charged comments on the events of October  1993.    The draft reportedly includes the formation of a public body  to ensure all sides observe the agreement. It should be signed  by federal government bodies, federation members, parliamentary  groups, political movements, public organizations and trade  unions.    If the terms are violated by any party, they will be asked  to  leave the political arena.    At the initiative of the president the document was drafted  by five working groups on the following spheres: politics,  economy, regional and ethnic matters, culture, security.    Earlier on Monday a well-informed source close to the  president told Interfax that the final text of the draft  agreement will be handed to Yeltsin within the next few hours.</p>

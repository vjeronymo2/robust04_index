			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOESKY TELLS OF ILLEGAL TIPS FROM MILKEN;  </P> <P> WALL STREET: THE FORMER INSIDE TRADER ALSO SAYS HE BROKE FEDERAL LAW BY PAYING  FELLOW PRISON INMATES TO DO HIS LAUNDRY.  </P> <P> Ivan F. Boesky gave the first public evidence Thursday that former Drexel  Burnham Lambert junk bond chief Michael Milken had illegally fed him inside  information about stocks.  </P> <P> Asked by a defense lawyer in the trial of John A. Mulheren Jr. to name all of  the people who had given him illegal inside tips, Boesky said "Mr. Milken comes  to mind."  </P> <P> But Boesky, formerly one of Wall Street's leading speculators in takeover  stocks, said he didn't know how much money he had made from the information  Milken had passed to him. "I haven't made a compilation, sir," Boesky said.  </P> <P> Milken pleaded guilty to six felony counts last month and is awaiting  sentencing. Several of the counts related to transactions with Boesky. None of  them, however, had to do with inside trading, a point which Milken's lawyers  and press spokesman strongly emphasized at the time. Milken's spokesman has  long denied that Milken leaked inside information or traded on it himself,  although he was accused of it in an indictment that has since been dropped.  </P> <P> Ken Lerer, Milken's spokesman, said Thursday that he wouldn't comment on  Boesky's testimony.  </P> <P> Boesky, 53, was excused Thursday after testifying for two and a half days as  the main prosecution witness in Mulheren's trial. Like Boesky, Mulheren was a  stock arbitrager. Mulheren faces federal criminal charges of securities fraud  and conspiracy related to his business dealings with Boesky.  </P> <P> Testimony about Milken was elicited by Mulheren's lawyer, Thomas Puccio, who  attempted to demolish Boesky's credibility by showing that he had lied  repeatedly under oath and engaged in extensive illegal activities. Boesky said  Milken was the only individual he remembered leaking him inside information  besides the two he had already named, former investment bankers Dennis Levine  and Martin A. Siegel.  </P> <P> Throughout the grueling cross-examination, however, Boesky claimed that he  couldn't remember names, details or specific amounts of money. He said he  couldn't recall which companies Milken had leaked information about.  </P> <P> Boesky's nearly total inability to recall amounts of money at times appeared to  stymie Puccio. The defense lawyer is attempting to show that Boesky has  considerable personal wealth left despite the $100 million in penalties Boesky  paid when he pleaded guilty to a single felony count. The defense theory is  that Boesky's agreement with the government to turn in others enabled him to  keep a big part of his wealth.  </P> <P> Boesky claimed that the huge volume of stock trading he did -- up to 300  million shares a year -- made it difficult for him to recall how much money he  made on any deal. Asked if he had made $57 million in profit after receiving an  inside tip about Getty Oil in the early 1980s, Boesky said he didn't remember.  </P> <P> "Isn't it true that if you made in the neighborhood of $57 million on a certain  stock it would stick out in your mind?" Puccio asked.  </P> <P> "I don't think it would necessarily stick out in my memory," Boesky said.  </P> <P> Boesky also said he couldn't recall whether he had transferred assets to his  wife and children when the government began investigating him in 1986 to reduce  the amount of money the government could seize from him. "I do not recall my  financial activities in 1986," he said.  </P> <P> But under close questioning, Boesky did recall that he was able to deduct from  his 1986 taxes half of the $100-million penalty he paid.  </P> <P> Puccio said outside the courtroom that one possible reason for Boesky's  apparent severe memory problems is his concern about the many civil lawsuits he  faces. Boesky has testified that he faces more than $1 billion in civil claims  filed by people and companies that contend they were defrauded by his illegal  activities. Anything Boesky said on the witness stand in the Mulheren trial  could be used against him in the civil lawsuits. A lawyer for Boesky failed to  return a telephone call asking for comment Thursday.  </P> <P> Boesky also said he had broken federal law during the 19 months he had spent as  an inmate at the minimum-security federal prison camp in Lompoc by paying  fellow inmates to do his laundry. A spokesman for the federal Bureau of Prisons  said in a phone interview that hiring fellow inmates would have violated prison  rules, although the spokesman said he wasn't certain what law it might have  violated.  </P> <P> Puccio also asked Boesky if he had bribed officials at the prison, including  one of the wardens. Boesky strongly denied it.  </P> <P> While answering questions from reporters later, Puccio refused to say if he had  any evidence that Boesky had committed bribery. The prisons spokesman said: "We  have no knowledge of any bribes occurring in this facility with any staff  member."  </P> <P> In court, Puccio had intimated that when Boesky was sentenced in 1987, he had  given false information to the sentencing judge that the $100-million penalty  would leave him nearly bankrupt. Puccio refused to say afterwards if he plans  to introduce evidence later in the trial showing that Boesky had lied on that  point.  </P></p>

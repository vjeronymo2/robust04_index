			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / World Trade News: WTO role 'crucial in bilateral disputes' Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, yesterday said a new World Trade Organisation would have to play a critical role in cushioning multilateral trade from the debilitating effects of bilateral trade disputes. Mr Sutherland, who ends a brief but high-profile visit to South Africa today, said the trade wrangle between the US and Japan 'must not be allowed to have any impact on the Uruguay Round' and on the talks still to take place before ministers sign the accord in Marrakesh in April. Mr Sutherland met President F W de Klerk yesterday before a meeting with the National Economic Forum - the tripartite representation of government, business and labour, - where he discussed future South African trade policy. Mr Sutherland meets representatives from the private sector, in Cape Town, the centre of the textile industry, today before leaving the country. Mr Sutherland said that South Africa's revised Gatt offer left the country with particular difficulties in the high tariff protection afforded to its textile and motor manufacturing industries. Central to the WTO, which he hoped would be established by January next year, would be the graduated arbitration, mediation and settlement of bilateral disputes. Binding decisions would be open to appeal but reversible only if consensus was achieved among the parties involved. The establishment of the WTO would have to go hand in hand with increased co-operation with the World Bank and IMF. Mr Sutherland said he had held talks last week with Mr Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank, to this end. The overriding priority of 'the Brettons Woods institutions' had to be attention to the position of sub-Saharan Africa. The success of the Uruguay Round was no panacea for the sub-continent, he said.</p>

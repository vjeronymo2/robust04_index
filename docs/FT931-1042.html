			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Venezuela: little trust of state among the poorest BARRIO Union, rising up the slopes of the mountains east of Caracas, is by no means the worst of the slums in Venezuela, one of the region's richer countries. It is a comparatively old barrios bajos, having emerged in the 1950s. Most houses are built of cinder-block rather than the chipboard that dominates newer slums. The residents paint a depressing picture of a decline in the 1980s which progressively worsened. 'The years 1988, 1989 and 1990 were disastrous for the Barrio Union,' says a community leader, Ms Cira Macado. In almost every contact with the state, the citizens of Barrio Union are given reason for deeper distrust. They see police in league with the drug traffickers; soldiers arriving with weapons to sell to criminals; politicians who arrive just before election time laden with promises. The country is Latin America's most urban society - 85 per cent of the population lives in the cities. The government put in place 'targeted' poverty programmes after the February 1989 food riots. Yet claiming the food and other benefits often means travelling long distances, and hours in queues waiting for handouts. These targeted measures are described by Mr Gustavo Marquez, an expert in poverty at the Caracas business school IESA, as 'the most important effort ever made by any government in Venezuela to support low income groups through an economic crisis'. However,although in 1991 the government spent close to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 704m) - 2 per cent of GDP - on these programmes, he says they were too little to compensate the poor for the fall in real incomes. Mr Marquez says the exclusive emphasis on poverty alleviation is misplaced. 'We need to produce policies that are able to integrate the poor as consumers and producers in a growing economy. Growth and enhanced availability and access to high-quality social services, particularly education and health, are the proven way out of poverty.' The quality of health and education provision has declined sharply through the 1980s. Government spending on these did not drop drastically, but the allocation of resources is uneven, and often heavily weighted towards administration costs. Yet not all is not pessimism. The government has enlisted the help of voluntary organisations. It has sought a decentralisation of power and to enhance the role of state and local government. Channelling money into local projects has, in areas such as Nueva Tacagua, met with significant success. Nueva Tacagua, a barrio perched high over the west of Caracas, is home to 100,000 people. In 1989, it suffered fires, floods and collapse of mountainside houses. The lack of official response prompted residents to take matters into their own hands. In an unusual exercise of democracy, they established a programme for developing the area. Out of it emerged a local leadership, not linked to political parties, and an organisation covering education, health and environment. However, the extent to which small community groups can be expected to administer a nationwide system of poverty alleviation is open to question. And there is no guarantee that current programmes will continue when the new administration takes power early next year.</p>

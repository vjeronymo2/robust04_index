			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Serfin and Inverlat merger put in doubt Grupo Financiero Serfin and Grupo Financiero Inverlat, Mexico's third- and fourth-largest financial groups, are on the verge of calling off their proposed merger after failing to reach agreement on the valuation of the two institutions. The merger was proposed in June, and would, according to some measures, have made the combined group Mexico's second-largest financial institution. It would have given Serfin control over Inverlat, which controls the Comermex bank and was seen as the weaker of the two groups. Inverlat said yesterday it was unlikely the merger would proceed. Mr Roberto Aguirre, of Serfin, said a formal decision would be taken at the group's board meeting tomorrow. But he was not optimistic: 'There have been a lot of problems in the negotiations and the merger will probably not go ahead.' Mr Aguirre said the main stumbling block was over the terms of the share swap that would have lead to the fusion of the two companies. Serfin wanted to exchange 3.7 shares of Inverlat for every one of its shares, while Inverlat had proposed a ratio of 2.5, according to Infosel, a financial news agency. As negotiations over the transaction proceeded, both organisations concluded that the process of merging the banks would have been more complex and expensive than thought, and could have taken years to complete. Serfin and Inverlat had hoped a merger would help them compete more effectively with the market leaders, Banacci and Bancomer, by enabling them to benefit from economies of scale in administration and systems. 'Under this situation, the probabilities of merging are very low,' a Serfin executive told Reforma newspaper yesterday. 'On a scale of zero to hundred, the probabilities of a merger are zero.' Serfin was quoted as saying the disagreement was not over the value of the two groups' assets or liabilities, but on the intrinsic worth of the different institutions.</p>

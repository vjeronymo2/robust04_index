			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of a report on the work of the Shanghai </F> Municipal Higher People's Court delivered by Court President Hu  Ruibang at the Second Session of the 10th Shanghai Municipal  People's Congress on 21 February 1994]    [Text] In 1993, courts in Shanghai, guided by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the 14th CPC National Congress' guidelines,  unswervingly carried out the party's basic line of "one center,  two basic points" and the central and municipal party  committees' arrangements for the anticorruption drive, further  emancipated minds and sought truth from facts, comprehensively  strengthened judicial work, raised the level of administering  justice, and actively explored ways for reforming courts,  thereby providing judicial guarantee and legal service for  maintaining social stability; promoting Shanghai's reform,  opening up, and economic construction; and establishing a  socialist market economic structure.  <H5>  1. Relentlessly Launching the Drive To Crack Down on Crimes </H5> To Maintain Social Stability    In the past year, courts throughout Shanghai accepted 7,844  criminal cases of the first instance, down 3.86 percent from the  previous year; and concluded 7,763 cases and rendered verdicts  on 12,175 criminals, down 6.67 percent from 1992. Of the 10,073  criminals, on whom the verdict was enforced, 3,129, or 31.06  percent of the total, were serious criminal offenders having  committed murder, robbery, rape, intentional grave injury, major  larceny, and railroad banditry. Of these, 2,154, or 68.84  percent of the serious criminal offenders, were sentenced to  five years or more in prison, life imprisonment, or death  (including death sentence with a stay of execution).    Under unified arrangements, courts in Shanghai closely  coordinated with the relevant departments and concentrated  efforts to launch in depth a special antitheft drive.  Throughout the year, they accepted a total of 4,157 cases  involving 6,882 accused. Of these, the courts concluded 4,102  cases and sentenced 6,753 criminals, accounting for 55.47  percent of the total number of criminals sentenced.    Courts at all levels in Shanghai, earnestly implementing the  National People's Congress' relevant decisions, meted out swift  and harsh punishments according to the law to 165 criminals who  smuggled, produced, trafficked, and traded in narcotics; who  smuggled, produced, and disseminated pornography; who abducted  women and children for sale; who engaged in prostitition; or who  assembled people to gamble.    The Shanghai railroad transport courts, proceeding from the  need to maintain public order, cracked down on railroad and  highway bandits. Throughout the year they tried and concluded  490 cases involving 996 criminals who committed murder, robbery,  rape, injury, and larceny along railroads or on trains. Of the  910 criminals on whom a verdict was already enforced, 379, or  41.65 percent of the total, were sentenced to five years or more  in prison, life imprisonment, or death (including death sentence  with a stay).  <H5>  2. Cracking Down on Serious Economic Crimes and Punishing </H5> Corruption To Safeguard Economic Order    Courts in Shanghai performed an extremely heavy task in  cracking down on economic crimes. Major economic criminal cases  increased markedly with the following features: 1) increased  number of serious cases and volume of money involved; 2) more  crimes committed by employees of banking institutions; and 3)  changes in the attributes of criminals. Most of the accused  were administrative and managerial, financial and accounting,  supply and marketing, and maintenance personnel of enterprises  and institutions or employees of banking institutions; and their  age tended to become younger. Of the 18 economic criminals  sentenced by the Intermediate Court, 55.6 percent were under the  age of 25.    Courts at all levels meted out severe punishment without  mercy specifically for crimes committed by state functionaries,  especially those of leading party and government organizations,  judicial departments, administrative law enforcement  departments, and economic management departments who took  advantage of their position and powers to embezzle and  misappropriate public funds and take bribes; for crimes of  producing and marketing fake and shoddy goods to the detriment  of consumer interests; and for fraud in economic contracts.  Throughout the year, they accepted 1,086 economic cases  involving 1,499 accused; and, together with the cases left over  from 1992, concluded 1,075 cases involving 1,515 accused. Of  the 998 criminals on whom the verdict was already enforced, 367,  or 36.77 percent of the total, were sentenced to five years or  more in prison, life imprisonment, or death (including death  sentence with a stay). Of the economic criminals given a  verdict, 40.1 percent were former state functionaries. Through  holding trials, courts recovered 53.0879 million yuan of  economic losses for the state and collectives. To maintain  market economic order and stop unlawful competition, the courts  sentenced 46 criminals involved in fake trademarks.    Following the Second Plenary Session of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission, the courts took immediate  action to strengthen the intensity of deepening the  anticorruption drive. Three successive special trials were held  in Shanghai in August, September, and October to try publicly 99  cases of embezzlement, bribery, and misappropriation of public  funds. From September through December, a total of 423 economic  criminal cases were concluded, equivalent to 64.88 percent of  those concluded in the first eight months.  <H5>  3. Intensifying Judicial Administration of Economic Cases, </H5> Using Legal Weapons To Readjust Economic Relations, and Ensuring  the Establishment and Development of the Socialist Market Economy    Last year, law courts handled 22,802 economic disputes of  various descriptions, up 54.59 percent from the previous year.  They completed the trials of 21,424 cases, up 48.77 percent  from the previous year. Claims involved in litigation topped  3.83 billion yuan, a 198-percent increase over the previous  year. There was an upsurge in the number of cases that  reflected salient problems in the way the economy functioned.  The number of cases involving foreigners and Hong Kong, Macao,  and Taiwan compatriots increased rapidly. Also, there was an  increase in the number of cases in which the defendants were  from outside Shanghai. Interference from protectionist  practices by local authorities was serious. In light of these  problems, the municipal higher court held several meetings to  carefully analyze the new circumstances in which economic cases  were tried, and explicitly called for enhancing concepts in five  areas of the judicial administration of economic cases:  Enhancing the concept of equality by providing equal legal  protection to all types of market competitors, such as  state-owned, collectively owned, privately run, and "partly or  wholly foreign-owned" enterprises; heightening the concept of  contractual obligations by fully respecting the intentions of  interested parties and ensuring the realization of the market  economic principle of fostering contractual practices; enhancing  the concept of overall interests by resolutely resisting and  opposing local protectionist practices and safeguarding the  unity and authority of legal institutions; heightening the  concept of policy-guided law enforcement by handling cases in  strict accordance with the law where relevant legal provisions  are available; by following the guidance of basic principles in  policies and laws in the absence of legal provisions or explicit  legal provisions; and by realistically and properly applying the  criterion of whether cases are solved in a manner conducive to  the "three causes"; and enhancing the concept of efficiency by  striving for good political, economic, and social benefits.    Law courts across the municipality actively tried cases  stemming from enterprise bankruptcy, joint enterprise  operations, contracting, and leasing, providing legal guarantees  and services for changing operating mechanisms in enterprises.  Last year, they tried 815 cases that fell under these four  categories, concluding proceedings in 703 cases. They actively  conducted explorations, boldly carried out practical work, and  conscientiously tried stock- related cases. First, they stopped  blackmarketing in stock subscription forms to maintain order in  issuing stocks. Second, they halted stock speculation to  maintain fair and orderly stock trading. Third, they  strengthened stock companies' responsibilities as brokerages to  protect stockholders' legitimate rights and interests. Fourth,  they experimented with the issuance of public notices on losses  incurred on stock markets to protect investors' legitimate  rights and interests. The development of scientific and  technological markets caused a corresponding increase in  disputes involving trademarks, patents, and technological  contracts. Law courts in Shanghai handled 140 cases that fell  under these categories.    Last year, law courts dealt with 182 cases involving  foreigners and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots  (including maritime cases), twice the number in the previous  year. They took care to serve the policy of opening up wider to  the outside world through the manner in which they handled  cases. They fully exercised China's jurisdicational rights in  accordance with the principle of maintaining state sovereignty.  They upheld the principle of equally protecting the legitimate  rights and interests of Chinese and foreign litigants, as well  as litigants within and outside the national boundaries. They  actively publicized China's laws and investment policies to  attract foreign investment. In dealing with illegal acts  committed by foreign business people, they meted out legal  punishment or applied compulsory measures in accordance with the  law.  <H5>  4. Strengthening Civil Judicial Work To Effectively Protect </H5> the Civil Rights and Interests of Citizens and Corporations    In the past year, courts accepted 36,963 civil cases of the  first instance and concluded 36,864, up 12.95 percent and 14.19  percent respectively over 1992. Divorce, debt, and indemnity --  the three major categories of civil lawsuits -- accounted for  nearly 80 percent of the total, of which 21,277 cases involved  divorce, constituting 57.56 percent of total civil lawsuits.    Courts at all levels, pursuant to the law and the Shanghai  municipal regulations for protecting the aged, the young, and  women and children, heard some 25,000 cases involving divorce,  alimony, child and parental support, and inheritance, thereby  protecting the lawful rights and interests of women, children,  and the aged. Persistently giving priority to lawsuits involving  the aged, courts expedited the handling of such civil cases; 90  percent of the cases were concluded in two months and most of  them in less than a month, and 97 percent were resolved. In  handling lawsuits related to violation of consumer interests,  courts earnestly enforced the "Regulations on Protecting the  Lawful Rights and Interests of Consumers in Shanghai  Municipality;" of the lawsuits settled, 96 percent were won by  consumers.    In the past year, a total of 73 lawsuits involving housing  and real estate management were accepted by the Municipal  Intermediate Court alone, which handled only two such cases in  1992. While hearing individual cases, courts demanded their  personnel to foster an overall concept and to refrain from  adopting a wait-and-see attitude as a result of failing to  obtain a clear grasp of policies and laws. They were urged to  combine the hearing of housing and real estate dispute cases  with the implementation of the state's macroeconomic regulation  and control policies, to guard against handling cases  independently, and to pay attention to the social benefits of  case handling. They were also urged to persist in proceeding  everything from reality and adhering to agreements in handling  housing and real estate disputes; to uphold the equality of  subjects before the law; and to expedite hearing and enforcement  of ruling while ensuring the quality of case handling. In  addition, courts also accepted 102 cases of labor disputes; and  591 civil lawsuits involving foreign and Hong Kong, Macao, and  Taiwan businessmen, thereby protecting the lawful rights and  interests of foreign nationals and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan  citizens in the mainland, as well as promoting the normal  development of people-to- people exchanges. Personnel of  grass-roots people's courts actively took part in local  comprehensive management of public order. Throughout the year  they offered guidance and training to 5,611 mediation personnel  on a total of 349 occasions, and alleviated aggravating  contradictions by properly handling 352 civil cases in good  time, thereby maintaining social stability and unity.  <H5>  5. Actively Conducting Administrative Judicial Work To </H5> Protect the Lawful Rights and Interests of Citizens,  Corporations, and Other Organizations and To Ensure and  Supervise Administrative Organs in Exercising Functions  According to the Law    In the past year, courts accepted 339 administrative cases  of  the first instance and, together with the cases left over from  1992, concluded 360 cases. Courts at all levels, earnestly  implementing the Administrative Procedural Law, focused the  administrative judicial work on serving key municipal  construction projects. They took the initiative to provide  out-of-court legal service in a bid to resolve disputes before  lawsuits were filed and promptly heard cases related to key  municipal construction projects, thereby providing an effective  legal guarantee for the municipal construction.    Courts actively accepted cases related to encroachment upon  enterprises' autonomy in production and management in violation  of the Enterprise Law; cases related to unwarranted pooling of  funds and arbitrary requisitioning of donations and extraction  of fees from enterprises; and various administrative cases  involving large and medium state-owned enterprises, which were  filed with the people's courts according to the provisions in  the Administrative Procedural Law. Throughout the year they  accepted 854 cases from administrative institutions for  compulsory enforcement by courts, and enforced 854, or 99.18  percent of the total, thereby supporting administrative  institutions in exercising functions according to the law.    In the past year, courts in Shanghai accepted a total of  97,950 cases of all kinds and concluded 97,846, up 12.3 percent  and 12.46 percent, respectively, over 1992. In view of the  judicial tasks, which became more and more heavy and difficult,  courts continued to follow the correct guiding ideology and  focused the work on the three major tasks of serving economic  construction, fighting corruption, and ensuring social  stability, thereby keeping the work of courts in pace with the  continuous development of the new situation arising from a  market economy. The following major measures were taken:  <H5>  1. Persist in Strictly Enforcing the Laws and Make Efforts </H5> To Enhance the Judicial Level    First, efforts were made to ensure that cases were placed on  file for investigation and prosecution. The overwhelming  majority of cases tried at the courts were directly handled by  courts; public prosecution cases accounted for only 7.52 percent  of the total number of the cases mentioned above. Second, we  persisted in holding public trials, placed judicial activities  under supervison by the masses and public opinion, and  vigorously put an end to "cases influenced by relationships or  favoritism." Third, we strengthened supervision over court  trials and provided better guidance for proceedings. In the  past year, we wound up a total of 815 criminal cases which had  been appealed to a higher court and a total of 22 cases  protested by procuratorial organs. Fourth, we improved study of  application of the law. Over 50 special judicial work  conferences and seminars of various forms were held across the  municipality to study laws, rules, and regulations which had  been recently promulgated as well as judicial explanations. The  judge training center sponsored 13 training sessions to give  professional training to nearly half of the key members of  judicial work. Fifth, we further strengthened law enforcement.  We handled 20,407 various law enforcement cases in the whole  year; coupled with the cases kept on file, we handled a total of  21,348 cases, making the rate of cases finished in the year  reach 82.27 percent. Thus, we maintained the authority of  verdicts as well as the dignity of the laws. Sixth, we conducted  a general examination of law and discipline enforcement. Law  courts in Shanghai examined 5 percent of civil, economic, and  law enforcement cases; seriously handled the problems  discovered; and made corrections while trying to consolidate.  Seventh, we established rules and regulations to standardize the  conduct of cadres and policemen. Shanghai's law courts  established or amended over 160 various rules and regulations,  including a system to determine the responsibility for mistakes  in the trial of a case, while launching a special drive to  rectify unhealthy practices found in government departments and  in trades and professions and while conducting a general  examination of law and discipline enforcement.  <H5>  2. Step up Reform of Law Courts Themselves and Strictly </H5> Enforce the Laws    First, we deepened reform of the personnel system and  improved administration through appraisal of objectives achieved  during job tenure, thereby arousing the enthusiasm of the vast  numbers of cadres and policemen. Law courts in Yangpu, Putuo,  and Changning districts implemented an "on duty, standby, and  off duty" system among their personnel, thereby preliminarily  giving expressing to the principle -- competition on an equal  footing, and those who excel will succeed and those who fail are  eliminated. Second, we rationalized the law court system and  installed better facilities in law courts. In 1993, we  established law courts in New Pudong Area, New Minhang Area, and  Jiading Area; the Higher People's Court established a court for  handling complaints and petitions; and the intermediate people's  court established a second court for hearing civil cases.  Third, we explored reform of court trial methods. The Shanghai  Municipal People's Higher Court specially set up a group for  guiding reform of court trial methods to provide specific  guidance for the progress of the work. Law courts in New Pudong  Area, Yangpu District, Xuhui District, Huangpu District, and  Songjiang Area successively experimented with criminal cases'  prosecution and defense and with the hearing and proof method  for civil, economic dispute, and law enforcement cases. Fourth,  we implemented a system for determining the responsibility for  mistakes in the trial of a case and adopted a new pattern of  lawsuit documents on a trial basis. They have a positive  significance for promoting the enhancement of judicial  personnel's professional and law enforcement level.  <H5>  3. Earnestly Improving Work Style and Stepping Up </H5> Investigations and Studies    After the party central committee and the muncipal party  committee encouraged the "practice of conducting investigations  and studies," leaders elected to a new term on the municipal  higher court used two months' time to investigate and study  thorny problems and issues of widespread concern arising during  the course of judicial processes in law courts at the  grass-roots level. They promptly held a work conference of  officials from economic dispute mediation centers in Shanghai's  law courts, drawing up work rules for such centers after summing  up their experiences. They also made specific provisions  regarding the character, tasks, establishment, case-handling  procedures, and mediation principles of such centers on the  basis of legal provisions and practical experience in judicial  administration. Moreover, they stepped up their efforts to hold  academic seminars and actively attended the fifth national  academic seminar of judicial departments. A total of 12 papers  from law courts in Shanghai won prizes, accounting for 55  percent of the total number of papers sent to the seminar. The  higher court won the prize for well-composed treatises.  <H5>  4. Setting Priorities in Judicial Administration and Hearing </H5> Major and Important Cases    Leaders in law courts at all levels personally heard major  and important cases, meting out harsh punishment expeditiously  in accordance with the law for serious cases of embezzlement and  bribery that gravely infringed on the interests of the state and  people, and impaired the reputation of the party and the  government; for serious cases involving fraud, profiteering, the  production and sale of counterfeit and substandard goods, tax  evasion, and grave disruption of economic order; and for cases  that seriously affected public order, endangered people's lives  and property, and affected social stability, such as murder,  robbery, rape, highway banditry, and especially crimes committed  by gangsters that were similar to organized crime. They  conscientiously tried major and important economic, civil, and  administrative cases related to the drive for deepening reform,  especially to the drive for accelerating reforms of the banking,  investment, financial, and taxation systems. They worked hard  to enhance the results of handling cases and improve service.  They showed courage in enforcing the law strictly in  exceptionally serious or controversial cases. They established  a sound supervision and inspection system, formulated the  "Opinions on Earnestly Trying Major and Important Cases," and  prodded law courts at all levels to ensure thorough judicial  administration of major and important cases.  <H5>  5. Applying Different Means To Actively Participate in </H5> Comprehensively Improving Public Security    At the begining of last year, the Central Committee and  municipal party committee issued a series of important  instructions on strengthening the comprehensive effort to  improve public security. The higher court promptly convened a  meeting of presidents of the courts at the district and county  level to gain a better understanding of the instructions, during  which it offered specific opinions on implementing the  instructions. Setting a target for the work of enhancing trial  functions and participating in the comprehensive effort of  improving public security, courts at all levels strengthened  examination and supervision in this respect. Through the efforts  of the police, it has become an initial standard that all courts  in the municipality take part in the comprehensive effort to  improve public security. First, education to publicize the  legal system was conducted through public hearing of cases and  public sentencing of offenders. The courts in the municipality  held 236 public meetings to announce the sentencing of  offenders, at which sentences on 717 cases involving 1,221  offenders were announced. This has helped educate some 191,100  people. Second, typical cases were selected and publicized  through the media to expand the cases' impact on society. Last  year, 1,641 pieces of case-related materials were compiled for  publicizing. About 3,110 manuscripts were sent to the central  and local press units, 2,138 of which were used. Third,  concrete education on the legal system was conducted by making  use of criminal cases. Last year, 1,747 visits were made to the  scene where cases occurred or to the relevant units to conduct  legal education by making use of related cases, and the masses  welcomed this method of education. Fourth, in dealing with  problems discovered in the course of handling cases, judicial  proposals were applied to urge the relevant units to improve the  legal system by plugging loopholes. Courts at all levels put  forward 707 judicipal proposals containing 1,031 articles, 384  of which were adopted by relevant departments. Rectification  and reform measures were implemented accordingly. Fifth,  efforts were made to strengthen education after sentences were  meted out to criminals. The purpose was to encourage criminals  to agree with the court judgement and reform themselves. To  keep an eye on criminals who were placed on probation, the  courts established a system under which the criminals were  frequently revisited for observation purposes. Measures to help  educate them were implemented in coordination with public  security departments and other relevant units. For juvenile  criminals, each had a personal file set up and an analysis of  their conditions was conducted regularly. The municipality's  courts made 472 revisits to check on criminals placed on  probation. To check on juvenile offenders, the courts made 697  revisits.  <H5>  6. Strengthening the Building of Court Personnel and </H5> Keeping Them Clean and Honest    Adhering to the principles of setting strict demands on  party  members and court personnel, the courts throughout the  municipality took great pains to improve the quality of their  personnel. First, they strengthened the building of leading  bodies. Following the election of new leading bodies for the  courts at various levels, the higher court party group  immediately convened a municipal conference on court work during  which it called on the leadership of courts to strengthen unity  and put the collective strength of courts into play. Second,  efforts were made to deepen the struggle against corruption to  promote honesty among court personnel. The higher court  conducted special checks aimed at improving the quality of  trials and at rectifying the practice of making litigants' money  and property the main criterion for handling cases; resolutely  carried out the provisions of the Supreme People's Court on  building a clean government; and promptly issued a circular to  rectify the collection of fees and charges in violation of  regulations. Third, courts at various levels organized cadres  and police to conscientiously study the documents of the 14th  CPC National Congress, Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping," and "The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on  Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market  Economic Structure," and to receive education on communist  ideals and ethics in order to enhance their consciousness and  firmness in adhering to the party's basic line. Fourth, to  purify the rank of cadres, courts at all levels earnestly  investigated and punished violators of laws and discipline.    With the acceleration of reform, opening-up, and economic  construction, a legal system with the Constitution as the core,  suited to the development of a socialist market economy, is  being established. As more and more social and economic  relations are being regulated by legal means, the workload of  people's courts is getting heavier and heavier. Under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the Third  Plenary Session of the party's 14th Central Committee and  according to the arrangements made by a national conference of  higher people's court presidents, the main tasks of this  municipality's people's courts in the new year are to continue  cracking down on criminal activities; to do a good job in trying  serious cases, especially serious economic cases; to vigorously  regulate economic relations; to effectively protect the  legitimate rights and interests of the people, legal entities,  and other organizations; to strengthen and improve judicial work  by strictly enforcing laws and raising the quality of judicial  workers; and to provide a judicial guarantee and legal service  in maintaining social stability, promoting a clean and honest  government, and taking the lead in building operating mechanisms  for the socialist market economy in Shanghai.    First, it is necessary to step up the trial of criminal  cases  and to strive to maintain social stability.    Second, we should regulate economic relations according to  law and promote the establishment of a modern enterprise system  and a market economic structure [the word "socialist" was not  included].    Third, efforts should be made to step up the trial of civil  and administrative cases to effectively protect the legitimate  rights and interests of citizens and legal persons.    Fourth, people's courts should step up their reform and  strengthen themselves.    The tasks facing the people's courts in 1994 are arduous.  Under the leadership of the municipal party committee and under  the supervision of the Supreme People's Court, the municipal  people's congress, and its standing committee, we are determined  to rally more closely around the party Central Committee; guided  by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese Characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary  Session of the party's 14th Central Committee, we will  strengthen our spirit, resolutely carry out reforms, and work  hard to bring our judicial role into full play so as to make a  fresh contribution to Shanghai's effort to be the first to build  operating mechanisms for the socialist market economy and to  "making some changes in one year and substantial changes in  three years."</p>

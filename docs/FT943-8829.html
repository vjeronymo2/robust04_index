			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Winterflood enters gilts market The recent rise in the number of marketmakers in UK government bonds could be coming to an end with the entry into the market today of Winterflood Securities, the smaller companies marketmaker owned by Close Brothers. In the past year, Hoare Govett, the UK stockbroker which belongs to ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, Merrill Lynch of the US and Yamaichi of Japan have become gilt-edged marketmakers (Gemms), attracted by the improved profitability in trading gilts. Winterflood's entry brings the number of Gemms to 22, which rekindles memories of the overcrowded and tough conditions of the late 1980s that forced several participants to withdraw. Unlike the larger Gemms which focus on large-volume trades, Winterflood will concentrate on retail and smaller institutional investors. Therefore, it will not be imposing a minimum size of trade. 'There is a reasonable amount of small business in gilts - trades of anything up to Pounds 1m - which many people in the market are not interested in doing,' said Mr Brian Winterflood, chairman and managing director of Winterflood Securities. He added that there was potential for the gilts market to be opened further to smaller investors, especially if the government allowed gilts to be included in personal equity plans. BZW Investment Management plans to capitalise on the renewed interest in commodities by launching a closed-end commodities fund aimed at institutional investors. The Jersey-based investment company will be launched next month and is expected to attract up to Pounds 100m. The benchmark for the fund's performance will be the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, which includes a wide range of commodities, including livestock, agricultural products, energy and precious and base metals.</p>

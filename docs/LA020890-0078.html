			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> King Doesn't Rule the Ratings: ABC's new "Elvis" series drew surprisingly low  ratings for its debut Tuesday night. Premiering in the coveted slot behind the  top-rated "Roseanne," the show about the King's early years in rock n' roll  captured a 24% share of viewers.  </P> <P> That left it in second place at 9:30 p.m. behind NBC's "In the Heat of the  Night," which drew a 25% share of the audience for that half hour. The CBS  miniseries "Family of Spies" garnered a 21 share between 9:30 and 10. Elvis'  rating represented a significant drop from Roseanne's 33 share and was less  than the 27 share which ABC's "Coach" averages in the same time period. "Elvis"  will debut Sunday in its regular 8:30 p.m. slot. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

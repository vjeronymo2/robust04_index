Following the NATO  summit in Brussels and President Clinton's visit to Prague,  Kiev, and Moscow, Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend discussed  topics of international security policy in a KURIER interview.    -- The new NATO concept: The fact that the Eastern reform  states have not been accepted as members is not primarily a  concession to Russian President Yeltsin. The foremost  consideration in this is the alliance's unity. Homogeneous  political, economic, and social structures are the real strength  of NATO. This requires an adaptation process of several years  for prospective members. I expect this process to be concluded  before the end of this decade.    -- Consequences for Europe: We must not draw the wrong  conclusions from the outcome in Brussels. The truth is that  Europe will have to do more for its security by itself, also in  the future.    -- Consequences for Austria: We are going a different way:  Security via integration. Austria will try to codetermine  European security within the European Union.    -- Clinton's foreign policy: However fervently the U.S.  President may state the opposite, the fact is that following the  end of the Cold War American interests have moved away from  Europe. And a power vacuum has formed in the Pacific area,  which has the highest population growth and where some of the  countries have two-digit economic growth rates. Japan, the  leading economic power, only has a very small army. Opening up  of Communism requires a different security policy in that part  of the world.    There are also other parts of the world that are more  important to the United States than Europe at the moment: the  Middle East for instance, where the peace process demands  support; or the petroleum producing countries, upon whose  political stability the United States' economy is dependent.    -- The situation in Russia: The recent developments should  not be dramatized. History has shown that times of big changes  tend to play into the hands of radical nationalists. But the  danger must not be underestimated, either. In Russia we have  the same situation now as before the elections: The president  faces a parliament where communists and nationalists hold a  majority. Considering this, a long period of political and  military instability can be expected.    -- Nuclear arms: In view of the distribution of arms in four  states of the former Soviet Union and considering the  diminishing central power and control, nobody can rule out that  mass destruction arms get into the wrong hands. This is the  real challenge to American security policy. Beside continuing  efforts for disarmament, it would be important to include the  new nuclear arms countries in a network of international  monitoring.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Further cracks in emperor's image: Robert Graham discusses whether the Berlusconi government in Italy is likely to survive the latest blows Five months into office, and the Berlusconi government has already acquired the air of a lame-duck administration. Through inexperience and poor judgment, Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate turned premier, has scored a string of own goals, which have brought his own future and the durability of his government into question. He has become involved in a bruising battle with the judiciary over corruption investigations into his Fininvest business empire, in which something has to give - with the threat of his implication the stuff of every newspaper's front page for the past two weeks. He has failed to find a quick solution to the conflict of interest between his role as head of government and his ownership of Italy's second largest private business group. And his nerve in introducing much-needed reforms is due to be tested today by a four-hour general strike in protest at cuts in pension and healthcare benefits in the 1995 budget. The unions organised similar general strikes against the two previous budgets, of the Amato and Ciampi governments, and Mr Berlusconi has dismissed today's protest as 'a ritual performance to reassert their presence and identity'. But this time there is a genuine sense of confrontation, with the pensions issue affecting a large cross-section of the electorate. The government has failed to communicate the genuine urgency of tackling the pensions issue and confused people by frequent changes in the detail of the proposal. Many are worried they will lose out, or simply do not know their status. This is evident both in street conversations as well as in the responses to hotlines run by the newspapers and government. Those who know Mr Berlusconi well say he has failed in his usually successful role as a communicator, because he has a visceral distaste of communicating bad news. He has only begun to talk of the need for 'sacrifices' in the past two weeks, and this in low key. 'We get the feeling Berlusconi changed tactics at the last minute and sought a confrontation with us which he always said he wanted to avoid,' comments one senior trade unionist. Certainly the government was bending over backwards to accommodate the unions until Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat and an arbiter of business opinion, called in Mr Berlusconi for an informal dinner, dubbed 'the last supper', on September 23. Mr Berlusconi is believed to have been told that without a tough budget his government stood no chance of winning international credibility, let alone of retaining the continuing support of the business community that he claims to represent. From this point on, the government's position toughened and the 1995 budget presented a courageous attempt to reform the money-devouring pay-as-you-go state pensions system. Italy will now accelerate the pace at which it moves to fix the male retirement age at 65 and the female at 60; early retirement will be penalised; the rate at which pensions accrue will be cut and private schemes will be encouraged. No one disputes the need for these changes. The markets, in particular, are worried about Italy's budget deficit and mountain of debt. Treasury funding of the pensions deficit will be almost L85,000bn (Pounds 34bn) this year and, if unchecked, will play havoc with Italy's future financial stability. Indeed, having courted unpopularity in the budget, it is arguable that Mr Berlusconi should have been more ambitious in his aims. In 1993, the Amato government found almost double the L50,000bn being sought by Mr Berlusconi in new revenues and spending cuts. Even if the general strike passes off quietly, the government will only have won a breathing space for Italy's public finances. Similar, perhaps larger sums will have to be found to keep the budget deficit from rising above 8 per cent of gross domestic product again in 1996. But as a leader, Mr Berlusconi has failed to impose his authority on the cabinet. He swings between listening to the hawkish advice of those such as Mr Giuliano Ferrara, the minister for parliamentary affairs, and Mr Cesare Previti, his Fininvest lawyer and now defence minister, and listening to the more cautious counsel of his other colleagues. The hawks have pushed him into frequent clashes with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, which he has invariably lost. Mr Berlusconi is also proving thin-skinned. He reacts defensively even to constructive criticism and sees conspiracies against him everywhere, not least in the local and foreign press. He complains openly about how hard he has to work, as if the country were ungrateful for his personal sacrifice. 'The quality of my life has deteriorated since I took on this job,' he said this week, adding: 'I work 16 to 18 hours a day.' While these faults could be put down to inexperience, others are seemingly irremediable. These derive from Mr Berlusconi having entered politics without clearing his position with the judiciary over corruption investigations into Fininvest and without distancing himself properly from his ownership of Fininvest. As a result, he has been weakened by continual conflicts of interest. The worst involves the government shake-up of the RAI, the state broadcasting organisation, which risks being beneficial to his own three commercial channels. Only at the last minute, on President Scalfaro's insistence, was legislation removed from the 1995 budget that raised the RAI's annual operating fee and left that of Fininvest untouched. This week the senate began to debate proposals drawn up by three Berlusconi-appointed jurists on ways to avoid a conflict of interest. Mr Berlusconi has promised that legislation based on the jurists' ideas will be considered by the next cabinet. However, Fininvest is deeply rooted in the government, having provided three ministers plus the funds and organisation for Forza Italia, Mr Berlusconi's support movement. In addition, any solution to the conflict of interest is likely to be slow and partial because Fininvest is so big and so indebted. Mr Berlusconi also now finds himself in open conflict with Milan magistrates and their colleagues in Rome and Turin, who are pursuing separate inquiries into Fininvest affairs. The most damaging investigation is into allegations of bribing the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, to turn a blind eye to the true ownership of Telepiu, the cable TV channel in which Fininvest has a declared 10 per cent stake. Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, the Milan public prosecutor, in a serious breach of his judicial role publicly warned last week that the net of investigation was closing round Mr Berlusconi. The magistrates cannot go on playing a cat and mouse game with the prime minister. Equally, given the continued popularity of the magistrates, it will be hard for the government to head them off. For Mr Berlusconi's main coalition partners - the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi, and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, headed by Mr Gianfranco Fini - this has proved reason enough to begin manoeuvring themselves for Mr Berlusconi's departure as prime minister. If he were to go, they calculate that Forza Italia would collapse as it has no rationale other than to back the prime minister. Mr Fini is making himself more attractive by pushing the uglier elements in his movement to one side. Simultaneously he is wooing, with considerable success, Forza Italia support in southern Italy. However, he is unlikely to do anything to prejudice the existence of the government as long as Mr Berlusconi stays. Mr Bossi, on the other hand, has always been uncomfortable in the coalition and will pull out whenever it suits him. He is already emphasising the League's separate identity, and testing new alliances in the centre and on the left. The opposition has not really shown its hand. The main group, the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), is still adjusting to the new leadership of Mr Massimo D'Alema after the angry resignation of Mr Achille Occhetto in the wake of its defeat in the March general elections. But, tactically, the PDS wants to see the Berlusconi government thoroughly discredited so as to avoid the reshaping or enlargement of the rightwing coalition. The party is against early elections, preferring to wait for a further refinement of the 1993 electoral laws that introduced the first-past-the-post system - a view shared by all the political parties. The need to change the electoral law also limits Mr Berlusconi's ability to go to the country with a snap election. The situation is thus profoundly unstable and uncertain. If Mr Berlusconi now faces a limited tenure, he has no one but himself to blame. He has squandered a huge groundswell of popular support, alienated sympathetic investors and, if he is not careful, could damage Italy's economic recovery, which looks stronger every day.</p>

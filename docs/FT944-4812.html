			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Taiwan opposition faces 'fit to rule' challenge Taiwan's leading opposition, the Democratic Progressive party (DPP), faces the formidable challenge of proving to voters it is fit to lead the country when its testing ground is a city which verges on being ungovernable. The eight-year-old party is renowned as much for sparking parliamentary brawls as for generating good ideas later co-opted by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT). Now it must make a swift transition from the enfant terrible of Taiwan politics into an organisation capable of managing the chaotic capital Taipei. Later this month Mr Chen Shui-bian, a DPP legislator, will take up the post of Taipei mayor after winning elections last weekend against the ruling party incumbent candidate for the post which previously had been an appointment. He will command a municipal budget of TDollars 130bn (Pounds 3.2bn) in the current fiscal year for the city of 2.7m residents. This will be the most important administrative position the DPP has held since political reforms and regular elections began in the late 1980s. Its performance running the island's biggest city will be critical to gaining voters' confidence before the first-ever direct presidential elections slated for early 1996. Taipei's woes are legion and stem mostly from a combination of poor planning and rapid economic growth. The KMT, which has ruled the island since 1949, has historically been loth to invest in non-productive services and infrastructure, hoping instead to realise the long-cherished dream of reconquering mainland China. Open drains flow by dilapidated, or nonexistent, sidewalks on streets where garbage piles mount, stray dogs roam and double-parking is the norm rather than the exception. The capital's traffic bottlenecks and air pollution problems are legendary, parks are few and real estate is overpriced. Traffic regulations are observed largely in the breach and loosely enforced by a seemingly demoralised police force. Mr Chen, a Taiwan-trained lawyer, built a fearsome reputation ferreting out military and official corruption in the Kuomintang government. But he will have to show that he is more than just a crack investigator and smooth talker once he finds himself at the receiving end rather than on the attack. Mr Chen faces the urgent task of revitalising city services and restoring morale among government employees and residents. Not least of Mr Chen's challenges will be to sort out the city's unfinished accident-prone, corruption-plagued urban mass transit system. He got a taste of what is to come yesterday when a carriage derailed during a test run. Experts dismissed the mishap as minor but it topped the evening new programmes and fuelled public fears about the system's safety. The traffic-clogged capital's mass transit system was originally scheduled to start running in August 1991 at a budget of TDollars 250bn. Costs have ballooned to TDollars 444bn and after a succession of delays the first line has yet to open. Believed to be the world's most expensive per kilometre, the system has attracted widespread allegations of corruption. The first chief of the department overseeing construction, Mr Chi Pao-cheng, was impeached, and the second, Mr Lai Shih-sheng, faces corruption-related charges. His case is pending. France's Matra Transport, the general contractor on one of the system's main lines, is embroiled in a contract dispute with the department over damages claims because of construction delays. The mayor-elect has promised to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the system. Mr Chen will have a grace period during which he can blame his predecessor when things go wrong. But eventually Taipei residents will want to see progress on his pledges to improve the quality of life, break the 'hung pao' culture - the practice of giving red envelopes, or bribes - in city government, and curb gangster-related violence.</p>

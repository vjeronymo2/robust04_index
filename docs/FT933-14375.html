			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Procter move hits Unilever REPORTS OF an aggressive pricing campaign by Procter and Gamble, the US household chemicals group, hurt Unilever and the shares tumbled 25 to 977p in hefty turnover of 4.7m. It was the stock's lowest level since mid-September last year. Analysts said the reports emanating from the US suggested that P &amp; G, which had mounted a vociferous promotion strategy on its detergents, had now decided to extend the campaign in North America and incorporate other products in its detergents range. With margins already squeezed in the detergents business, the P &amp; G move is seen as an escalation of an already difficult situation.</p>

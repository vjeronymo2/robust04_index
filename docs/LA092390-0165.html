			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> BEWARE TIMIDITY IN THE ENDGAME;  </P> <P> IT IS LIGHTLY STATED THAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE ISOLATED IN A MILITARY  CRUNCH. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS.  </P> <P> From the initial deployment of U.S. forces to the skillful weaving of  international support, the Bush Administration's management of the Persian Gulf  crisis has been flawless. But foreign policy is remembered for its endgames.  </P> <P> For economic and political reasons, I doubt a stalemate can be sustained,  either by our associates or by the United States. The rise in oil prices has  already reduced growth projections in the industrial democracies by 1% and  greatly increased the danger of inflation. No one can know at what oil price  support for sanctions would erode. But it would be reckless to ignore the  prospect.  </P> <P> On the political front, a prolonged stalemate is likely to undermine the  domestic stability of our Arab associates. Large numbers of foreign forces on  Saudi soil -- however well-meaning -- must be grating to a population carefully  shielded heretofore from contact with the outside world. Radical propaganda  labeling foreigners as occupiers will become increasingly plausible. Harassment  and sabotage will increase.  </P> <P> The same factor that led to the rapid U.S. deployment -- the need to sustain  moderate governments in the gulf -- makes it imperative to create the right  conditions for an equally rapid withdrawal.  </P> <P> The key decision before the Administration is thus to define what constitutes a  tolerable outcome. But this is muddled in the current debate, which treats  diplomacy as a self-contained exercise equated with compromise and with saving  the other side's face. These slogans, drawn from the experience of a society  that has rarely known irreconcilable differences, are irrelevant to Saddam  Hussein's Iraq.  </P> <P> Iraq's use of hostages, for example, is without precedent. When hostages were  first taken two decades ago, the culprits were outlaw groups unavowed even by  governments that encouraged them. Terrorism then evolved into tacit government  support targeted mostly on government personnel. Hussein has now escalated it  to a head of state taking action against thousands of innocent civilians from  all over the world.  </P> <P> In these circumstances, saving Iraq's face is the exact opposite of what is  needed. For it would enable Hussein to claim some gain from his aggression,  while the goal of gulf strategy must be to demonstrate its failure.  </P> <P> The test of that demonstration will be how the outcome is perceived by actual  or potential victims. Early on, there was some argument over whether U.S. vital  interests justified the deployment in the gulf. That debate has since been  overtaken by the scale of our deployment and the number of countries that have  followed U.S. leadership.  </P> <P> This international support can only be due to two factors: The other nations  either agree with the United States about the need to stop Iraqi aggression; or  they consider whatever reservations they have outweighed by their need for  America's long-term support. The perception of U.S. failure would therefore  shake international stability. Every moderate country in the Middle East would  be gravely weakened. Egypt, Morocco and even Turkey would face a tide of  radicalism and fundamentalism.  </P> <P> President Bush is right in insisting that no compromise of the U.N. resolutions  -- Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait, the unconditional release of  all hostages and the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate government -- is  possible. Any modification would amount to an Iraqi gain and a defeat for the  United States and its associates.  </P> <P> It is important to keep this in mind in view of the facile argument that the  United States must not run risks on behalf of the emir of Kuwait. By insisting  on a restoration of pre-invasion conditions, neither the United Nations nor the  United States is passing judgment on the emir's qualities. They are asserting  that the most repressive regime in the region does not have the right to sit in  judgment over the domestic legitimacy of its neighbors. Of course, these  traditional governments will, in time, change. But their evolution should be  guided by their own dynamics.  </P> <P> The U.N. terms, in one respect, already represent a compromise with what is  needed for peace and with what is compatible with the massive international  deployment. Were Hussein suddenly to accept them, he would preserve the essence  of his power, although it would represent a huge loss of prestige for him. It  might even bring home the need for a more moderate Iraqi leadership --  especially if Hussein were replaced as a consequence.  </P> <P> But this could easily turn out to be wishful thinking. The strategic  relationship that encouraged Iraqi aggression would remain. Iraq would retain  its chemical and nuclear capabilities. Iraq's large standing army would  preserve its capacity to overwhelm the area. Reducing Iraq's disproportionate  military capacity is especially important if U.S. forces are to be withdrawn  rapidly, as I believe they should be.  </P> <P> To think that the area can be protected by multilateral security treaties is a  fantasy. The experience of the defunct Baghdad pact and of the Southeast Asian  Treaty Organization shows the fragility of multilateral arrangements in regions  where the nations involved have no coherent objectives or means of mutual  support and frequently shift allegiances.  </P> <P> Paradoxically, it would be undesirable to reduce Iraq's armed forces below what  is needed to maintain equilibrium with its neighbors, especially in light of  their demonstrably low threshold of resistance to the temptations of a military  vacuum. The democracies' support for Iraq during the war with Iran was a  reflection of their commitment to Iraq's territorial integrity. What they are  resisting now is having their economies and their peace held at ransom by a  megalomaniacal ruler.  </P> <P> For all these reasons, I would feel more comfortable if the United States  sought to strengthen the U.N. resolutions by insisting on internationally  monitored reductions of Iraq's military capabilities. But were Hussein to yield  to sanctions without war, Bush might well decide that he could not go beyond  the existing U.N. resolutions, without which the sanctions would never have  been implemented. Such an outcome would be as understandable as it would be  precarious. It must be entered into -- if at all -- with the knowledge that it  would require a much higher degree of continued vigilance and a larger U.S.  presence in the area than is desirable. If a military clash occurs, the United  States should seek an outcome more consistent with long-term stability.  </P> <P> The Administration must therefore decide how long it is prepared to wait for  sanctions to work and how far it is prepared to go without unanimous  international support. I do not know whether the decision must be made in  October or November. I would be very uneasy were it to be delayed into the new  year, for I believe the entire enterprise might then begin to unravel.  </P> <P> It is lightly stated that the United States would be isolated in a military  crunch. I do not believe this. The moderate Arab states would welcome a  decisive U.S. move if it were demonstrably the only alternative to Hussein's  succeeding. As for our allies, conditions are unusually favorable for a U.S.  initiative. In short, the United States is not likely to find itself isolated  were it to decide, after an appropriate testing period, that sanctions are not  working; indeed, the most likely road to isolation is by way of a protracted  crisis.  </P> <P> In the flush of rediscovered multilateralism, the United States must not  subordinate all long-range policy to the heady glow of internationalism or to  the tactics of the moment. Even though I have consistently urged the inclusion  of Syria in the Middle East peace process, I cannot repress my uneasiness at  the eagerness with which the United States welcomed the movement of a Syrian  armored division to Saudi Arabia. Do we know how to make it leave?  </P> <P> In overcoming the current crisis, the United States must not emerge as the  permanent defender of every status quo. But the path to peace and progress  resides in success in the gulf. Afterward, the United States, together with its  Arab partners, can demonstrate the benefits of cooperative action in promoting  the well-being of the Arab peoples. Also, it should energetically seek to make  progress toward a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, especially now that  looming disaster might have brought all sides second thoughts about the nature  of a peace and suitable participants in peace negotiations.  </P> <P> Sometimes platitudes turn out to be true. This is the test of the post-Cold War  era. It remains for the Administration to reap the benefits of its courageous  efforts.  </P></p>

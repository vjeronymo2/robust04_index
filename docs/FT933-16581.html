			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: BMW moves into aluminium components BMW of Germany yesterday became the latest important producer to reveal a special interest in developing aluminium car components by signing a co-operation agreement with Norway's Hydro Aluminium. The deal may even involve the production of complete 'space frames', skeleton-like frames to which body panels can be fixed. The two companies said they had been working together for several years to increase the use of aluminium in car structures, and they had now formalised the arrangement. Car companies are being driven to use much more aluminium to reduce the weight of cars so that they can meet increasingly stringent fuel economy and pollution regulations. BMW's move comes a few months before the launch by its rival, Audi, part of the Volkswagen group, of an 'aluminium-intensive,' top-of-the-range, V8 model, developed with Alcoa of the US, the world's biggest aluminium group. However, BMW said it had no plans for volume production of an entire aluminium car like Audi's. BMW's M-Technik offshoot is using an aluminium space frame in its prototype E1 electric vehicle for California. At the Geneva Motor Show recently, the group presented the Z13 concept 'city car', which has an aluminium frame, recycled plastic panels, and a motor-cycle engine. Hydro is part of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest industrial group and 51 per cent owned by the state. It is quoted on several stock exchanges. It is the world's biggest producer of aluminium extrusions, and this year started supplying space frames from a Michigan factory for General Motors' new Corvette sports car. It has also been co-operating on car space-frame concepts since the mid-1980s with various groups, including Renault in France, Porsche in Germany and Pininfarina in Italy.</p>

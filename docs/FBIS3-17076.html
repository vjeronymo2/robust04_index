			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>   [Text] Riga, 23 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Latvian Prime Minister  Valdis Birkavs categorically rejected accusations by the  opposition that the delegation to the talks with Russia, which  initialled a package of agreements on the withdrawal of Russian  troops a week ago, betrayed the interests of the state. "Only  the enemies of Latvia will benefit if these documents are not  signed," he told journalists.    The meeting with the press took place Tuesday evening after  the Cabinet meeting at which the accords reached with Russia  were discussed. It is expected that the government will  officially announce its support for them next week. Then the  presidents and parliaments of the two countries will express  their attitude to them.    Valdis Birkavs emphasized that international public opinion  approves the agreements reached with Russia. The prime minister  also expressed confidence that many countries will be able to  help Latvia with the means for dismantling the Russian radar  station at Skrunda and also for improving the health of the  residents of that settlement.</p>

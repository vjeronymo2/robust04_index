			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Friday [18 February] that Japan will do whatever  it can to rectify its huge trade imbalance with the United  States.    It is natural that both Japan and the U.S. should make  efforts but Japan has to make its own efforts on both  macroeconomic and microeconomic problems in view of the fact  that this country plays a large role in leading the world  economy, Hosokawa said during a session of the House of  Representatives' budget committee.    The powerful lower house started deliberation on a third  supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 which calls for a spending  increase of 2,185.2 billion yen over the second revised budget,  to cover the largest-ever economic stimulus package of 15.25  trillion yen, and an increase of the overall general account  budget for the current year ending in March to 77,437.50 billion  yen.    Commenting on last week's breakdown in the Japan-U.S.  "Framework trade" talks in Washington, Hosokawa said that it was  regrettable the two countries could not reach an accord, but  that both sides agreed not to let the issue disrupt friendly  relations between Japan and the U.S.    Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to agree on  trade negotiations aimed at reducing Japan's bloated trade  surplus and opening its markets to U.S. firms.    "Japan must tackle what it can voluntarily...such as making  procedures transparent for insurance and government procurement,  promoting cooperation between the two countries' auto  industries, deregulating the economy, accelerating imports and  investments, and securing competition," Hosokawa said.    He made the remarks in response to questions by Shigeru  Goto,  a lower house legislator of the Social Democratic Party (SDP),  the leading bloc of the seven-party ruling coalition.    The prime minister expressed his hope that the U.S. would  act  with sensible judgment, referring to recent U.S. moves toward  retaliatory measures against Japan following the failure of the  framework talks.    On U.S. criticism that "bureaucrats" have led the  negotiations on Japan's side, Hosokawa denied the charge, saying  that though the officials of each ministry made considerable  effort to protect national interests, neither the politicians  nor the bureaucrats can accept the U.S. "stance against economic  deregulation."</p>

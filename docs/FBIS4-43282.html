			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by President Suleyman Demirel: "Security </F> Relations in the New World Order"]    [Text] The events that dramatized the end of the Cold War  were both welcomed and unprepared for. They generated a tidal  wave of optimism about the future of international relations.  Fervent talk about a rapidly changing world was the order of  the day when we entered the present decade. However, little was  done to determine and shape the dynamics and scope of the  change. It was, more or less, taken for granted that it would  turn out to be for the better. This did not prove to be the case.    Accordingly, the creation of a new and desirable  international system continues to top the political agenda as  the most challenging task of our times.    The erosion by armed conflicts at the regional level of the  global security edifice, is the most urgent threat which we have  to confront and to overcome. For, without mutually reinforcing  regional orders of peace and stability, we cannot put together  the building-blocks of collective security on the world scale.    Europe's new security framework has to be conceived under an  umbrella of a strengthened world organization. The interlocking  institutions making up Europe's post-Cold War security  architecture have, to date, achieved no apparent success.    However, it would be unfair to blame the conceptual  blueprint  for their failure. Without an adequate supply of fuel in terms  of political will on the part of its members, no organization  can make substantial headway towards realizing its aims. Had  the requisite political will not been in short supply, these  institutions could have done a lot within the scope of the  mandates provided to them by the CSCE and the UN on several  instances during the recent years in connection with some of the  ongoing crises.    Recent events and developments prove that little can be done  to prevent a further deterioration of the security situation in  the Euro-Atlantic area if the full weight of NATO's capability  and assets are not brought to bear on conflict-prevention,  effective crisis-management and peacemaking.    NATO's role should not be confined to declaring readiness  for  support to peacekeeping. NATO should act in the name of the  international community, when mandated by the UN or the CSCE,  for repelling aggression and rolling back the territorial and  other consequences alone or in coalition with extra-alliance  countries or organizations. Moreover, NATO should take the lead  in negotiating and "extracting" the mandates required to execute  such functions. The surest way to conflict-prevention is for the  international community to be able to suppress adventurism  before it widens.    We think that the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC)  may serve as a vehicle for promoting a new cooperative order  among its participating states by dealing with specific issues  as outlined in its work plan.    Turkey's approach to security rests on the principle of its  indivisibility. In this respect, we consider the formula  "Partnership for Peace" as feasible and relevant to the present  transitional period. Under this formula, the cooperation and  relationship encompassing all the European, Caucasian and  Central Asian states will certainly be enhanced. Such an  arrangement holds more far reaching opportunities than the NACC.    While NATO remains vital for European security, the CSCE, as  a complementary organization, will share the role of improving  and maintaining stability on the continent. The CSCE will  continue, as a larger frame, to play a major role in the future  architecture of Europe together with other international  organizations such as NATO, NACC, the European Union, the  Council of Europe and the Western European Union.    A European society rooted in a pluralistic democratic system  of governments that unites our peoples through common ideals and  principles should be the goal to achieve.    The challenge of further spreading and consolidating  democracy, making sure that the contemporary norms of  international behavior are respected, and, to that end, the  adaptation of the global and regional organizations to the needs  of our times, top our list of priorities.    We have witnessed how fragile the sense of freedom which  comes from throwing off totalitarian rule has turned out to be.  It is now once again admitted that building democracy is a  difficult task. We should all engage ourselves more tangibly  and generously in the efforts of the post-communist countries  aimed at transforming themselves into genuine democracies.    In order that the top priority of propagating democracy may  be achieved, a series of challenges have to be grappled with  simultaneously. In this context, I should also mention the need  to strengthen preventive diplomacy, to curb excessive arms  transfers, to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction, to combat terrorism more effectively.    The North Atlantic alliance has been in the forefront in  adapting itself to the post-Cold War environment. In fact, this  process of rapid adaptation started following the sweeping  changes during 1988 in the CSCE countries.    NATO took on board bold and far reaching decisions at its  Copenhagen and London meetings with a view to responding  adequately to the challenges.    The search for a new role and for joining arms with our  former adversaries took a distinctive shape at the NATO summit  held in Rome in November 1991 with the adoption of the  alliance's new strategic concept.    The creation of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council  (NACC)  at the first NACC ministerial in December 1991 coincided with  the demise of the Soviet Union and with the appearance of new  partners on the international scene.    These new partners gained their long sought but hardly  expected independence and sovereignty in a very short span of  time. The North Atlantic alliance and individual allies tried  their best in helping our new partners to overcome the difficult  period of transition and state building. Both the expertise of  each allied country as well as financial resources have been  made available to our partners. NACC has been instrumental in  this process. It not only provided them with a forum for  intense consultation on security related issues and for solving  potential crises but also devised tangible programs for  cooperation on key topics.    NACC work programs developed with the participation of all  partners have made substantial contributions by addressing  important specific needs of our partners like defense  conversion, peacekeeping, crisis management, information  exchange and access to NATO science programs.    The alliance at its last Brussels Summit adopted the  Partnership for Peace (PFP) concept and invited all NACC  partners as well as other CSCE countries willing and able to  contribute to the program to join it in a new and qualitatively  enhanced form of partnership.    Up to date, 20 countries signed the PFP framework document  and displayed in unequivocal terms their determination to  benefit from this new form of partnership and cooperation.  Others are expected to join in the coming weeks.    PFP with its non-discriminatory approach to all potential  partners, yet providing room for self-differentiation, is  suitable for all. Furthermore, presentation documents to be  presented by partners and individual partnership documents to be  prepared jointly by the partner concerned and the alliance make  this new program flexible enough to meet the specific needs and  capabilities of each partner.    This basic feature of the PFP should be preserved and no  special status or privileged position should be accorded at the  outset to any prospective partner. The pace and intensity of  the cooperation with each partner within the framework of the  PFP will largely depend on the capability and willingness of the  partner concerned. Thus the relations between each partner and  the alliance will undoubtedly have specific features.    In this era of interlocking institutions it will be futile  to try to evaluate contributions of several European and  Transatlantic institutions. Each played its fair share in the  post-Cold War configuration. The European Union, the EU and the  CSCE made substantial contributions. Nonetheless, one can  easily assert that NATO, with its unique capabilities and its  integrated structure, has been on the forefront in extending its  hand of friendship to our partners. It has also been first to  set up new mechanisms geared towards enhanced cooperation like  the NACC and the PFP.    Times of change are fraught with new challenges and  uncertainties.    The world order as defined by the parameters of the Cold War  has disappeared. The international community is faced with a  new type of security challenge as witnessed in the former  Yugoslavia and the Caucasus.    Ethnic tensions and long suppressed animosities resurfaced.    It is very difficult, if not impossible to argue that the  international community and its institutions, be it the UN, NATO  or the European Union, have shown the necessary resolve and  determination in the face of these new challenges in Bosnia and  Herzegovina and Azerbaijan.    In both cases the international community has let the  aggressors go unpunished and capitalize on their gains, achieved  through invasion, murders, rape, "ethnic cleansing."    When use of force was necessary, the international community  shied away from employing it until when it was too late. Thus  the credibility of all international organizations from the UN  to NATO to CSCE has been enormously eroded.    Potential aggressors drew their lessons. They now believe  that "aggression pays" They have seen that the international  community can enter into futile debate and sit back and let the  territorial integrity and even the sovereignty of its fellow  members like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Azerbaijan be trampled  upon.    The stakes in Bosnia are much higher than those related to  the survival of the Bosnian state and its people. They include  the validity of our hope to do away with ethnic and religious  warfare in the future. The betrayal of Bosnia as a  multi-cultural, multi-ethnic state invalidates this hope, and  with it the fundamental principal of the Western institutions.  If we allow aggression and adventurism to get away with the  crimes they have committed in Bosnia, the post-Cold War disorder  may worsen. Should Bosnia fail, not only the Balkans, but the  whole of Europe will bear the bitter aftereffects.    Another destabilizing development is the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.    Huge amounts of conventional arms deliveries to some  specific  areas and countries is yet another source of instability, at  least for their neighbors. Nevertheless, the interdependent  world we live in does not permit us the luxury of closing our  doors to the outside world and living peacefully in our affluent  societies. Any crisis is bound to affect us eventually.    Turkey, located in an unstable region, feels this threat  perhaps more imminently than others.    Finally, the ever-increasing gap between the South and North  is another potential source of instability, the effects of which  are being felt by mass migration and by the problems inherent in  it.    If the international community has the political will and  acts accordingly, these negative trends could be reversed in  medium to long term. However, we should shed away the present  inertia and refrain from putting undue emphasis on petty  internal bickering.    A European security architecture is beginning to emerge. It  should be based on the long cherished principle of interlocking  institutions in which all actors will have important roles.  Nonetheless, the international community needs to be more aware  than it is today of the problems of peace and security in a  turbulent world. It needs the political will to confront the  dangers and the determination to acquire the necessary  institutional and financial resources, or to put into use the  existing unique capabilities of the North Atlantic alliance. It  goes without saying that NATO will need a clear mandate from the  UN and/or the CSCE for non-article "V" contingencies.    Partnership and cooperation between all security related  institutions are vital to safeguard common interests.    Tolerance, cooperation, solidarity, non-discrimination and  an  equitable sharing of responsibilities and burdens must be the  cornerstones of a system based an the principles of the UN  charter and the Helsinki Final Act.    NATO is needed and able to address the new security  challenges.     -  It must provide security and stability in a  world that has become more unstable.    -  It must prevent, manage and  resolve crises and conflicts.    -  It must prevent Europe from  sliding back into renationalization and fragmentation and into  the destructive logic of alliances and counter-alliances.    -  It  must enhance its cooperation with its new partners.    -  It must keep  transatlantic relations working smoothly and effectively.    -  It  must ensure the effective implementation of existing arms  control agreements and the full compliance to their provisions  by all parties.     None of these challenges can be met without the alliance.    First, the transatlantic relationship is the most stable  geopolitical asset in the world. It brings together two  principal centers of democracy and liberalism. A more stable  world cannot be achieved without an alliance of these power  centers. Our partners turn to NATO because of their  appreciation that NATO and only NATO can provide the stability  they need.    Second, regarding the need for effective management of major  conflicts, diplomacy is deemed to fail if it is not backed by a  powerful politico-military instrument. Needless to say that  NATO needs the joint political will of its members to act.  However, once the political will is there, there is no other  effective instrument than NATO.    Third, one of the effective achievements of NATO has been to  put an end to the centuries-old habit of European power politics  by providing an Atlantic framework. By contrast, the  dissolution of the alliance and the disengagement of the United  States could undermine the European integration process. This  would be damaging not only for the allies on both sides of the  Atlantic, but would also gravely affect the political and  economic transition of partner countries.    Fourth, NATO provides the key forum for coordinating and  harmonizing transatlantic policies in the broadest sense. This  role should be maintained and enhanced.    Finally, NATO is the only mechanism to deal with new  challenges, as these challenges exceed the capabilities of any  single nation.</p>

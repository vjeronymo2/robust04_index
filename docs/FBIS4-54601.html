			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 2 May (MTI) -- Voters are mainly  concerned about issues related to the economy, and about the  chances and avenues for economic growth, for the creation of  welfare security. This was the almost unanimous statement made  by the leaders of the six parliamentary parties' lists, who  attended a forum on Monday evening in Budapest's University of  Economics.    The forum was the closing event of a lecture series entitled  "Elections 1994". The Hungarian Democratic Forum (HDF) was  represented by Prime Minister Peter Boross, the Hungarian  Socialist Party (HSP) by Gyula Horn, the Alliance of Free  Democrats (AFD) by Gabor Kuncze, the Federation of Young  Democrats (FYD) by Viktor Orban, the Christian Democratic  People's Party (CDPP) by Laszlo Surjan, the Unified  Smallholders' Party by Janos Szabo.    The central theme of the forum was the stake of the May  parliamentary elections, the possible outcome, and the tasks  facing the next government. Citing the experiences of their  campaign tours, the views of the party list leaders were divided  as regards the outcome of the elections.    Boross and Surjan were of the opinion that the voters do not  want a radical political turn and change in direction. Although  the two politicians acknowledged that many people presumably  have still not decided who they would vote for, they stressed  they believe the majority is for continuing on the road begun in  the past four years, albeit with certain corrections.    As against this, Orban used the term "semi-turn", which is  also formulated in the FYD's manifesto, to characterize the  political direction desired for the future. He said people do  not want to turn back the change in system, the process of  changing the system, but they definitely want a change in  government.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radar" column by Ancelmo Gois] </F>   [Text] The Navy's nuclear program will double its  processing capacity by the end of the year. The Aramar Center in  Sao Paulo will add 900 centrifuges in addition to the 600  already available for enriching 400 kg of uranium a year. The  Aramar Center will be inspected by international organizations  to verify if the energy being produced is for peaceful purposes.  This will bring an end to the suspicion that the program seeks  to make an atomic bomb.</p>

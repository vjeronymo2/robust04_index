			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sharelink price drops after warning on interim losses Shares in Sharelink Investment Services, the telephone based stockbroker floated last July, fell by more than 38 per cent yesterday after the company warned of losses at the interim stage. Shares in the Birmingham-based company fell by 51p to close at 187p after Sharelink announced it expected pre-tax losses of about Pounds 500,000 for the six months to September 30. Mr David Jones, chief executive, said low market volumes had caused Sharelink to trade 'at below break even' in the first four months although trading had improved in August. Sharelink warned in January that earnings could suffer if the decline in UK equity market trading volumes persisted. Mr Jones also pointed to expenditure of Pounds 700,000 on development projects, such as the MarketMaster service launched yesterday, which would benefit Sharelink's product profile by. Total investment in the first six months reached Pounds 1.25m. Even with depressed volumes, operating profits were expected to be about Pounds 200,000 at the interim stage, Mr Jones said. In its first figures after coming to the market, Sharelink announced interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.68m (Pounds 785,000), inflated by Pounds 1.47m from handling part of the government sale of BT shares. Mr Jones said yesterday that the board remained positive about prospects for the full year, as revenues in the second half were traditionally stronger than in the first. The company intended to maintain an interim dividend of 3p and, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, to recommend an unchanged final of 6p.</p>

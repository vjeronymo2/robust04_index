The press service of the Popular Rukh movement reported to  Interfax-Ukraine agency that Chernovil declared that "Ukrainian  president had already enough authorities in 1992 but he has not  issued any decree which would stimulate reforms." At the same  time he underlined that "Kravchuk has appointed a great number  of former communist party functionaries as his envoys in the  regions, handed over tactical nuclear weapons to Russia, and  made one concession after another regarding Crimea and the Black  Sea Fleet."    Chernovil is convinced that in case additional authorities  are granted to the Ukrainian president "a quiet dictatorship of  oligarchy will be established in Ukraine."    On Friday evening Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk voiced  a statement in which he expressed his intention to address  Ukraine's Supreme Soviet with a request to grant him additional  legislative authorities in case not more than two thirds of  deputies are elected to the parliament. As many as 450 deputies  must be elected during the elections to Ukraine's Supreme Soviet  scheduled for March 27.</p>

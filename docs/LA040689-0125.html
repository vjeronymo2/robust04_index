			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ANIMALS SUFFER IN BULLFIGHTS'  </P> <P> Retired bullfighter Patricia McCormick claims to love horses (Times, March 26),  yet these animals suffer terribly in bullfights . . . when the tormented bull  charges them. Heavy padding soaks up the blood; it does not prevent injury to  the horses.  </P> <P> It is always amazing to hear people justify how they can "love" animals or be  "horrified" by the clubbing of baby seals while defending other brutality.  Bulls are not the vicious animals she suggests. In the ring they are confused  and usually standing still..  </P> <P> Running a story about McCormick on Easter was crass. Calling someone who took  part in this barbaric ritual a "lady" is stretching it a tad, don't you think?  </P> <P> BEE SIMPSON  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

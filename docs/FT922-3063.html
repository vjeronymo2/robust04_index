			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa in talks with Aeroflot on Moscow plan LUFTHANSA, the German national carrier, is in advanced negotiations with Aeroflot, the Russian airline, to form a new joint airline venture based in Moscow in competition with a rival Russian project being set up by British Airways. Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chairman, yesterday confirmed at a Financial Times aviation conference that his airline was holding 'intensive talks' with Aeroflot and was hoping to reach an agreement 'in the next few months'. Apart from Aeroflot, Lufthansa is looking for other partners in the Commonwealth of Independent States to participate in the venture. The project would revive an historic joint airline venture between Germany and Russia called Deruluft which operated air services between Berlin and Moscow in the 1920s. The new airline would be based at Moscow's Sheremetyevo 1 airport where Lufthansa is leading a consortium involved in a Dollars 800m modernisation programme. The plans envisage initially the new airline will operate international services from Moscow using western aircraft and eventually shuttle services in the CIS. However, Mr Weber warned there were still difficult issues to resolve to enable the venture to go ahead, especially in view of the economic and political problems Russia is facing. The new venture would be in competition with BA's plans to set up a new international airline based in Moscow called Air Russia with Russian partners. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, told the FT conference he expected Air Russia to start operations in 1994 or possibly even earlier, also using western aircraft. Lufthansa and BA are currently involved in a fierce battle on the German market and their respective Russian ventures are likely to intensify competition between the two carriers. Since German unification, Lufthansa has re-established itself in a big way in Berlin and has expanded in eastern European markets. Mr Weber said the airline was the leader in eastern Europe. Apart from the proposed new Russian-German joint airline venture, Lufthansa is involved in hotel projects in Moscow and provides training for Russian airline crew.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (13): Signs of an upturn detected - Charter sector Britain's air charter business, battered and bruised by the recession, has emerged a fitter sector after months of falling demand and increasingly cut-throat competition. The cost has been high: the business is littered with the wreckage of charter companies that failed to generate enough income from hiring-out aircraft to cover growing maintenance and operating costs. But those who survived are beginning to see signs of an upturn as fresh demand begins to percolate through the market. The new business is not the result of cash-strapped companies deciding they can afford to charter again. It reflects moves by companies which once owned aircraft to dispose of their fast-depreciating assets and hire private jets instead. BP and Smith Kline Beecham are among companies that have recently sold corporate aircraft. They have opted to charter aircraft rather than pay several thousand pounds a year to keep in a hangar aircraft they used only occasionally. BP, which until last year owned three jets worth more than Pounds 40m, said: 'We got rid of the jets and are using charters where necessary. We decided we could not justify having our own fleet; they were just too expensive and it was not economic.' All this is good news for companies with aircraft of the range and speed to meet the long-haul requirements of multinational companies. According to Air London International, UK-based brokers for executive aircraft, there is steady demand for jets capable of intercontinental flights. It predicts growth this year of 15 per cent. Mr David Savile, Air London's operations director, foresees particular growth in executive trips to the CIS, where Aeroflot's erratic timetable does not lend itself to the itineraries of businessmen hoping to invest in the former Soviet Union. 'It's an operator's dream because there's no practical alternative. No-one would opt for an internal flight with Aeroflot,' he says. 'We're seeing substantial growth in that market. Three years ago the only place we could fly to was Moscow but now we can go almost anywhere.' His assessment is echoed at Air Hanson, the subsidiary of the UK conglomerate, which has seen increased demand in the former communist bloc. Ms Brenda McCune, operations manager at Air Hanson, says: 'There is a definite upturn in fixed wing activity into eastern Europe, largely as the result of more airfields becoming accessible.' Although demand is picking up for charters to outlying destinations such as Tbilisi or Tashkent, the trickle-down effect from big companies selling aircraft and entering the charter market has not yet reached the smaller operators. Such operators are dependent on medium-size companies which in the past chartered private aircraft but are now booking senior managers on commercial flights. This cost-cutting has had a direct knock-on effect on air charter companies operating short-range turboprops. These operators, often the first call for companies seeking an alternative to airlines, have seen profit margins squeezed and business dry up. Several small operators, such as Rogers Aviation at Luton and Skyline Aviation at Southend, have not survived. Others are diversifying into maintenance and aircraft sales to stay in business. One of the survivors, RM Aviation, has concentrated on other sources of income, such as developing aircraft equipment and in-flight computer software, to offset the charter downturn. Mr Peter Roberts, RM's managing director at Leavesden Airport, north of London, admits: 'We haven't had an easy time and I wouldn't be surprised if more companies folded. 'Unless you diversify in this business you are very vulnerable. Companies that are just into chartering could suffer badly because there's a price war looming, with some operators flying aircraft at below cost just to get the business.' Among its five aircraft, RM operates a turboprop owned by Rothmans International which it also charters to Whitbreads, the brewers, and Argyll Group. The company is benefiting from a new market trend imported from the US. This involves a company which owns its own aircraft giving a charter operator a management contract and permission to dry lease it to other users. RM Aviation operates an aircraft owned by Rothmans International, the tobacco company, which it also charters to Whitbreads and Argyll. In the US the system, pioneered by Ohio-based Executive Jet Aviation, is seen as the next development in air charters. Under the scheme, the charter company buys an aircraft and then sells a share to one of its clients. Executive Jet, for example, will sell a 12.5 per cent share in a Cessna Citation for Dollars 315,000. The client is guaranteed access to any of the jets managed by the company without incurring crew or maintenance costs. Since 1988, more than 50 companies have joined the so-called Netjets programme, generating Dollars 25m dollars in revenue. Few British charter companies, however, are thought to have the financial muscle required to start such a scheme. And Mr Savile at Air London warns that until there is a sustained recovery most operators will continue to struggle. 'Margins are very tight and prices have not increased at all,' he adds. The pressure on operators has been further increased by the lack of landing and take-off slots at Britain's most popular hubs: London Heathrow and Gatwick. This has prompted operators to move their business aviation facilities to alternative sites such as Stansted and the City Airport in London's Docklands. More than 50 executive aircraft are now based at Stansted, where Esso has redeveloped the old passenger terminal as a business aviation centre. But the recession has led to a 5 per cent decline in executive charter passengers at Stansted, while expansion at London City remains restricted by limitations on night flying and aircraft movements. The growing number of airports offering business aviation facilities - in a sector where operators are chasing demand and fuel prices are falling - means the executive charter business has become a buyers' market. Clients can pick and choose from a glut of available aircraft which operators are anxious to get in the air; some companies are offering attractive charter-lease schemes; and there are more take-off points and destinations. 'Operators will be under pressure to cut prices further and although the recession may be ending in the wider economy, it will take some time for this market to feel the benefit,' says Ms Ingrid von Hentschel industry analyst at Beeson Gregory. Ms von Hentschel, predicting only a small increase in demand at the top of the market, warns: 'The conditions remain for more companies to go out of business. The casualty list is going to be a long one.'</p>

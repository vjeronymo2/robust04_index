			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Major links Tory fortunes to faster economic growth: PM faces renewed leadership speculation Mr John Major last night staked his hopes for a revival in the fortunes of his embattled government on faster economic recovery. He strongly defended the tax increases at the centre of the latest political storm as 'the tough decisions today that will make everyone better off tomorrow'. But at the end of a week which has seen disgruntled Tory MPs again question his leadership, the prime minister faced fresh difficulties from Mr Norman Lamont. The former chancellor, who was sacked last year, is quoted today in The Times as describing the prime minister as 'weak and hopeless'. Downing Street was curtly dismissive of the reported attack, saying it was an attempt to 'rake over cold ashes', and in a statement last night Mr Lamont said the published interview did not reflect accurately his views or general attitude. The government's run of embarrassing mishaps was further compounded yesterday by a High Court ruling against attempts by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, to restructure local government. Mr Major was confronted also with growing speculation on the Conservative backbenches that some cabinet ministers have begun to position themselves for a possible leadership contest later this year. In his latest attempt to regain the political initiative, the prime minister made sustaining the pace of economic recovery his central objective for 1994. Sidestepping the furore over the moral aspects of his 'back to basics' initiative, he said the priority was 'getting back to the most basic basics of all: lower borrowing, lower unemployment, low inflation and more growth'. In a speech to businessmen at the Leeds Chamber of Commerce, Mr Major said maintaining growth depended on constant improvements in Britain's competitiveness. Both public and private sectors had to keep wage costs down, while the government's education policies were working towards 'nothing less than the re-skilling of Britain'. With senior ministers acknowledging that the government's fortunes were now linked with a visible acceleration in economic growth, Mr Major insisted: 'We now have the conditions for long-term sustainable growth.' He said Britain's 1.9 per cent inflation rate would probably rise slightly during the next few months but added: 'Low inflation is here to stay. So industry can now invest with confidence.' Referring to the impending tax increases in April, Mr Major said that he would have preferred not to have introduced them: 'It was necessary, because sound finances are the only basis for sustained economic growth.' Mr David Richardson, president of the Leeds chamber, attacked the government in front of Mr Major for 'ill thought-out' proposals on its services to industry and commerce. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, meanwhile led cabinet ministers in a series of speeches emphasising Britain was 'leading Europe out of recession'. He said the Tories would fight June's election to the European parliament on a platform of prosperity through improved competitiveness. The consensus among Tory backbenchers yesterday was that Mr Major could ride out the present storm. But ministers admitted privately that bad results in local and European elections could threaten his leadership.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] All Belgian citizens who wanted to leave Rwanda  have left that country. So the evacuation operation is over.  This morning the situation was very dangerous at Kigali  airport. Because of confrontations between the government army  and the rebels, foreign troops, too, were jeopardized. The  Rwandan army pounded the rebels with heavy artillery. A shell  fired by the rebels exploded at the airport. There were no  casulties.    The blue helmets have demanded that firing should cease and  have fired warning shots.    The withdrawal of the Belgian paras is meantime being  continued at a higher rate. [passage omitted]    But from Kigali we have received the report that the blue  helmets, too, have permission to leave as quickly as possible.  For the time being, the Defense Ministry in Brussels is unable  to confirm this.</p>

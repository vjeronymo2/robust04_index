			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Golden Vale warns on profits Golden Vale, the Irish dairy group, said yesterday that pre-tax profits for the year to December 31, 1994 would be 'significantly below current market expectations' and would 'show a reduction in the region of one-third from the published profit before tax for 1993'. Profits then totalled IPounds 19m, or Pounds 18.5m sterling. The announcement was made after the London market closed. The group explained to projected profits shortfall thus: 'This was due to paying a competitive price for milk which resulted in a misalignment with product market returns'. Further, there had been increased competitiveness in the consumer products area. Movements in commodity product markets had not yet fully been matched by a corresponding fall in the price of raw material.</p>

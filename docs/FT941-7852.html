			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Drugs policy 'watered down' The government's policy on illegal drugs was under attack yesterday after leaked papers showed it had altered a report calling for a coherent approach to drug misuse. Two versions of a report by the Department of Health show the original paper containing criticism of the government's failure to provide a co-ordinated drugs policy. In the final version the title have been changed, key texts calling for a new partnership to tackle the problem in local communities have been watered down, and some chapters have been omitted. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said: 'The first version of the report that has been with the Department of Health for over a year is strongly critical of government policy and urges precisely the type of new strategy to fight drug misuse that Labour proposes.' Mr Blair said: 'These two versions are drastically different with every sign that hard-hitting recommendations have been deliberately watered down.' The government yesterday said the report had been changed because the management consultants, Roger Howard Associates, who had been commissioned to write the report had gone 'well beyond their brief'. Labour is pushing for an amendment to the criminal justice bill to tackle the link between drug abuse and youth crime.</p>

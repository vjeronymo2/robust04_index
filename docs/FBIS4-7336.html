			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Rude and Inhumane Barbarous Act" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  carries a commentary hitting out at the South Korean authorities  for blocking the southern trip of a delegation of the North side  which had been invited to a memorial service on the one  hundredth day after the death of the Rev. Mun Ik-hwan.    Recalling that the Rev. Mun was a pioneer of the  reunification movement who fought till the last moments of his  life for the reunification of the country, the common cause of  the nation, and a highly reputed patriotic champion of  reunification widely known to the compatriots at home and  abroad, the analyst says:    The South Korean rulers had barred a mourners' group of the  North side from going to Seoul to express condolences at the  bier of the Rev. Mun in January and this time blocked the  southern trip of a delegation of the North side which was to  attend a memorial service on the one hundredth day since his  death. This is a very immoral and rude act.    The national funeral committee for the late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan  decided to hold the memorial service on the one hundredth day of  his death as a national function and invited compatriots in the  North and overseas. And the North side decided to send a  delegation out of the noble sense of obligation for the deceased  and his bereaved family and ardent desire for national unity.    Expressing condolences and honoring the memory of the  deceased is rather a humanitarian matter than a political matter.    Such anti-human group of traitors as the Kim Yong-sam group  which seeks confrontation and war in league with outside forces  while lowering a checkbar on the Southern trip of fellow  countrymen for mourning the deceased, must be removed from the  nation.</p>

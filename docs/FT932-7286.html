			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Education voucher scheme proposed THE GOVERNMENT may introduce a common credit for the education and training of 16 to 19-year-olds, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, hinted yesterday. She told senior managers the move would be a 'step we might consider in opening up a real market in training and education.' The government is understood to be considering publishing a white paper on the issue. The option of a common system of funding for academic, vocational and job specific training, first proposed by the Confederation of British Industry, was endorsed in a ministerial review of the education and training of 16 to 19-year-olds conducted by the education and employment departments. The CBI has developed its idea into what it calls Careership, under which all 16-year-olds would receive a voucher or financial credit which they could exchange for training or education. The CBI says this would enable people to shop around for the best opportunities, and open up competition among providers. Three years ago, the government set up pilots of a more limited scheme - involving young people undertaking vocational training - which is due to be extended nationally in 1996. Take-up in pilot areas has been uneven. Mrs Shephard said yesterday: 'What the CBI is saying is that we should look to market mechanisms to express choices and achieve value for money.' The size of classes at state-maintained nursery schools in England rose last year, education department figures showed yesterday. There were 25 pupils for every teacher last year compared with 24.2 in 1991 and 23 in 1983. If nursery assistants are taken into account, the ratio last year was 11 children for every staff member, which was similar to 1991. The figure in 1983 was 10.4.</p>

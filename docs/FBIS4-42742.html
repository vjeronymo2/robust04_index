			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lucien Lux, Socialist representative: "Lies by a </F> Flop"]    [Text] Every Saturday the LUXEMBURGER WORT publishes a  special page that is called "CSV [Christian Social People's  Party] Profile" when in reality it is a Juncker [minister of  labor] fan magazine trying increasingly to find its place among  satirical papers from which it differs, however, by its shabby  style.    On 28 May, the undersigned received a dubious honor in this  page's column. My name was bandied about with and animal  comparisons were made. One could feel the almost childish fun  that must have overcome the author when writing this lampoon,  something which I last enjoyed in second grade.    Mr. Juncker is to be pitied. He who, in the early stage of  the election campaign, had announced objective explanations  because politics is "no beauty contest," he who likes to present  himself as the prototype of elevated political standards has to  live with the accusation now of having dragged serious topics  down to a very low level and having degraded the ideological  debate to playpen standards.    To the issue itself, Juncker blames me for praising the  minister of labor in Parliament on 18 May and criticizing him in  TAGEBLATT on 21 May and even accuses me of cowardice.    The dilemma of the minister of labor is obvious. But it  still does not entitle him to resort to lies that could  doubtlessly win him an honorary membership in Mr. Mehlen's club.  One membership card more or less would not matter anyway, when  Juncker is also a member of the initiative against the same  hazardous waste dump which he supported as a member of the  administration.    On 18 May I praised the legislative results of the minister  of labor because the five statutes of labor law passed during  this parliamentary term were positive.    On 21 May I criticized the minister of labor because his  overall performance as minister of labor is completely  inadequate.    Why it is unsatisfactory I explained in detail on 18 May in  Parliament in the presence of the minister of labor by listing  his omissions:    1. There were no impulses or new ideas for humanization of  the work environment and work safety. Failure no. 1!    2. For five years nothing has happened to encourage  participation in decision making, a broad and important field.  Failure no. 2!    3. Instead of discussing working time regulations, new types  of working time, etc., there has been a five year silence.  Failure no. 3!    4. In the field of plant inspection there was hardly any  progress worth mentioning. Failure no. 4!    5. Nothing happened to bad weather settlements despite the  possibility of preliminary work. Failure no. 5!    This review is all the more alarming because the reform  plans  were part of the 1989 government statement, in fact some had  already been promised in 1984. Not to mention the numerous  unanswered letters and inquiries, or the committees under the  responsibility of the minister of labor which have not met in  months and years...! When Juncker regretted on 28 May that  unemployment was a "non-topic" in Luxembourg, he concedes that  he not only reacted too late in this matter and that his  measures did not work, but also that he has failed socially and  as a political ideologist, even though he is not bad at  influencing the masses. But it seems that he did not want to  waste his skill on the Ministry of Labor which hardly interested  him....    This view is shared by the independent LETZEBUERGER LAND,  which writes on 14 January 94: "The eloquent ministerial  introduction of the press conference (...) was probably meant to  make one forget that the Ministry of Labor so far has been  somewhat neglected."    How little Juncker was interested the Ministry of Labor over  the past five years is illustrated by another fact:    The recently passed laws on subcontracted labor, on the  office for disabled workers, on part-time work and on collective  dismissals had been introduced in the chamber of deputies on 30  May 1989 (!) or 9 May 1989 (!!) or 18 January 1983 (!!!) or 1  October 1980 (!!!!) respectively. The law on job safety itself  is the implementation of a European directive that earned  Luxembourg a reprimand from the Brussels Commission because of  delay of application! Thus during five long years nothing new  came from Juncker, not a single new regulation in labor law was  introduced during this period!    It takes a good share of political impertinence and  brazenness in view of this pathetic performance, to present  oneself as a great workhorse and to toast oneself as a  successful minister of labor. How come nobody else is joining in?    The fact is that, due to Juncker, there is an enormous  backlog in the Ministry of Labor. The fact is also that the  Ministry of Labor would never be neglected in Socialist hands.    Even the propaganda of lies by the current flop cannot hide  that fact.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an "exclusive" interview with Honduran President </F> Rafael Leonardo Callejas in Comayagua; date not given; from "The  Morning Paper" newscast; passages within quotation marks  recorded]    [Text] President Rafael Leonardo Callejas has said that he  opposes a reduction in the price of fuel in the amount that has  been announced, because this would leave Dr. Carlos Roberto  Reina without a protective cushion. He also said that he will  begin a tour in March, as a politician, through all of Honduras  to try to restore the National Party [PN].    President Callejas, who inaugurated the Siguatepeque  Municipal Palace at a cost of 3 million lempiras, has said that  he disagrees with the U.S. Embassy, which accuses Honduras of  being irresponsible and of not honoring the rights of American  citizens regarding properties, which, according to the law,  belong to the Honduran state; an example of this is the United  Nations Park.    An example of a good situation between Honduras and the  United States is the contract I have just signed with the U.S.  Motorola Company, which at a cost of $25 million will install  cellular telephones in our country, Callejas said, adding: We  have also signed a contract for $60 million to install a  25-megawatt power plant.    [Callejas] "I am concerned sometimes about radical positions  that U.S. foreign policy sometimes adopts. One of the largest  U.S. telecommunications companies, Motorola, was granted the day  before yesterday a contract to install cellular phones, and it  will invest more than $25 million. We have just signed a  contract for the installation of a 50-megawatt [as heard]  private power plant by a U.S. company at a cost of $60 million.  This means that while the U.S. Embassy--especially U.S. foreign  policy--is trying to create difficulties around the problems  concerning the properties of certain Americans in the country,  sectors from the U.S. economy are coming here to invest over  $100 million."    Concerning the properties for which certain American  citizens  are fighting, Callejas said he will ask the Supreme Court to  explain each case so that the people can find out to where the  U.S. Embassy wants to irresponsibly lead our country.    [Callejas] "As for the lands, there is much that remains to  be said. Actually, one of the problems has been the way in  which many Americans have come here to buy lands, especially in  Islas de la Bahia, even though the Constitution states that no  foreign citizen can buy lands located 40 km from the border.    "What has happened in the past is that the offices of the  mayor first determined which urban areas could be sold and then  sold the plots of land and properties; this created certain  difficulties regarding the legitimacy of the lands. Very often  the lands were just leased for long periods.    "I recognize that when an American has the right the law  should protect him, but what I perceive is that attempts are  being made to create the impression that all Americans have this  right, because their position is the correct one. I do not  agree with that, because many Americans come to our country and  violate the law, and that does not give them the right to be  protected by the state's judicial systems. The courts are there  to solve it.    "I would ask the media and, especially, the Supreme Court to  inform about each one of these cases so that we cannot end up  believing that everything the United States does is ethical,  correct, and right. There are U.S. citizens who may have the  right, and there are others who do not."    The president said he will not sign any more contracts and  has instructed the Comptroller General's Office not to carry out  these types of actions that could create problems for the next  government.    [Callejas] "I would like to refer to this. I have recently  seen, with a certain degree of concern, accusations being made  permanently in the media, especially concerning new contracts or  actions taken by the government. I would like to inform the  Honduran people that I asked the Comptroller General's Office  not to authorize new contracts toward the end of my  administration, so as to avoid problems.    "We want to clear up any doubts that may exist regarding the  actions taken by my government. There are certain charges that  lack totally any basis. The sale of the (Cobasa) Company is  something about which we have not even thought. No sale has  been made, and we do not even have time to hold a public bid;  that will be the next government's responsibility.    "I saw in a Tegucigalpa newspaper today a serious accusation  against a public official simply because he traveled to the PRC,  and instead of taking the daily allowance of $250, he took $400,  which was what the board of directors had authorized. The  newspaper reported it on the front page as an act of corruption.  One thing is trying to get the sympathy of the moral  revolution and the next government, and another is to have the  fundamental basis not to make accusations that can adversely  affect people, who have been honest throughout their lives."    Concerning the reductions in the price of gasoline-- which  have been announced at 1.40 lempiras per gallon--Callejas said  he opposes it, because it would leave Dr. Carlos Roberto Reina  without a protective cushion if prices fluctuate. He said  currency devaluations could occur before March. Callejas said  he will ask the Economy Ministry to reduce prices by only 1  lempira per gallon; otherwise, it would be an irresponsible  thing to do by his government.    [Callejas] "There has been a substantial reduction in oil  prices internationally, and our policy is that when there is a  change in prices of more than 5 percent, the price is  transferred to the consumer. I have seen some figures in the  media with which I do not necessarily agree, especially  regarding the reduction that should be passed on to the  consumer. This reduction does not consider the new gasoline  price increases in the upcoming shipments or currency  devaluations. I sincerely do not want to leave the next  government the immediate responsibility of having to increase  prices.    "I will probably discuss the reduction in prices with the  Economy Ministry. The next government should have a small  cushion which can allow it to work based on currency  fluctuations or international prices at least until March. I  can tell the Honduran people that there will be a gasoline price  reduction, but it will not be the kind of reduction included in  the proposal brought to me by the Economy Ministry. Instead of  1.40 lempira, it will probably be a 1- lempira reduction."    On his private life the president said that he will travel  to  Miami and New York starting 27 February to have his shoulder  examined, as he is experiencing pain. In March he will conduct  his first national tour to restore unity and recover power in  the next elections. He will be accompanied by the National  Party's central committee, but he hopes the February convention  will elect the new National Party authorities with whom he will  tour all of Honduras.    [Callejas] "In February I will conduct a private visit to  the  United States, particularly in Miami and New York. I want  doctors to take a look at my shoulder, because I am still  feeling pain in the muscle and tendon in the right shoulder. I  will visit the doctor and then travel to New York with my wife  to rest. I will return in March to participate in the business  firms with which I am an associate or owner. I am also going to  try to contribute to the new political options of the National  Party. I hope to visit the different departments of the country  in March. I want to tell the people there that the National  Party believes unity is essential for recovering power. We  believe that clearly established processes of democratic  participation are essential as well."    Finally, the president of the Republic, in this exclusive  interview with Voz de Honduras, said that the debts owed by his  party's transportation workers will be paid off within the next  few days. He said a meeting with the finance commission was  held, and the funds are now available at a banking institution  so that transportation workers can collect the money. They  should not be concerned, he said.</p>

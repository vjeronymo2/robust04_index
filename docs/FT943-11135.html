			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Bredero to lose listing on September 1 Bredero Properties, the property developer that was almost dragged down by its ambitious Centre West development in Hammersmith, will lose its listing on September 1 after Slough Estates succeeded in gaining an 81.8 per cent stake. Slough received 32.3 per cent acceptances for its 10p a share privatisation offer, adding to its initial 49.4 per cent stake in the company. It is unclear whether British Land has accepted the offer, after taking a 7 per cent stake in Bredero in June.</p>

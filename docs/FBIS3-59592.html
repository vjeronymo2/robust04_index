			<p>Language: <F P=105>German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hans Herr: "Bridge to Broadband ISDN"] </F>   [Text] Globand is the name of a new network which is now  available worldwide. It supports transmission speeds of between  64 kbit/s and 2 Mbit/s and is suitable primarily for undertaking  services with large quantities of information. One principal  application will be the videoconference service which Telekom  will switch from the Transmitted Broadband Network to the  Globand network at the end of 1993.    The starting point for the development of the Globand  network  was the European Community's RACE (Research and Development for  Advanced Communications in Europe) program. Within the framework  of the European Broadband Interconnection Trial (EBIT) project  innovative data applications were to be realized, for which a  suitable data network with a bit rate of at least 2 Mbit/s was  needed.    The EC in 1988 asked the CEPT (Conference Europeenne des  Administrations des Postes et des Telecommunications) whether it  was able to supply within a short time such a transparent  switched data network with the existing technology. As early as  April 1989 19 Telekom organizations from 14 European countries  signed a corresponding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). DBP  Telekom, which was also among the signatories, participated in  the project with the satellite-supported, area-covering DFS  network (German Telecommunications Satellite).    In the course of the test preparations it turned out,  however, that only very few applications actually needed 2  Mbit/s; in most cases 64 kbit/s were enough. The signatories  therefore decided to halt the Ebit project. Those participants  who had already made investments for adjustment work and  calculated their market opportunities signed a new MoU in March  1992 and together formed a consortium which was given the name  of GloBanD (Global Bandwidth on Demand).    By July 1993 network operators from Finland, Norway,  Denmark,  the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Switzerland, Portugal,  Hong Kong and Australia had joined the consortium. Telekom  participates as a so-called associate partner, since the  technology it supplies does not permit full partnership  according to the MoU.  <H5>  User Facilities and Applications </H5>   The Globand network offers the customer the following user  facilities:        -  Switched connections,    -  bandwidth on demand    -  bit transparent transmission with a speed of n x 64 kbit/s  (n=1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 23, 24, 30),    -  customer interfaces G.703, V11, X.21, Q.931W (planned),    -  closed user groups,    -  point to multipoint connections,    -  reserved connections.       This list makes it clear that the Globand network belongs to  the Corporate Network category. To be sure, some user facilities  for traffic relations with the German network component are not  offered for technical reasons:        -  Bandwidth on Demand is not available through the  customer in the DFS network, but is switched on by request by  the operator;    -  at the moment only transmission rates of 384 and 1,920 kbit/s  are offered;    -  no reserved connections;    -  no closed user groups.       Globand is suitable primarily for the following  applications:        -  Self-dialled videoconferencing including multipoint  conferencing;    -  rapid data transmission, for example between host computers;    -  LAN-LAN coupling;    -  remote printing and setting;    -  back-up for rented lines or overflow traffic;    -  audio lines for hifi transmission;    -  remote consulting and diagnosis in the medical field;    -  CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided  Manufacturing).       The main application of the DFS/Globand network will be the  videoconference service. At Telekom this service will for  technical (selection ability) and cost reasons (charge  standardization) be switched at the end of 1993 from the  Transmitted Broadband Network (VBN) to the DFS network.  <H5>  From the DFS Network to the Globand Network </H5>   The Globand partners are using exclusively terrestrial  networks. The DFS network, on the other hand, is a  satellite-supported, digital switched network with transparent  data channels. It consists of 30 connection stations with the  transmission-technical installations, two reference stations for  network internal control purposes and one operating control  center.    The connection stations are operated unmanned and remotely  serviced and monitored. They consist of the antenna reflector  with the IF/RF installations (intermediate frequency/radio  frequency), the TDMA installations (Time Division Multiple  Access) for allocation of satellite transmission capacity and  the communications unit (ANPE, adapter unit) for the network  connection. This consists of 24 2 Mbit/s ports, which if needed  can be divided into entry and exit ports. The technology is  based on the S12 system from Alcatel SEL.    The communications facilities are in part also terrestrially  interlinked. This was necessary because of the transfer of the  videoconferencing service to the DFS network and the resulting  danger of overloading. For the subscribers this has the  advantage that they can get a terrestrially routed connection if  they want to avoid potentially undesirable delay time on the  satellite link. Moreover, the transition to foreign networks  also takes place through the communications facility.    The network terminus is located at the subscriber's and is  connected through a 2-Mbit/s connection line to the  communications facility. The switching procedure takes place  either software-controlled with a commercial PC or with the  keyboard of a commercial multifrequency selector telephone.    With the exception of the German component, the Diax concept  is used in the Globand network. This network concept, named  after the Danish company with the same name, consists of three  components:        -  The local transmission station (Vst) can accept up to  22 2-Mbit/s connections. It can be operated as a stand-alone Vst  or as a part of a larger network.    -  The Transit-Vst can process up to 80 2 Mbit/s PCM systems and  supplies the necessary functions of a gateway station. It is  comparable to the ANPE in the DFS network.    -  Dikonet 64 and 2000 form the network terminus for 64 kbit/s  and  2 Mbit/s.       With junctions to networks with a different technology (such  as the DFS network), the Transit-Vst must be modified at the  gateway station in question for the required performance  characteristics in the entire Globand network. This is done with  new software releases.    The principal difference between the DFS network and the  infrastructure of the other Globand partners lies in the  signaling: Both technologies make use of the CCITT-No 7 system,  with a central time division channel. The Diax technology uses  the so-called Telephone User Part (TUP) for this, while Telekom  uses the so-called Data User Part (DUP).    The required adaptation functions are in each case  implemented in the transmission nodes of the gateway stations  for the immediately adjacent network components. In the case of  the German network component, this is ANPE. These functions are  supplied at the stations in Hamburg, Duesseldorf and Offenburg.  Ultimately, the performance characteristics of the network  junctions determine all the services offered by the network.  Thus, the offering of German network components can be expanded  within Globand if the corresponding modifications are introduced  into the ANPE of the gateway station and the foreign network  junction in the immediate vicinity. As an example of this the  supply of additional transmission speeds (in addition to 384 and  1,920 kbit/s) is mentioned.    A central operating control center for the entire network is  not necessary. Each network component has its own center  available, which in addition is equipped with a Globand help  desk. Operating, monitoring and error elimination are integrated  into the overall concept of the respective network operator.  <H5>  Standards for the Competition </H5>   The international call number in the Globand network  consists  either of the Country Code (CC) or the Data Network  Identification Code (DNIC), including the national portion. Call  data postprocessing takes place at the operating control center.  Accounting for the international charges takes place only  between the directly adjacent network operators and according  the rules of the telephone service.    The quality of services can be specified with respect to the  connection and the customer service. For network operators who  support the complete palette of Globand performance  characteristics, the following examples of values are to be  understood as standards to be aspired to.    Connection parameters:        -  Bit error rate: 10&lt;sup&gt; -6&lt;/sup&gt; ,    -  max. delay time (without satellite): 200 ms,    -  connection setup time: 12 seconds,    -  lost calls: 0.4 percent.       Customer service:        -  Installation time for the connection: 90 days,    -  length of time for interference suppression: 36 hours,    -  manning of the "help desk:" official service hours,    -  malfunction reporting: around the clock       Telekom regards the DFS network in the Globand network as a  transitional solution until broadband ISDN (B-ISDN) based on ATM  (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) is ready in about three to four  years. After that, it can be employed as a backup for B-ISDN, if  necessary. The other Globand partners position their network  components in the same way.    Transmission speeds similar to the Globand network are also  offered by the narrow band ISDN (S-ISDN). When using inverse  multiplexers for bundling B channels, for example, the service  quality of S-ISDN for bit rates over 128 kbit/s will be below  Globand's, however.</p>

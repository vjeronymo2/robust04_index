			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 6 (BTA) -- On the Day of the Bulgarian  Army and its patron saint St. George, President Zhelyu Zhelev  delivered a speech at a traditional fair outside Shumen  (northwestern Bulgaria), at the foot of the cliff with the image  of the Madara Horseman, popularly identified as St. George  (actually, the image of a Bulgarian khan). The depoliticization  of the Bulgarian Army, its transformation into an army which  defends the state's interests, is one of the greatest  achievements of democratic Bulgaria since 1989, he said. This,  the president explained, paves the way for the creation of a  national army proper, that would defend this country's  independence and territorial integrity.    The reform in the Bulgarian Army is part of the general  process of reforms in this country, the president pointed out.  However, he added that in that Bulgaria "lags far behind." The  delay of economic reforms not only prevents the finding of  solutions to the most pressing social issues; it also prevents  the creation of prerequisites and means for a radical reform in  the armed forces, he said.    He also pointed out that national security is a top priority  in Bulgaria's national interests, and the Bulgarian Army is one  of the main pillars of national security. Although the  diplomats will do everything possible to prevent Bulgaria from  being drawn into a conflict, the army should be ready, if  necessary, to defend this country's sovereignty and territorial  integrity, said the president. He believes that in the course of  the reform the army should retain its fighting capacity and  readiness. According to the president, the goal now is a new  army: smaller in number, better trained, armed with less  weapons, but of higher quality. The modernization of the army,  the improvement of its fighting efficiency is a task to be taken  on by the whole society, the president said in conclusion.</p>

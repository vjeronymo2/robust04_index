According to the forecast of the Federal Hydrometeorology and  Environmental Monitoring Service, around 13-16 percent of the  entire sown area of winter crops will have to be resown in the  spring. Given that the area of winter-sown crops, which account  for one-third of the grain harvest, has been reduced, the scope  of spring field work should be drastically increased. At the  same time, only 75 percent of available tractors and 76 percent  of plows (81 percent) were in working condition as of the  beginning of March (against 80 and 81 percent respectively at  the same time in 1993), while fuel and seed reserves were  considerably smaller that usual. The availability of mineral  fertilizers stands at 30 percent of the requisite level, and  herbicides at slightly more than 50 percent.</p>

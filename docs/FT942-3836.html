Richard Ehret, a classics master, recently got into trouble with an over-enthusiastic attempt to infuse life into the tongue of Catullus, a Roman poet. Ehret's offence was to introduce into the classroom phrases like 'in dentibus anticis frustum magnum spinaciae habes' and 'braccae tuae aperiuntur', which loosely translate as 'you have a big piece of spinach on your front teeth' and 'your fly is open'. 'Totally inappropriate,' said school superintendent Kenneth Bishop. Ehret, who claims he was trying to make his classes interesting and merely took examples from the textbook Latin for all occasions, was suspended without pay for 10 days.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / People: Oil chief's new posting Rolf Stromberg, the chief executive officer of BP Oil Europe, will be assuming the chairmanship of the company in October upon the departure of Christopher King, the present chairman. Stromberg, who is the most senior German executive in BP, has been particularly effective in recent years in eliminating duplication between BP's various national divisions in Europe. A graduate in economics and business administration from Hamburg University, Stromberg is described by BP officials as a 'committed European.' His most important activity will be overseeing BP's growing downstream activities in Europe, including refining and marketing of petroleum products.</p>

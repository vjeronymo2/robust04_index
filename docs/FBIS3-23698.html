			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Payson, under the rubric "Space": "What </F> Will We Be Flying On?"]    [Text] If Russia is not the homeland of elephants, it's at  least the homeland of the most inexpensive and reliable launch  vehicles in the world.    In the past, that has made it possible to save substantially  on the development of satellites that are more advanced,  primarily photoreconnaissance satellites. If the Americans spent  more than $100 million on launching a heavy "spy," the heaviest  Soviet launch vehicle, Proton, cost 40 million. In addition,  recon satellites themselves were initially created on the basis  of the Gagarin Vostok, were placed in orbit by the medium R-7  Vostok rocket, were manufactured at a plant in series  production, and were very inexpensive. They were launched and  forgotten, as it were. Within a week or so, you get a capsule  with photographic film. All the enemy's intrigues as if they  were on the palm of your hand.    The R-7 rocket, the "Golden No. 7," was developed by the  Podlipkinsk-based OKB-1 [Special Design Bureau-1] under the  guidance of S. P. Korolev and V. P. Mishin. That's where they  started working on the modest Zenits. In 1963, domestic,  series-produced, first-generation reconnaissance satellites went  on line. And then No. 7 and the Zenits and some other things  were transferred to the Kuybyshev branch of OKB-1. Now it's the  Samara-based Central Specialized Design Bureau.    Academician D. I. Kozlov heads it.    Beginning in 1957, various versions of the R-7 rocket lifted  off from Baykonur and Plesetsk and placed all the Vostoks and  Soyuzes and a good many Kosmoses -- peaceful as well as not so  peaceful -- into orbit. But time passed, and eventually seven  tons, the maximum lifting capacity of that rocket, wasn't enough  for the developers of space vehicles. But the 20 tons of the  Proton was a bit too much. In the mid-1970's, specialists from  the Moscow Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine  Building, apparently not wanting to part with the traditional  No. 7's, put out the first rough sketches of the 77 rocket. Then  that rocket became the well known Zenit. It could lift as much  as 13 tons into orbit and was manufactured in Dnepropetrovsk at  NPO Yuzhnoye. So it was a domestic rocket, and became exported.  But the needs for lifting heavy payloads remained.    At the present moment, the Central Specialized Design Bureau  is working on the project for the Rus launch vehicle. It expects  to use some of the elements of Zenit, primarily the control  system, to substantially improve the characteristics of the  veteran R-7 rocket, as well as increase the payload by half a  ton.    On the other hand, special requirements are being placed now  on rockets in terms of ecology. So the R-7 is running on trivial  kerosene and entirely safe oxygen, and, except for the mass of  scrap in the drop zone for spent stages, it's not doing any  particular harm to the environment. But the heavy Proton, as it  slams into the ground, sprays around itself what is left of the  unburned fuel -- nitrogen tetroxide and unsymmetrical  dimethylhydrazine (correctly pronouncing those names is one of  the principal habits of student rocket builders). Those horrible  reddish-yellow chemicals do have one nice feature: their maximum  allowable concentration in air is below the level of  sensitivity. Roughly speaking, when a human finds himself in a  nitrogen tetroxide-UDMH environment, he at first gasps for air  and then begins to feel as if something doesn't smell right.  That's why the Proton developers -- the staffers at the  Khrunichev State Rocket-Space Center -- are making improvements  on it at present. Before the end of this century, plans are to  use the Proton M -- instead of the 21 tons of cargo, it will be  able to delivery as much as 22.3 tons into low near-Earth orbit.  But the main thing is that the new control system will make it  possible to substantially reduce the drop zone for spent stages  and to place them with almost "jeweler's precision." A special  system will make it possible to combust the unused portions of  fuel before the rocket falls to the ground.    But that's all housekeeping business. On the world market,  Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energiya International is representing the  interests of the Proton developers. Whether M. Khrunichev, the  people's commissar for the aviation industry, would have ever  thought or guessed what loud company he would fall into, no one  knows. But the company is not without success in moving the  Protons to market. In late 1995, that rocket will place a  communications satellite manufactured by the Space Systems/Loral  firm into orbit; talks are also under way about the launch of  four additional vehicles.    Things are relatively easy for Proton -- there aren't that  many rockets of that class in the world, and our "heavy lifter"  faces competition from only perhaps the American Titan. But  competing with the R-7 are the Ariane of the European Space  Agency and a number of American mid-class rockets that are  currently in use or are expected to be used. It would seem that  everything is leading up to a real "cold war" breaking out in  the space market at the turn of the century. But then...    "Main European Rocket Firm About to Sign Agreement on  Cooperation With Russian Rocket Builders!" is the kind of  sensationalist headline that appeared in newspapers at the end  of October. As it turns out, representatives of the Central  Specialized Design Bureau and the Paris-based Aerospatiale,  purposely not informing the public, are almost ready to sign the  unprecedented contract.    The firms are getting ready to develop a launch vehicle by  1996. The first stage is expected to be the first stage of the  Samara Vostok; the Parisians will build the upper stage. As it  is, the contract is not signed yet, but, in the words of the  representatives of the two sides, recent difficulties have been  overcome. "On the path to this program," declared Central  Specialized Design Bureau Deputy General Designer G. Fomin,  "there are no technical or any other obstacles." And he promised  that he would launch a rocket from Plesetsk in 1996. And  Vladimir Saygak, a Samara specialist in outside communications,  praised the Moscow officials -- there are no impediments on the  path of the new rocket. And the events of early October? "It  took place in Moscow, not in Russia."    It seems that the good old No. 7 will still be in service.  Especially since the now foreign Zenit rocket is now handcuffed  with large and small problems. On 4 October 1990, the 15th in  the Zenit series blew up on the launch structure, eliminating  one of Baykonur's pads. As it turns out, one of the sustainer  engines broke down. Although launches have resumed since then,  the pad is in ruins. The most recent Zenit lifted off on 16  September 1993.    In December, the deputy general designer of Dnepropetrovsk's  Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, Yu. Smetanin, said that his firm has  orders to fill from the Russian government until 1995 -- at 3-5  rockets a year; after that, it's hard to say. Yuriy Smetanin  complained about the politicians -- and the Russians are  complaining about the Dnepropetrovskians, who are striving to  convert their relationships with domestic buyers to a dollar  basis.    Again those dollars! We would hope that the Rus project  will hold up no matter what and that the Russian space program  will not be left with no reliable "cabs." Otherwise, things will  be bad. After all, for recent launches to Mir, the launcher had  to be taken from the arsenal of the space forces -- there  weren't any others. And the arsenals of the space forces aren't  made out of rubber.</p>

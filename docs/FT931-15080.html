			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow shows resilience to Iraq attack news Wall Street US SHARE prices bounced back and forth yesterday before ending mostly firmer in the wake of the attack by US and allied military forces on Iraq, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally down just 1.08 at 3,263.56, following a fall of more than 20 points earlier in the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 1.99 up at 433.03, while the American SE composite ended 2.15 firmer at 398.56. The Nasdaq composite put in the best performance, rising 7.33 to a record 686.78 on the back of a sharp rise for Intel and strong demand for other technology stocks. Trading volume on the New York SE was 245m shares. Prices opened lower as investors continued to struggle to find good reasons to buy stocks, while the absence of new economic statistics, and the lack of movement from a becalmed bond market, ensured that trading remained directionless. The political backdrop deepened the gloom. Following rumours earlier in the week of a planned attack on Iraq by US and allied forces, yesterday afternoon the White House confirmed reports that a military strike had been launched. The market took the news well, with share prices recovering almost all the ground they lost earlier in the day. Investors remained concerned, however, that a renewed conflict in the Gulf could hinder economic recovery by depressing consumer and business confidence, and possibly divert funds away from stocks to bonds. Philip Morris receded Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 73 3/4 after disclosing that shipments of its best-selling Marlboro cigarettes fell 5.6 per cent last year - the steepest drop in the brand's history and much larger than the industry-wide decline in sales. A variety of factors undermined airline shares, including signs of another price war, concern that conflict in the Middle East could push up fuel prices and scare passengers away, and profit-taking following big gains earlier in the week. UAL dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 125 1/2 , Delta lost Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 49 7/8 , USAir shed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 13 7/8 and AMR, parent of American Airlines, slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 67. Defence stocks received a boost from the reports of an attack on Iraq. General Dynamics roser Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 109 1/8 , Lockheed Dollars 1 to Dollars 56 1/4 and McDonnell Douglas Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 53 1/4 on hopes that another war would boost government spending on weapons. On the Nasdaq market, Intel soared Dollars 8 1/8 to Dollars 110 1/8 , an all-time high, in volume of 10.7m shares after reporting that fourth-quarter earnings rose to Dollars 1.97 a share, well above market estimates. Canada THE TORONTO market finished lower after continued heavy trading. The TSE 300 index was down 16.2 at 3,298.3 and declining issues led advances by 348 to 265 after volume of 45m shares valued at CDollars 414.8m. Corby Distilleries reported significantly higher nine-month earnings. The 'A' stock appreciated CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 47.</p>

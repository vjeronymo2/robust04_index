			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / UN Council under fire over Iraq A TOP United Nations official yesterday accused the Security Council of failing to respond swiftly and vigorously enough after Iraq last month barred weapons inspectors from Baghdad's Agriculture Ministry. The official, Mr Rolf Ekeus, who is head of the UN commission charged with finding and scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said the Security Council's attitude exacerbated the recent confrontation with Iraq. He told reporters that Iraq misread the situation. It understood only in the final 24 hours before backing down that military action against it had become 'a very close call'. Mr Ekeus denied that he compromised future weapons inspections in Iraq by choosing inspectors from countries that did not take part in the Gulf war in order to win access to the Agriculture Ministry. 'I did not negotiate any selection; I did it in order to help Iraq out of the impasse,' he said, adding that the UN had no wish to humiliate Baghdad. However, he said the US, Britain and France were about the only countries that had people with the expertise to conduct sensitive inspections. It was inevitable their citizens must continue to be included in operations. A new UN team led by a Russian expert would begin a further round of inspections in Iraq next weekend, concentrating on locations 'where we have reason to suspect that prohibited material is stored or hidden'. Mr Ekeus said the Iraqis would get no advance warning. It would also test their undertakings to him during his mission to Baghdad in the wake of last month's crisis. He also hoped the Security Council would react quickly if the inspectors encountered another confrontation. US marines in amphibious assault vehicles, escorted by low-flying helicopter gunships, landed on Kuwaiti shores yesterday in an implicit US warning to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, agencies report from Kuwait. Exercise Eager Mace, planned last year, is the first of three war games in Kuwait that will involve more than 5,000 US troops in landing, live fire and tank manoeuvres during August.</p>

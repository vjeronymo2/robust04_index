			<p>CSO     [Text] German researchers are presently arranging a  Russian-German-Japanese Space cooperation project. They are  outfitting a Russian reentry vehicle with German infrastructure  for the "Express" experiment.    There will be German and Japanese experiments on board the  capsule, which will be launched on 9 September by a Japanese  M2-S3 booster.    The Munich Kayser-Threde GmbH is responsible for the central  power system for the equipment, the boosting and processing of  the measurement signals, and data processing.    The three experiments will concentrate on the continued  development of technologies for reentry into the Earth's  atmosphere. The scientific work will begin at the conclusion of  the flight, when the nose cone of the capsule heats up to  2,400C in the atmosphere. The capsule will be brought to  Japan in July to prepare for launch.</p>

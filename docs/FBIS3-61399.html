			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [LIETUVOS RYTAS article: "Only One Former National </F> Delegation Member Included on Team for Negotiations with CIS"]    [Text] Vilnius, 22 Dec (BNS)--The composition of the  working group for Lithuania's negotiations with the CIS  countries was confirmed at the Wednesday meeting of the  government leadership.    Virgilijus Bulovas, ambassador extraordinary and  plenipotentiary and a member of Seimas, has been appointed head  of the working group, which will have four additional members.  Bulovas previously headed the national delegation for  negotiations with Russia, since dismissed by the president.    The other members of the group did not belong to the earlier  national negotiating delegation.    They are Raimondas Barcevicius, vice-minister for industry  and commerce; Arvydas Lescinskas, vice-minister for  transportation; Ricardas Seibelis, director of the account  settlement center of the Bank of Lithuania; Petras Zapolskas,  head of the foreign ministry's CIS countries section.    Some of the members of the delegation for negotiating with  Russia, dismissed by decree of the president, have decided not  to dissolve their group. They have not, for the time being,  outlined their status more clearly, but intend to do so at the  first meeting of the group, which will probably take place right  after New Year's.    Romualdas Ozolas, one of the members of the group, calls the  decision by the former negotiators a "civic initiative" to  observe and evaluate the negotiations with Russia as well as the  treaties that are made with it.</p>

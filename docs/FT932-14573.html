			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Fishing: Mayfly make me mad - Tom Fort thinks you can have too much of a good thing IN MY dry fly apprenticeship, I displayed all the characteristic intolerance of youth towards the mayfly. On the stretch of the upper Kennet which I then fished, the insect did not appear. Nor would it have been in the least bit welcome if it had. We much preferred our modest hatches of well mannered olives and delicate pale wateries. Our view of the mayfly carnival was akin to that of monks hearing reports of Roman orgies. I no longer fish the upper Kennet, so crystalline and lovely in those days, before it was stricken by drought. I have moved down river, to a fishery on which the mayfly hatches in abundance. And my snooty attitude towards it has been necessarily modified. A good deal of the old prejudice does survive. I cannot help thinking that there is something gross and undignified about the mayfly season, which is an affront to notions of fly fishing as the most refined and graceful of pastimes. Partly, it is the behaviour of the fish. We like to think of trout as reasonably discriminating creatures, which help themselves in moderation at Nature's table, and examine our imitations with a critical eye. But all this goes out of the window with the arrival of ephemera danica. Gluttony and piggishness rule in the frenzy to swallow as many of these fat, luscious titbits as possible. Our chalkstream trout become like schoolboys who find the tuckshop left unlocked. The scale of the hatch is also over the top, provoking excess succeeded by biliousness and torpor. The fish, stuffed to their gills, circle dyspeptically to the bottom, contemptuous of anything as puny as a trickle of olives. 'If only', one exclaims irritably as one surveys the unbroken surface in early July, 'if only Nature would organise matters more sensibly. Why could not the mayfly be supplied little and often, rather than in one colossal binge?' A hatch of fly should be an unassuming affair. It should not blot out the sun, obscure the meadow, form a hovering cloud over the river. The fisherman does not really wish to have huge insects settling on his ears, festooning his hat, creeping across the lenses of his spectacles. Nor, if he has any sensibility, does he care to see his favourite river transformed into the aquatic equivalent of the classic French film about gastronomic frenzy, La Grande Bouffe. I am, of course, overstating my case. The scenes of abandon I have described are hardly the norm. And when they do occur, they tend to involve fisheries recently stocked with large numbers of greedy, simple-minded trout whose ingrained instincts of caution and common sense are nullified by the transfer from stewpond to river. There was, for instance, a day on the Test last year, when the water heaved and a discarded toenail would have brought a rise. On stillwaters, the mayfly hatch is likely to be as maddening as any other. I am thinking of the great Irish lakes, such as Corrib, where more often than not the surging hope which attends the start of the mayfly day is transformed into despair by the time a fishless evening is reached. I am also quite unjustifiably blackening the reputation of the insect itself. It is a lovely and fascinating creature, and I am well aware that its appearance is one of the wonders of the angler's year. Who am I to denigrate it, and the sport in inspires in these harsh times? What, above all, quickens the heart about the mayfly season is the matter of BIG fish. It is the time par excellence when the disciplined angler can put aside thoughts of quantity and may reasonably pursue the dream of the monster. It is the time at which the five and six pounders which one has been told exist actually offer proof of the fact. It is a time for putting oneself to the test. I confess now that I have done so - and I have failed. The memory of the episode is still painful, but they say that self exposure is part of the healing process, so I shall relate the tale. There is a sidestream which leaves the lower Kennet by some hatches and rejoins it some distance downstream. On its meandering journey it is connected to a lake, which a few years ago was home to a few, very large, wild brown trout. In the mysterious way of the mayfly, it hatched on the stream but not on the lake. So, when the hatch was at its height, the leviathans would move into the stream to feast. I spotted one feeding beneath a tangled gorse bush. There were sucking sounds and ripples of a character calculated to promote panic and incompetence. The luxuriance of the surrounding vegetation made normal casting impossible. On my knees, I thrust the end of my rod through the thicket, and lowered a French partridge on to the water. It travelled slowly into the monster's lair, and there was a noise like a wet kiss. I tightened, and thereafter the drama was played out at paralysing speed. The fish went upstream, turned, headed past me, dived, broke me; and I never even got off my knees. Trembling and panting, like a mountaineer at high altitude, I stumbled away. A little later, I bumped into the keeper and recounted the terrible story. He endeavoured to console me by telling me that he had seen this fish, or enough of it, to estimate its weight at eight pounds. He did not think it it was possible to land such a creature in such a spot. I am a few years older now, and I still have not caught a chalkstream trout half the size of the one I lost that afternoon. But the giants are still there, which is why, come the end of the month, I shall be prowling the river bank, apologising to mayfly and trout for having been so rude about them, and hoping against hope for a chance to make amends.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Fire union leader warns on cuts Mr Ken Cameron, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, accused the government of 'playing with fire' and putting lives at risk through public service cuts. 'We see fire stations continually being closed. We see fire engines being taken off the run,' he told the conference. Public-sector workers would no longer put up with having their wages held down while directors took home 'telephone-number salaries', he warned.</p>

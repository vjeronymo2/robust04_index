			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Affairs and Cults Ministry has ordered  former President Jean-Bertrand Aritide and his employees not to  speak on behalf of the Haitian state or to commit the Republic  of Haiti to anything with their signatures. This is how it  appears in the Ministry press release, which adds: The Haitian  Chancery expresses its most formal reservations over statements  and actions by members of the overthrown government, statements  and actions that the Chancery considers null and void. The  Foreign Affairs and Cults Ministry adds that it has asked the  OAS secretary general to pass this information on to its various  members and regional institutions for whatever it's worth.</p>

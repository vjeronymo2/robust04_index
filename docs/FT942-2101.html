			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Observer: Czech this bitter brew In the second world war, Brits grew accustomed to - if not exactly in love with - that culinary miracle, the powdered egg. But has anyone spotted the beer drinker's equivalent of a doodlebug? The reason for asking is the news that somewhere in central Europe powdered beer will soon be hitting the street. It is being launched by Jan Oliva, a Czech brewer who hails from the land which gave us the original Budweiser. Oliva, like many Czechs, is keen to break into the Russian beer market but has been hindered by high transport costs. Hence his recipe for powdered beer. Far from feeling shameful at committing such sacrilege, Oliva stoutly defends his product: 'It looks like beer, it tastes like beer and it has a head, too,' he says. It also has the big advantage of costing the equivalent of 8p a pint. Initially he is selling 40 tons of beer powder to the Russians. But who knows how long it will be before British pubs are ringing to the cries of a 'pint of your best powder, Landlord]'</p>

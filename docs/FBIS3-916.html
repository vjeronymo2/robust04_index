The party's vice-president, Aleke Banda, said at a press  briefing that his party was quitting the National Consultative  Council after failing to block a new constitutional provision  barring politicians with criminal records from standing in the  presidential and parliamentary elections in May.    The provision appeared aimed primarily at the front's  president, Bakili Muluzi, who has been tipped to win the  presidential election but who served a six month prison term 20  years ago.    "This is wrong, there is no reason why such a rule should be  build around an individual" Banda said.    The council, grouping Malawi's eight political parties, was  formed to manage the country's transition to political pluralism  after decades of rule by President Kamuzu Banda.</p>

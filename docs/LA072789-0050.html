			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> STRUGGLING ORIOLES SCORE 4 IN FIRST, BUT TWINS FIGHT BACK FOR 5-4 WIN  </P> <P> Manager Frank Robinson keeps denying it, but the signs are there. The Baltimore  Orioles are feeling the pressure.  </P> <P> They scored four runs against Shane Rawley in the first inning Wednesday night  at Minneapolis, then ended up losing their seventh consecutive game.  </P> <P> Doug Baker singled with the bases loaded and one out in the ninth inning to  give the Minnesota Twins a 5-4 victory. The Orioles' lead in the American  League East has been cut to 4 1/2 games over the Cleveland Indians and Toronto  Blue Jays.  </P> <P> Although Robinson kept saying the 14-game journey that began last Thursday in  Oakland was another trip, his players apparently felt differently. When they  began the trip, the Orioles needed one victory to equal their win total for  last season; they are still a victory away.  </P> <P> "You're always worried about the mental things in a losing streak," Robinson  said, "and that's why they become longer losing streaks.  </P> <P> "We can't panic and we can't lose our heads. We have to come out and battle our  way out. Little things are beating us. We could have won, but we didn't. We  can't let it get us down."  </P> <P> Oriole starter Bob Milacki simply couldn't handle Kent Hrbek. The first baseman  hit two home runs and put the Twins back in the game.  </P> <P> In the seventh Milacki, hit Randy Bush and Baker tripled to tie the score. Mike  Smith came in to strike out Kirby Puckett and end the inning.  </P> <P> In the ninth, Tim Laudner and Al Newman hit one-out singles off Mark Williamson  and Bush walked to set the stage for Baker.  </P> <P> Jeff Reardon, the third Twin pitcher, closed it out and picked up his first  victory since June 26.  </P> <P> Cleveland 9, New York 7 -- The Indians moved into a tie for second at Cleveland  when Pete O'Brien hit an opposite-field double to drive in two runs in the  eighth inning.  </P> <P> "It was a pure shank," O'Brien said. "With a man on third you want to  concentrate on the big area of the field. You don't want to pull one that can  be turned into a double play."  </P> <P> Doug Jones, who gave up a two-run home run to Luis Polonia in the top of the  eighth that gave the Yankees a 7-6 lead, wound up the winner.  </P> <P> Walt Terrell, recently obtained from the San Diego Padres lasted 4 2/3 innings,  giving up six runs and 11 hits.  </P> <P> The loss was the Yankees' eighth in their last nine games. They are 47-53 and  are tied with Milwaukee for fifth place, seven games out of first.  </P> <P> Chicago 5, Seattle 3 -- Shortstop Ozzie Guillen continues to lead the White Sox  to victory.  </P> <P> Guillen hit two run-scoring singles and stretched his hitting streak to 16  games as the White Sox won for the 11th time in 12 games.  </P> <P> In a game delayed twice for a total of more than two hours because of rain, the  White Sox won their 10th in a row at home.  </P> <P> Guillen is batting .424 (25 for 59) during his streak.  </P> <P> Reliever Bobby Thigpen got the last five outs for his 21st save.  </P> <P> Harold Baines had three hits for the White Sox, including his 13th home run of  the season.  </P> <P> Kansas City 7, Boston 4 -- Right-hander Bret Saberhagen has become the Royals'  stopper on the road, winning for the seventh time in his last eight decisions.  </P> <P> Although he was in constant trouble, giving up nine hits and walking five in 6  2/3 innings, Saberhagen (10-5) had the support of a 12-hit attack.  </P> <P> Willie Wilson led the way with four hits, scored a run and drove in two.  </P> <P> Texas 11, Toronto 1 -- Julio Franco had two hits and drove in three runs at  Arlington, Tex., to lead the Rangers and take over the league RBIlead. Franco  has 74 RBIs, two more than teammate Ruben Sierra.  </P> <P> The 16-hit attack enabled rookie Kevin Brown to improve to 9-6. Brown gave up  seven hits in eight innings.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 3, Detroit 2 -- Robin Yount hit a two-run home run in the first  inning at Milwaukee to extend his hitting streak to 16 games. Then, in the  eighth he walked with the bases loaded to give the Brewers the victory.  </P> <P> Teddy Higuera (5-4), slowly rounding into form, held the Tigers to three hits  in eight innings.

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae  Vacaroiu was in Bratislava today on a one-day visit to Slovakia.  [passage omitted] Our editor Ivo Kunsch was present at a news  briefing at which the Slovak and Romanian prime ministers  answered journalists' questions.    [Kunsch] [passage omitted] Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae  Vacaroiu commented on the signing of agreements:    [Vacaroiu in Romanian fading into Slovak report read by  Kunsch] We have continued in Bratislava today what we started  during Prime Minister's Meciar's visit in Bucharest last year.  It is especially good that we are discussing all problems  openly and sincerely, but, at the same time, we very strictly  oversee that all of what we have agreed to becomes reality.  Today, more than seven months since Prime Minister's Meciar's  visit to Bucharest, we can say that we have made progress in all  aspects. However, the most important fact is that we have  almost completed the legislative framework needed to get  bilateral relations between traders on a higher level. We  envisage that several meetings will be held at both governmental  and parliamentary levels this year. Slovakia is the second  country with which Romania signed a memorandum on trade  liberalization.    [Kunsch] So much for the Romanian prime minister's comment  on  the signed agreements. Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar  also talked about this important event. He said Romania and  Slovakia had completed the part of contractual obligations that  were necessary for trade cooperation of a simple type. Talks on  the transition to free trade have started already today, and the  drafting of agreements will begin shortly. It is a matter for  the teams of experts and a question of how soon they will  prepare the conditions. The political will is to have this as  soon as possible.    The Romanian prime minister was also received by Ivan  Gasparovic, chairman of parliament, and Slovak President Michal  Kovac. Nicolae Vacaroiu left Bratislava shortly before  "Radiozurnal" [this news bulletin] went on the air.</p>

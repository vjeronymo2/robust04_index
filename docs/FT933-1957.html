			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (1): Big change in users' expectations - New developments have made business systems easier to use. Some tasks may have been de-skilled, but users are expected to become ever more versatile in return THE COMPUTER used to be a special machine, tended by special people, in a special place. Not any more. It is comparatively rare to come across a business, however small, whose participants do not use computers in some way, or cannot see the benefit of doing so. A much-quoted estimate, attributed to the US Environmental Protection Agency, suggests that by the year 2000, computers will account for the consumption of nearly 10 per cent of all electricity. For many companies, the computer has moved to the centre of the business, an assertion that software suppliers (particularly of database and decision-support products) are fond of making. At the core of organisations such as banks, insurance and building societies is the information they hold on customers. Such businesses simply cannot function without computers. Yet despite moving to the centre of activity, computerisation has become less centralised. Not so long ago, computers were distant, and personal contact with them rare. A vista of terminals, glimpsed though a basement window in the city centre was as close as most people came to computer. Now, in every high street, ordinary people can be seen perched at their PCs. Call into a tiny back-street insurance broker, and the assistant can bring up a choice of policies up on a PC screen within minutes. Anyone who uses a high-street cash dispenser interacts with a computer, but it is increasingly likely that using the computer also forms a part of the working day, as with the broker's clerk. For the people with whom he or she deals by telephone, in the insurance company itself, the computer may define the entire job. Systems, like people, have a natural life cycle, and the advances in technology are making it possible for systems to live longer. In the last few years, such developments as graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have made computers easier to use. That has implications of its own. You, the user, have to fulfil the other side of the bargain, which is that using a computer must become just one of a battery of quotidian skills, as mundane as using the telephone. This 'democratisation' of computing, as it has been called, brings a new set of pressures to both end-users and the organisations employing them. These are very different from the traditional information technology (IT) concerns such as speed of response and control of users. They include portability of software and skills, the rapid falling of hardware prices, and, with the spread of the user-base, ergonomics and health and safety. Companies are also waking up to cost issues such as electricity consumption. Analysts have estimated that unused systems, left on across Europe overnight, consume the output of two power stations. In reaction, Siemens-Nixdorf has produced the PCD-4L, 'the Green PC,' which can switch itself off if necessary. Thoroughly environmentally friendly, it needs a special monitor to maximise the benefit from all the power savings, which can be as high as Pounds 50,000 for 2,000 users. While environmental concern is a 'must' in the US, it may take 10-15 years to percolate through to the UK, according to Jennifer Parry, industry marketing manager for Siemens Nixdorf PC business unit - 'I don't think UK corporate decisions take into account environmental issues as much as in other European countries,' she says. 'Senior managers are not really aware yet: it's a whole cultural phenomenon because computers have not - until now  -been prolific.' Users' expectations of systems have changed, raised by the apparent accessibility of the PC and its ease-of-use. Boardrooms, used to spending millions annually on preserving their computer power, are asking for more in return. Some of the technical issues appear to be approaching resolution in a shake-down that has affected the entire industry. Open systems have already forced down the price of hardware. Software is becoming more portable and easier to use with object-oriented computing, and everything - hardware, software, systems software - has to be integrated. 'Computer shall talk unto computer, and the PC shall lie down with the mainframe,' says an industry analyst - and this puts pressure on software and hardware suppliers. With margins cut and competition fierce, suppliers are looking for new sources of revenue and dependency from user organisations. Suppliers who were once easily tagged as hardware manufacturers, software houses or consultancies are now scrambling for new areas of business, including systems integration and support, and business process re-engineering. In recognition of the new order, older mainframe systems have become known as 'legacy' systems. Such systems are still at the heart of most large organisations and they have a life cycle of their own. Now included in that life are developments such as the 'disaster recovery' centre, a development forced upon occupants of larger cities following recent terrorist attacks. Another significant trend is towards facilities management, (FM) or outsourcing. In some cases this can be likened to putting ancient systems 'into a home.' In FM, the legacy systems get handed over to experts, while the user company is freed to concentrate on its core business, often developing new, more flexible client-server systems, based on smaller,less expensive computers. In recent US contracts, one leading supplier, EDS, has approached IT facilities as potential profit centres, taking a proportion of savings/profit as its payment. A number of hardware manufacturers have diversified. Many have entered into 'partnerships' with software suppliers. Unisys, once wholly a hardware manufacturer, now frankly claims to be an impartial advisor to its users, in competition with traditional consultancies. All service providers may profit from the distributed support needed by the heterogenous networked systems brought about by 'downsizing.' Support-costs have not disappeared, but they have been dispersed. The responsibility for support and control appear to be devolving too, and the user is expected to do some of the tuning, the maintenance, and the backup that was once managed by specialists. In effect, we all have to become more skilled, to cope with systems that can themselves do more. Technology is producing systems which 'de-skill' specific tasks, but demand more diverse skills from users. Desktop publishing (DTP) provides one good example of this: one small system in the corner, acquired for presentations or the newsletter gradually expands its use, but only a few in the office really understand it. Even they only use a fraction of the software. Another example comes from Rank Xerox's recently launched colour photocopier, which brings astonishingly faithful colour reproduction in-house. Its mastery actually takes some time, but before long, people will take it for granted as they do the mono photocopier, which once needed a one-day training course. Anyone, anywhere, is now a potential computer user. Portable and remote computing has become part of the daily pattern of business. The executive who once got information from subordinates is now as likely to get daily facts from a laptop. For example, VAG, part of the Volkswagen group, has implemented an entire sales information system based on Pilot's LightShip, which has re-structured the entire business around home-working sales managers. But business process re-engineering, as many a redundant British Telecom manager will affirm, is often a matter of shedding middle managers and improving the workflow between those who remain. Around a quarter of the UK workforce, 5.5m people, now use IT in their work, according to a recent report by West London Training Enterprise Council, The report, IT skills in the 90s: Overcoming Obstacles to Growth, suggests that a national shortage of IT skills in the UK is threatening economic recovery. Although the number of IT users are expected to double in the next few years, there is little, if any central IT strategy. 'There is no consensus on who needs what skills - and why,' says Marco Capp, a one-time partner in the Coopers &amp; Lybrand consultancy who now advises the IT Skills Forum set up by the West London TEC. Training cannot help until there is some clear definition of the key skills needed, although Marco Capp points out that new developments such as multimedia might help. He tells a story of a leading pharmaceutical company whose ancient stock system often got out of step with the shop floor. A rewrite of something so fundamental was out of the question, but a concentrated training effort, centred on a Pounds 200,000 multimedia programme, gave it a new lease of life - 'a normal training course could cost hundreds of pounds per person, but that cost a mere Pounds 70 per head in getting 3,000 people up to speed in one system.' The basic problem, he says, is that companies are frustrated - 'they feel they are not getting a lot out what they have spent.'

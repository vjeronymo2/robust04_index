The statement said that the message which was sent in the  name of the Presidential Council is an open and desperate  attempt to distort the nature of the political and economic  crisis in the country, and an attempt to look for a scapegoat  with the purpose of canceling the real causes of the  deterioration of the political, economic, and security  situation. Its purpose is also to divert attention from those  who are behind the misuse the [word indistinct] of the state  funds, the devaluation of the local currency, and the wave of  terrorism.    The statement said that the message which was issued by some  members of the Presidential Council took place at the time when  the national dialogue commission is holding its meetings, and is  about to complete its work and come out with a general agreement  to find a solution to the political crisis.    Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid and Mr. Salim Salih Muhammad affirmed  that they are not responsible for the practices, and are putting  responsibility on those who seek to escalate the situation.</p>

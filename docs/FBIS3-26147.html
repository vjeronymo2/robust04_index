			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Reporter Li Xiuqing (2621 4423 3237)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb (XINHUA) -- Half of China's  ordnance industry's enterprises are now exporting civil  products; their total export amount reached 1.7 billion yuan in  1993.    The ordnance industry, due to such factors as its poor  compatibility with civil production in the areas of equipment  and technical conditions, has much difficulty "switching  production of military products to civil products." Several  hundred thousands of staff members and workers in the ordnance  industry, however, were not afraid of the difficulties. They  worked hard to develop export products and helped the industry  bring about a more than 30 percent surge in the growth of civil  product exports in recent years. China North Industries Group,  which is a major exporting company, doubled its export of civil  products three years in a row. Last year, its exports of civil  products accounted for more than half of the entire industry  total. At present the ordnance industry exports some 500 lines  of civil products including sporting guns, construction  machinery, automobiles, and motorcycles to over 100 countries.    In promoting civil product exports, the ordnance industry  pursues a longterm policy and gives priority to building up an  export base. Since the 1980's, it has aggressively attracted  foreign capital and managed some 100 types of enterprises with  exports as the main goal. Enterprises which switched from  military to civil production, and enterprises which lately  turned to civil product lines persist in starting out from the  high ground, setting their sights on occupying domestic and  international markets, and striving to produce name-brand and  excellent quality products.</p>

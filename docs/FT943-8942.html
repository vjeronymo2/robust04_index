			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Germany to act on smuggling of nuclear material Chancellor Helmut Kohl will send a special envoy to Moscow to find out how nuclear material is being smuggled into Germany after police in Bavaria last week seized 50 grams of enriched plutonium carried on a recent Lufthansa flight from Moscow to Munich. It was the third seizure in four months of weapons-grade material from the former Soviet bloc and confirmed fears that Germany has become the main transit route for such smuggling since the end of the cold war opened a black market for nuclear contraband from the east. Speaking on German television last night, Mr Kohl said he would also speak to President Boris Yeltsin to seek help in tightening up security. 'Every possible step must be taken to prevent such things from happening in the future,' he said. At the same time, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, yesterday told Bild am Sonntag newspaper that a 'new control system for plutonium' should be set up. 'Travelling salesmen with nuclear suitcases pose a new atomic danger,' he said. Police told Der Spiegel magazine, which broke the story, that the smuggling of weapons-grade nuclear materials could have been organised by Libyan, Iranian, or Iraqi diplomats.</p>

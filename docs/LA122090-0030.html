			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOPPING: 'TIS THE SEASON TO EAT CHOCOLATE  </P> <P> The best way to describe the Great Chocolate Cover-Up is with the words that  appear on its two-tone pink label: "A scandalously delicious way to dip fruit,  cookies, snacks . . . . "  </P> <P> It's a new product from Sara Brook Desserts of Houston: chocolate coating in a  jar. You soften the coating -- it comes in white and dark chocolate -- in the  microwave oven and use it straight from the jar to paint fresh fruit, cookies,  pretzels, dried apricots, nuts and whatever else you can think of. The Cover-Up  can also serve as an ice cream sauce and as the dessert dip at a fondue party.  </P> <P> The advantage is, you don't have to transfer it to a bowl or pot. That means  your clean-up load is lessened by at least one bowl.  </P> <P>  Cover-Ups are available at Irvine Ranch Farmers Markets and at Pavilions  markets in West Hollywood, West Los Angeles and Arcadia. The suggested retail  price is $3.50.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A romantic tin of chocolate-infused cookies could make a splendid Christmas  gift. In gold trimmed with magenta and black, the container holds 10 ounces of  Tuscan-style chocolate biscotti. To make sure you know these cookies are for  dipping, the tin is adorned with an old-fashioned sketch of a child about to  plunge one into a cup.  </P> <P> Inside are three types of biscotti from La Tempesta Bakery Confections in South  San Francisco. They are cioccolotti, biscotti dipped in bittersweet chocolate;  gianduia, hazelnut biscotti covered with milk chocolate mixed with hazelnut  creme; and amore cioccolato, chocolate biscotti that contain both almonds and  hazelnuts and are dipped in bittersweet chocolate.  </P> <P>  The suggested retail price is $15. Shops that stock the tin include Neiman  Marcus, Newport; Bristol Farms, South Pasadena; Montana Mercantile and Fred  Segal Espresso in Santa Monica; An Occasional Basket, Woodland Hills; the  Social Graces, Van Nuys, and Village Kitchen, Glendora.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another candidate to assuage the craving for chocolate is Green Street  Restaurant's AFCC. That's the staff code name for the Almost Flourless  Chocolate Cake, an intense dessert that gives you two pounds of Belgian  chocolate diluted with only two tablespoons of flour. It's $32 and must be  ordered a week in advance -- which may try the patience of some chocoholics.  </P> <P> Other Green Street treats available by advance order include a  chocolate-raspberry cake, $33; a Snicker layer cake, $35; key lime and New York  cheesecakes for $29 each; and a carrot cake for $35. The restaurant's popular  zucchini bread is also for sale. The price is $4.25 a loaf or $1 for two  slices.  </P> <P> Green Street Restaurant, 146 S. Shoppers Lane, Pasadena; (818) 577-7170. Open  Monday through Thursday 6:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Friday and Saturday to 10 p.m.,  Sunday 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.  </P> <P> </P></p>

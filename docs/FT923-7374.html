			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Textile and clothes exports rise by 8% TEXTILE and clothing exports rose almost 8 per cent to Pounds 2.3bn in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year, the industry's trade body said yesterday. This was more than double the growth in imports, the Apparel, Knitting and Textiles Alliance (AKT) said. The change left the textiles and clothing trade deficit steady at Pounds 1.8bn. Mr Allan Nightingale, chairman of AKT, said: 'This is a remarkable achievement when the economies of the UK's major overseas markets are in difficulty. 'However, the UK market remains extremely depressed. The brief upturn in consumer and industrial confidence in the spring has faded.' He criticised 'government spokesmen who deny the extreme seriousness of the present recession'. Textile and clothing companies continued to cut costs, said Mr Nightingale. The AKT estimates 6,000 jobs in the industry are lost each quarter. Clothing exports increased faster than textiles and accounted for Pounds 875m of the total. The biggest markets remained the Irish Republic and Germany, with the fastest growth coming from France, Sweden, Spain and Italy. France reinforced its position as Britain's third biggest export market with sales growing by more than 20 per cent to Pounds 90.4m. Sales to Sweden increased by 30 per cent to more than Pounds 62m, largely as a result of the shrinking domestic manufacturing base and the strong traditional trading links with the UK, said AKT. Spain moved from tenth place to sixth as sales jumped 45 per cent to Pounds 53m. The improvement continues a long trend - in 1988 sales to Spain were worth less than Pounds 7m. A weak dollar was one of the factors behind a 14 per cent fall in clothing sales to the US, but the value of goods going to the former Soviet Union rose from a negligible level to Pounds 13m. Hong Kong remained the biggest supplier of clothes to the UK, in spite of a fall of 7.2 per cent to Pounds 341m. This was partly offset by imports from lower-cost Far Eastern countries  - especially China (up 39 per cent), Indonesia (up 27 per cent) and Malaysia (up 30 per cent). Within the European Community, Portugal was the biggest supplier to the UK, second only to Hong Kong overall with sales of almost Pounds 112m, up 2.2 per cent. Textile exports grew by a more modest 6 per cent. The fastest growing market was the Netherlands, where sales grew by half to Pounds 147m. This figure was distorted by the establishment in the Netherlands of a new distribution centre for an artificial fibres manufacturer.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR FEELS THE HEAT IN COUNCIL STEW;  </P> <P> POMONA: ONE COUNCILMAN JUMPED ON 2 POLICE OFFICERS, WHICH PROMPTED THE MAYOR TO  JUMP ON THE COUNCILMAN, WHICH PROMPTED ANOTHER COUNCILMAN AND FORMER ALLY TO  JUMP WITH BOTH FEET ON THE MAYOR.  </P> <P> After moving to censure Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant for his verbal attacks  on police officers, Pomona Mayor Donna Smith became the object of a barrage of  criticism herself at this week's council meeting, with her sometimes political  ally, Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer, blaming her for the city's turmoil.  </P> <P> Nymeyer said Smith's censure motion was "nothing more than one more indication  of her personal vindictiveness and animosity toward Councilman Bryant and her  total inability to lead this city and this City Council in any constructive  direction."  </P> <P> In a nine-page written statement, Nymeyer accused Smith of lying when she said  the council fired Police Chief Richard M. Tefank on Oct. 17 because he would  not carry out its instruction to fire seven officers on a hit list.  </P> <P> Nymeyer, who initiated the dismissal of Tefank, said Smith's claim that  officers have been targeted for termination by the council "was not only  untrue, it had the effect of yelling 'fire!' in a crowded theater. Mayor Smith  bears the total political responsibility for the public outrage at the prospect  of political interference in the day-to-day operation of Pomona's Police  Department."  </P> <P> Smith, who was the only council member to vote against Tefank's dismissal, said  little in her own defense at the council meeting. But she reiterated afterward  that council members had a list of officers they wanted fired when they met in  closed session to discuss the firing of Tefank. "The names were stated in  closed session," she said.  </P> <P> Bryant said in an interview that Nymeyer wanted Tefank to dismiss the  department's three police captains. In addition, Bryant has said he would like  to see the dismissal of two other officers.  </P> <P> But other council members insisted that there is no hit list. Councilman Tomas  Ursua said: "I was outraged at the lies that began to hit the press (after  Tefank was fired) about the so-called hit list. No such thing exists."  </P> <P> The censure motion against Bryant was prompted by letters sent to council  members by Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona) expressing outrage over what he  described as Bryant's "personal attacks on individual police officers."  </P> <P> Bader referred to Bryant's disclosure at a council meeting Oct. 30 that Raul  Camargo, president of the Pomona Police Officers Assn., had been seeing a  psychiatrist at a cost of $20,450 to the city. Bryant labeled Camargo "a  psychiatric case."  </P> <P> Members of the police officers association also claim that Bryant told them  that he would like to see Sgt. Gary Elofson "killed, disemboweled and hung."  Bryant has denied making that statement but he says he would like to see  Elofson fired because of an incident several years ago when Elofson arrested  him for drunk driving. The charge was dropped after a blood alcohol test showed  that Bryant was not drunk, although he was found guilty of running a stop sign  and speeding.  </P> <P> Bryant also disclosed at a council meeting that Camargo and an unnamed  sergeant, later identified as Elofson, had been accused of sexual harassment  and lewd contact by a woman who had been fired as a police crime analyst.  </P> <P> Bader, a former Pomona mayor, asked the council to publicly censure Bryant,  saying that "silence on this matter would amount to your support and  endorsement of his attacks."  </P> <P> Nymeyer, who is running for the Republican nomination to succeed Bader in the  Assembly, accused Bader and his staff of proposing censure for political  reasons. Bader, who is giving up his Assembly seat to run for the state Senate,  has endorsed his aide, Jim Brulte, as his successor.  </P> <P> In his written statement, Nymeyer said Brulte was trying to capitalize on the  police issue for political gain. "The stench of rotten politics on the part of  Bader's staff is very strong, and I am amazed that Chuck Bader allows himself  to be sucked into this debate," he said.  </P> <P> Bader rejected Nymeyer's assertion that he had called for Bryant's censure as a  political move. He said he was simply outraged that Bryant had disclosed  confidential medical information about a police officer and sought to defend  the department against attack. He said "Pomona is a tough town to police" and  officers deserve support, not criticism.  </P> <P> Bryant denied that he disclosed anything that wasn't in public records or  common knowledge in the Police Department. "I didn't violate anyone's  confidential file. I didn't look in anyone's personnel folder. . . . The object  was simply (to give the) public information about what was happening in your  city with your money."  </P> <P> After a closed session that ended at about 2 a.m. Tuesday, the council voted 3  to 1, with Smith dissenting and Bryant abstaining, to provide an attorney and  pay any costs incurred by Bryant in the lawsuit that has been filed against the  city and Bryant in federal court by Elofson and Camargo.  </P> <P> The two officers allege that their civil rights were violated by Bryant's  disclosures.  </P> <P> Smith said she voted against the city's providing an attorney or paying any  judgment against Bryant "because he needs to be responsible for his own  actions."  </P> <P> The city will pay for an attorney to represent itself and for one to represent  Bryant.  </P> <P> Smith charged that Nymeyer concentrated his criticism on her because she had  endorsed Brulte over him for the Assembly. Although she and Nymeyer have voted  together on a number of major issues, including opposition to the firing in May  of A. J. Wilson as city administrator, they have been at odds on other matters.  </P> <P> Nymeyer not only criticized Smith but also Bryant, Elofson, Camargo and other  council members for making statements that he called unprofessional.  </P> <P> Agreeing, Councilwoman Nell Soto said: "Many of us have acted unprofessionally  in the things we have said. But I think it comes from the frustration of having  to listen to some of the distortions and prevarications that have been made on  the part of the mayor."  </P> <P> Most of the audience in the crowded council chamber vocally supported Bryant  and criticized the censure motion as an outgrowth of the recall campaign under  way against Bryant.  </P> <P> One resident, Debra Hernandez, said Bryant has taken the lead in exposing the  problems that face Pomona.  </P> <P> "What I would like someone to tell us," she said, "is who let the city get this  way in the first place? Who let the drugs and the gang activity get so  disproportionate to our sister communities? We would appreciate somebody  telling us who those people are so that we might publicly censure them instead  of those who are trying to clean up this mess."  </P> <P> But another resident, James Oberhofer, said Bryant should be censured for  making comments that exposed the city to a lawsuit. He added that what Bryant  has done is typical of the entire council.  </P> <P> "Everybody could be censured," he said. "Just sitting back here and listening  to it, it's the greatest show in town. . . . What a farce."  </P></p>

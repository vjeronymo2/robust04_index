			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: South Africa It has been a rough old year for overseas salesmen of South African shares. Quite apart from the darkening shadow of next week's referendum, the gold price has been flat on its back and the industrial economy is in deep, probably deepening, recession. If that were not bad enough, growth, when it returns, is likely to be stunted by drought and double digit inflation. It is impossible to exaggerate the impact a 'no' vote next Tuesday would have on foreign investor sentiment. Any kind of 'yes' vote, however slim the majority, would no doubt be greeted by an immediate bounce in prices but a sustained advance will require the clear interest being shown in South Africa of late to be translated into firm buying action. It would be unwise to count on it. The risk for the outsider is not so much the share markets themselves, which regularly vie for the low turnover prize in world stock markets, and which are underpinned by locals with nowhere to go. Notwithstanding a flood of recent rights issues, the Golds and Industrial sectors have actually managed a 5 per cent gain since January 1. The problem is rather the gyrating investment currency, the financial rand, which has plunged 18 per cent against the US dollar since the start of this year. Downward pressure, provoked in part by German and Swiss profit-taking on their sizeable portfolios of government bonds, is compounded by wide dealing spreads and restrictions on Reserve Bank intervention. Managed gold funds, with an estimated 20 per cent of their Dollars 5bn of worldwide assets in South Africa, have also been selling in the last year to meet heavy redemptions. Political risks aside, it could take a turnaround in precious metal prices to stem the general tide.</p>

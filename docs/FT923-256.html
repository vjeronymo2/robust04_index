			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: Baring subsidiary plans merger in Australia THE Australian subsidiary of Baring Securities, the UK broking house, is to merge with McIntosh Securities, a listed Australian broking group, in a further working out of over-capacity in the Australian stockbroking industry. Mr Bruce Parncutt, McIntosh managing director, said the merger was subject to ratification by both boards of directors plus regulatory and other approval. Mr Peter Meurer, managing director of Baring Securities (Australia), said it was 'clear that the financial community was sending us a message by cutting broking rates'. The merger follows a number of closures and mergers which have reduced employment in the Australian broking industry to about 4,000 from more than 7,000 in 1987-88. Barings Plc, Baring Securities' parent, reported a fall in first-half pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.8m from Pounds 24.3m. Barings said its securities arm had reported a loss for the first time, mainly because of losses in Japan.</p>

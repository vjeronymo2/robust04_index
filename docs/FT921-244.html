			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Arts: A giant in Tokyo - Architecture Tokyo last year had an operating budget of 7.5 trillion yen. This year the tax revenues have declined for the first time for 36 years, but you would hardly call it a recession, the actual drop in income being a minute 0.2 per cent from the year before. What does the city Governor do when he is so agreeably flush with funds? The answer in the case of Governor Suzuki was to embark on an astonishing building campaign. This great public programme was carried out with no increase in taxes and no deficit financing. The major monument of this era of public spending is the new Tokyo City Hall  -officially known as the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office - in the Shinjuku district of the capital. The architect, Kenzo Tange, was chosen by way of a competition. Tange became world famous for his Tokyo Olympic stadiums for the 1964 Olympics. These are still remarkable buildings that achieve a sublimation of high-technology structures into elegant forms, evocative of traditional buildings. The City Hall is a giant. The great mass of the lower floors rises and then splits into two towers that climb to a height of 243 metres. There is a second tower block that rises to a mere 163 metres and a lower complex, housing the Assembly which is built around a Siena-like fan-shaped city square. Scale is what is impressive here. It is manifested not only in the towering height but also in the generosity of the public spaces. The Citizens Lobby is like a giant film set of a public building. Hostesses in navy blue uniforms wave you with white-gloved hands towards the mirrored doors of the lifts. Parties of neat Tokyo school children are swept up to the top floors to enjoy the domed observatory floor where, according to the publicity leaflet they can enjoy 'a panoramic view of Tokyo and think about and understand Tokyo and the metropolitan administration.' This is the kind of architecture that is designed to make you feel big and proud - and it works. The towers are the best part. I thought the Assembly Hall was disappointing. Although rich in marble and thick in carpet, it is bland in colour and strangely dominated by the empty symbol of an onyx rising sun. Interestingly enough, the City Hall is much more fun for the public visitor than for the elected officials. Perhaps that is the right way round. Another aspect of the spending boom is the provision of sport and educational facilities. Four of these have been designed by Fumihiko Maki, a Tokyo-born architect who trained in the US and spent some time working in America for the Skidmore Owings and Merrill practice. His Metropolitan Gymnasium is an exotic, almost organically formed creation with a dramatically shaped metal roof. It stands as part of a public complex with a large swimming pool also designed by Maki, as was the adjoining University Music School. At the Gymnasium I felt the influence of Eero Saarinen - there was certainly more than a touch of the Kennedy airport TWA terminal about the flying roof. The fourth Maki creation close to this complex is the Technology Museum (Tepia), which is more straightforwardly modern but benefits from the use of water at its entrance and the sheer elegance of its cutaway elements. Throughout these projects there is also something that is very distinctive in Japan - simple and beautiful landscaping. Much of the urban landscaping is hard, using granite or other stone pavings and restrained planting. Fumihiko Maki is in the big league of modern architects - he is very good but, like many things in modern Tokyo, he is not above the influence of trend and fashion. His 'spiral' building follows the pointless American trend of 'deconstruction' - cutting away the skin of a building to show its inner parts. This is frequently done at the corners to show that the structure supporting the edifice has nothing to do with the walls. Observers looking at deconstructed architecture are left to shrug their shoulders and say 'so what?'. Fashion can be an influence for quality - if it rises above mere trend. There is no doubt that one architect in Japan at the moment is both high fashion and serious quality and that is Tadao Ando. His work is tough and serious, austere and cold. He is the master of smooth concrete and of defensive planning which creates houses within high walls, where they calmly create their own world away from the frantic city. His plans show a fascination with the intriguing spaces that are made when the square sits inside the circle. I visited one of his recent Tokyo creations that seemed to sum up his essential skills as well as his sense of what is chic. La Collezione is a group of Italian fashion stores gathered together in a small Ando building. Clothes, hairdressing, a gymnasium and health club all huddle within one of Ando's circular concrete, almost fortified, walls. Access to some of the shops is by lift or a climb up a sweeping spiral stair. All is minimal and grey, but it is tres chic. Ando is aware of the noise and visual chaos of much of modern Tokyo and so he fortifies his clients - some may say he almost entombs them - to allow the creation of internal,concealed, neutral places in the city. One imported architect from Italy, Mario Bellini, working with the Obayashi Design Department, has brought another kind of stylish architecture to Tokyo. His Tokyo Design Centre has just opened, and it is a brilliant insertion into the city street. Maximising on the difficulties of the steep site he has put a staircase (another scala reggia) that is partially open to the elements through the centre, allowing access at all levels and giving the impression of a steep Italian street in Tokyo. More than a gesture, it leads the eye to the sloping garden where Bellini has placed one of his famous equestrian sculptures. Tokyo is rich in good new architecture. It is also visually exciting in rather outrageous ways. There is a lot of sudden colour: the luminous lime-green public telephones, for instance (there are also some searing pink ones); uniformed workers at petrol stations who appear to have stepped from some space programme, gleaming in pink and silver; fluorescent madness in the pachenko parlours (Japanese equivalent of fruit machines); and the delicate eruption of a mass of coloured umbrellas the moment it rains or snows. Tokyo offers tension and creation and energy that have clearly inspired its contemporary architects. If you look hard, the tradition of Japanese minimal elegance can still be found. The city can produce an amazing mixture of restraint and madness.</p>

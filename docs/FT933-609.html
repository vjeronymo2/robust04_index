			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Paramount may consider higher offer from QVC THE board of Paramount Communications, the entertainment group which has agreed to a takeover from cable company Viacom, said yesterday that it would consider a higher, hostile offer made by QVC Network when there was 'satisfactory evidence' of financing to support the bid. The announcement followed a special meeting of the Paramount board to weigh its options in the takeover battle. Paramount has insisted that it iscommitted to the deal it announced with Viacom on September 12. However, Viacom's shares and cash offer is worth far less than the shares and cash bid launched by QVC on September 20. Mr Martin Davis, chairman of Paramount, said that the board had taken no action yesterday on the QVC proposal. 'Paramount will consider the QVC proposal when there is satisfactory evidence of financing,' he added. QVC is smaller than Paramount or Viacom and would have to find Dollars 3.55bn to fund the cash portion of its bid. That compares to its annual cash flow of Dollars 173m. Wall Street analysts said yesterday's statement gave Paramount some breathing space, but it acknowledged that the board would have to consider the offer from QVC, provided that company produced clearer evidence of financial backing. Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, announced yesterday that his company had fully underwritten commitments sufficient to fund its takeover of Paramount. In an attempt to sway yesterday's board meeting, Mr Barry Diller, the chairman of QVC, sent it a letter on Sunday which sought to remove any concerns about the financing of his offer. The QVC offer, of Dollars 30 in cash and 0.893 of a share of QVC stock for each Paramount share, was worth just over Dollars 83 a share, based on QVC's closing price of Dollars 59 5/8 , down Dollars 1 1/8 . That valued the company at Dollars 9.8bn. Viacom's bid, which contains Dollars 9.10 a share in cash, was worth nearly Dollars 67 a share, or Dollars 7.9bn for the group, on the basis of its closing stock prices. Its A shares stood at Dollars 62 1/2 , up Dollars 1 5/8 , while its B shares were at Dollars 57 1/4 , up Dollars 1 1/8 . Paramount closed at Dollars 77 5/8 , up Dollars 2.</p>

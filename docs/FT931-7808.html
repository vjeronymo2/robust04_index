			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Yeltsin warning for Russian forces MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, has warned the armed forces against being dragged into politics by 'foul and irresponsible' groups. His comments, in the army newspaper which still bears the Soviet name of Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), were made just before a demonstration expected in Moscow today by hardline communists and nationalists protesting against economic reform. Today is Defence of the Fatherland day, formerly Soviet Armed Forces Day - no longer a holiday, but an occasion for military leaders to lay wreaths and make speeches. So far, overt criticism of Mr Yeltsin from within the military has been limited to apparently small groups of hardline officers - one of which, the officers' union, is expected to take part in today's demonstrations. However, the military remains disoriented, without a new doctrine and under pressure to leave former Soviet bases from the Baltics to Central Asia, without adequate quarters or provision in Russia on which to fall back. Mr Yeltsin's warning comes as the political scene is again illuminated by the struggle between himself and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, over the powers wielded by each. The two men and their aides have exchanged a flow of insults over the past few days while ostensibly engaged in negotiation aimed at reaching a definition of the division of their constitutional powers preparatory to working out a new constitution. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, promised an 'adequate' response to the bombing over the weekend of the Georgian-held town of Sukhumi by a Russian aircraft. The Russians say the bombing was carried out in retaliat ion for Georgian shelling of a Russian military laboratory. Georgian forces have held Sukhumi, the capital of the breakaway province of Abkhazia, for the past few months against attacks by Abkhazian separatists whom they accuse of being aided by Russia. Mr Shevardnadze, in a recent interview, said Mr Yeltsin was not personally responsible for the Russian aid to Abkhazia but blamed reactionary circles in the military and elsewhere for the supply of men and weapons to the anti-Georgian forces.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (2): Executives who must now turn right - There has been more cost-cutting in the air than on hotels MANY BUSINESS travellers had no idea until quite recently that you could turn right when you entered an aircraft, says Mr Keith Webber, UK director of Uniglobe Travel, a network of franchised travel agents. Turning right when you enter an aircraft takes you to economy class. An increasing number of business travellers now spend their journeys there. Mr Webber says: 'If you have always travelled business class and then one day there's a policy change and they say any flight of less than 10 hours is now economy, that takes some getting used to.' Only 14.9 per cent of UK companies now allow all staff to fly business class throughout the world, according to Thomas Cook, the travel agents. A year ago, the proportion was 25.4 per cent. A year from now, only 13.4 per cent expect to permit all staff to fly business class. However, there are still many people flying business or first class, as any traveller can see. Many have bought cheaper tickets but have managed to get themselves upgraded. Others have retained the right to fly at the front of the aeroplane because of their seniority. A high proportion of those flying at the front are likely to be Spanish and Belgian, reports a recent Europe-wide survey by American Express. Over 20 per cent of Spanish senior managers still fly first class on long-haul flights. Nineteen per cent of Belgian senior managers fly first class, followed by German executives at 16 per cent. The least likely to be flying first class are the Swedes (4 per cent), the Dutch (5 per cent) and the French (7 per cent). Business remains the class of choice for senior managers in most European countries. Around half of all senior executives in Belgium, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK fly business class on long-haul flights. A striking feature of the American Express survey, however, is the number of senior managers who now fly economy class on long-haul flights. Spanish senior executives, who have the highest representation in first class, also have the highest number flying economy. About 40 per cent of senior Spanish managers fly economy on long-haul flights. Other countries with large numbers of senior managers in economy are the Netherlands (36 per cent), Italy (31 per cent), Sweden (30 per cent), and the UK and France (26 per cent). However, such travellers, now flying in greater discomfort than previously, have a greater chance of holding on to their old privileges when it comes to choosing a hotel. Some travel industry managers, such as Mr Bill Kirkwood, sales and marketing director of Thomas Cook Travel Management, criticise companies for devoting too much of their cost-cutting effort to the airline bill. He says: 'Too many companies are wasting the savings they have made in the air with a poor choice of hotel.' But Mr Webber says there is a logic to companies worrying less about which hotel their employees stay in than which airlines they fly. The hotel bill forms a smaller proportion of total travel costs than airline bills. The American Express survey found, however, that while air fares are the biggest travel expense for companies, hotels are not far behind. Air fares account for 26 per cent of travel expenditure, with hotels at 19 per cent and motoring costs at 19 per cent. Mr Richard Lovell, managing director of Wagons-lits Travel, says the reason why business travellers have been allowed greater freedom in choosing a hotel than an airline is that many companies are still unaware of what accommodation is costing them. Only 25 per cent of hotel bookings are made through travel agents, he says. Many travellers' hotel bookings are handled directly by their secretaries. By contrast, 70 per cent of airline bookings are made through travel agents, and the number is growing. The greater mass of airline information provided by travel agents makes cost control easier. Mr Lovell says there have, nevertheless, long been general rules about which staff stay in which class of hotel. In domestic business travel particularly, staff sent out to sell goods and service customers' equipment have been expected to stay in budget hotels of the sort provided by large groups such as Forte in the UK and Accor in France. At the top end of the corporate hierarchy, senior executives have traditionally stayed in exclusive five-star hotels. That has changed over the past two or three years, with many senior managers deciding to stay in less exclusive establishments. This is not necessarily because those senior executives want to save money. Large savings have been available at many of Europe's most exclusive hotels over the past few years. Mr Lovell says he remembers getting a Pounds 225 double room at a top hotel in London for Pounds 80 for one of his clients. The real reason why many senior executives stay in four-star or even three-star hotels is they want to be seen to be setting an example to staff. A manager at one of the world's most exclusive hotels laments the fact that many senior executives will no longer stay at his establishment, no matter how little the rooms cost. If word got around the office that the chief executive was staying there, the credibility of the company's cost-cutting policy would be irretrievably damaged. Explanations that the chief executive had got a special deal would cut little ice. Four-star hotels have benefited from this need to be seen to be austere in choice of accommodation. Small, exclusive hotels in London have also been able to attract senior executives who are steering clear of better-known establishments. One area where exclusiveness appears to be thriving, however, is rail travel. Mr Lovell says that his company has seen an increase in bookings of first-class rail tickets. He says: 'We think that what is happening is people are being told they can't stay away overnight. They have to do their journey in a day. What they can do, however, is go first-class on the train.'</p>

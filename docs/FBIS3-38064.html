			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "Why Is Washington Making a </F> Fuss?"]    [Text] The circumstances of the exposure and arrest of the  CIA counterintelligence agent accused of cooperating with Soviet  and Russian intelligence prompts a host of questions and  requires explanations attributable to the extremely specific  realities of American society.    The key questions, in our view, are the following:    Why was it deemed both possible and necessary to include  President William Clinton directly in the propaganda campaign  immediately launched by Washington? It is possible to recall a  fair number of spy scandals which have erupted in the United  States in recent decades, including the affair of the Walkers,  father and son, for working with whom Oleg Kalugin, if you  believe the former general of Soviet intelligence, was  handsomely decorated. But not one of these affairs was  advertised at such a high level as the presidency. Even Ronald  Reagan, who never missed an opportunity to have a fling at the  intrigues of the "Evil Empire," was not actively involved in the  public exposure and condemnation of the Walker family, who  inflicted extremely ample damage on the United States. So why  was Clinton dragged in, although it was perfectly possible to  restrict things to a statement by the director of the FBI or the  bureau's direct chief, the attorney general? Was it not in  order to stress with especial authority Washington's  dissatisfaction with Moscow's actions? Probably this is so.  But surely Moscow, in carrying out intelligence operations  against the United States, was not doing anything different to  what the United States engages in in Russia?    Surely Washington will not really try to prove that it does  not recruit its own intelligence agents, or that, in doing so,  it places a special premium on holders of secrets of extreme  importance, and consequently, on our intelligence and  counterintelligence agents?    IZVESTIYA has already carried a brief report on the recent  arrest of a certain Russian citizen who inflicted the same sort  of damage on our interests as Penkovskiy once inflicted on the  Soviet Union. According to the information at our disposal,  either the Americans or their traditional intelligence partners,  the British, had been working with the new "Penkovskiy" -- it  was the British, let us recall, who recruited the original  Penkovskiy, and later wooed him together with the CIA.    Competent sources clearly intimate that they see a direct  link between the arrest of the neo-Penkovskiy and the exposure  of the CIA official: It is a sort of retaliatory action, they  told me.    An action all the more serious, let me stress, for the U.S.  President's being directly involved. What lies behind this?  Theories are being voiced that the arrest of Ames is a response  not only to the arrest of the spy in Russia, but also to the  boldness displayed by Moscow in the Balkans, a boldness which  for the first time in recent years cast the United States into a  secondary role in world politics. By the sensationalism of the  Ames affair, by direct hints that very swift and sincere  apologies are expected from Moscow, as if spying were an  exclusively Russian activity, we are pretty clearly given to  understand: Just you know your place.    There is, however, some hope in Russian intelligence sources  that the Ames affair will not cancel out all the productive and  useful elements that have developed in recent years in relations  between the Russian and U.S. special services. It would be a  pity, my sources told me, if these relations were now undermined.    And a final point. However you look at it, the main credit  for exposing Ames belongs to American-style Pavel Morozovs  [Soviet archetype of someone who informs against his own  relatives]. After all, it was Ames' neighbors, staggered by the  inordinate expenses of this civil servant on an ordinary salary,  who drew him to the attention of the "competent organs." And  after that it was all a matter of technology, with which the  U.S. counterintelligence agency is handsomely equipped.    One cannot fail to mention that, in the previous sensational  affair -- that of the Walker family -- the role of exposer  belonged to the mother and former wife of the spying duo. State  interest transcend personal and even family interests; this is  roughly how she explained to reporters the motives of her  action, which, it must be said, was absolutely typical of the  realities of American society.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Pilkington The partial flotation of Pilkington's Australian business will help the company's belated drive to reduce debt. Yet Pilkington may still struggle to reach its target of reducing gearing to 50 per cent by 1995, despite cutting capital expenditure and squeezing working capital hard. That suggests further disposals or partial flotations may follow. Pilkington has encouraged Nippon Sheet Glass to take minority stakes in various operations. But the group clearly believes it can raise more from a flotation than a trade sale of a minority stake. Australian investors have certainly been taking a similarly benign view about the building materials sector's recovery prospects as their UK counterparts. Pilkington will doubtless appreciate such long-term thinking.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMELESS  </P> <P> It is often instructive to hear the views of an outside party in order to gain  some perspective on a problem which, because of its familiarity, has become  virtually invisible to those whom it should concern most. Dr. Suresh Vidya's  comments regarding the homeless (letter, April 7) should, therefore, be taken  very seriously. After an absence of 10 years, the doctor was shocked to see the  apparent decline in our standard of living in such a short time. What, the  doctor asks, has happened here in the last 10 years?  </P> <P> What indeed? Could the systematic gutting of social programs to fund an  increasingly voracious and monstrously inefficient military be at fault? Could  a steady diet of propaganda about welfare queens in Cadillacs and the virtues  of self-reliance have something to do with it? Perhaps the explosion of cocaine  abuse and the coddling of drug lords to facilitate misguided foreign-policy  objectives had some kind of impact? Has the utter failure of the private  sector, in the absence of any federal help, to provide decent, affordable  housing been a factor?  </P> <P> In short, Dr. Vidya, Ronald Reagan happened to this country.  </P> <P> JIM WARD  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

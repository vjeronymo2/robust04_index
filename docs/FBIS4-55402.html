			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pal Szombathy: "Janosi: The MSZP Is Doomed to </F> Coalition"]    [Text] The first round of the elections resulted in voting  that changed the government, and the second round will create  the government. This fact has to be taken into consideration  when the government is formed. From this point of view, the  decisive factor is that the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is  doomed to form a coalition, as is customary in all democracies,  MSZP Deputy Chairman Gyorgy Janosi told NEPSZABADSAG. "It is  thought-provoking that the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is  visibly expecting an expert prime minister and the name of the  party chairman [party not defined] is not even raised as a  possibility in governmental roles," Janosi said.    Janosi said that now a democracy is needed that unites  rather  than divides the nation, and the political forces will also have  to represent this. A government with the biggest possible  social support will have to be formed because the example of the  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] showed the consequences of a  rapid loss of support, Janosi pointed out. He emphasized that  he would consider it improper for a single party of the three  political poles to form the new cabinet. The MSZP must strive  for a coalition even if it exceeds the 50-percent limit, he  stated, adding that he sees a realistic 50-percent chance of  this.    In Janosi's view, the MDF implemented a one-party government  together with two puppet partners, and proved that governing by  one party revives the reflexes of the state party. All this can  start a tragic erosion within the party within minutes. "We  also have to consider the long-term interests of the left wing,"  he added.    For this very reason, even if the Socialists gain an  absolute  majority, they will have to do all they can to establish a  multiparty government. The greater the MSZP's advantage is, the  greater its obligation will be to make gestures and compromise  solutions. According to Janosi, the chances of an MSZP-SZDSZ  coalition would be greatly increased if the two parties together  exceeded the two-thirds limit in parliament.    In connection with the MSZP's prime ministerial candidate,  Janosi said that society expects the winning party to produce  its own prime ministerial candidate. The name of the politician  will have to be made public immediately after the second round,  he confirmed, adding that the MSZP can only enter coalition  talks if it has a candidate of its own. "We cannot enter into  talks without a prime ministerial candidate, and we will have to  produce the best possible candidate, although we do not yet know  the result of the talks," he said. He believes that, if the  candidate is a party politician, then the ministries can be  given to experts, however, if the prime minister is a  professional, then party politicians who also have professional  expertise can be considered for the ministries.    According to Janosi, everything possible has to be done in  the interest of forming a coalition, up to the final, sensible  limit of compromises. Naturally, this limit also depends on yet  unknown factors like the proportion of mandates and the other  side's openness. The bigger party has to make gestures and the  smaller one must relinquish the use of blackmail. Only this can  establish confidence as a basis for the next four years'  governing, Janosi said, indicating that the MSZP is not yet  familiar with the proposals of the other side.    In reply to our question on [former Prime Minister] Miklos  Nemeth, Janosi said that he can be excluded as a prime  ministerial candidate for the MSZP, as this had been discussed  before. However, it is possible, although the chance is small,  that an outside third person's name will be raised as a  compromise solution if the future coalition partners cannot  agree.    Janosi expounded that society wishes for a social-liberal  coalition that has to be placed on an as broad as possible a  basis. Janosi previously considered the participation of the  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] a key issue, but [Fidesz  Chairman] Viktor Orban "spectacularly closed the door,"  therefore, there is no point in thinking about this anymore.    In Janosi's view, the case of the Christian Democratic  People's Party [KDNP] is completely different: Coalition with  them can be excluded because of the difference of the programs,  and a possible change of people in the KDNP's leadership would  not solve this problem, either.    In replying to whether the MSZP wishes to create a deputy  prime ministerial position, Janosi said that the MSZP had not  raised this idea before because it is contrary to the program  point advocating a cheaper state. However, the party is also  open on this issue.</p>

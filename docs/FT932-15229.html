			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: HK lift for C&amp;W The news that talks were to resume between the UK and Chinese authorities over the future of Hong Kong sent related shares sharply forward on the London market yesterday. Among the best performers was Cable and Wireless, helped also by a weighty tome from Hoare Govett and a positive note from NatWest Securities. The shares jumped 17 to 747p in turnover of 2.9m. Hoare's predicts earnings growth of 16 per cent per annum between now and 1996-7, while productivity and efficiency improvements are forecast to add Pounds 50m to annual profits. The securities house also draws attention to the growth potential for Hong Kong Telecom in the Pacific Rim. In reiterating its positive stance, NatWest also drew attention to C&amp;W's low relative weighting due to weakness in the first quarter as Hong Kong worries overhung the stock. Elsewhere, HSBC climbed 13 to 623p, Standard Chartered 11 to 709p and Inchcape 5 to 601p.</p>

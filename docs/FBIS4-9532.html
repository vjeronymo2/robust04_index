			<p>BFN     [Text] Gdansk, 27 Apr -- Solidarity leader Marian  Krzaklewski has ruled out the possibility that the national  strike called by Solidarity on Tuesday could turn out to be a  "damp squib."    "At the moment, 120,000 people are already on strike, and  the  strategic effect of the strike has been practically achieved,"  he said today at a news conference in the Gdansk headquarters of  Solidarity's National Commission.    "I expect that in the first two days there will be a lot of  warning, two-hour actions, and some of the plants will begin a  continuous strike. There will certainly be more than 100 plants  protected by the Solidarity strike fund," he added.</p>

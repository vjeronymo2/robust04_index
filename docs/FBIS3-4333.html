			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 28 (XINHUA) -- China will inject  1.66 billion yuan into its gold industry this year, to upgrade  gold production technology and develop gold mine construction.    Jiao Zhi, president of the Gold Administration under the  State Metallurgical Industry Ministry, said here today that this  year the country's gold production will still be directed by a  state plan, and the purchasing of gold will still be monopolized  by the state.    He said that this year's main task for the gold trade is to  put two management regulations into effect, one of which  concerns introducing foreign investment, and another focusing on  the use of geological prospecting foundation.    The two regulations were raised before the State Council  last  year.    Jiao also asked the gold administrative department to help  the central bank to establish a standard domestic gold market  and revise management rules on purchasing and selling of gold  and silver.    He said that this year, the gold industry should try to  collect funds through multi-channels, including attracting  foreign investment, in order to better develop gold resources.    So far, China's gold trade has cooperative ties with more  than 20 countries and regions, such as the U.S., Canada,  Australia and South Africa.    As Jiao disclosed, last year the amount of gold purchased by  the central bank decreased by 32 percent, compared with that of  the previous year.    However, the country's gold production witnessed an increase  of 7.5 percent.    Jiao attributed the situation to the low gold-purchasing  price set by the government, the emergence of original local  gold markets, and a serious problem with gold smuggling.    "But since the government readjusted its gold management  policy in last September," Jiao noted, "The amount of gold  purchased by the central bank has seen a sharp rise."    For the last four months of last year, the amount of gold  sold to the bank was nearly twice that for the first eight  months.    Jiao finally explained that last year, gold prospecting  teams  submitted 103 reports, which provided abundant information for  gold production.    In other respects, the economic benefits of the gold  industry  jumped 74 percent over the previous year. The gold trade  yielded a huge profit of over eight hundred million yuan.</p>

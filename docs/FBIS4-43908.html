			<p>BFN     [Text] Halle (DPA) -- New DGB [German Trade Union  Federation] Chairman Dieter Schulte has harshly criticized the  Federal Government's policy. Never before have there been so  many social welfare recipients and unemployed in Germany, he  said on Wednesday [22 June] in a speech at the Social Democratic  Party [SPD] congress in Halle. The country will not be able to  bear this course in the long run, a change is urgently  necessary, he said.    He appealed to the Social Democrats to struggle with the  trade unions against further social cuts. Schulte offered a  close dialogue to the Social Democrats. The SPD government  program forms an "excellent basis" for such a dialogue. Schulte  credited SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping with having committed the  party to important priorities of Social Democratic policy. The  SPD chief will find fair partners in the DGB, he said.    In another speech Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's Social  Democratic head of government, stressed that her party stands  side by side with the German Social Democrats. As common goals  she cited full employment in Europe and a just world order.  That is why one needs strong Social Democrats in Germany, she  stressed.    Reinhard Hoeppner, the SPD's top candidate for the Landtag  elections in Saxony-Anhalt, expressed optimism that his party  will achieve a good result on Sunday. This will also provide  support to the Social Democrats for the Bundestag elections on  16 October, he said, speaking to 500 delegates. Hoeppner  accused Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union) of  having turned the stroke of luck of unification into a problem  case with his "disastrous policy."    The delegates unanimously adopted proposals by the east  German SPD for an immediate program for the first 100 days of an  SPD-led federal government. The focus is special protective  measures for tenants, pensioners, and farmers in the former GDR.</p>

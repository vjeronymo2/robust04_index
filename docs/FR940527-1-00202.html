			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=4 --> Appendix B: Technical Appendix on the Capital Acquisition Model and Budget Neutrality Adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act requires that for FY 1992 through FY 1995 aggregate prospective payments for operating costs under section 1886(d) of the Act and prospective payments for capital costs under section 1886(g) of the Act be reduced each year in a manner that results in a 10 percent reduction of the amount that would have been payable on a reasonable cost basis for capital-related costs in that year. Under &sect;412.352, the 10 percent reduction is generated entirely from the capital prospective payments. A budget neutrality adjustment factor is applied to the Federal rate and hospital-specific rate so that total capital payments for each year from FY 1992 through FY 1995 equal 90 percent of Medicare inpatient capital costs in each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To calculate the budget neutrality adjustment, we must project the rate at which old capital will be depreciated and written off and at which new capital will be acquired and depreciated. (Old capital costs include depreciation, lease, interest expenses, and other capital-related costs defined in &sect;412.302 for depreciable assets that are in use for patient care or obligated on or before December 31, 1990.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing the FY 1992 prospective payment rates, there were limited capital data available that could be used to project payments under the capital prospective payment system and develop the budget neutrality adjustment factor. Consequently, we developed a capital acquisition model that relied on Monte Carlo random simulation techniques to project capital costs for 6000 hypothetical hospitals. This model is described in detail in the August 30, 1991 final rule (56 FR 43517&hyph;43522).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We now have cost report data for the first year of the capital prospective payment system. These cost reports begin in FY 1992 (PPS&hyph;9) and provide a break-out of old and new capital for the first time. We used the December 1993 update of the PPS&hyph;9 cost reports, the January 1, 1994 update of the provider specific file, and the December 1993 update of the intermediary audit file as data sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The available data still lack certain items that are required for the determination of budget neutrality, including a hospital's projected new capital costs for each year, its projected old capital costs for each year, and the projected obligated capital amounts that will be put in use for patient care services and recognized as old capital each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For FY 1993 and FY 1994, we implemented an integrated model that starts with the available data for existing hospitals and back-fills the missing items with results from the capital acquisition model that was used to develop the FY 1992 payment rates. Since we now have data for FY 1992, we no longer need to use the integrated model, and, consequently, we are no longer using the model that developed the FY 1992 rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since hospitals under alternative payment system waivers (that is, hospitals in Maryland and hospitals in the Finger Lakes Area Hospital Corporation in New York) are currently excluded from the capital prospective payment system, we excluded these hospitals from our model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We first developed FY 1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994 hospital-specific rates using the provider-specific file, the intermediary audit file, and when available, cost reports. (We used the cumulative provider-specific file, which includes all updates to each hospital's records, and chose the latest record for each fiscal year.) We checked the consistency between the provider-specific file and the intermediary audit file. We also ensured that the FY 1993 increase in the hospital-specific rate was at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.62 percent (the net FY 1993 update) and that the FY 1994 hospital-specific rate was at least as large as the FY 1993 hospital-specific rate decreased by 2.16 percent (the net FY 1994 update). We were able to match hospitals to the files as shown in the following table.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,6 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Source  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1No. of hospitals  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> Provider Specific File Only  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 47  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provider Specific and Audit File  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 5201  <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=4 --> Total  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 5248  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Forty-five of these hospitals had unusable or missing data.

Most of these dropped hospitals are new hospitals or hospitals with very few Medicare admissions. This leaves us with 5224 hospitals and should not affect the precision of the budget neutrality determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Cross-party group of MPs backs Clarke's fiscal policies A cross-party panel of MPs yesterday gave its backing to the tightening of fiscal policy in Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget, arguing that the 'dramatic' adjustment of the balance between fiscal and monetary policy was 'very welcome' for the economy's medium-term prospects. But in its report on the November 30 Budget the Treasury and civil service committee was less enthusiastic about the government's approach to monetary policy. The MPs said the budget statement and the Treasury 'Red Book', detailing budget measures, failed to give sufficient analysis of the factors influencing monetary policy and concluded that the true test of its credibility would come only when inflationary pressures re-emerged. The MPs said they were not concerned about rising prices in the short term. They agreed with the government that average annual growth of 3 per cent for the UK economy was a reasonable medium-term projection. They judged the Budget's public expenditure plans 'broadly realistic', although the government's success in hitting the spending targets in the 'new control total' were 'more contingent on the outturn for inflation and growth than the Treasury admits'. Among a host of detailed points, the panel: Criticised Mr Clarke for introducing revenue raising measures, such as 15 per cent reliefs on allowances, that 'departed from the principles of simplicity and neutrality in taxation'. Urged him to be more open about the government's plans for mortgage interest relief, arguing that it would be better to announce plans for its phased and complete abolition than restrict its scope by stealth. Called on the Central Statistical Office to conduct a special inquiry and report publicly on the accuracy of UK trade figures. At a press conference yesterday committee members differed over the current level of interest rates. Mr Giles Radice, the Labour MP for Durham North, said that there was a growing case for a cut in base rates from 5.5 per cent. Mr Radice and Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed, criticised Budget plans to cut public-sector capital spending. Mr Beith added that the government was denying itself an opportunity to generate employment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed J.-P.D.M.: "Europe Chooses Compatible </F> O.5-Micron Technology"]    [Text] In June this year, as part of the JESSI [Joint  European Submicron Silicon Initiative] industrial project,  Philips, Siemens, SGS-Thomson, Matra MHS, GEC Plessey, Mietec  [Microelectronics Technologies], and ES2 [European Silicon  Structures] agreed to offer their clients, as of late 1993,  common design rules for the development of their 0.5-micron CMOS  [complementary metal-oxide semiconductors] integrated circuits  [IC]. (Footnote 1) (The objective of the JESSI program is to  make European semiconductor technology credible enough to win a  respectable market share on the international scene, and above  all to facilitate innovation in all electronics-based systems  designed in Europe.)    Practical applications are now possible. Users can start  designing 0.5-micron IC's thanks to the libraries made available  by a number of suppliers, with so-called "relaxed" rules, so  that an IC designed by one of them can be easily distributed  later by another one, possibly as a second source. It is worth  reminding that until recently, in Europe, the most advanced  custom-made IC's were based on 0.7-micron technology. Small  production runs of 0.5-micron custom IC's will be possible from  April 1994, with large ones becoming possible in April 1995.    This "alliance at the top" is one of the consequences of the  current good cooperation climate among the JESSI industrial  partners, thanks to the action of JESSI President Heinz W.  Hagmeister (the former president of Philips' IC division) and  JESSI Vice President Guy Dumas (Matra MHS' former president).    This alliance confirms that what "pays" in any  government-initiated endeavor is a long-term policy with clearly  identified objectives. Now that JESSI has reached its mature  stage, results will soon follow, the most significant ones being  expected in computer-assisted design and 0.35-micron technology:  There is today a high likelihood that the goal of a transfer to  industry of a 0.35- micron CMOS technology that is mostly free  of non-European components will be achieved. The European  semiconductor industry could thus be able to offer ASIC's  [application-specific integrated circuits] based on a  0.35-micron technology before the end of 1996, that is, before  the JESSI program terminates.  <H5>  IC's as of April 1994 </H5>   The fact that there is design rule compatibility for  0.5-micron IC's among suppliers does not mean that the  technologies of the participating companies are identical, apart  from those of SGS-Thomson, Philips, and Mietec (Philips has been  developing its technology at SGS-Thomson's Crolles [France]  plant and Mietec is manufacturing IC's in Belgium under license  from SGS-Thomson). For instance, SGS-Thomson's 0.5-micron,  3.3-volt technology is characterized by double-gate transistors  which make it as fast as the 0.7-micron, 5-volt technology. And  the company's stacked via technology with tungsten-filled holes  makes for increasing integration density.    Starting dates for the distribution of the IC's will be  slightly different depending on the company: The 0.5-micron  technology is being tested by SGS-Thomson-Philips, Siemens, and  Matra MHS, while qualification -- and therefore the release of  the final version of the 0.5-micron library cells -- is  scheduled for early 1994. As for ES2, GEC Plessey, and Mietec,  they will be ready a few months later.    ES2, for example, will finalize its compatible design rules  during the first quarter of 1994, and will market its 0.5-micron  library in time for customers to start designing in the second  quarter of 1994. At the same time, ES2 will conduct the  qualification phase of its 0.5-micron technology -- directly  derived from the JESSI program -- until late 1994 or early 1995,  when the first operational 0.5-micron IC's will start coming out  of the Rousset plant.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S., VENEZUELA OK STEPPED-UP EFFORT ON DEBT  </P> <P> President Bush and Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez agreed Saturday to  begin intensive work on a plan to reduce Venezuela's $33-billion foreign debt,  making the country one of the first "test cases" of America's new Third World  debt strategy.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said the meeting between the two leaders, which lasted for  almost two hours, was designed both to provide new political impetus to the  effort to help Venezuela with its debt problems and to coordinate the two  leaders' policies on Central America.  </P> <P> Administration officials said top economic policy-makers from the two countries  would begin intensive sessions this week to work out a concrete debt-reduction  plan. The Venezuelans are here for a meeting of the 151-nation International  Monetary Fund.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear how much in actual debt relief Venezuela would be  able to obtain. Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. Brady is to unveil the  broader U.S. debt strategy at a special meeting today of finance ministers from  seven major industrial nations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mixed Reaction to U.S. Plan  </P> <P> Initial reaction to the U.S. proposal, which Brady outlined broadly on March  10, has been mixed. U.S. officials say support from Perez, who is one of South  America's elder statesmen, could have a major impact on how other Third World  countries react to the plan.  </P> <P> "The focus (at the White House meeting) was on implementation (of the new debt  relief ideas) -- let's get on with it," a U.S. official said. "Nobody has any  question about the urgency of the economic situation in Venezuela."  </P> <P> Besides Bush and Brady, Secretary of State James A. Baker III also attended the  White House meeting.  </P> <P> The new Brady debt plan essentially would offer to help debtor countries reduce  the cost and size of their huge foreign debt by asking the IMF and the World  Bank to serve as catalysts for schemes under which banks could write down their  loans and swap them for guaranteed bonds.  </P> <P> The proposal is designed to replace the previous debt strategy, outlined by  Baker when he was Treasury secretary in 1985, which called on banks to provide  new loans to help debtor countries finance economic reforms. (See related story  in Business, Page 1.)  </P> <P> Venezuela, the oldest democracy in Latin America and a major oil producer, has  been in a crunch since oil prices collapsed in the early 1980s. Perez, a  moderate socialist, imposed economic reforms after his inauguration in January,  touching off riots that claimed 300 lives.  </P> <P> Although Perez publicly has blamed the riots on the "intolerable and obscene"  burden of repaying his country's foreign debt, U.S. officials said he struck a  more conciliatory and pragmatic tone in his talks with Bush, promising to  continue overhauling his economy.  </P> <P> "He made it clear that he understands that countries that don't reform and  restructure their economies can't escape blame for their own problems," the  official said.  </P> <P> U.S. and Venezuelan officials have already held preliminary talks to discuss a  debt reduction strategy, but Bush and Perez directed their aides to accelerate  the negotiations this week, several officials said.  </P> <P> Treasury officials have been hoping to move quickly to apply the new plan to  two or three countries in hopes of blunting criticism that the proposal is  ineffective and making it more credible to debtor countries, many of which are  embroiled in political unrest and are facing leftist challenges.  </P> <P> Besides Venezuela, U.S. officials also have been considering Mexico as a  candidate for quick action under the new proposal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Investment Potential  </P> <P> "We discussed the potential for Venezuela as one of the first test cases (of  the Brady plan)," the official said. "As an oil exporter, Venezuela can attract  new capital flows better than some other countries."  </P> <P> Officials said it was too early to predict how soon a concrete plan for  reducing Venezuela's debt might be ready, however.  </P> <P> The United States wants finance ministers of the seven largest non-Communist  industrial nations to endorse the plan today and agree to refine it further  between now and the seven-nation economic summit in Paris in July. Besides the  United States, the group includes Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy  and Canada.  </P> <P> In their meeting Saturday, Bush and Perez also discussed the situation in  Nicaragua, where the Administration has launched a new strategy to put  diplomatic pressure on the ruling Sandinista regime for democratic reforms.  </P> <P> As part of its pressure, the Administration has won approval from congressional  leaders for continued non-military aid to the Contras.  </P> <P> Perez, who has played a key role as a mediator between the Sandinistas and  Nicaraguan opposition groups, assured Bush of his general support for the new  U.S. approach and said he understood the rationale for the continued Contra  aid, one official said.  </P> <P> But the Venezuelan disappointed some U.S. officials by ducking an opportunity  to make his support public when he left the White House without pausing to talk  with reporters.  </P> <P> Bush and Perez also discussed the situation in Panama, where the United States  has mounted an abortive campaign to oust the military strongman, Gen. Manuel A.  Noriega.  </P> <P> Along with Bush, Perez has been pressing Noriega to allow free elections in  Panama next month, although U.S. and Venezuelan officials are privately  pessimistic about the chances for an untainted vote.  </P></p>

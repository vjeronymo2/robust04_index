			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by </F> Miriam Mrizova; place and date not given: "Rudolf Scharping  Claims in Exclusive Interview for SME: German Government  Spokesman Is Deceiving"]    [Excerpt] [Mrizova] Accusations have appeared in the  German news to the effect that Chancellor Kohl has bribed  correspondents in the Federal Press Office who create an image  of you as an incompetent politician. The Social Democrats  supposedly want to address a complaint to the Federal  Constitutional Court in this matter.    [Scharping] With its propagandistic contributions, the  Federal Press Office is increasingly abetting the present  government, its spokesman Dieter Vogel is deceiving parliament,  and his office is infringing upon political neutrality that is  prescribed by the Constitution. Because State Secretary Vogel  is responsible for the Federal Press Office, he should bear the  consequences for this affair and resign from his post. The  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will use all  parliamentary means to resolve this situation. It is now  working on a motion that will initiate a ban on the continued  publication of such contributions by the Federal Press Office.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Jardine Matheson in fund management joint venture MATHESON INVESTMENT Management, part of Jardine Matheson Holdings, and BDO Binder Hamlyn, the accountancy firm, yesterday formed a joint venture to manage Pounds 300m of combined investment funds. Matheson has bought a majority stake - believed to be 80 per cent of the equity - in Binder Hamlyn Investment Management for an undisclosed sum, to create a new company called BDO Matheson Investment Management. The new venture - one of the first such launched by an accountancy firm - boosts Binder's funds from their current level of Pounds 125m, which is mainly derived from large private clients. The existing staff of 13 will be increased to 20, and be based in Matheson's office in London. Mr Roderick Collins, a director of Matheson and the chairman of the new venture, said the company would offer a range of global equities and fixed income investment. He said the venture had been driven by a desire from Matheson to expand its portfolio and to generate economies of scale. Mr Edmund Wood, a partner with Binder Hamlyn who will serve on the new board, said: 'We are very excited by the venture. It will grow and strengthen the services to our clients.' He said it would strengthen the reputation of the firm in investment management because, 'the approach and ethos of an accountancy firm are not necessarily identical with investment managers. It is a distinct discipline.' He denied that the resignation of Mr Chris Swinson - the national managing partner of Binder Hamlyn who left the company last Thursday after his replacement was appointed - would have any effect on the arrangements. Mr Wood said Binder Hamlyn Investment Management was established four years ago and became profitable two years ago after achieving a portfolio of Pounds 80m.</p>

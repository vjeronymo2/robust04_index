			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Observer: Little by little If Tarmac does press the button and have its rumoured rights issue soon, will the company mark the occasion by changing its chairman? Sir Eric Pountain, who turned 60 earlier this month, has had a good innings and handed over the executive reigns to Neville Simms early last year. Along with Graeme Odgers and Bryan Baker, he was the reason Tarmac was regarded as one of the best-managed companies in its field in the early 1980s. However, he was not the best chairman for a recession and Tarmac now needs an injection of new equity to repair its earlier mistakes. Having a powerful former chief executive on the board can often make life difficult for a new chief executive keen to put his own stamp on the company. Ten years ago Tarmac was the biggest in its sector. Today, in terms of market capitalisation, Blue Circle is nearly twice as big and Redland almost three times. If Sir Eric does choose to bow out, Sir John Banham seems the most likely internal candidate to succeed him.</p>

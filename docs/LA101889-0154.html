			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBC STALKS RATINGS WITH RAMIREZ STORY;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: HIS CONVICTION MEANS "TRACKDOWN" WON'T NEED A REWRITE AND THAT THE  MOVIE WILL BE READY FOR THE SWEEPS.  </P> <P> Sept. 20 was a "fairly jubilant day" on one particular Hollywood movie set, the  producer related. That was the day on which Richard Ramirez was found guilty of  conducting his reign of terror as the Night Stalker.  </P> <P> In two days, cast and crew would be done and -- whew! -- wouldn't have to do  any new scenes.  </P> <P> As it is now, the NBC movie of "Trackdown: The Search for the Night Stalker"  ends with that festive arrest of "suspect" Ramirez in East Los Angeles and his  delivery to the County Jail pending trial. The producers are putting a crawl on  the screen explaining that Ramirez was subsequently found guilty of 13 murders  and 30 other felonies and was sentenced to death 19 times.  </P> <P> Had he been found innocent, well, "It would have been a scene of him released  from jail, vindicated by the court system," said executive producer Leonard  Hill. "But we didn't have to shoot it."  </P> <P> The murderous rampage took five months in 1985. The trial took 14 months and  the jury deliberations 22 days. Although the movie took only 20 days to  photograph, the project started about the time of Ramirez's arrest in August,  1985. The script was done about two years ago; NBC gave the production order  early last year.  </P> <P> Now the producers are racing like the wind to get "Trackdown" edited and scored  and generally beautified for airing during the November ratings "sweeps" (the  date hasn't been set yet). NBC is paying the overtime.  </P> <P> The story took some of the best criminal minds in Hollywood. Consider their  rapsheets:  </P> <P> Len Hill produced "Jack the Ripper" and "Nitti: The Enforcer" last season.  Veteran TV cop-show writer Joe Gunn had 20 years in the Los Angeles Police  Department before retiring as a commander; he ran all the detectives on the  Westside and checked all the homicide calls. Tony Masucci, NBC vice president  for movies and miniseries, has done movies on multiple killer Ted Bundy, the  Billionaire Boys Club and the Hillside Strangler murderers.  </P> <P> The heroes of this trackdown are Los Angeles Sheriff's Detectives Frank  Salerno, who also was a key investigator on the Strangler, and Gil Carillo.  They were selected as the point men in pursuit of what at first was a local  character known quaintly as "The Valley Intruder." Then, from the San Gabriel  Valley, the madness exploded into the San Fernando Valley and Orange County,  then San Francisco and the whole state.  </P> <P> The officers are portrayed by Richard Jordan as Salerno and A Martinez as  Carillo. Veteran character actor Jordan knows something about demented people:  He played the twisted, sweating serial killer to Kurt Russell's reporter in the  feature "Mean Season."  </P> <P> Young actor Gregory Cruz was cast in the unenviable role of Ramirez. He has  very few lines, and represents more of a presence than a person, since the  story focuses on the tracking down and not on the persona of the satanist  himself.  </P> <P> Shortly after Ramirez was captured, Gunn got a call from NBC saying that  several writers were talking Ramirez projects and asking what he thought. He  said he didn't like the idea of focusing on the killer.  </P> <P> "I thought a far more interesting movie," he said, "was from the point of view  of the detectives and how they captured him and about the panic that covered  not only L.A. but the whole state. The heat and the fear and the panic buying  of guns. How one guy had kind of changed our whole pattern of living."  </P> <P> Why wasn't the movie done right away?  </P> <P> "The primary reason was a respect for law enforcement," Hill said. "There was a  sense that if we did the show, those law enforcement officials who worked very  hard to apprehend Ramirez and prosecute Ramirez stood the risk potentially of  mistrial based on the way we treated the movie before the trial itself was  resolved."  </P> <P> The movie is "scrupulously true," said Hill, and "extremely accurate," said  Gunn. The only fictionalization of any significance is a composite journalist  called Ann Clark (played by Lisa Eilbacher).  </P> <P> Asserted Hill: "The arc of her story is based on very pertinent events that  relate to that classic quandary that every journalist dealing with these kind  of stories confronts, the reporter's responsibility to print all the news  that's fit to print -- but occasionally not print because of the implications  of revealing sensitive information."  </P> <P> One or more of the true-life journalists -- the producers won't say who --  discovered key evidence that police wanted to keep undisclosed for fear that it  might undermine an important avenue of investigation. In the movie, Clark's  editor at the TV station insists that this information should be used; the  reporter finally says no.  </P> <P> "Various reporters are taking credit for it," Hill said. "I've never discussed  it personally with any of them. We've had triple corroboration and the key  corroboration came from Salerno. He said, yes, indeed, there was a problem when  a reporter or a couple reporters tumbled onto footprint information which had  been the one thread the cops were able to knit through a few different crimes."  </P> <P> Then came the major breakthrough, an informant who turned up after the county  supervisors approved a reward. The informant knew about jewelry that had been  burgled and fenced by the Stalker and "said the guy's name was Rick and he was  a Latino from El Paso," Hill explained.  </P> <P> Using new laser technology, they found a single print in a suspect Toyota and  it led to "Rick" Ramirez. With the name, police raised his photo.  </P> <P> Hill said that much previously unreported information on the case will be  related in the film -- including a major dispute over whether to release the  photo of Ramirez to the media. Investigators Salerno and Carillo insisted that  distributing the photo might prompt Ramirez to take flight; Sheriff Sherman  Block and Police Chief Darryl Gates felt that the public needed to know to  protect itself, even if it hindered the pursuit.  </P> <P> Said Hill, "Well, the best drama is always an argument between people who are  both right."  </P> <P> Meantime, life goes on. Or, more appropriately, death goes on.  </P> <P> Hill's next release is "Cross of Fire," an NBC miniseries set for Nov. 5 and 6.  Starring John Heard (as KKK Grand Dragon D. C. Stephenson), Mel Harris, David  Morse and Lloyd Bridges, it's another true tale of romance, murder and revenge  in 1920s Indianapolis.  </P> <P> Gunn is consulting on the new-new "Adam 12" and "Dragnet" -- with 104 deadly  episodes ordered for syndication. There's bound to be some murders in there. No  comedies, he said.  </P> <P> Is Masucci planning any more mass murdering? "Certainly true-life crime is a  subject that all networks and movie makers continue to go back to because there  seems to be an audience fascination with that kind of stuff," he said.  </P> <P> "I guess the next thing we're doing is Joe McGinniss' 'Blind Faith.' It's not  mass murder but true-life crime. It's going into production the end of the  month."  </P> <P> In the miniseries, Robert Urich plays insurance executive Rob Marshall, now  residing on Death Row for killing his wife.  </P> <P> Also coming up on the NBC longer-form schedule: "Murder in Mississippi,"  "Murder in Paradise," "Man Against the Mob II: Man in Cement," "Perry Mason:  The Case of the Murder Mystery Murder," "Drug Wars: The Camarena Story,"  "Howard Beach: Making the Case for Murder" and "Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes."  </P></p>

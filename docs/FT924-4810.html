			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Twelve fail to agree on border controls EC interior ministers yesterday failed to agree how to end internal border controls on people before the end of 1993, let alone by January 1. The London meeting was the last chance for ministers to agree a compromise solution before the end of this year - deadline for the barrier-free single European market. Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner, proposed yesterday that all member states should pledge to eliminate 'systematic' internal border controls on people during 1993. But Mr Kenneth Clarke, British home secretary, who chaired the meeting, said afterwards that no member state could promise to lift all passport checks. EC airports have already been given until December 1993 to lift controls on internal EC flights. Britain is the firmest opponent of lifting internal border controls on people and will go no further than reducing checks on EC nationals to a minimum. Mr Clarke, whose intransigence on the issue angered a number of ministers, said member states were moving at different speeds towards the goal of lifting controls. 'In my opinion there's no prospect of taking it very much further forward until we see what the various member states do in the course of 1993,' he said. Continental member states intend to lift checks on all travellers within the Community in due course, but are worried that external frontiers are not yet strong enough. However, Dutch diplomats said the UK presidency should have pressed for a more positive outcome. Spanish officials also complained that their efforts to lift controls by the end of the year would be undermined by delay.</p>

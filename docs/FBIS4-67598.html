			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 17 (BTA) -- A three-day  Bulgarian-British seminar on AIDS started here today. A  delegation of five British specialists led by Prof. Nicholas  Day, head of the Institute of Public Health, Cambridge, will  deliver lectures on the social aspects of the disease to 50  Bulgarian specialists. There are four major topics to be  addressed: Registering the HIV-positive and those who have  developed the full symptoms of the disease, exerting control  over AIDS patients, the way society treats them, and statistical  modelling.    The seminar has been organized within the Tempus Programme.  Its coordinator for Bulgaria, Prof. Ivan Chernozemski, told a  BTA reporter that they are seeking to modernize Bulgarian  education and the operation of social medicine departments and  to improve prophylaxis.    According to the National Preventive Medicine Centre, to  date  121 individuals have tested HIV-positive in Bulgaria. 24 of  them have developed the symptoms of the disease and 18 have  died. However, the No AIDS Foundation believes that the number  of those infected with the virus is much greater, reaching  between 800 and 1600. About 4 million of Bulgaria's 8.5-million  population have taken the test so far. Bulgaria ranks 8th in  Europe by the number of HIV- infected. Eleven infants were born  by HIV-infected mothers. One of them tested positive, four are  healthy, the others are kept under observation. The virus has  spread most widely in Burgas and Gabrovo, but Sofia and the  Black Sea resorts should not be ignored, either, said Associate  Professor Zdravka Argirova, head of the Central AIDS Laboratory.    Unlike other European countries, in most of the cases in  Bulgaria the virus has been transmitted sexually. Of the  HIV-positive 45 percent are between 19 and 25 years of age and  got the virus from their sexual partners. Ever since the  obligatory monitoring of blood and blood products for HIV was  introduced in 1987, the blood transfusion path for transmitting  the virus has been cut. Only 10 patients were infected in that  way before 1987. The homosexuals are also ten, the others got  infected in heterosexual contacts. According to Ms. Argirova,  young people are the ones who fall into the high-risk group.  Their lacking in sexual education is the main reason for the  spread of the disease, doctors say.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECALLING 'FORGOTTEN GENOCIDE';  </P> <P> ARMENIAN GROUP DISTRIBUTES CURRICULUM GUIDE  </P> <P> A Glendale-based Armenian organization has begun distributing the first  English-language curriculum guide to teach about what Armenians call "the  forgotten genocide" -- the killings of more than a million Armenians by the  Ottoman Turkish regime.  </P> <P> The guide was published by a branch of the Armenian National Committee, one of  several Armenian-American political organizations with offices in the Los  Angeles area. The handbook is a suggested lesson plan for teaching about the  deaths, which occurred between 1915 and 1923.  </P> <P> Titled "The Armenian Genocide," the guide evolves from more than half a century  of attempts by Armenian groups to establish the deaths to the American public  as an example of genocide, which is defined as the systematic killing of a  national or ethnic group.  </P> <P> It is unclear at this time whether teachers will use the material.  </P> <P> The nature and intent of the deaths have long been the subject of fierce and  often violent disagreement.  </P> <P> Armenian scholars say that Talat Bey, then interior minister of the Ottoman  Empire, explicitly ordered a mass killing of Armenians in 1915. The Turkish  government says there was never a calculated plan of extermination.  </P> <P> Turkish officials do not deny that many Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks  during World War I, but they put the number of deaths at closer to 300,000.  They contend that Armenians killed about as many Turkish Muslims during the  period.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scholar Disputes Genocide  </P> <P> "I dispute that there was a genocide of Armenians. I don't believe that is an  appropriate term for what was a combination of international war, an  inter-communal war and especially death from starvation and disease," said  Justin McCarthy, a Mideast scholar and author of several books on the Ottoman  Empire who is chairman of the department of history at the University of  Louisville, in Kentucky.  </P> <P> "It would be proper to present both sides of the contentious historical issue,  but they have deliberately not done that. They have deliberately picked the one  side that is most politically expedient."  </P> <P> Armenian scholars say that the massacre is beyond dispute.  </P> <P> California Department of Education officials said this week that the decision  whether to use study materials prepared by independent groups is left to school  districts and in many cases to individual teachers.  </P> <P> Vic Pallos, a Glendale school district spokesman, said that district officials  have not yet had time to assess the curriculum guides.  </P> <P> The 84-page handbook is illustrated with stark pictures of victims and  bedraggled survivors. It details the history of the Armenian people, the deaths  that the community continues to mourn and the result -- the scattering of  Armenians around the globe.  </P> <P> The guide was written by Garine Zetlian, a 27-year-old doctoral candidate in  Armenian and Mideast history at UCLA. Zetlian said she researched both Turkish  and Armenian archives in preparing the handbook and received assistance from  Armenian scholars nationwide, including Richard Hovanissian, a UCLA professor  who is regarded as a national authority on Armenian history.  </P> <P> "Genocide in general and the Armenian genocide in particular have fallen out of  textbooks of recent history and civilization," Hovanissian said. "We want to  motivate teachers to devote a couple of weeks to this subject in an otherwise  very crowded curriculum."  </P> <P> The guide is one of several study aids prepared by Armenian organizations to  accompany the "Model Curriculum for Human Rights and Genocide," which was  ratified by the State Board of Education in October, 1987. The development of  the model curriculum was mandated by the California Legislature in 1985, after  years of intensive lobbying by Armenian and Jewish organizations and other  minority groups.  </P> <P> Under the guidelines prepared by the State Department of Education,  California's school districts in 1988 began adding "human rights with  particular attention to the inhumanity of genocide" to the regular social  studies curriculum of students in grades 7-12.  </P> <P> The curriculum includes, in addition to the Holocaust and the deaths of the  Armenian people, a discussion of the Ukrainian famine brought on by Soviet  agricultural policies in 1932-33, the mass murder of Poles during World War II,  slavery in the United States, recent human rights abuses in Argentina, Cambodia  and South Africa and discrimination suffered by Asians, Latinos, women, the  handicapped, gays and Native Americans.  </P> <P> "For someone who doesn't have any idea who the Armenians are or where they come  from, the handbook offers a more elaborate presentation of who we are and the  genocidal process," Zetlian said. "Our hope is that educators will familiarize  themselves with the document and decide to use it in the classroom."  </P> <P> Zetlian said she sought suggestions from curriculum planners and teachers to  develop the guide, which includes maps, vocabulary lists, suggested questions,  puzzles and an extensive bibliography.  </P> <P> Completed in December, more than 300 complimentary copies of the guide have  since been sent from the Armenian National Committee branch on Colorado  Boulevard to schools throughout Southern California, where more than 250,000  Armenians live. Committee officials said they plan to distribute the book  nationally, but will charge $10 a copy.  </P> <P> The Armenian Assembly, a political organization with offices in Hollywood, is  also distributing study materials about the Armenian deaths to California  educators. The Assembly's publication -- also being distributed for free -- is  an extensive bibliography of documentation and secondary sources about the  genocide, rather than a lesson plan.  </P> <P> In teaching about the deaths of their people, Armenian community leaders and  outside scholars agree that they are following the example of American Jews,  who have for years produced an enormous reservoir of educational material to  teach about the Holocaust.  </P> <P> "When the Holocaust began to be talked about, it was first by Jewish survivors,  and it took Jewish scholars to bring to the fore the specifics of the Holocaust  and its place in history," said Margot Strom, director of Facing History in  Ourselves, a private, nonprofit research center in Boston devoted to the study  of human rights abuses. "I think the same thing is beginning to happen with the  Armenians."  </P></p>

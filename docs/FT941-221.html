			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / EU boosts duty-free allowance European travellers will from tomorrow be allowed to bring almost four-times more goods into the European Union from other non-EU countries such as Turkey or the US, the European Commission said yesterday. The new allowance raises the monetary limit on goods purchased at duty-free shops outside the union from Ecu45 (Pounds 34) to Ecu175. The decision had been taken as part of a general reform of the European customs system, which is seeking to give European consumers greater freedom to bring in tax-free goods for personal consumption. The allowance for duty-free goods bought within the union has been doubled to Ecu90, although the numerical quotas for cigarettes and alcohol brought into the union from non-EU countries will remain the same.</p>

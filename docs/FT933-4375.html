			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Directors' pay shoots ahead TOTAL earnings of top company directors rose by an average of 12 per cent in 1992-93, nearly three times the average increase gained by the workforce generally, say figures published yesterday by Income Data Services, the employment research organisation. The analysis of directors' renumeration is drawn from annual reports from FT  -SE 100 companies covering trading years ending between September 1992 and March 31 1993. The average increase for the workforce to June, according to government figures, was 3.5 per cent. IDS also gave the median increase of 8 per cent for top directors, which it said may perhaps more accurately reflect the situation because average figures were heavily influenced by large increases. There was an enormous range of increases and decreases around the levels, IDS said. The highest increase was at Carlton Communications, the media group, where the chairman's total emoluments jumped by 84.2 per cent to more than Pounds 530,000 - made up of a 42.5 per cent salary rise and a performance-related bonus of Pounds 120,000 from a newly established scheme. IDS said: 'In a spirit of greater openness the annual report outlines the rationale for the rise.' Carlton yesterday pointed to a special remuneration committee's report. It concluded that the chairman's salary 'did not recognise his contribution to the company or its progress over the last year, nor did it reflect the market level for such a position.' At the other end of the spectrum total earnings of the food group Argyll's top director dropped by 43.9 per cent. IDS said this reflected the fact that a long - term bonus was paid in the preceding year and such bonuses were awarded only every three years. Excluding bonuses, base salary for the top director at Argyll was increased by 7.7 per cent. No identifiable link between company performance and pay increase was seen in its analysis, IDS said. In five companies the highest-paid director's bonus increased despite a fall in both profits and earnings per share. In only three companies, Kwik Save, Rentokil and British Telecommunications, did the rise in bonus levels closely match the increase in profits and earnings per share.

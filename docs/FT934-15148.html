			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Virtuality valued at Pounds 44.4m in placing VIRTUALITY GROUP, the designer and manufacturer of virtual reality computer games, is to obtain a full Stock Exchange listing by placing 7.43m shares at 170p each, to raise Pounds 9.45m net. The funds will be used to provide additional working capital, to finance product development, and to redeem outstanding preference shares. Dealings in the shares are expected to commence on October 19. The placing gives Virtuality - which was founded in 1987 - a market capitalisation of Pounds 44.4m. The biggest single shareholder will continue to be Apax Partners, the venture capital company, at 50.9 per cent. The total holding by directors will be 12.1 per cent. Other Virtuality employee holdings will amount to some 5 per cent of the enlarged share capital. Motorola intends acquiring 3.8 per cent and IBM (Europe) 2.2 per cent. Motorola and IBM's decision to invest in the company is thought to be connected with its programme of developing home-based virtual reality technology, aimed at bringing what is at present only available in games arcades into the living room. Virtuality currently has an installed base of some 360 game machines across the world. Mr Jon Waldern, managing director, said that the flotation and the capital raised would enable it to continue developing high performance virtual reality technology. The total number of shares in issue following the placing is 26.1m; the value of the shares being placed in this flotation is Pounds 12.6m. The percentage of enlarged share capital being placed is 28.4 per cent. The group had turnover of Pounds 5.24m in the 1992 year, with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 217,000 and earnings per share of 1.1p.</p>

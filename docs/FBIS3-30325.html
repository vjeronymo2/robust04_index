He said that the two countries have agreed to set  up a joint commission for cultural cooperation.    Daskalov stressed that his country would not allow its  relations with Iran be influenced by pressure of foreign powers.  He said that differences of views existed between the two  countries with regards to settling the Bosnian crisis but added  that this cannot hamper expansion of Tehran-Sofia relations.  He said his country favoured lifting sanctions on former  Yugoslavia adding that Iran has a different approach to the  issue. He added that the U.S., Russia and the U.N. play a key  role in settling the Bosnian crisis.

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (10): Awash with wrong sort of space - London and the Western Corridor / The laws of supply and demand imply significant growth over the next few years - providing the economy maintains its momentum The decision by BZW to move a large slice of its back-office operation into Canary Wharf and Morgan Stanley's commitment to an extra building there speak volumes about the changing atmosphere of London's office markets. Another page could be added if the London Futures Exchange takes the same trip down-river from central London. Two years ago - maybe even at the beginning of 1994 - these would have been treated as merely the rumours of tenants squeezed out through shortage of new space in the City and West End. Now the news that the supposed white elephant of Docklands has filled another 1m sq ft is greeted with a shrugged: 'I told you so' by many agents. They have long predicted that when a few big companies sniffed economic recovery and made much-postponed moves, the rest would realise just how little space is available for expansion. That might sound ludicrous when the market is awash with empty buildings in a broad swathe stretching from Docklands to the Thames Valley. Total supply seems monumental at 11.8m sq ft in the City and 8.7m sq ft in the West End, according to Jones Lang Wootton's Third Quarter Review. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley tops that up with another 10.6m sq ft in its M25 Survey. But it is the wrong sort of space. Vast numbers of second-hand buildings are practically unlettable because they are no better - and often worse - that the space which tenants already occupy. Vacancy rates in new premises are down to 4 per cent in the City and as low as 1.6 per cent in the West End, says JLW. Around the M25, some 10 per cent is available, but KFR points out that less than 3m sq ft is new, and most of the 1m sq ft absorbed in the three months to September was in recently-built offices. Some companies enjoying rising corporate profits might feel they can relocate further afield into the Western Corridor, which has traditionally acted as a relief valve for London. But Chris Hiatt of JLW points out that there are only five buildings larger than 100,000 sq ft free in the stretch from Hammersmith to Bracknell. Smaller appetites may also find poor pickings. Only 15 new buildings more than 20,000 sq ft are available in central Berkshire, which covers office centres such as Bracknell, Reading, Slough and Windsor, says Marcus Henley at Weatherall Green &amp; Smith. That represents only 2 per cent of total stock. Inevitably, rents have begun to respond to the changing market balance. City analysts are sceptical about claims that values are showing first signs of growth since 1989, but Christopher Jones of Chesterton insists that City deals are in the pipeline at more than Pounds 35 a sq ft. This compares with a norm of Pounds 27.50 to Pounds 30 earlier this year. Admittedly, these headline figures hide letting incentives. Analysts will become more enthusiastic when rent-free periods disappear, but at least these are softening to less than two years in the City and 18 months in the West End. Landlords are also holding out against 10-year break clauses introduced over the past couple of years, says Kevin Clarke of JLW. While no-one expects boom-time rents of Pounds 70 a sq ft to return in the near future, the laws of supply and demand imply significant growth over the next few years - providing the economy maintains its momentum. One extra advantage is that business rates will fall in London from 1995, giving tenants something extra to play with. Developers refuse to count their chickens after taking a roasting in the slump, however. Only 700,000 sq ft is being built in the City and just a little more in the West End, says Mr Clarke. Things are little different out in the Western Corridor. 'Only three buildings are due to be finished by the end of next year,' says his colleague, Chris Hiatt. 'It is difficult to see how this will satisfy demand. We think rents will bounce back, with Hammersmith hitting Pounds 30 by 1998.' Developers should get a move on, because any good scheme around the M25 area will attract strong pre-let interest, says Stephen Mallen of KFR Research.</p>

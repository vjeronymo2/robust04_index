			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIMMY SANTIAGO BACA TO APPEAR TODAY ON LATC'S POETRY READING SERIES  </P> <P> Poet Jimmy Santiago Baca, the mestizo (half Chicano/half "detribalized Apache")  who taught himself to read and write while imprisoned and who recently won the  American Book Award for poetry for his "Martin &amp; Meditations on the South  Valley," will appear today at the Los Angeles Theatre Center.  </P> <P> He replaces Russian poet Bella Akmadulina, who had to postpone her appearance  because of visa problems, said Alan Mandell, poetry/literary series producer.  </P> <P> Baca, whose other works include "Immigrants in Our Own Land" and the  forthcoming "The Black Mesa Poems," was originally scheduled to read his poetry  along with poet Victor Hernandez Cruz on April 17. He will not appear on that  date but Cruz will appear as scheduled. Those holding tickets for Bella  Akmadulina's appearance will be admitted to Jimmy Santiago Baca's reading  today. The Los Angeles Theatre Center is currently negotiating to reschedule  Akmadulina for a date next year.  </P> <P> For more information, contact the box office at (213) 627-5599.  </P></p>

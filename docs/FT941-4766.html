			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Economic Watch: Oil demand revised upwards The International Energy Agency forecast for oil demand in OECD countries in the first quarter of 1994 has been revised upwards by 0.1m barrels a day, to 40.3m. European demand is expected to be temporarily subdued as a result of very mild weather, but is projected to rise modestly in 1994, to 13.7m b/d, from 13.6m in 1993. The IEA revised upwards European demand in the fourth quarter of 1993 by 0.2m b/d to 14m b/d, but the agency said this reflected an increase in stocks, rather than any underlying increase in oil consumption. Further stockbuilding in Europe during January has left stock levels 'above normal', the IEA said. Outside the OECD, demand in the former Soviet Union is expected to decline by 0.6m bpd in 1994, from 5.6m bpd in 1993. The Hamburg-based HWWA economic research institute has forecast real growth of 5 per cent in German exports in 1994, after a 6 per cent fall in 1993. East German exports should also grow, it said. Western German retail trading sales fell a real 2 per cent in January from a year earlier, and stagnated in nominal terms. Retail sales in January were down an average 37 per cent from December. Hungary's unemployment rate fell to 12.6 per cent in February from 12.8 per cent in January, with the number of registered unemployed falling by 11,000, to 630,600.</p>

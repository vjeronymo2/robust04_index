			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Faruq Qaddumi, head of  the PLO Political Department, has said that the march of  Palestinian-Jordanian cooperation and coordination in all areas  is necessary in order to maintain joint interests and bolster  cohesion between the two peoples on clear bases employing  effective mechanisms and demonstrating a zealous and determined  spirit.    In an interview with the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY, Qaddumi  stressed that the issue of cooperation between the Palestinian  and Jordanian brothers can only be viewed as an indisputable  fact that should not ignored. He said there was no serious  coordination or cooperation for a period of time, but serious  work began after the emergence of dangers resulting from new  facts following the signing of the Declaration of Principles.    He said that joint interests strongly influence both parties  and that our common fate is left to its destiny. He stressed  that we should take quick and wide steps on the road of  cooperation and coordination in order to face future challenges  that will be reinforced by many upcoming political, economic,  and social changes.    Answering a question on Israeli procrastination during the  peace negotiations, Qaddumi said: Any observer of Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's stands, since the signing of the  Declaration of Principles, will notice that he is hesitant and  stringent and is adopting decisions that he intends to implement  by force.    Qaddumi added that, through his political policy, the  Israeli  prime minister aims at containing the West Bank and Gaza Strip  in a a somewhat coercive manner. At the same time, the Israeli  prime minister is announcing that the dates of withdrawal  stipulated in the Declaration of Principles are not sacred.    Qaddumi noted that Rabin is justifying his failure to commit  himself to these dates by what he calls the issue of security.  He insists on keeping the military positions inside the areas  from which the Israeli Army is supposed to withdraw.    He explained that the issue of security is subject to  discussion because Israel is considered the country with the  strongest military power in the Middle East. Israel has  concluded agreements with Egypt and the Palestinians and is  expected to conclude agreements with the rest of the Arab  parties concerned with the peace process. Qaddumi said that  Israel owns weapons of mass destruction, stressing that Israel's  pretext of maintaining its security are void in the face of  these facts that are known to the entire world.    Qaddumi said that Rabin insisted in the recent negotiations,  which concluded with the Cairo agreement, on controlling the  crossing points, and he is still prevaricating by not defining  the Jericho area, which was 345 square km at the time of the  British mandate. The Israelis, he noted, are holding  negotiations over every inch of this area, although the  agreement stipulates another withdrawal from all these areas  after two months.    He went on to say that the Israeli prime minister instructed  the negotiating delegation to be intransigent enough to depict  Israel as if it is the owner of the right to this territory and  that it is offering a piece of it as a grant to the Palestinians  to live on. They forget UN Security Council 242, which is the  basis for a political settlement.    Qaddumi said that the Israelis insist on maintaining a  presence in the Palestinian territories through military and  security posts or settlements. The Israelis also insist on  taking part in the administration of security issues in the Gaza  Strip and Jericho areas from which they will withdraw. They  also insist on freedom of movement for the Israeli Army and  settlers in these areas.    He noted that the Israelis are expanding Israeli settlements  and are connecting them to wide streets patrolled by a joint  force of Israeli soldiers and settlers. He said that everyday,  the Israeli prime minister is placing more nails in the coffin  of the Declaration of Principles. At the same time, he is  announcing that his coercive policy will lead to a just and  lasting peace.    Qaddumi noted that Rabin is setting conditions for  withdrawal. These include reaching economic agreements and a  customs unity, approving the shekel as an official unit of  currency, getting familiar with members of the national  authority and studying their files, as well as controlling who  enters and leaves Gaza and Jericho.    Qaddumi said: How can Rabin ask this before the  Palestinians start to run their own affairs? One of the basic  conditions for signing contracts is that we have sovereignty  over our land, complete sovereignty so that we can sign  contracts on customs, financial, and other affairs as an equal  to Israel.    Qaddumi said that the Israelis are trying, through their  current policy, to convince the world that they will reach a  just solution to the Palestinian cause while they impose more  restrictions on our people and on our occupied Palestinian  homeland. He said that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations,  and the Arab-Israeli negotiations in general, will expose the  Israeli stand and that the world at large will see through  tangible evidence that Israel rejects peace and is leading the  region toward more tension, anxiety, and instability.    In reply to a question on international assistance to the  Palestinians, Qaddumi said that several countries that  participated in the economic conference in Washington on 1  October last year had set the sums they will allocate as  economic assistance to the Palestinian people in the West Bank  and the Gaza Strip.    Qaddumi added that the World Bank was charged with  administering the these funds to finance economic projects the  Palestinian territories need. He said that intensive contacts  were held with all the concerned parties to start the  implementation of these projects, and that, particularly, some  European countries had asked us to deal with them on a bilateral  level and through the EC.    Qaddumi explained that certain Islamic states have offered  financial assistance to cover some current expenditures and that  there is a need for more funds to cover expenses in security,  education, health, and other fields. He said implementation  will start as soon as possible on some projects for which  contracts were signed with the donors.    Qaddumi referred to statements by Israeli officials that  European and U.S. assistance will not reach the Palestinians  unless agreement is reached on all outstanding issues. He  stressed that the concerned quarters in the donor countries were  asked to protest these statements, which are viewed as a form of  blackmail.    Qaddumi said that some Islamic states have offered  assistance, specifically for covering part of the current  expenditures and to keep institutions in the occupied  territories operational while other countries have earmarked  their grants and loans for building projects, and maintaining  and developing already established institutions.    Speaking about the criticism some Palestinian and Arab  parties leveled at the Cairo agreement, Qaddumi said: Every  Palestinian has the right to level constructive criticism at  Palestinian officials. Such a right should be nurtured  throughout the Arab homeland. The Cairo agreement and the  Declaration of Principles are not sacred and one can criticize  them, but in a constructive and not a destructive manner, in a  manner that unites and does not divide, and in a manner that  strengthens one's resolve to achieve national unity.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / The Long View: Fair play in the tax war ALREADY THERE is a powerful movement to take monetary policy out of the grubby and inflationary hands of rresponsible politicians. Need we stop there? At times like these it can seem an attractive idea that taxation, too, should be made a no-go area for the squabbling and scheming vote-catchers. I know that the right to design and gather taxes is one of the fundamental powers of a government. As the American revolutionary slogan put it, from the other viewpoint: no taxation without representation. Our Conservative government appears to think that tax is its only winning policy area in the imminent general election. Perhaps I could make a compromise proposal: no politician should be permitted to make a statement about tax without prior clearance from an independent fiscal regulator. Such an Office of Fair Taxation would never have permitted National Insurance Contributions - now levied at 9 per cent of pay up to Pounds 390 a week - to have remained alarmingly wide open to deception. Either NICs should be insurance premiums, actuarially justified by defined benefits, or they should be rolled up into income tax. Labour's proposal to levy NICs on higher income groups without extending any corresponding benefits is surely fiscally fraudulent. If the charge were honestly described as income tax, on the other hand, Oftax would have absolutely no grounds for complaints (although perhaps the voters would). All Tory claims that the Conservatives are the party of low taxation would come under especially close scrutiny by Oftax, bearing in mind that tax revenues during the last period of Labour administration represented a lower proportion of GDP than on average during the past 13 years of Tory rule. Taxation is not just a question of the standard rate of income tax. Some people, although Conservative ministers might not understand this, pay more in VAT than in income tax. Any knighthoods from time to time conferred on the distinguished directors-general of Oftax would not be decided by either government or opposition, but rather by a panel of impeccably objective financial and economic journalists. Come to think of it, ageing but still serviceable commentators might make ideal candidates for the job itself. The greater challenge for the fiscal regulator would be to prevent the development of ever-increasing complexity in taxation. Politicians have an incentive to raise the nominal tax rates, but offset these with a maze of allowances and exemptions. This is how political power is expressed, and political reputations are made. The doziest Member of Parliament knows how to whip up a national outcry on the issue of imposing VAT on children's clothing. The rational economist, on the other hand, would like to see low rates of tax, universally applied so as to prevent distortion and favouritism. We have few things to thank Nigel Lawson for, but one was his consistent campaign to bring down tax rates, both personal and corporate. But he could not resist the temptation to introduce his own tax shelters, notably Personal Equity Plans. And it is not only the creation but also the dismantling of tax shelters that can cause trouble. I was reminded of this by the news during the week that house prices went down yet again during January. Residential property values have been consistently soft since higher rate mortgage interest relief was abolished in last year's March Budget. There are other reasons for the weakness, but the change was singularly ill-timed; an embarrassed Treasury had to wriggle in December to avoid being forced into a U-turn when the government insisted that the house market should be propped up. In the event stamp duty was temporarily lifted instead. Phasing out tax relief on mortgage interest was perfectly justified in principle, but it should have been done when house prices were booming in the late 1980s. Indeed, Lawson wanted to do it then but was overruled by Margaret Thatcher. So when the Treasury seized its opportunity just four months after Thatcher had gone it was overwhelmingly on political grounds, and was without regard to the developing crisis in the housing market. You can see a much bigger problem of the same kind with the Labour party's tax proposals. Millions of people earning upwards of about Pounds 21,000 a year are faced with large increases in National Insurance Contributions and, above about Pounds 40,000, higher income tax, too. In a strong economy there might be a reasonable case for raising higher rates of tax. But the effect in the context of a serious recession is to make an already bad situation worse: not so much a kick-start as a kick-stop. Again, a political decision is being applied regardless of the circumstances. Moreover, should Labour ever gain power the proposals would threaten to spark off a new wave of evasion (accountants, I know, would call it avoidance) of the kind that created so many scandals in the 1970s, when tax was at rates up to 98 per cent on investment income. One tax rate that Nigel Lawson actually raised was that of capital gains tax for those in higher income brackets. This happens to be the time of year when otherwise sane people sell securities one evening and buy precisely the same investments back next morning. This daft procedure creates work for stockbrokers, but benefits nobody else. It happens because CGT breaks the rules of efficient taxation, by being applied at a comparatively high rate (up to 40 per cent) yet with an exemption for gains of up to Pounds 5,500 within a tax year. If CGT were charged at a low rate there would be less call for bed-and-breakfasting. The tax avoidance and investment industries are eagerly looking forward to a Labour government. Already the investment institutions are attracting huge sums into Personal Equity Plans, which make little economic sense for most people except as refuges from high future Labour taxes. Once in power, a Labour Chancellor would no doubt create his own pet tax shelters, for instance regional investment funds, to encourage investment in places which few rational businessman would touch. You cannot keep the politicians away from the fiscal honey-pot. At least we have representation, but then we have misrepresentation too.</p>

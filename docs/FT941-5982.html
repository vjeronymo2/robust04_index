			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold joins in general decline Gold, often seen as a haven in times of turmoil in financial markets, failed to live up to this reputation yesterday. As stock and bond prices went into free fall on world markets, gold also lost ground, closing in London at Dollars 375.75 a troy ounce, down Dollars 5.55. However, Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, pointed out that governments were still determined to keep inflation under control and would consider increasing interest rates to do so. 'Higher interest rates are not good for a non-interest earning asset like gold,' he said. 'People are holding cash in the expectation that interest rates will rise.' Mr Smith said that if gold could hold above the technical support level of Dollars 376 an ounce for a few more days it could move up again. He warned, however, that the investment funds that last year made profits by chasing up the price of gold might start to push the price down if they thought the time was ripe. Market sentiment was also affected by increased hopes that there would be no violent conflict during the elections in April in South Africa, the world's biggest gold producer. Dealers said trading was thin and demand weak. 'Gold was being tugged about by other precious metals,' said one. Silver's price closed in London down by 12 US cents an ounce at Dollars 5.245 while platinum fell by Dollars 6.25 an ounce to Dollars 386.50. Platinum was also affected by Engelhard, the US precious metals group, announcing that Ford Motor would soon begin limited use of its all-palladium automotive catalyst. These catalysts are the biggest consumers of platinum. The market has been aware of the all-palladium catalyst for some time and this has helped the palladium price move up from Dollars 80 an ounce last November to Dollars 135.</p>

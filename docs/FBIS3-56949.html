Ariyoshi Sibata, president of the Japanese company "Toen  Shiozi", which mediated the deal told TASS on Friday by  telephone from Beijing, where he is currently staying, that his  company engages in trade in scrapped metal and therefore is  interested in cooperation with Russia which has huge amounts of  decommissioned machinery, including military equipment.    He rejected claims of U.S. mass media that Russia and North  Korea had signed a deal envisaging shipments of a whole fleet  consisting of 40 submarines which Pyongyang may use for training  and as spare parts for its military equipment.    In October 1993 Sibata's company brokered a deal upon a  North  Korean request to ship three decommissioned and dismantled  diesel submarines from the Russian Pacific Fleet to Pyongyang.    Sibata said the submarines had no armaments, were heavily  covered with rust and were semi-submerged. The submarines had  already been delivered to North Korea where they were cut into  pieces 1x1.5 metres in size to be used as scrap metal, he added.</p>

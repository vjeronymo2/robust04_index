			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes The near 3 per cent drop in Cadbury Schweppes' share price against yesterday's buoyant market trend must be galling for the company which last month announced the best interim results in the food manufacturing sector. It is especially so when Tesco's agreement to market Virgin Cola - the immediate trigger to the share price fall - poses a minimal direct threat to Cadbury's profits. Only 4 to 5 per cent of total group earnings derives from soft drinks sold in UK supermarkets. Of that a fraction is Coca-Cola sold in Tesco. But the link between Tesco and Virgin, which will lend its name to a drink brewed by the Canadian Cott Corporation, is symptomatic of change in the balance of power between retailers and food manufacturers. Supermarkets' private label products have gained ground at the expense of traditional brands, skewering manufacturers' margins. Until recently one segment of the market which has resisted the threat has been soft drinks, where the own label share of the market rose modestly from 28 to 33 per cent between 1980 and 1993. However J. Sainsbury's launch of its Classic Cola earlier this year turned the tables against the manufacturers. Tesco's link with Virgin Cola is a further assault on the plump margins earned by Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages. To a large extent, the share price reaction reflects sentiment rather than fundamentals. But that sentiment is understandable - the Cola wars may spread spread beyond the supermarkets. The Tesco/Virgin deal is the thin end of an unpleasant wedge for Cadbury.</p>

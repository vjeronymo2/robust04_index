			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> EC PUSHES FARM SUBSIDIES CUT  </P> <P> The European Community made a surprise proposal today to break almost four  years of deadlock in farm trade talks, challenging world trading partners to  cut subsidies to farmers by 30% by 1996.  </P> <P> Ray MacSharry, farm commissioner for the 12-nation EC, sprung the plan at a  closed-door meeting of agriculture ministers from Australia, Canada, Japan and  the United States.  </P> <P> The United States, which has been at loggerheads with the EC over farm trade  reform, appeared taken aback by MacSharry's proposal, which would take into  account any subsidy cutbacks made since 1986.  </P> <P> Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter, who has called on the community to  overhaul its agriculture policies, said Washington will not officially respond  to the offer until it is formally made at world trade talks.  </P> <P> "This is not a negotiation," Yeutter said, referring to the meeting here. It  had been billed as informal, and no dramatic initiatives were expected.  </P></p>

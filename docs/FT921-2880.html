			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: John Major: The Movie starts to roll - The Campaign Machine: Conservative / The Tories' style shift from past poll battles ASK Mr Chris Patten how the Conservatives are running their general election campaign and the party chairman's first response is a negative: not like 1987. Ask him on which issues the campaign will be fought and he offers a negative and a positive: Labour's tax plans and Mr John Major's leadership. The recession is to be ignored. When it must be acknowledged, it is to be blamed on the world economy, fear of a Labour government or, privately, the mistakes of Mr Major's predecessors. Facing the closest election since the early 1970s, Mr Patten's priority is to avoid the confusion, the personal and political rivalries, and the sheer incompetence which allowed Labour to win the campaign five years ago. Then it did not matter. In 1987, the slick efficiency of his campaign machine could not overcome voters' distrust of Mr Neil Kinnock's policies. This time the party that wins the campaign will win the election. So the message from Conservative Central Office is that there will be no repeat of the rows between Downing Street and Smith Square which dogged the party in 1987. The prime minister and party chairman, who have become good friends as well as close political allies over the past 16 months, agreed well in advance the main elements of the campaign. As one insider puts it: 'There can be no recriminations if things go wrong.' Of course, there will be more to the campaign than solidarity at the top - about Pounds 20m more. The Conservatives, notoriously secretive about their finances, are not prepared to put any figure on how much they will spend in the quest for a fourth term. But senior figures do not demur at speculation that the final bill will approach Pounds 20m. One member of the party's ministerial 'A team' suggested at the weekend that if it was still behind in the opinion polls in the final days before April 9, it might add another Pounds 4m or so to that figure in a burst of last-minute advertising. Shaken and rather humiliated by Labour's superior style in 1987, the Tories intend to be more sophisticated, better-organised and more aggressive than their main rival. This time there will be lots of Tory glitz. Mr John Schlesinger, the Hollywood film director, has been drafted in to make 'Major: The Movie'. Central Office is spending Pounds 500,000 on a pantechnicon to haul round the country the set for half-a-dozen 'Major in the round' question-and-answer sessions. Mr Andrew Lloyd Webber has rearranged a piece by the composer Henry Purcell to produce a new theme for Tory election rallies. Shirley Bassey, Sarah Brightman and Paul Daniels are among those enlisted to give the party celebrity appeal. Mechanics are in the hands of Mr Shaun Woodward, the communications director recruited by Mr Patten on the recommendation of Mr Jonathan Dimbleby, a mutual friend. The young but self-assured Mr Woodward has asked Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to repeat the magic which won the Conservatives the 1979 election but faded somewhat in 1983 and 1987 before the agency resigned the account. Mr Maurice Saatchi leads a team of 25 working full-time on the account. The aim is to reactivate the fears that led the skilled working classes to desert Labour for Mrs Thatcher during the 1980s. There is a less-than-subtle subtext: Labour cannot be trusted because Mr Kinnock cannot be trusted. Look how often he has changed his mind, the Tories will say. Can voters be sure he will not do so again? It is only then that the positive message appears. The focus is Mr Major, Mr Major and Mr Major. The theme is ing Street in which he abolished the poll tax, led the country to victory in the Gulf war and ushered in a new, more caring, brand of Conservatism, the prime minister deserves his own mandate. The pitch is not for a fourth Tory term but for a first Major term. The manifesto published tomorrow - built around the distinctly un-Thatcherite concept that wealth and welfare go hand in hand - is designed to give substance to the image. But it is the man rather than the policies that the campaign is designed to sell. As one self-confessed cynic on the Conservative team puts its: 'They (the voters) like John Major and they are afraid of Labour's tax plans. We shouldn't clutter their minds with too much else.'</p>

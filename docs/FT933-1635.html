			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / World Trade News: South Africa issues telephone licences THE South African government last night approved the award of two cellular telephone licences to consortia of local and overseas investors, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg. The ANC has protested that the government should not issue licences without its approval, raising suspicions that the group was trying to delay the issue to give US and Scandinavian companies a chance to participate once the ANC has authorised the lifting of sanctions imposed by those countries. Such a move is likely as early as tomorrow. Licences went to Vodacom, a consortium in which Vodafone of the UK has a 35 per cent stake along with the public utility Telkom with 50 per cent and Rembrandt with 15 per cent, and Mobile Telephone Networks, which includes Cable &amp; Wireless, the local cable company M-Net and a group of black investors. It is believed that 30 per cent of MTN will be reserved for black ownership. Each licence is expected to involve an investment of about R1bn (Pounds 200m), with an estimated R700m coming from abroad.</p>

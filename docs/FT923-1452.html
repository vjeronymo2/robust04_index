			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: EC Commission faces a bruising shake-up - About half the 17 commissioners will be replaced in December traditionally a lively spectator sport as EC member governments, commissioners, and candidates lobby and intrigue for the few real jobs in the Brussels executive - is shaping up as a rather sombre affair. This is not because the jockeying for position is less fierce than at previous ends-of-term for the Brussels executive. Indeed, about half the 17 commissioners will be replaced when their four-year mandate expires at the end of December. It is the continuing uncertainty over the Maastricht treaty which has taken most of the fizz out of the spectacle. Whether or not Maastricht ends up being ratified, the Commission not only faces a big reshuffle at the top, but a morale-bruising shake-up throughout its civil service. 'The present set-up is hardly tenable,' admits a senior Commission official. Hostility towards Maastricht has been fuelled as much by widespread popular perception that 'Brussels' is out of control as by what the treaty contains. 'We need to send a signal that this is a shrinking bureaucracy, and one that has got the message,' says another top official. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, returned from his summer break determined to use the reshuffle as a lever to re-order the executive's priorities, and thoroughly reform its organisation. Since his arrival in 1985, he has revitalised the Commission, won a reform of EC finances, and offered Brussels bureaucrats an integrationist vision of the single market - and then Maastricht. But to make the bureaucracy work, he has relied on an informal network of capable loyalists, and the prestige and combative projection he himself has given the Commission. But within a maximum of two years from January - the period for which Mr Delors has been reappointed by the 12 - this network will be wound down. There is a real risk that an already vulnerable Commission will become invertebrate. Only if the Commission puts its own house in order will it be able to defend itself against increasingly sovereignty-conscious governments, and increasingly irritated citizens, who want to cut Brussels down to size. The first outline of the reshuffle of the 17 commissioners is beginning to emerge. Four commissioners are definitely going - Ray MacSharry, Carlo Ripa di Meana, Antonio Cardoso e Cunha and Vasso Papandreou; seven (including Mr Delors) are virtually certain hold-overs; and there are differing degrees of uncertainty about the other six. Not all member governments have made up their minds on who to nominate. The Commission clearly needs to attract politicians of real standing. Whether it will be able to depends on how Brussels emerges from the Maastricht ratification battle, and how central a role it retains in shaping Europe's future. Under the more democratic arrangements almost everyone now agrees are essential for the EC to re-establish its popular legitimacy, many argue it is vital to have front-rank figures in the Commission. 'We need 'live' politicians,' says one senior official, 'people with a future who are looking over their shoulders to see how what they are doing is playing with the voters.' The presidential ambitions Mr Delors has nursed in France, this official suggests, are part of the vitality the former French finance minister injected into the Commission from 1985. Reshuffling commissioners is, at the best of times, like multi-dimensional chess, with each member state's domestic as well as European interests on the board. But this is not the best of times. An overshrunk role, moreover, risks turning the Commission into a refuge for displaced politicians - as it was before Mr Delors took over. The Commission's ability to attract depends on how it is reformed, and what the member states want, or will allow it to do. The majority view is likely to end up being that the Commission should do less, and do it better. Mr Delors would probably add that it should have all doubt about its rights to intervene removed by a code of conduct on 'subsidiarity'. This would establish clear EC and national spheres of influence, oblige the Commission to demonstrate that Community action is needed because measures would be ineffectual at national level, and require governments to substantiate their objections in the same terms. Mr Delors himself wants more formal political control over the Commission to be exercised by its secretariat general, which operates now as part administrator, and part informal network. A beefed up secretariat would have a purview over four or five central areas of EC policy, such as the internal market, foreign relations and regional policy. It would know what was going on right across the Commission with potential impact in these areas. The object would be to minimise internally contradictory proposals, and the meddling for which the Commission is sometimes fairly, but often unjustly accused. Most important, the secretariat would assess whether there was a real need for the Commission to bring forward legislation. Officials and outside experts say about nine of the existing 23 directorates general (DGs) are considered ripe for possible re-organisation, merger, or closure, although they warn it could take a long time to get the chemistry right. Brussels' foreign responsibilities, now spread over several DGs, are likely to be more unified, with responsibility for foreign trade policy conceivably passing to the industry directorate - a pet scheme of Mr Martin Bangemann, the German industry commissioner, to replicate Japan's Miti. EC structural aid spending, now spread over three DGs, would also be unified more round the regional policy directorate. The social affairs directorate, now internally divided into three, effort-duplicating areas, could be reorganised, and the powerful agriculture directorate could be limited to a core activity of commodity market management, with its internal market and trade dimensions hived off to the relevant DGs. Such a scenario would probably lead to the closure of four directorates: for small to medium-sized industry; fisheries (if it is amalgamated with agriculture); for co-ordinating structural aid; and the ineffectual information directorate. Resistance can be expected from inside the Commission, and possibly from member states that may feel unfairly treated in the new share out of top civil service posts. But most insiders feel a more powerful impulse will be the Commission's need to fight for its place at the centre of European development.</p>

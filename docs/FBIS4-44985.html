			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Amritsar, May 1--Akali politics under the `guidance'  of the Akal Takht and influence of the Sikh clergy today took a  new turn with the dissolution of six leading Akali Dal factions  and formation of a new political party--the Shrimoni Akali Dal  (Amritsar), reports UNI.    The new party made a "historic Amritsar declaration,"  renewing the `age old Akali' demand for the "formation of a  separate area (state) for the Sikhs wherein the `quam'  (community) can experience the glow of freedom and freely  profess and propagate its religious view-points and at the same  time uplift Punjabi culture."    The declaration was read out at a public rally held inside  the Golden Temple complex after the culmination of the week-long  Akali unity process in which all the frontline Akali factions  barring the Akali Dal (Badal) had participated.    In the declaration, the Akalis speaking on the lines of the  Anandpur Sahib resolution also demanded that India be  re-organised into a confederation of states wherein every  religion and community could freely profess and propagate its  views and culture. The declaration warned that if this demand  for bringing about changes in the Indian constitution on federal  lines was not met then the Akali leaders would be left with no  option but to launch a struggle for an "independent sovereign  Sikh state."    The Akali Dal which were dissolved today were the Akali Dal  (Kabul), the Mann Dal, the Manjit Dal, the Babbar Akali Dal,  Akali Dal (Panthic) and the Talwandi Akali Dal. The Badal  faction of the Akalis aligned with the SGPC [Shiromani Gurdwara  Prabandhak Committee (Sikh Temple Management Committee)] chief,  Mr Gurcharan Singh Tohra, also announced their decision to leave  their parent body and join the SAD [Shiromani Akali Dal (Akali  Religious Party)] (Amritsar).    The frontline leaders of the dissolved Akali factions who  had  taken part in the unity process which was started on Monday last  under the guidance of Akali Takht acting Jathedar Prof Manjit  Singh took a pledge to preserve and protect the interests of the  new party.    In the pledge read out by Bhai Manjit Singh who had still  yesterday headed the Manjit Dal, the Akali leaders decided to  re-dedicate themselves for the betterment of the Sikh community  and for achieving the proposed demand for a `separate Sikh area.'    Besides Bhai Manjit Singh the other leaders who took the  pledge before the public gathering were former Punjab chief  minister and Kabul faction leader Mr Surjit Singh Barnala, Mr  Amrinder Singh of the Panthic Dal, Mr Simranjit Singh Mann, Mr  Jagdev Singh Talwandi and Col Jasmer Singh of the Babbar Dal. Mr  Barnala, who declared the formation of the new party, also  announced to formation of a six-member committee consisting of  the above-mentioned six leaders to run the affairs of the party.    The Amritsar declaration which was read out by Col. Jasmer  Singh, former general secretary of the Babar Akali Dal soon  after Mr Barnala finished his speech, was also greeted by the  public. The contents of the one-page document created confusion  for newsmen who wanted to know whether the Akalis had demanded  an "area for the Sikhs" within the Indian union or a separate  independent state.    The declaration while raising this demand castigated the  Congress leaders, who at the time of the Indo-Pakistan partition  had promised the then Sikh leaders a similar "independent area"  for the Sikhs. These leaders had betrayed the Sikhs as they did  not create such a state, Mr Jasmer Singh said while reading out  the document.    The document while drawing comparisons of the political and  social realignments world-wide said it was only in such a Sikh  state that the interests of the minorities could be protected  and there would be scope for the expansion of Punjabi culture.  Both Sikhs and Punjabis could feel free to profess and propagate  their religion and culture in this `free zone', the document  added.</p>

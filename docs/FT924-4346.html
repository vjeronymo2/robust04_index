			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Kohl rejects idea of 'Europe a la carte' MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday urged member states of the European Community not to rush into economic and monetary union (Emu) too hastily, simply to preserve their national pride. Clearly implying that a two-speed Europe was better than an unstable union, he rejected any suggestion that political pressure could be used to undermine the strict requirements of the Maastricht treaty on European union. And Mr Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, warned that Europe could not indefinitely move at the pace of its slowest member states. He was speaking as the German Bundestag voted overwhelmingly in favour of the ratification of the treaty, after a debate which was marked far more by doubts and misgivings than by outright enthusiasm. The vote was by 543 votes to 17, with eight abstentions. Chancellor Kohl spoke against any attempt - particularly from Britain - to try to enlarge the EC into a 'glorified free trade area'. He also rejected the concept - with both Britain and Denmark under suspicion - of turning the EC into 'Europe a la carte', by allowing member states to pick or choose the bits they wanted to belong to. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, expressed his fears about the increased powers of the German federal Lander in future EC negotiations, as enshrined in new amendments to the German constitution. Foreign policy must remain the prerequisite of central government, he said. Mr Waigel, who comes from the fiercely independent state of Bavaria, disagreed, saying the strengthening of federal controls over the central government was all to the good. And then speaker after speaker worried about the lack of democratic controls over the integrated European institutions, because of the failure to give enough powers to the European parliament. The message was clear: the vast majority of the German political establishment remains wedded to the concept of European integration, above all to lay to rest any revived fears of German nationalism and hegemony. Yet doubts about the details, not least about the democratic control of European institutions, and about the future stability of a single European currency, have not been laid to rest. The result is that the Bundestag is insisting on a decision before embarking on the last stage of Emu, to determine if the convergence criteria have been observed by all EC states planning to join. It is also writing in to the German constitution that no further steps to European union are possible without adequate democratic controls.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: US stores put a revival plan on the counter / A report on the slow struggle back to health for Allied and Federated When Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores Corporation filed for protection from their creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code in January 1990, the move symbolised the ending of debt-laden Eighties. 'Loan Spree seems over,' ran one newspaper headline. The groups - taking nine chains, ranging from Manhattan's Bloomingdale's to Lazarus in Cincinnati and Bon Marche in Seattle - had been bought up by Canada's Campeau Corporation via two leveraged bids. The first, in late-1986, had given the Canadian property developer control of Allied for Dollars 3.6bn; the second, in 1988, allowed it to snap up Federated for Dollars 6.6bn. Yet, within a year of this latter deal, problems had started to emerge, and by late-1989 it was clear that there was insufficient cash flow from the stores to service the massive debts taken on to acquire them. With little prospect of asset sales bringing in desired prices, bankruptcy ensued. Total estimated claims - at the January 1990 filing date - were put at around Dollars 8.2bn. This week, Federated and Allied summed up a very different trend in US corporate life. Late on Monday, the two companies, together with their immediate parent, Federated Stores Inc (FSI), filed their own suggested reorganisation plans with the Cincinnati courts - and quickly ran into complaints from some creditors. In short, another slow and costly struggle back to corporate health seems to be under way, as the excesses of the previous decade are remedied. The plans are inevitably complex, although the basic structure is clear enough. Essentially, creditors of the two stores groups would be offered a mixture of cash, new debt securities and equity in a new company, formed by the merger of Allied and Federated's department store interests (there is already common senior management). The equity would almost certainly be listed, and no significant assets would be sold off. The aim is to pluck the group from Chapter 11 by early-1992. Who would get what under the reorganisation plan is dealt with at length. General unsecured claims against Federated, for example, would receive stock in the new merged group; general unsecured claims against Federated subsidiaries would get cash and some medium-term notes; and so on. At the end of the day, the plan suggests that the ongoing group might carry around Dollars 2.8bn of debt. The value of its equity is assumed to be around Dollars 2.3bn, although the plan stresses that this figure is derived from a whole heap of assumptions. As for creditors of FSI, the parent of the two stores group, they would swop their claims for stock in the merged Allied-Federated group and in Ralphs, a Los Angeles-based supermarket group which is owned by FSI but not part of the Chapter 11 process. Campeau itself, which is a large creditor of FSI, would end up with 14.79 per cent of Ralphs. That would be its only link with the US stores it once owned. Whether this will wash with all the creditors is a moot point. Under the US bankruptcy system, the debtor has a prescribed period when it has the sole right to file any reorganisation plan. Although there has clearly been some dialogue with the creditors, Allied and Federated made no attempt to pretend that Monday's scheme has anyone's blessing. 'Some disagreement on various aspects of the plan as proposed has been expressed by creditor representatives,' they conceded, adding 'we would have been surprised if it were otherwise at this juncture.' One bone of contention centres on whether assets from within the retail groups should be sold, thus reducing the size of the merged company (and increasing the cash outlay). That said, not all creditors are unenthusiastic about Monday's proposals. Lawyers for the Federated bondholders' committee - representing about Dollars 800m of senior secured debt - were quick to say that they 'support Federated/ Allied's intent to maintain a reasonable level of debt' and are substantially in favour. Another grey area, as far as the plan's potential success is concerned, is the very substantial claim - running to hundred of millions of dollars - submitted by the Internal Revenue Service. 'It is anticipated that the IRS and other tax claims will be resolved,' remarked Federated/Allied blandly, 'but we cannot comment on specific amounts at this time'. Finally, reorganisation details aside, there is still the extremely difficult US retail climate to contend with. So far, 1991 has been a patchy year for the two stores groups, and progress on the nation's high streets may be every bit as tough to achieve as progress in the courtroom.</p>

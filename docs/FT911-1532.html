			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Financials help bourses achieve further modest advance MOST BOURSES achieved modest gains yesterday, as financial stocks continued to attract buyers. But Amsterdam was depressed by a subdued London market, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was led higher for the second day by the banking sector, on hopes that German interest rates could be on the way down. But the real-time DAX index fell from a high of 1,636.80 to close just 1.80 up at 1,631.84, 0.5 per cent higher on the week and its best closing level since late August. Volume eased to DM5.3bn from DM5.8bn. Among banks, Dresdner put on DM7.50 to DM387.50 following favourable recommendations from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, while Deutsche, which is making a series of presentations to investors in the US, rose DM3.70 to close at DM660. Continental, the tyre manufacturer which is fending off a takeover bid from Italy's Pirelli, fell Fl 1.30 to Fl 210.50. After the market closed, Continental said it was halving its 1990 dividend and that its 1990 group net profit had fallen to DM93.4m from DM228m. Although the 1990 results were in line with an earlier company warning and with its defence document, analysts feared that Continental was being too optimistic when it said that profits would not fall further in 1991. The car sector went against the trend. Volkswagen, due to present 1990 results on Tuesday, lost DM3.30 to DM371 while Daimler, due to report on May 15, fell DM3.80 to DM701.20. MILAN rose across the board in moderately active trading, led by continued buying of the insurer, Generali. The stock rose L760 or 2 per cent to L37,600. The Comit index climbed 4.71 to 586,24, up 0.6 per cent on the week, in volume estimated at around Thursday's L125bn. Fiat rose as high as L5,280, although it was officially fixed L96 or 1.8 per cent higher at L5,251 on hopes that the carmaker would maintain its dividend on 1990 results. However, one analyst said he would not be surprised if Fiat cut its 1990 dividend on ordinary shares to L200 from L370 to reflect the company's deteriorating earnings, which he forecast would drop by 54 per cent in 1990. He noted that paying a steady dividend, including Treasury stock, would cost Fiat 57 per cent of its 1990 net profits, compared with 25 per cent of net profit the previous year. However, he added that while cutting the dividend made sense from a business point of view, it was a difficult political decision for Fiat to take as it would risk alienating the investment community. MADRID celebrated its return from a two-day holiday with a 1 per cent gain, after the Spanish Treasury cut its 10-year bond yields. The general index closed up 2.65 at 278.39, for a 0.6 per cent rise on the week. Turnover was moderate at about Pta13bn. Hidrola lost Pta9 to Pta571 and Iberduero eased Pta3 to Pta735 after the electricity utilities confirmed their plans to merge late on Tuesday. PARIS edged higher after Thursday's 2.5 per cent rise, with the CAC 40 index adding another 8.08 to 1,832.31. Turnover, however, was thin. Over the week, the bourse gained 3.2 per cent. Recent brokers' reports have lifted Michelin and Suez during the week. Yesterday Michelin gained another FFr1.10 to FFr96.20 and Suez, which released results on Tuesday, rose FFr1.60 to FFr351. AMSTERDAM was held back by the UK market, which was disappointed by the Tories' performance in local elections and by a weak start on Wall Street following jobless data. The CBS tendency index closed at 95.4, 0.8 down on the day and little changed on the week. Hoogovens, ex dividend of Fl 4.40, closed Fl 4.10 lower at Fl 59.10, while Elsevier, ex dividend of Fl 2.10, was down Fl 1.90 at Fl 87.10. ISTANBUL fell on profit-taking after two days of gains. The index fell 104.66 to 3,881.18, down 3.9 per cent on the week. ATHENS also declined, the general index losing 28.65 to 1,143.58, for a fall on the week of 3.8 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open     10 am    11 am    Noon     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close 1126.81  1126.29  1127.37  1125.62  1126.10  1128.76  1128.70  1129.77  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               Day's High   1133.36     Day's Low   1125.09  ----------------------------------------------------------------------     May 2      May 1        Apr 30              Apr 29     Apr 26   1128.32    1110.32***    1111.29              1120.75    1115.94  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) *** Indicative.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Fall in employer-funded education worries CBI The Confederation of British Industry and education organisations said yesterday they were disappointed at figures which showed that employers have cut sharply the number of workers they send on further education courses. The figures came at the same time as others which showed that employees who want extra training were resorting to paying for classes themselves, and were often using holiday time to attend them. The Department of Employment is to work with the Further Education Training Council, which supplied the figures, to try to explain why employers are not taking up part-time training places. The number of part-time students funded by employers has fallen by 7 per cent - in spite of new financial incentives to do so. The Confederation of British Industry said it was unhappy with the figures - but suggested that the decline in employer take-up would prove 'transient'. Many recruits were staying longer in education and did not attend day-release schemes when they started work, while the recession had hit overall recruitment and so the numbers of employees being sent on training courses. The Association for Colleges described the take-up from employers as 'disappointing'. The number of part-time day students funding themselves has risen 16 per cent in the 1993-94 academic year - more than twice the government target. Further education colleges were removed from local authority control and became independent institutions in April last year. Funding council figures show that the number of full-time students has since increased by 8 per cent. But the overall rise in numbers was restricted to 5.1 per cent compared with a government target of 6.9 per cent. Numbers taking evening classes also dropped. Greater London saw the sharpest increase in further education take-up at 9.3 per cent while in East Anglia the increase was only 3.0 per cent. Employer-led participation dropped 12.9 per cent in Yorkshire and Humberside, but rose by 4.6 per cent in London. Mr Tim Boswell, further-education minister, said the overall expansion had 'confounded the doom and gloom merchants', but added that colleges should make clear to industry that further education could improve business.</p>

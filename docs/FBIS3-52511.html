Karimov. The  visit, resulting in a series of agreements and memorandum of  understanding between both the countries, besides high-level  deliberations, is bound to take their bilateral relations to new  heights in the new year. The Uzbekistan, the land of the  builders of India's historic Taj Mahal, offers a very lucrative  mosaic of opportunities to Indian entrepreneurs, businessmen,  and industrialists. It is time for Indian businessmen to give  up inhibitions and invest in this former Soviet republic known  for gas deposits, coal reserves, non-ferrous metals and gold.  Now pursuing the path of a free market economy, Uzbekistan is  witnessing considerable foreign investment flow. The changed  global scenario definitely demands Indian businessmen to break  the barrier and tap the available opportunities in the land  where people also love Indian films and adore Raj Kapoor, the  doyen of Indian cinema.    As Mr. Karimov put it after his arrival in New Delhi on  Monday, he would not like Indian businessmen to be left behind.  Besides strengthening cooperation in economic areas, the two  countries can launch a joint offensive against fundamentalism  and extremism with India playing a greater role in Central Asian  region in political fields as well. During his meeting with the  Indian president, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, the Uzbek president  said that the disintegration of the Soviet Union had created a  vacuum in Central Asian region. India has a special  relationship with the countries of the region when Europeans and  other countries are to get a foothold. [sentence as heard] The  agreements and memorandums of understanding now being entered  between the two countries involve cooperation in economic and  other areas, including telecommunications, science and  technology, culture, and transport and transit. The Uzbek  president earlier held formal talks with the Indian prime  minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and discussed bilateral issues  with several Indian ministers. India had recently extended a  credit of $10 million for setting up projects with Indian  know-how and entrepreneurial participation in Uzbekistan.  Projects worth $7.8 billion [as heard] for Uzbekistan have also  been approved in addition. Uzbek personnel are being trained in  India in disciplines such as diplomacy, banking, management and  mass communication. In the area of joint ventures, the two  countries are also producing electronic and brass wares.  India's (Thapar Group) is also to set up a cotton yarn plant in  Uzbekistan.    Close interaction between the top leaders of both the  countries has been on ever since the Central Asian Republics  attained independence two years ago. While New Delhi was the  first city that Uzbek president, Mr. Karimov, visited outside  the Commonwealth of Independent States in 1991 after his country  decided to break away from the former USSR, Indian Prime  Minister Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao reciprocated the gesture in May  last year when he chose Uzbekistan as his first destination  within the CIS as prime minister. Only last year, five  agreements on cooperation in science and technology, tourism,  avoidance of double taxation and cooperation between the foreign  offices of the two countries were signed during the visit of the  Uzbek deputy prime minister, Mr. (T.M. Miryakubov). Mr.  Karimov, accompanied by a delegation from Uzbekistan, including  the foreign minister and chairman of board of dealing with trade  like industry, economic relations, civil aviation and tourism  met leading Indian industrialists and entrepreneurs to explore  possible areas of cooperation. This visit is likely to open a  new era in India-Uzbekistan links with this Central Asian  country creating conditions for mutually beneficial cooperation  and encouraging ties with foreign companies, firms and financial  institutions.</p>

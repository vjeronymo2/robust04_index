			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Lenders aim to ride out mortgage storm: David Barchard on why home repossessions are down while arrears have risen HANGING OVER the latest gloomy set of repossession and arrears statistics from the Council of Mortgage Lenders is an even grimmer question: what is going to happen to the 305,140 people who are more than six months in arrears with their mortgage payments? Since Christmas, lenders have done their best not to evict borrowers. As a result, the figures for repossession show a deceptive improvement. The 35,750 in the first half of this year were 8.2 per cent down on the second half of 1991. The slackening has several causes. Lenders are well aware that prices in the housing market would tumble even faster if they repossessed homes of customers in trouble as swiftly as they would have done two or three years ago. Since December they have also been under strong political and media pressure not to repossess homes. Although they say that the number of mortgage accounts in arrears of between two months and six months peaked last autumn and has been falling gradually since then, arrears over six months are getting steadily worse. Yesterday's arrears figure compares with 275,000 at the end of last year and 221,900 a year ago. People more than six months in arrears with their mortgage payments often have other debts and their chances of righting the situation are usually slim. Since January, building societies have tried to offer deals to customers who have even a faint prospect of financial survival. Mr Mark Boleat, director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said he believed that most cases of long-term arrears would not go as far as repossession. His confidence seems to be based on pledges by lenders that customers who stick to revised payment arrangements will not be evicted when the market improves. Halifax Building Society, the largest mortgage lender, says categorically it will not evict any customer who keeps up with a payment agreement. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, is much more pessimistic than Mr Boleat. He warned that arrears might be well above expected levels of 65,000 or 70,000 this year and stay very high for several years to come. He said: 'I fear that over half of the 305,140 cases will eventually be forced to give up their homes. Unless the economy starts to recover, their prospects will be very bleak indeed. The irony is that an economic recovery depends largely on a recovery in the housing market.' He said the situation had passed the point where lenders could have much impact on the arrears backlog. Since the start of the year, only a handful of individuals had been saved from eviction by mortgage-into-rent schemes operated by building societies and housing associations. Barring direct government intervention to save home-owners from eviction, it seems inevitable that the next few years will see repossessions running at levels around or above the 75,540 recorded last year. Repossession will be a severe embarrassment to the government and is one of several factors keeping the housing market subdued. However, since the end of last year lenders have managed to keep the stock of repossessed houses on their books more-or-less unchanged at around 68,000. But the thought that the housing market may not after all be drowned in a flood of repossessed houses is no comfort for families in debt who know that sooner or later they are going to be forced out of their homes. THE BIGGEST single housing association contract, worth Pounds 60m to build 1,500 homes, was awarded yesterday to Countryside Properties, the publicly quoted residential, commercial and industrial property developer, Andrew Taylor writes. The contract, for affordable homes in parts of London and south-east England, was granted by South Thames Housing Partnership. The total cost of the development is expected to be about Pounds 92m, of which Pounds 60m will be public money.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Wife is liable for IHT - Briefcase My wife is a US citizen, aged 62. On January 1 this year, the Inland Revenue recognised her as being domiciled in the US but resident in the UK, where we have lived permanently since 1971. How does she stand over inheritance tax? We suspect the Revenue's recognition of her US domicile is for general law purposes, which would then apply to income tax and capital gains tax. But if she has been resident in the UK for not less than 17 of the 20 years of assessment, ending with the year of assessment in which the 'relevant time' falls, then she will be deemed to be domiciled in the UK for IHT purposes. Her world-wide assets would then be potentially liable to IHT on her death. (Reply by Andrew White of Gordon Leighton &amp; Co.). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Management: An educational experience - John Gapper on a chance for executives to study a topic relevant to their company in the US for free Are you a British executive interested in learning about how US companies run schools, reshape employment policies, or sell products to ethnic minorities? Is your company interested in public-private joint ventures in the UK, but ignorant about how such ventures work in the US? If so, you have a chance to study the topic that interests you at first hand, free. The Financial Times is joining the Commonwealth Fund, a US foundation, to offer a fellowship for up to 12 months to a UK company executive who wants to observe innovation in the US private sector. He or she will travel the US, seeing how American companies are responding to competitive pressures, as well as social and demographic changes. If the offer sounds unusual to UK readers, that is because it emerges from a US tradition of private philanthropy largely absent in Britain. The new fellowship is an adaptation of the Commonwealth Fund's existing Harkness Fellowships. Since 1990, these have offered mid-career British professionals, mostly in the public sector, the opportunity to examine US innovation in their field. In the past three years, this has allowed British doctors to examine the US healthcare system, and education professionals to observe changes in US schools. Last week, the prime minister's office announced that the UK government is to part-fund a new fellowship scheme based on the Harkness idea, offering Americans a chance to examine UK practice. The Harkness Fellowships, although theoretically open to the private sector, have not attracted many applicants from UK companies. The new fellowship has been devised to broaden the scope of the awards. It will allow a UK company to observe changes in the US through the eyes of a younger executive whom it regards as a future leader in its industry. Among those on the selection panel for the award is Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. Davies says the new FT-Harkness fellowship is timely because the barriers between public and private enterprise are now breaking down in the UK in a similar manner to the US. He argues that although the fellowship may not be of direct short-term benefit to a company, it will gain in the longer term through the participation of a valued employee. 'There are many things that companies need to be prodded to do. A company may not see the short-term financial advantage of the experience, but it will probably learn something to its advantage,' he says. Keith Kirby, director of the Harkness Fellowships, says US companies are used to studying social and political change in order to adapt their businesses, and the fellowship offers an insight into how they do that. Kirby says that the selection panel, including Ian Hargreaves, deputy editor of the Financial Times, and Sir David Scholey, chairman of the investment bank SG Warburg, will encourage broad-based proposals. 'Narrow technical projects are less useful than something which will broaden the mind of someone who is likely to be at the top of their industry or field in due course,' he says. The theme of the fellowship is: 'Renewing the company: sustaining competitiveness; improving business performance against a background of rapid social change.' Information and application forms are available until October 6 from: Harkness-Financial Times Award, Harkness Fellowships, 28 Bedford Square, London WC1B 3EG. John Gapper is banking editor of the Financial Times. He was a Harkness Fellow in 1991-92, studying education and training in US schools, colleges and companies.</p>

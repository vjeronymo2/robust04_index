			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Bank suggests shedding its 'protector' role THE Bank of England hinted yesterday that its role as protector of bank depositors should be devolved to an outside institution. In a speech on bank supervision, Mr Brian Quinn, the director in charge of supervision, said that current arrangements for supervising and regulating banks 'may have to be reconsidered'. Although his speech gives few details on this issue, it is understood that Mr Quinn believes there is a distinction to be drawn between his department's two main functions: the protection of the financial system and the protection of depositors. Under the Banking Act, the Bank has explicit responsibility for both functions. However, he said that the depositor protection function has encouraged bank customers to believe that 'the banking supervisor is there to protect them from every deficiency they experience - or perceive - in the service they get from their bank'. But he was adamant this was not his role: 'I have to say that the role of the banking supervisor is to seek to enforce prudent conduct by banks, not customer satisfaction'. Mr Quinn stressed that the bank is a supervisor but not a regulator. He defined regulation as the process of ensuring that financial institutions follow appropriate rules when selling financial products, to protect consumers from buying bad or unsuitable products. Mr Quinn is understood to believe that there is an argument for giving the Bank's deposit protection functions to an outside body - though not until the current reorganisation of the regulation of investment and life products is completed. However he did not make this view explicitly in the speech. He did, however, argue that the Bank should retain its role as supervisor, in the sense of ensuring that there is the minimum risk of a collapse in the payments system. Although he said that there is a potential conflict between the Bank's role as the executor of monetary policy and its role as supervisor, he believes that there are advantages in combining the functions. The execution of monetary policy would be impossible if there were problems with the payments system. For the first time he made explicit the circumstances in which the Bank acts as a lender of last resort to a bank. He said that the Bank will only pump money into a bank if it is 'too important to fail'. He said that a bank would be allowed to collapse, no matter how big it is, so long as that collapse did not put the financial system at risk: 'There is no 'too big to fail' doctrine in the United Kingdom'. Mr Quinn spoke at a conference on City regulation. At the same conference, Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, said for the first that his bank would join the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new regulator of the retail investment industry, if the PIA could demonstrate that it will be an efficient and effective regulator.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Wickes achieves Pounds 4.1m and resumes dividend payments WICKES, the DIY and timber retailer which came close to collapse two years ago, yesterday returned to the dividend list after a two-year absence, on the back of improved interim profits. The company, which operates 111 stores in the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and France, declared an interim pay-out of 0.2p as it revealed pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.08m for the six months to June 30. That compared with Pounds 6.5m last year on an FRS 3 basis, which included extraordinary gains of Pounds 5.1m on the conversion of unsecured loan stock. Stripping out those gains, the comparable pre-tax profit was Pounds 1.4m. Earnings were 1.0p (2.1p including extraordinary gains). Turnover increased to Pounds 294m (Pounds 266.5m). UK turnover increased by 13 per cent and pre-tax profits by 17 per cent. Excluding new stores, like-for-like sales rose only 0.5 per cent. But Mr Henry Sweetbaum, chairman, said that represented a 'significant increase in share' in a static market. Sales and profits in continental Europe increased by 5 per cent, with like-for-like sales up 4.5 per cent in spite of the weaker economic climate. Sales rose 9 per cent at Hunter Timber, whose acquisition for Pounds 273m in 1988 proved to be a severe drain on Wickes' management and financial resources. Mr Sweetbaum said the chain was now close to making a profit before interest, after Wickes reduced its size and introduced a system of incentives for increasing volumes. Trading remained difficult at the Malden timber and joinery subsidiary, whose customer base of small 'jobbing' builders was badly hit by the recession. The new Builders Mate format, however, was performing well, with 11 new branches opening, taking the total to 18. Wickes plans to open seven more stores in 1993. Group debt declined from Pounds 73.2m to Pounds 70.6m during the period, reducing gearing to 88 per cent (94 per cent), and the lower borrowings and interest rates reduced net interest charges to Pounds 5.23m (Pounds 7.32m). COMMENT Wickes created severe difficulties for itself with its diversification into timber in 1988. Hunter Timber now seems to be turning round, although falling sales at Malden remain a cause for concern and it may be some time before store conversions to the new format reverse the decline. Otherwise, Wickes has played a canny game recently. It stayed out of last year's DIY price war and emerged with enhanced profits and margins. It has a distinctive product offer appealing to both DIY enthusiasts and the trade, and enjoys a strong reputation for customer service and the quality of its own brand. It is expanding, and well-placed to benefit from improving consumer spending. Full-year forecasts of up to Pounds 18m put the company on a high prospective multiple of 28, but Wickes is seen as a recovery stock and long-term outperformer.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cray Electronics set to take Dowty arm CRAY Electronics, the high technology group, is expected to emerge tomorrow as the successful bidder for the information technology interests of Dowty Group, now part of TI. The Berkshire-based company, which is set to publish full-term figures tomorrow, confirmed yesterday that it would be making an important announcement at the same time. TI said only that the company was still talking to prospective purchasers but that one set of negotiations was 'going particularly well'. It is understood, however, that the deal has been essentially sealed at a purchase price of Pounds 50m-Pounds 55m. TI acquired Dowty last month for Pounds 485m and made it clear it was anxious to sell the information technology division quickly. Mr Christopher Lewinton, chairman of TI, believes that Dowty's move into that business, chiefly through the purchase of Case Communications, was a costly error. The division last year made sales of Pounds 172m but failed to produce a profit. Cray, a small company specialising in software, telecommunications and instrumentation, has returned to profitability under the guidance of new management led by Sir Peter Michaels, who has made it clear he intends to expand the company rapidly by acquisition. Last year it made an initial bid for SD-Scicon, the UK software house eventually acquired by EDS of the US. Case Communications, which specialises in computer networking, was a rising star in UK electronics until it struck problems in the US and was acquired by Dowty in 1988 for about Pounds 80m.</p>

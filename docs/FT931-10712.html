			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Collecting: Sick patient stirs into life - The statistics seem to confirm that the worst is over in the UK art market THE BRITISH art market is showing the first tentative signs of recovery. The two specialist fairs of late January - Art 93, the leading, if not the only, national showcase for contemporary art; and the World of Watercolours - both provided some encouragement. Art 93 had its highest attendance ever, with more than 21,000 people trekking up to Islington, north London, and those dealers that exhibited works that were priced reasonably - Pounds 5,000 seemed to be the buying barrier - did well. Anthony Hepworth of Bath made 46 sales, including works by Roger Hilton and Keith Vaughan, and brought in more than Pounds 40,000. Another Bath gallery, Cleveland Bridge, sold 'Still Life - Fish' by Mark Gertler for around Pounds 20,000. The highest price paid was the Pounds 26,500 at the Anneley Juda stand in the opening minutes for an Anthony Caro sculpture. Nicola Hicks, John Bellany, Ken Howard, Peter Howson, Harry Holland - these were the artists in favour, familiar British names working in figurative or colourfully abstract fields. The jokey sculptures of David Mach also found buyers, including two works (from the limited edition of 11) of his scaled-down version of even larger-than-life sumo wrestlers lifting a container; these sold for Pounds 5,500 each. Helped by the overflow from the Royal Academy's major exhibition of English watercolours, the World of Watercolours attracted 10,000 visitors, a slight increase on 1992, and 850 works were sold, a rise of 50 on a year ago. Abbott &amp; Holder disposed of 62 pictures and Christopher Wood had his best fair ever, selling a George Apperley self-portrait for around Pounds 25,000 to a private English collector. Although the art market has been optimistic about a revival for more than a year now, it does seem that business has picked up slightly in the past few months. Furniture, which is practical, never suffered as badly as pictures, which are only decorative; and fields with committed collectors, like ceramics and Old Master drawings, survived quite well. The weakest area has been 20th century art, as a recent survey by the British Antiques Dealers' Association confirms. This found that two-thirds of the dealers quizzed saw sales fall in 1991-92, but only slightly: their collective turnover was just Pounds 40m lower, at Pounds 430m. The statistics seem to confirm that the worst is over. Art consultants Poensgen Sokolow suggest that international auction turnover in paintings, drawings and watercolours fell by 20 per cent last year, to Pounds 503m. This compares well with the 65 per cent decline in turnover between 1990 and 1991. They expect the market will bottom out this year. Those dealers that got out and started marketing themselves, either by attending more fairs or opening their shops at flexible times, are reaping the benefit. Spink has taken advantage of the undoubted revival in the American economy, and American art buying, and returned from the winter antiques show in New York this week with six sales in the Dollars 30,000-50,000 range. Leslie Waddington has planned a hectic schedule of international fairs this year, and did Dollars 2m worth of business in Miami last month. Like other top contemporary dealers, who sell mainly to non-British clients, the devaluation of sterling has provided a great boost. After the successful Cork Street weekend in November, most of the dealers in this high street of the art world are planning to stay open on Saturday afternoons. The main auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, are locked in a mid-winter hibernation which seems to get longer every year. Sellers have become street-wise and want to commit their works to the major auctions in the big selling months, which means that the really good stuff does not come under the hammer until late March. Christie's is, however, encouraged by the fact that sales of lots at its South Kensington offshoot, which concentrates on collectables, are running at 90 per cent so far this year, a rise of 5 per cent on 1992, while Sotheby's two 1993 sales - the contents of Robert Maxwell's Headington home, and of marine pictures - both exceeded estimate. It would have been surprising if the sale of the late tycoon's belongings, and one devoted to a popular collecting market, had failed - but at least they suggested that the increased charge to buyers (another 5 per cent on the hammer price, to 15 per cent) was not going to cause a boycott by bidders. The revival of American buying could have a quick impact on the UK trade. Americans account for almost half the sales of the top London dealers, and the prices paid at Christie's in New York last weekend for English furniture must have brought a smile to the face of many a dealer in the Fulham Road or the Cotswolds. For instance, a pair of William and Mary oak bookcases sold for Dollars 385,000 (Pounds 258,000) compared with Dollars 90,000 top estimate; while a set of 12 George II mahogany dining chairs, estimated at up to Dollars 10,000, were bought by a New York dealer for Dollars 46,200 (Pounds 31,000). But there are still traps to be avoided if 1993 is to stabilise the market and achieve modest growth. The financial losses at Lloyds have dealt a major blow to many dealers who could bank on some of the Names converting their bonuses into pictures or furniture. Agnew's hopes that the quality of the work on offer at its 120th watercolour exhibition (which opens on March 8) will make good any absence of regular Names. It includes nine works by Samuel Palmer, the largest group to arrive on the market in 25 years, as well as good watercolours by Turner, Gainsborough and Lear. The loss of the Names is a minor matter compared with the dangers from European Community legislation. So far, the British government has warded off the imposition of 5 per cent VAT on works of art coming from non-EC sources into the UK (these account for Pounds 700m, or 50 per cent of all art imports, each year); but there is another meeting on the matter in the middle of this month, and this threat to the UK's status as the great unfettered market for buying and selling art is still very potent. In addition, the government has made no progress in changing the ludicrous situation in which contemporary artists in the UK must pay 17.5 per cent VAT on their works while artists in France pay 5 per cent. Unless this anomaly is corrected, dealers like Leslie Waddington will be tempted to move to Paris. The market is still weak and convalescent. The auction houses are advising sellers to keep reserves low and dealers will usually offer good discounts to make a sale. But sentiment is improving. This month, the Original Print Fair, at the Royal Academy from February 25, should confirm that a connoisseur market can ride out the recession. Then, in March, the big and glitzy gathering at the Maastricht fair in Holland should confirm the improvement in the international art world - or cast everyone back into misery.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAHONY ASKS REVIEW OF ABORTION FOES'  SENTENCES  </P> <P> Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony has asked prosecutors and the courts to  review what he believes are "unusually harsh" sentences imposed on abortion  foes convicted of trespassing in protests outside women's clinics.  </P> <P> In letters mailed earlier this week to Los Angeles Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Ira Reiner, City Atty. James Hahn, the presiding judge of the Superior Court,  Richard Byrne, and the presiding Municipal Court judge, Jon Mayeda, Mahony  asked that they gather the arrest and sentencing records of demonstrators  convicted of trespassing and other misdemeanor offenses during clinic protests  in the past six months.  </P> <P> "By analyzing this data, you and I will be able to compare the arrest records  and sentences imposed in connection with pro-life activities to arrest records  and sentences imposed in other cases," the archbishop wrote.  </P> <P> Reiner and Hahn had the day off and were not available for comment Thursday,  and there was no immediate response from the two judges.  </P></p>

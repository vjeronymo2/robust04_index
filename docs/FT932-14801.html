			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Small earthquake in US financial services - FASB rule may not be as damaging as opponents claim RARELY has there been an accountancy rule as controversial in the US financial services industry as the decision this week by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to force the nation's banks, insurers and other financial institutions to value more of their bond holdings at current market prices. The ruling, which takes effect with 1994 financial statements, triggered an outcry from banking and insurance industry executives, who claimed the rule would create volatility in earnings, policyholder surpluses and equity accounts. The bankers' argument is that by forcing them to revalue their bond holdings each quarter, their financial results will become more confusing. Insurers maintain the new rule could force them to shorten the maturities of the Treasury bonds they hold. But a closer examination of the rule shows it may not pose as much of a threat as its opponents claim. Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has had nothing but praise for the new rule. He said it would clarify 'the rules of the road' and lessen the number of enforcement actions needed by the SEC. Mr Edward Markey, the Democratic member of Congress from Massachusetts who chairs the House Finance Committee, argued that had the mark-to-market rule been in effect a decade ago it might have helped prevent some of the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s by giving investors a more accurate picture of bank values. Banks have reason, at least at the political level, to be nervous about a rule that affects their Treasury bond holdings. Since 1990, US banks have increased their holdings of Treasury paper substantially. Three years ago, such paper represented an average of 10 per cent of US bank assets; by the middle of last year, the proportion had jumped to 17 per cent, meaning that US banks held Dollars 281bn of Treasury paper. Politicians have blamed bankers for causing the credit crunch by reducing business lending while building up Treasury holdings. In fairness to the banks, the trend was exacerbated by new capital ratio guidelines that acted as a disincentive to lenders, who were already wary because of the commercial property loan crisis that faced US banks between 1990 and 1992. Mr Tom Jones, senior Citicorp executive in charge of finance, said he could see no real impact on bank earnings. But he added that one result of the new rule might be to cause banks to reduce their overall bond holdings to avoid having to reclassify the values every three months. 'In a pragmatic sense I can't see why we should bother holding long-term securities at all,' said Mr Jones. Another aspect of the rule - causing banks to classify bonds as available for sale rather than as long-term investments - could force some to move from longer to shorter term bond maturities. Ms Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, the bond market analysts, noted that 'many banks have already been preparing for the eventuality of having to mark to market by moving to shorter term maturities. So there should not be an inordinate volatility as a result of this rule.' Mr James McDermott, president of Keefe Bruyette, the bank analysts, said most analysts 'consider this a bogus issue because we already take into account the real market value of such holdings.' Insurers' hostility towards greater current cost accounting of their investment portfolios is just as deep-rooted. Repeatedly, the insurance community has argued it was misleading - even dangerous - to value assets at market levels, but not liabilities. Furthermore, it has protested that a considerable portion of insurers' investment portfolios were not readily marketable. 'Current' valuations, therefore, will be subjective. However, the narrower FASB ruling has prompted critics of the move to highlight two specific practical implications. The first is that the new FASB rule will add even more volatility to insurers' earnings. If there were to be a period of high inflation, and a sharp jump in interest rates, for example, it might even create 'technical' insolvencies, requiring regulators to intervene and take over these temporarily 'ailing' companies. Second, some in the industry think that insurers will be increasingly anxious to invest in shorter-term securities to minimise their exposure to interest-rate-related volatility and improve liquidity. The numbers involved are not small: life companies alone have assets of about Dollars 1,700bn. About 60 per cent of this - about Dollars 1,000bn - is currently invested in bonds, and perhaps three-quarters of that amount in longer-term bonds. The counter-argument is that marking more of the bond portfolios to market will prove a valuable discipline, and the industry's reaction is unnecessarily alarmist. 'I think the response from the industry is way overdone,' comments Mr Ernest Jacobs, insurance analyst at Furman Selz. 'Some companies have effectively already adopted this treatment - and, frankly, I'd be hard-pressed to say that they've been scarred as a result.' Arguments can clearly be made from both sides of the issue. What seems clear is that insurers have more at stake in overall money terms than do banks. But few people, opponents of the rule included, would be so bold as to claim mark-to-market is likely to trigger a financial nightmare. The main impact looks like creating still more bureaucracy for accountants.</p>

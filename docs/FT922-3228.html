			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Gilt-edged decision boosts Cater Allen CATER ALLEN Holdings, the discount house and financial services group, reported profits up from Pounds 7.92m to Pounds 8.13m after tax and rebate in the year to April 30. The result was helped by the elimination of losses in gilt-edged securities which the company pulled out of at the end of the previous period after losses of Pounds 2.7m. At the end of the year capital and disclosed reserves increased to Pounds 70.6m. The discount house maintained profitable trading, particularly in certificates of deposit, the Jersey and stock lending businesses had again done well while Barclays Cater Allen, the new joint venture specialising in international stock lending, came into profit before the year end. However, the businesses at Lloyd's turned in a loss of Pounds 473,000, against profits of Pounds 1.92m, when a flat result had been expected. There were also losses in financial futures broking amounting to Pounds 88,000, against profits of Pounds 65,000. Cater did not expect an improvement at Lloyd's this year. In financial broking the company expected to return to profit this year. The proposed final dividend is raised to 20p making a total of 26p (25p).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MECA suggested that the definition be changed to ``.&blank;.&blank;. used  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> on a farm  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .&blank;.&blank;.'' to require site specificity. While most of the preempted equipment is operated on farms, EPA has not included this suggestion out of concern that it may create ambiguity for some operations, like plant nurseries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SDAPCB was also concerned that the phrase ``commercial organic products'' would allow some chemical and man-made products to be considered farm produce and thus their associated processing equipment to be considered farm equipment. The list of acceptable farm products is broad and may include items not generally considered farm products. However, the equipment used in any processing after the harvest is not considered farm equipment. Thus, equipment used to make chemical or man-made products would not be considered farm equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted in the NPRM, EPA intended harvesting to be the last operation in the farming process to be considered ``farming'' and, therefore, equipment that performed any function later in the process,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> processing or storing, would not be preempted. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) commented that all activities associated with planting, harvesting and on-farm processing of agricultural products for use on the farm should be considered farm activities. The Nisei Farmers League had similar comments with respect to on-farm activities although they did not limit the operations to those preparing products for further use on the farm. Therefore, EPA decided that equipment used in certain post-harvesting operations will be accepted within the preemption category when they relate directly to the continued operation of the farm. Those activities include such things as grinding, drying, and storage operations of products usually used in the future on the farm. Examples of crops subject to these activities are hay, silage, and other animal feed. For less traditional agricultural operations such as nurseries, equipment used in similar operations will also be considered farm equipment. Machinery that is used on crops for continued use in that agricultural operation, such as conveyors (hay bale loaders) and ensiles, will be considered farm equipment. Post-harvest processing of crops in preparation for sale will not be considered farm operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SDAPCB expressed the concern that the definition is so broad that it could limit the state's ability to regulate stationary equipment used in the refining, handling, cleaning or processing of food products. We believe that the above discussion of what post-harvesting processing may still be considered farming should alleviate that concern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EMI supplied EPA with a proposed definition which many others supported. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA's definition is nearly as inclusive as EMI's definition. One of the differences between the two was the inclusion in the EMI definition of storage and processing activities of the harvested product. EPA's resolution of how such activities should be treated is discussed above. Another difference was EMI's inclusion of off-road transportation. We do not believe that such nonroad vehicles should usually be considered farm equipment as they are primarily used to transport persons or property on or off farms and are not unique to farms. EMI's definition also could include vehicles which are frequently used for property maintenance of a sort which is also not unique to farms. EMI noted at the public hearing that under its definition such equipment as lawn mowers would be included. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Such a definition of farm equipment is overly broad. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EMI proposed that ``farm equipment or vehicle'' means any engine-powered machine, device, apparatus, or movable stationary source which is self-propelled or transportable and which is designed by the manufacturer for use, or is used, to supply mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic or electric power, for: preparation for production, production, harvesting, processing, storage or off-road transportation of food, fiber, animal feed, other organic material or any other agricultural product or commodity, or any product used in an agricultural operation; handling of products or water related to the care of animals; movement of animals; or operation or maintenance of a farmstead, ranch or logging operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Transcript of Sept. 20,1991 Public Hearing regarding Authorization of Nonroad Standards in California at page 139, line 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has decided to define ``commercial'' in the final rule as ``an activity engaged in as a vocation.'' Farming does not have to be the sole or primary vocation. If a person engages in vocations in addition to farming, farming would still be a vocation. EPA believes that a dollar threshold would not serve the purpose of distinguishing residential from commercial use. EPA defined farm equipment as equipment used for ``commercial'' purposes to prevent the inclusion of such activities as backyard gardening in the definition of farming. There is no reason to believe that Congress meant to include equipment used in these operations which are not conventionally considered to be farms. Thus, equipment used on an agricultural school farm would fall under this definition of commercial because it is equipment used to educate students to farm as a vocation. Also, equipment used on farms that grow crops only for livestock would be considered to be farm equipment. Finally, equipment would be farm equipment if found on ``subsistence'' farms, defined by Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary as farming that provides all or almost all the goods required by the farm family usually without any significant surplus for sale. EMA and PPEMA's suggestion that any piece of equipment that is used on a farm is farm equipment would preclude from potential CARB regulation many types of machines that are incidental to living on a farm and not used in operations normally associated with growing or harvesting agricultural products. An example would be the lawn mowers that EMI said should be deemed farm equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final rule, farm equipment is defined as any internal combustion engine-powered machine primarily used in the commercial production and/or harvesting of food, fiber, wood, or commercial organic products or for the processing of such products for further use on the farm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Definition of Construction Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM stated that ``construction equipment'' means any internal combustion engine-powered machine primarily used on commercial construction sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

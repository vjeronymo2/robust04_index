			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 25 SAPA -- Police on Monday [25  April] night denied a suspect was arrested in connection with  car bombings in Johannesburg in the past two days. African  National Congress National Chairman Thabo Mbeki earlier said  passersby had made a citizen's arrest after seeing a white man  running from a car which was packed with explosives. The  suspect had parked the car outside a Department of Home Affairs  office in Benoni on the East Rand, he said, adding police were  dealing with the matter.    But police spokesman Col Steve Senekal said there was no  truth in Mr Mbeki's statement. He said passersby had noticed a  vehicle with a suspicious parcel inside. Police took the car  away and searched it. There were no explosives. "We have been  trying to get hold of Mr Mbeki to clarify the matter," Col  Senekal said.    At least 19 people were killed and more than 130 were  wounded  in two car bomb attacks on Sunday and Monday.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEELER FAN BEATEN AT RAIDERS GAME  </P> <P> What in the world ever happened to sportsmanship at sports events? I couldn't  believe my ears recently when I heard Dodger fans booing Kirk Gibson (a guy who  just a short while ago helped give those same fans a World Series).  </P> <P> In Chicago, a group of real idiots shower a class outfielder like Kevin  McReynolds with beer just because he caught a fly.  </P> <P> But the real topper happened at the Coliseum when a hooligan nearly killed an  out-of-state visitor just because he was rooting for the Steelers.  </P> <P> If kind of just makes me want to stay home in the safety of my den to watch TV.  The most that can happen is that my wife will ask me to fix a leaky faucet!  </P> <P> ART AMOS  </P> <P> Desert Hot Springs  </P></p>

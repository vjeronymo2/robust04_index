			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS FLAG BURNING AS PROTEST  </P> <P> How inane the reasoning of five Supreme Court justices when they rule that flag  burning is just another "expression" of free speech as protected by the First  Amendment to the Constitution.  </P> <P> It is one thing to verbally duel at 50 feet with adjectives about Old Glory or  any other topic, but a world apart from burning the American flag which a  million or so people have died for during our 213 years of independence.  </P> <P> Let's find a way to protect the Stars and Stripes forever.  </P> <P> JAMES E. PETERSON  </P> <P> Sunland  </P></p>

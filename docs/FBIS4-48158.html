			<p>BFN     [Text] The commander in chief of the NPFL [National  Patriotic Front of Liberia], former President Charles Gankay  Taylor, has called on the LNTG [Liberian National Transitional  Government] to arrange for the formation of a national army to  take charge of the security of the country. President Taylor  has proposed that all factions should provide soldiers for the  formation of the new army. He said leaving the security of the  country solely in the hands of a foreign army could threaten the  national security interests of Liberia.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ICAHN BOOSTS STAKE IN TEXACO, MAY SEEK CONTROL  </P> <P> Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn disclosed Tuesday that he has raised his  stake in Texaco Inc. to 16.6% and confirmed that he was preparing for the  possibility of a second fight for control of the oil giant.  </P> <P> Icahn also accused Texaco management of breaking a promise to shareholders by  devising a new anti-takeover defense to replace one that expires April 7.  </P> <P> "It has come to my attention that Texaco management -- again without  shareholder approval -- is about to further insulate itself from accountability  by changing their existing 'poison pill' to make it even more toxic," Icahn  said in a letter to Texaco President James W. Kinnear.  </P> <P> Icahn, who six months ago lost a bitter struggle against management for control  of Texaco's board, was responding to an article in Tuesday's editions of the  Wall Street Journal. The newspaper reported that Texaco was preparing to  replace its expiring poison-pill takeover defense with a new plan.  </P> <P> Icahn said the new strategy was an attempt to "preclude a bid for Texaco by me  or by anyone else."  </P> <P> Texaco assured shareholders during its proxy battle against Icahn that it would  eliminate the poison pill, which is aimed at making a hostile takeover  prohibitively expensive. Analysts have said that promise was largely  responsible for Texaco's victory in the proxy fight.  </P> <P> Texaco then promised the committee representing its shareholders in the  company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization that it would not issue another  poison pill without the approval of shareholders or authorization from an  investment banking firm designated by the committee.  </P> <P> In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, Texaco stock rose  50 cents to close at $53.50 a share.  </P> <P> The newspaper also reported that the shareholders committee had designated the  investment banker Rothschild Inc. to issue a new defense and that Kinnear and  Texaco Chairman Alfred C. DeCrane had visited Rothschild's offices about a  successor to the poison pill.  </P> <P> Dennis O'Dea, counsel for the equity committee, denied the panel had made any  such designation.  </P> <P> Kinnear issued a statement late Tuesday saying, "This is another case of Carl  Icahn protesting without knowing what is being proposed and making claims  solely for his own benefit."  </P> <P> Kinnear said Texaco is considering an interim plan to take effect when the  existing pill expires in April. That plan would be in effect until shareholders  have the opportunity to vote on it in at Texaco's annual meeting in May.  </P> <P> Texaco officials said the plan would not preclude any legitimate offers for the  company but "would avoid anyone's acquiring control of Texaco through creeping  purchases, to the detriment of other Texaco shareholders."  </P> <P> Icahn declined to specify his intentions or to say whether a second proxy fight  was likely.  </P></p>

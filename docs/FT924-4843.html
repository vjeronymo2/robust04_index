			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Greene King provides Pounds 3.8m for failed bid GREENE King's unsuccessful bid for Morland, the Thames Valley-based brewer, cost a total Pounds 3.8m in the half year to November 1 1992. There was a Pounds 1.1m net cost of carrying the 29.3 per cent stake in Morland, which raised the East Anglian-based brewer's interest charges from Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.86m and contributed to a 4 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits, from Pounds 9.91m to Pounds 9.52m. And there was a Pounds 2.7m extraordinary charge for underwriting costs and professional fees for the bid. Mr Simon Redman, chairman of Greene King, said the stake - bought at 450p a share and now worth 418p - would be retained as a 'strategic investment.' The reduction in interest rates would reduce carrying costs in the second half to about Pounds 650,000, he said. Taxable profits were also affected by lower property disposals and changes in accounting for them. An exceptional loss of Pounds 9,000 compared with a surplus of Pounds 486,000 in the corresponding period last time. Earnings per share fell 4 per cent to 16.2p (16.8p), but the interim dividend is raised 6 per cent to 3.7p (3.5p). Trading profit rose 6 per cent to Pounds 13.27m (Pounds 12.51m) on turnover ahead 3 per cent from Pounds 65.6m to Pounds 67.5m. Trading conditions remained depressed but beer volumes were held near last year's levels and market share improved, Mr Redman said. Cask beers made real volume gains, with Greene King IPA, given strong advertising and promotional support, doing well in all trade sectors. 'We see good potential for further growth,' Mr Redman said. Free trade business during the half year accounted for 56 per cent of volume sales; and a new depot is planned close to the M3 motorway to extend distribution in southern England. The company invested heavily in upgrading its pubs. Food takings in the managed pubs grew 22 per cent, and the emphasis on catering has been increased. A number of tenanted pubs, which were not viable in the longer term, would be sold when the property market improved, Mr Redman said. 'We intend to continue adding to our pub estate where suitable opportunities occur. Our investment focus is now concentrated on better quality, larger properties.' COMMENT Greene King must be mightily relieved by the fall in interest rates. It will almost halve the cost in the second half of carrying the 29.3 per cent stake in Morland; and it may help to revive consumer confidence in East Anglia which has been one of the areas hardest hit by the recession. The Morland holding remains an embarrassment. It is unlikely to prove successful as the launching pad for a second bid; and Greene King will have to wait on the Morland management to restore its value or sell at a loss. That said, it is still getting a better return on that investment than its 35 per cent stake in Butterfly hotels. The core beer and pubs business is performing rather better than the market. Abbott and IPA are strong brands which should perform even better when more buoyant conditions return. Analysts suggest that will not be this year-forecasting flat yearly profits of Pounds 20.3m. On a prospective p/e of 13.5, the shares are rated a hold.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Vedernikov under the "Regional Elections" </F> rubric: "Directors Become Legislators"]    [Text] Certain central publications have reported that the  elections in Orenburg Oblast were not valid, but they made a  mistake in evidently taking on trust the protest of Presidential  Representative V. Shapovalenko, who stated that the voting  results in eight districts could not be declared valid. The  oblast electoral commission did not consider his arguments to be  convincing and "confirmed" 36 members of the legislative  assembly out of the 47 needed. (In 11 districts the elections  were not valid because voters did not turn out.) There is a  quorum of deputies, and on 12 April the first sitting of the  oblast legislative assembly will take place, at which the  standing orders for work will be considered and organizational  questions will be decided. At the same time the oblast  electoral commission sent the Russian president a letter giving  an adverse assessment of his representative's actions,  considering them to be discrediting the president himself. Who  exactly will assemble in the hall on Cosmonauts' Day? People  who have real power in their hands. The slogan of purely  "party" candidates, who suggested to voters the notion that  leaders of enterprises have no business being in the legislative  assembly, did not work. A total of 19 people will represent the  directors' corps in the assembly. Neither did the call of the  head of the oblast administration to his colleagues at city and  rayon level not to run for deputy work. Virtually to a man they  launched themselves into the election campaign, as a result of  which 11 of them achieved their objective. The remaining seats  went to representatives of a new wave -- businessmen. They  include, for example, V. Shcherbakov, director of "Yuzhnyy  Ural," the oblast's biggest commercial bank. There will be  representatives of the press in the deputies' corps -- two  journalists were elected.    Neither did the party principle work. Not a single "Russia's  Choice" or "Democratic Russia" candidate got through.  Communists and agrarians, who united in the bloc "Against  Poverty, Unemployment, and Corruption," had to be content with  two seats. But those elected included many who, although they do  not formally belong to this bloc, sympathize with it, as they  say. Those who did not heed the wish of the head of the oblast  administration and who were elected to the assembly include  Orenburg Mayor Gennadiy Donkovtsev, who, to give him his due, is  in high standing with the city's inhabitants.    "Paradoxical as it may seem, I am against the presence of  administration heads in the assembly," he told journalists.  "The Executive and Legislative Branches must be separated.  Otherwise, we end up controlling ourselves. Why did I myself  fight for a seat in the legislative assembly? Because I saw  that there would be nobody to protect the interests of the city,  which accounts for one-fourth of the oblast's population...."    The city's mayor assured voters that as a deputy he would do  everything to ensure that the city's economy is not so  "turbulent." Well, we will wait and see.</p>

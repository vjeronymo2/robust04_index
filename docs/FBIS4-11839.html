			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comment" Column by Husayn 'Abd-al-Wahid: </F> "Clinton's Promises"]    [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton's position on the issue  of Jerusalem has become some sort of a puzzle. In the past few  days, statements by Clinton and officials in his Administration  about the issue have been strangely and suspiciously  contradictory. When the U.S. President met with leaders of the  "Zionist lobby" in the United States he emphasized to them his  support for making Jerusalem the unified capital of Israel. A  day later, the U.S. State Department issued a statement  stressing that there is no change in Washington's position  regarding Jerusalem! A few days later, Jewish sources once  again quoted President Clinton as backing Jerusalem as the  unified capital of Israel.    Later, news agencies quoted him as affirming that the status  of Jerusalem must be determined through Arab-Israeli  negotiations. The Arabs understood this to mean Clinton's  promise to them not to recognize the legitimacy of the Israeli  occupation of Jerusalem.    In general, the U.S. comments, which are designed to satisfy  the Arabs, were marked by a great deal of deliberate ambiguity.  Former U.S. President George Bush was once asked his opinion on  declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel. His specific and  firm answer was that Jerusalem is part of the occupied Arab  territories and that its final status, like that of the other  Arab cities and villages that Israel occupied in 1967, will be  determined by the peace talks.    However, the current U.S. Administration confines itself to  emphasizing that its "position on Jerusalem has not changed."  The confusing thing about this phrase is that the position of  the Democratic Party and its presidential candidate in the  recent elections, Bill Clinton, recognized Jerusalem, both East  and West, as the capital of Israel and even sought to move the  U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Zionists viewed  this position as a promise no less important or significant than  the infamous "Balfour Declaration."    Thus, the "no-change in the U.S. position on Jerusalem"  means  one of two things: First, that Clinton meant that he adheres to  his position announced during his election campaign, namely to  recognize the legitimacy of the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem;  or second, that he meant they continue to adhere to the position  of the preceding U.S. administrations, which viewed Jerusalem as  an occupied Arab territory.    I believe that this duality in meanings is intentional and  deliberate, acting upon the foxy Kissinger's theory that "modern  politics should be hard to understand." We apologize to Mr.  Kissinger, but we are nevertheless trying to understand.  Unfortunately, our attempt to do so leads us to believe that the  whole thing is nothing but a trial balloon by Washington to see  what the Arab and Islamic reactions would be if the U.S. Embassy  were to be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Thus, the Arabs  must counter this U.S. ambiguity with full clarity and firmness  before it is too late.</p>

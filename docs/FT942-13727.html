			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Leyland Daf celebrates return to profit The 1,070 workers at Birmingham-based Leyland Daf Vans were given a day off yesterday to celebrate the company's spectacular re-emergence from receivership as a profitable company expecting to make more than 10,000 vans this year. The company, created out of the crash of the Anglo-Dutch Daf trucks giant last year, reported making a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.6m on a turnover of Pounds 79.6m in its first, truncated, financial year between last April and December 31. Jubilant managers yesterday relaunched the company with the new name and logo of LDV, to help distance it from its troubled past. Mr Allan Amey, its chief executive, little dreamed last spring, while tramping the corridors of sceptical potential investors for his management buy-out plan, that within a year he would be running Britain's biggest UK-owned vehicle manufacturer. Yet thanks to BMW of Germany's takeover of Rover Group last month, that is what LDV, housed at Washwood Heath near Birmingham, has become. Profits are expected to grow substantially this year. Turnover is expected to reach about Pounds 150m. 'The performance says two things,' said Mr Allan Amey, chief executive. 'Inherently the vans business is profitable, and it was profitable both as part of Rover (formerly British Leyland) and, later, as part of Daf.' Managers of LDV, several of whom, including Mr Amey, had been with the company for years before the Daf debacle, had long been annoyed that the van business's underlying profitability had been swamped, in the public eye at least, by the rising tide of the Daf group's indebted-ness. Not surprisingly, therefore, the management buy-out team has derived considerable satisfaction from reporting the performance to its main equity investor, the 3i venture capital group, and finance providers Royal Bank of Scotland and United Dominions Trust, which between them made possible the Pounds 40m buy-out. The first-year performance, said Mr Amey, exceeded the target of the company's three-year business plan. Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School, said LDV's brief track record was 'one of the most dramatic and successful recoveries in Britain's post-war history'. In March 1993, during the receivership, LDV's share of the UK panel van market slipped to 6 per cent. Its workforce was cut by more than a half, to just over 900. In the first quarter of this year its market share has almost doubled, to 11.3 per cent. The plant is producing at a rate of 250 a week, up from 200 in the immediate aftermath of the receivership, and Mr Amey said it should be up to 300 a week by the middle of this year. Break-even, said Mr Amey, was 9,000 a year and falling. That is still far behind market leader Ford, but LDV has no intention of seeking head-on confrontation. LDV's strategy is focused heavily on 'tailor-made' vans, using its Special Vehicle Op-erations to build vehicles specifically adapted for operators in a way not possible on volume assembly lines. The Post Office, electricity companies and the Automobile Association come high on the list. Some 75 per cent of all output now goes through Special Vehicle Operations. LDV has added about 100 employees, taking the workforce to 1,070, prompted mainly by strong growth in output of the Land Rover Discovery for which LDV presses panels. Pressings accounted for Pounds 10m of the turnover. Productivity increases will restrict workforce growth. Mr Amey's main concern has been to firmly secure LDV's position the UK marketplace. But contained within last year's turnover figure is Pounds 2.5m in export sales  -a small sum, but marking the stirrings of a revival in Continental sales. 'When we developed the business plan we didn't know what would happen to our European customers,' said Mr Amey. 'But once we got back up and running last year a lot of Continental dealers who had been selling both trucks and vans found they were missing the vans. So we're starting to sell again - so far in Spain, France, Belgium and Holland.' Mr Amey said there was no 'grand strategy' for mainland Europe but predicted 'a clear potential to do 4,000 or 5,000 vans a year there. It could provide 20 to 30 per cent of our volume'. Priorities include strengthening the business for the medium term, requiring a Pounds 30m new-products programme, the first results of which will be seen in 1995. Some Pounds 8m has already been committed. Mr Amey said this could be funded from LDV's earnings. But still missing is precisely what will happen in the long-term, when LDV must face total renewal, rather than updating, of its product range. Mr Amey does not rule out the possibility that when a new generation of product does appear - current modernisation is expected to take LDV to the turn of the century - it will be the result of a partnership. 'We're going to look at a number of options, and probably spend the next 18 to 24 months evaluating them,' he said. Actual sales in the eight-month year totalled 7,000 - enough to generate substantial business for LDV's 110 dealers. About half of these are truck dealerships with the remainder Rover Group car dealers. Mr Amey sees no particular need for more dealers. However, he acknowledged some 'massaging' of standards was required 'so that a constant level of performance is achieved across the network'.</p>

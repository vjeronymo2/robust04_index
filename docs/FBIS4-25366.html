			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 8 (CNA) -- Foreign Affairs Minister  Chien Fu disclosed Wednesday [8 June] that Premier Lien Chan did  not meet Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari during his  three-day stay in that country, as widely believed. Chien left  Mexico Wednesday.    Chien made the remarks when answering questions by reporters  at a farewell party for the Information &amp; Cultural Affairs  Director Ouyang Jui-hsiung, who will take over the post of  director-general at the Coordination Council for North American  Affairs (CCNAA) office in Los Angeles. The CCNAA represents the  Republic of China [ROC]'s interests in the United States in the  absence of formal ties between the two countries.    Chien said he did not make public Lien's visit to Mexico  beforehand because of an agreement between the two governments  that neither side could release the news before Lien arrived in  Mexico.    Chien said the reason he refused to comment on the  possibility of a Salinas-Lien meet before Lien departed on his  May 29-June 9 Central American tour was because the meeting had  never been scheduled. Lien did meet with other ranking Mexican  officials and Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the ruling party's  candidate in the next presidential election.    Lien, currently in New York for a two-day family reunion  with  his two children, who study there, will return to Taipei  Saturday, as scheduled, and hold a press conference, Chien said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Saarlouis -- Oskar Lafontaine, deputy chairman of  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], criticized the  participation of German soldiers in missions in civil war zones  as the "wrong peace policy." At a conference of the Saarland  SPD, Lafontaine stated in Saarlouis today: "Those who want  peace in Asia and Africa should finally stop exporting weapons  to these countries." He accused the government of  schizophrenia, stressing: "First we export our weapons to all  parts of the world, and then we send our children there as  soldiers to collect them again." Referring to the civil wars in  the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Rwanda, Lafontaine pointed  out that it must also be possible to help without soldiers.</p>

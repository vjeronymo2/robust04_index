			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 26 (TANJUG) -- Jovan Zametica,  spokesman of Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) President Radovan  Karadzic, described Tuesday [26 April] as another in a series of  propaganda fabrications of the Bosnian Moslems the story about  the alleged thousands of wounded and hundreds of killed in  Gorazde. Gorazde is a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia and the  site of almost a month of heavy fighting of the Moslem and Serb  forces. After ceasefire accord was reached, evacuation of the  wounded with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] helicopters ensued  on Sunday. Zametica's statement, sent to TANJUG, says that "at  the height of the Gorazde hysteria, it was claimed that there  were 2,000 Muslims wounded and 700 dead. "However, U.N. medical  evacuation helicopters have to date brought out only 170  persons, many of whom have been patients for months and could  not have been the casualties of the recent fighting," says  Zametica and warns that on Tuesday, "two evacuation helicopters  returned empty".    "The pattern is very clear for those who want to see it: the  Muslims manufacture or exaggerate a crisis, international  organizations on the ground either say nothing or openly take  the Muslim side, and the world media uncritically swallow  everything," says he. Zametica claims that "a high-ranking  UNPROFOR official confirmed to us that international  humanitarian organizations had deliberately engaged in a  campaign of lies and disinformation concerning the extent of  casualties in Gorazde." In conclusion, Zametica recalls the  "case with the `breadline massacre' which was staged by the  Muslims, but the Serbs got the sanctions (i.e. F.R. Yugoslavia).  With the market place massacre, again staged by the Muslims,  but the Serbs got the ultimatum. And now with Gorazde, with one  ultimatum on top of another." He adds that "the world diplomats  and decision-makers should ask themselves whether they can allow  their policies to be so easily dictated by the world media which  in turn report lie after lie after lie."    A French television Channel One reporter in Bosnia admitted  Tuesday that the numbers about hundreds of killed and wounded  Moslems in Gorazde were "blown-up" by the Moslem sources,  different humanitarian organizations and Western media. The  answer to the question where have several hundred wounded and  killed Moslems in Gorazde disappeared could not be supplied, as  the TF-1 reporter said, by either UNPROFOR or representatives of  humanitarian organizations.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Major hits back over attacks on leadership MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday hit back at charges of 'dithering' over reform of the poll tax by dismissing attacks from opposition leaders and criticism from the Thatcherite right as 'juvenile name calling'. Justifying the delayed publication of plans for a new local government tax, the prime minister said it would be folly to issue a consultation document without time to examine the options on what was a 'really important' long term strategic decision. He went on to counter accusations that he is indecisive on controversial issues by pointing to his move to join the European Community's exchange rate mechanism and his handling of the Gulf war. The much-awaited consultation document on the poll tax's replacement would be published shortly, he said. Mr Major's defence against growing questioning of his leadership style dominated his first lengthy television interview since taking office. It came just a day before Sir Alan Walters, the former special economic adviser to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, was due, in another television programme, to lend his weight to right-wing claims that the government lacks direction. In a bid to maintain last week's Labour offensive, Mr Neil Kinnock, the party leader, characterised the Tory party as hopelessly split both on the poll tax and on Europe. The defensive tone of the prime minister's London Weekend Television interview, nonetheless, led some Tories to question why the party leader had been allowed to face the cameras at a time when the poll tax consultation document had still not been published. With the local government election campaign now entering its second week, it immediately provoked fresh attacks from opposition parties which have seized on criticism of Mr Major's style from the Tory right to hammer home the 'weak leadership' charge. The public discussion of Mr Major's abilities came after public carping from a leading Young Conservative and last week's highly critical statement from officials of the anti-federalist Bruges Group over Europe. Clearly irritated by repeated questioning on the government's new local tax, Mr Major was unable to do more than insist that the public must 'wait and see'. In an effort to head off the accusation that the time taken to find a solution to local government financing was due to the Cabinet's attempts to 'fudge' the issue, he replied: 'It is not going to linger on and on and on and on.' The prime minister was dismissive of criticism from Sir Alan Walters, due to be broadcast on the BBC's Panorama programme tonight. This claims that while Mr Major is 'an extraordinarily good executive' he has not conveyed a sense of the ideas and principles that drive him. Mr Major reminded viewers that earlier criticism from Sir Alan had incorrectly warned that Britain's entry into the ERM would mean devaluation and an inability to lower interest rates. The prime minister also defended his policy of creating an enclave for Kurdish refugees in Iraq, saying Britain had been the first country to react with humanitarian aid and had taken the initiative in proposing solutions. Pressed on whether he would support the use of troops to defend the Kurds, he replied: 'I am neither ruling it in nor ruling it out. Nobody knows what may be the situation in the future.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, accused the prime minister of failing to demonstrate decisive or imaginative leadership.</p>

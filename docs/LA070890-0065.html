			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER'S ATTACK ON MANDELA TERMED SHAMEFUL  </P> <P> The article "Mandela Talk Draws Cheers From Congress" (June 27) by Times staff  writer Edwin Chen was indeed inspiring.  </P> <P> It is too bad that Republican Congressman William E. Dannemeyer from Fullerton  had to show his narrow-minded attitude when he likened Mr. Mandela to H. Rap  Brown and Willie Horton. Perhaps Rep. Dannemeyer has been too long in office  and needs a long, worthwhile rest.  </P> <P> JAIME B. VEGA  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

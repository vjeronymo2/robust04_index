			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No proper recognition or advocacy for UK's scientists/engineers (2) Sir, In response to your leader, 'Supply, demand and scientists' (August 31), and speaking as a scientist who has recently hung up his 'test tubes' after 20 years in favour of a commercial career, I would maintain that Britain's decline in science and engineering has been taking place over the last three decades. The reason is a lack of financial rewards and opportunity for scientists and engineers to reach top positions in British companies and society. I have witnessed many scientists give up the battle to pursue a career through creative innovation and application of science. Job satisfaction doesn't pay the bills, and a society that has been through Thatcher's get-rich-quick era has left the scientist/engineer demoralised and disillusioned. The average scientist/engineer has been through a rigorous training and learning programme and, when less qualified and less able people are paid substantially more in commercial careers, they ask themselves 'has it been worth it?'. Improvements in education are only part of the solution. Britain has to start to value its technologists by paying them more. Supply and demand laws do not appear to have worked for the scientist/engineer, possibly because Britain's technological base has shrunk; we have given it to countries which have a more enlightened approach about the role of industry in modern economies.

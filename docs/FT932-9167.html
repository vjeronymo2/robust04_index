			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Signs of corporate recovery lift Sweden  -The prospect of new rate cuts has boosted sentiment Falling interest rates and signs of corporate profits recovery have helped fuel a stock market rally in Sweden which began last October and is still going strong. A further cut in interest rates yesterday added to the positive sentiment; but profit-taking late in the session saw the Affarsvarlden general index fall 9.6 to 1,072.1. Equities have now risen by more than 17 per cent since the start of the year, and have climbed by some 50 per cent since Sweden effectively devalued the krona last November. However, prices are still 20 per cent below the peaks reached in August 1989, before the onset of economic recession. The devaluation has done much to generate the momentum of the last six months, not least because the weaker krona has enhanced the competitiveness of the large export-orientated multinationals. More recently, it has been expectations of further falls in interest rates which have dominated sentiment. Following yesterday's cut, the central bank's marginal interest rate stands at 9.00 per cent, compared with 12.50 per cent at the time the krona was floated. The trend is firmly downward and, in spite of central bank caution, further cuts can be expected this summer. But there are other influences at work, including increased interest by overseas investors. Ms Mary Berg, Scandinavian analyst at James Capel in London, comments: 'International investors, who have done well out of Germany and France, are now looking to put their money somewhere else with both countries moving into recession. Sweden looks particularly attractive because of its range of well-known international companies with good recovery prospects.' In the last two weeks a number of factors have helped to give the market a further boost. The low wage accord that employers and engineering unions have agreed looks like averting any widespread industrial unrest in the current wage bargaining round. There has also been evidence of improving corporate fortunes in some first-quarter reports. On Tuesday Ericsson disclosed a SKr428m (Dollars 57m) profit for the first three months, sharply reversing a SKr363m loss for the same quarter of 1992. Its 'B' shares closed at SKr300 yesterday, against a 1993 low of SKr172. Last week Stora, the forestry group, also provided some cause for optimism when it said that prices for most of its main products had stopped falling as it announced a lower than expected quarterly loss. However, forestry shares have still had a disappointing year, moving up by only 6.4 per cent since January and failing to build on the strong spurt they put in immediately after the November devaluation. The sector, however, showed a 6 per cent gain yesterday. The star performer has been the banking sector, where shares have risen by more than 90 per cent since the start of the year on hopes that the worst of Sweden's financial crisis is over. Some of the buying has had a strong speculative feel to it, as with S-E Banken, whose shares have tripled in the last month. The sector is still 15 per cent below its level of a year ago. One clear indication of the general buoyancy has been the increase in turnover, frequently exceeding SKr1bn a day during the year, and reaching its second highest level ever on Wednesday when it rose above SKr2bn. A 'no' vote in next week's Danish referendum on Maastricht would quickly change sentiment, not least because it would raise the prospect of renewed currency turbulence. A nervous eye is also being kept on Germany - Sweden's leading export market - because evidence of deeper recession there would almost certainly harm the recovery prospects of the country's big multinationals. The superstitious recall that it was almost exactly a year ago that the Affarsvarlden index touched a 1992 high of 1,000 before plunging 37 per cent in the next five months. This time such a reversal looks unlikely given the downward trend in interest rates and a feeling that the end of recession has to be nearer today than it was a year ago.</p>

In 1993 Ukrainian nuclear power plants produced 75,238  million kilowatt/hours, which is 33 percent of the overall  Ukrainian electricity output, he said. The electricity  production amounted to 111 percent of the planned targets.    In the words of Umanets, there were no accidents at nuclear  power plants in 1993, although there were some malfunctions  eleven of which were estimated as the first level and one --  second on the international nuclear accident scale.    A radical factor for the development of Ukrainian nuclear  power engineering is a resolution of the parliament to cancel  moratorium on construction of new units of nuclear power plants  and further operation of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, said  the official. The resolution provides for the postponed  termination of Chernobyl plant halt with due account of  technical and radiation safety.    A major problem of Ukrainian nuclear power engineering  remains fuel, which Ukrainian nuclear power plants continue to  receive from Russia. Ukrainian scientists and specialists have  been instructed to create national fuel.</p>

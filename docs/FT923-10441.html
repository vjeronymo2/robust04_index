			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Foreign investment in gilts rises to Pounds 726m OVERSEAS investors increas-ed their purchases of UK government bonds last month, allaying fears that lack of foreign demand might create difficulties for the government in meeting its funding requirements. According to the Bank of England's final money supply data, overseas investors bought Pounds 726m of gilts in June compared with Pounds 378m in May, reversing a downward trend since April. Overseas buying of gilts has never been as high as expected since the election and seemed to have been discouraged after the rejection of the Maastricht treaty by the Danes. The Bank's figures also showed that net official gilt sales in June were Pounds 2.6bn, bringing to Pounds 10.3bn the total for net sales in the year to the end of June. The news came as the Confederation of British Industry urged the government not to set such strict limits on public-sector borrowing that measures to stimulate recovery were ruled out. The CBI's national council agreed that a rise in borrowing to finance higher investment or measures to boost the recovery were desirable. 'Whatever happens in Germany, it does not mean that the UK government has no room for manoeuvre,' said Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI. 'The constraints on monetary policy point to fiscal policy as the main route through which government can influence the economy.' The council agreed on four measures the government could take: Maintain public-sector investment programmes - such as road and rail investment  - within the constraints imposed on public spending last year. Meet the economies required to stay within the targets by restraining public-sector pay. Take action to build confidence and bring forward spending. Such measures could include a stimulus to the housing market and a replacement for the business expansion scheme. Increase government support for UK exporters.</p>

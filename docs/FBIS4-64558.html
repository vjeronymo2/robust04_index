			<p>BFN     [Text] The Hague, May 3 (AFP) -- Outgoing Dutch Premier  Ruud Lubbers will stand as a candidate to succeed Jacques Delors  of France as president of the European Commission, the Foreign  Ministry said Tuesday [3 May].    Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans will formally present  Lubbers' candidacy to the European Union soon, the Ministry said  in a statement.    Lubbers resigned earlier Tuesday as general elections were  held in the Netherlands. He was not running for re-election.    Until now Lubbers, 55 in a few days, had refused to say if  he  was aiming for Delors' job, saying to discuss it would be  inappropriate as long as he was head of the Dutch government.    Delors' term expires on January 5 of next year.    In 1992 the Frenchman said Lubbers would be a good  successor,  and Dutch television said Tuesday it was Delors himself who  encouraged Lubbers to seek the post.    Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, a Christian  Democrat  like Lubbers, is also seeking the job and diplomats say he has  the support of France and Germany.    Lubbers has led three coalition governments in the  Netherlands over the past 12 years.</p>

In particular, it indicates that the  "positive developments on the European and Asian continents are  accompanied by the rise of new challenges and dangers. Among  these is the aggravation of inter-ethnic conflicts, creation of  `vacuum security' zones, attempts to destabilize new independent  states from outside and establish `spheres of influence'."    The document points out that the idea of "Partnership for  Peace" approved by the heads of the NATO member-states has a  great positive potential. Its implementation will allow the  expansion expand the framework of stability, peace, and trust  among states. "We have no right to turn a blind eye to the fact  that of late, the forces which call for the reanimation of the  totalitarian regime have stepped up their activity," says the  declaration. "Ukraine and Kazakhstan, which have voluntarily  chosen the path toward a non-nuclear status, cannot but feel  anxiety for their security. We call on all the interested  states and governments to double their efforts geared to  building a safer and a more stable world."    Also signed were a "Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation  Between Ukraine and the Republic of Kazakhstan" and eight  agreements which regulate mutual indebtedness, establish further  cooperation in the space, military and industrial spheres.    Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk and President of  Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev held a news conference for  journalists at which they expressed their points of view  concerning the priorities of the present-day policy, the  prospects for the CIS, the security guarantees for the states  which acceded to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and other  issues. In particular, Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed his wish  to introduce a single monetary unit called "altyn" on the  territory of the former Union and also travel cards which would  ensure the freedom of movement on the territory of the CIS  states. The presidents expressed their negative attitudes  towards the institution of dual citizenship and promised to  spare no effort to develop bilateral relations.    On 21 January the Kazakhstan delegation leaves for  Dnepropetrovsk, where it will visit the "PivdenMash" [southern  machine] plant, and for Dneprodzerzhinsk where the future mining  engineer, Nursultan Nazarbayev, was on a practical attachment  during the years of his studentship.</p>

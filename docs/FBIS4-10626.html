			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Eduardo Vallarino, presidential </F> candidate of the Christian Democratic Party, PDC, with  unidentified reporters following President Guillermo Endara's  message; from PDC headquarters in Panama City--live relay]    [Text] [Vallarino] I would like to be brief. I believe  every Panamanian is sadder now than he was an hour ago. We have  relived our past, scenes of our past. Our party was a main  player in the struggle against the dictatorship and paid dearly  for this in lives and material losses. This reminds the  Panamanian people, however, that we must remember the past and  avoid the mistakes made in the past and avoid returning to the  past.    Today, I would like to invite the Panamanian people to look  forward. I would like to call on all the candidates to set  their sights on the future. In the hopes of doing this, I made  a friendly call in good faith to all the presidential candidates  to join us and enter into a pact with the people to ensure a  better future for all Panamanians and to assure us we will not  return to those days of which we were reminded on television  this evening.    [Reporter] How would you describe the [words indistinct]  president of the Republic?    [Vallarino] This was simply a little sample of what happened  in the past 22 years. This was something most Panamanians did  not experience, because they were too young. Today's voters do  not really know what happened between 1968 and 1989, when the  dictatorship ended. Knowing our history is very important and  this is part of our history. As I said earlier, it hurts to  remember, but we must remember it. Just as I say it hurts to  remember I also say it is necessary to look to the future. We  must propose and present a better future to the Panamanian  people. We can do this together. Once again I call on all  civilians throughout the country, especially the presidential  candidates, to join in a great crusade for the good of Panama.    [Reporter] What political effect will this have only three  weeks before the elections?    [Vallarino] I do believe this will have a political effect.  There are too many people who for one reason or another forget  too quickly. There are others who knew nothing of this. This  will help the Panamanian people do what they must do; that is,  remember that voting is a serious thing and that our future and  our children's future depends on this election. Let's not make  another mistake. Let's look to the future with optimism, and  let's remember the past carefully.</p>

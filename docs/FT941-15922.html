			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading Fading hopes of a cut in UK interest rates brought about a heavy sell-off in the derivatives sector, pulling the underlying cash market lower, writes Joel Kibazo. The March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index had been expected to come in strongly following the buoyant overnight performance of Wall Street. However, with a growing feeling that the much anticipated reduction in UK interest rates was unlikely in the near term, institutions needed few incentives to turn sellers. Having opened at 3,455, around 8 points below Monday's closing level, the March contract tumbled further, with a number of equity sell programmes said to have served to increase selling of the future. Bargain hunting, together with anticipation of a higher Wall Street, reduced earlier losses and saw March move forward early in the afternoon for the first time in the session. But those hopes proved unfounded when Wall Street retreated at the opening, once again causing a slide in the contract. The March future often traded at a discount during the session and it closed at the day's lowest point of 3,426, a three-point discount to its fair value premium of around 13 points. Volume was 13,356 at the close. Strong trading in the FT-SE 100 option boosted total turnover in the sector to 40,776 lots, against a previous 33,868 dealt. The volume in the FT-SE 100 option was 17,134, up from Monday's 9,131. Ladbroke was the most active among the stock options as a total of 3,520 contracts were traded, the single biggest trade being in the May 200 calls and puts.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Japan assailed over war sex Japan has a moral and legal obligation to compensate the Asian women who were forced to provide sexual intercourse for its troops during the second world war, the International Commission of Jurists said yesterday. It urges the Japanese government to pay each former 'comfort woman' an immediate Dollars 40,000 (Pounds 25,500) in compensation, pending steps to provide 'full rehabilitation and restitution'. The commission's report is likely to embarrass Tokyo at a time when the Japanese government believes it is on the point of resolving an issue which has bedevilled diplomatic relations with its neighbours. At the end of August Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister, announced a Dollars 1bn fund to be used over the next 10 years for exchange programmes and vocational training centres for women as a token of apology for war atrocities. But the planned fund does not represent compensation for the women involved. The ICJ, which groups some 45 eminent jurists from around the world, is critical of the handling of the issue by Japan which, it says, appears to be aimed at placating sentiments rather than finding a solution. In thinly veiled language the ICJ accuses Tokyo of dragging its heels and covering up documentary evidence. The Japanese imperial army abducted 100,000 to 200,000 women and girls, often as young as 13, to serve a vast network of 'comfort stations', it notes. If Japan does not take action, the matter should be pursued by an international tribunal or by the United Nations, the ICJ says, adding that the allied governments also bear a responsibility for ensuring the 'comfort women' receive justice. Japan argues that war reparations to individuals and their families were formally settled by the 1951 San Francisco peace treaty. Many governments, including South Korea and Malaysia, have said they would not seek additional state-to-state reparations for comfort women. The acts should have been part of the war crimes trials after the war ended but were not, because the trials focused on acts committed against nationals of the allied powers, the ICJ argues. The ICJ monitors and promotes the rule of law and human rights worldwide. As an non-governmental organisation it has no formal sanctions it can impose. Its reports do, however, carry weight with the UN and by publishing them it hopes the international community will put pressure on governments to correct human rights abuses.</p>

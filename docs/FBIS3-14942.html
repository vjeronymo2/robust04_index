This follows a statement from Defense Committee chairman  Sergey Yushenkov who represented the Russia's Choice Party at  the meeting. In his words, the speaker said that former  prosecuter general Aleksey Kazannik had sent him a letter on  Saturday asking how to implement the Duma amnesty resolution but  announced his resignation later in the day without waiting for  reply.    Yushenkov said that as soon as the Duma reconvened on March  11, a draft resolution would be put up for discussion warning  the uprising leaders that the amnesty could be withdrawn if they  violated Article 70 of the Criminal Code. The article spells  out punishment measures against organizers of mass riots.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UN nuclear call to North Korea The United Nations Security Council yesterday called on North Korea to open military sites to nuclear inspectors and reconsider its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Reuter reports. The vote was 13-0 with China and Pakistan abstaining. While the resolution is fairly mild, it sets the stage for possible future action, such as economic sanctions, though diplomats said there was no sign the UN was contemplating such a move.</p>

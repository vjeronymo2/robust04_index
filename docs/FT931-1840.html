			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heath adds to pressure over fuel tax SIR EDWARD HEATH, the former Conservative prime minister, last night stepped up the pressure on the government not to restrict help with increased costs arising from the extension of value added tax to domestic fuel bills to those receiving social security payments. Speaking in the closing stages of the four-day Commons debate on the Budget he stressed that those 'just above' the qualifying level for income support would also be hard hit by the new impost. Sir Edward called on the government to agree that the right course would be to accept that all in this category should be 'fully' compensated. While giving a general welcome to the Budget, Sir Edward urged the chancellor not to persist in setting targets for cuts in direct taxation. Earlier Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, denied a weekend newspaper report that he had a 'furious row' with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, over the extension of VAT to domestic fuel bills. When consulted on the issue he had made no protest because he shared the chancellor's judgment that it was necessary to raise taxation in the Budget, he told MPs. Mr Heseltine stressed that he had not been prepared to 'cop out of the difficult tax decisions' on the contemptible ground that, while ready to agree in principle, he disagreed with a particular item. In an effort to reassure Tory backbenchers uneasy about the extension of VAT to domestic fuel bills he reaffirmed that there would be extra help for less well-off pensioners and others on low incomes from next April before the higher bills were received. Labour MPs heckled Mr Heseltine when he asserted that this had already been made clear by Mr Lamont and by Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, insisted that the assurances given by the government about compensation were inadequate. He maintained that there were 1.3m pensioners entitled to income support but who did not receive a penny either because of mistaken pride or for other reasons, while another 1m were within 1 per cent of the qualifying level. He urged Tory backbenchers who were not satisfied with the undertakings given by the government to join with Labour MPs at the end of the debate in voting against the extension of VAT to domestic fuel bills.</p>

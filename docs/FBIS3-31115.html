			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, Feb 15 (AFP) -- The United Nations refugees  office is avoiding "non-essential" visits to Bosnia by its staff  before the NATO ultimatum comes into effect this weekend, a  spokeswoman said on Tuesday [15 February].    UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata has  delayed a visit to the former Yugoslavia planned for this week  because of current tensions, Sylvana Foa said.    The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said last Wednesday  that all heavy weapons should be withdrawn from around Sarajevo  or handed over to UN control within 10 days, or they would be  bombed.    "We are not sending non-essential personnel to areas where  there could be problems (...) but all essential personnel remain  in place," said Foa.    Asked about their safety in the case of a possible NATO  airstrike, she said there were "contingency plans for every  situation, but we feel rather comfortable" about it at the  moment.    However the UNHCR was worried about the situation in Mostar,  in southern Bosnia, where Croatian shelling has claimed many  victims, she added.    Aid convoys to east Mostar, under Moslem control, had been  blocked by snow which made it hard to detect landmines.  "Incessant" bombing by Bosnian Croats had caused 37 deaths and  130 injuries in the first five days of February.    "Fifty thousand people in East Mostar are living literally  like rats in cellars, without water, electricity or sanitation,"  said Foa.    In west Mostar, at a psychiatric hospital, around 100  patients were caught in crossfire between the two camps.  Despite local authority promises, it was still proving  impossible to move these patients to another site in a  Croat-controlled zone, she said.    The Moslem enclave of Bihac in western Bosnia was another  black spot, the target of heavy Serb bombing since February 6  which had caused at least six deaths and 100 injuries in its  first few days.    This offensive disrupted the distribution of food aid to the  region, which had been effective until now, and the UNCHR feared  "large movements of displaced persons" as a result, the  spokeswoman said.</p>

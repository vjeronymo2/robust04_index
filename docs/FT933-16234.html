			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / From the brake to the accelerator: The French premier is facing a rising tide of grim economic news At the time of his appointment, Mr Edouard Balladur was supposed to be economically effective and politically low key. But in his first three months as France's prime minister, he has proved to be neither. The economy has continued to sink. Unemployment rose in May to a record 11.5 per cent, and, among leading indicators, housing starts have continued to fall. His stewardship has, of course, been too brief for him to be fairly blamed for the state of the economy. But on taking office, Mr Balladur underestimated the seriousness of recession, and since then has been shifting his foot from the fiscal brake to the fiscal accelerator. Neither he nor his ministers have been able to point to any upturn. At the same time, both the conservative prime minister and Mr Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist president, are rising in the opinion polls. The French seem to appreciate the fact that the two get on well together. Evidence of this was Mr Balladur's readiness to let Mr Mitterrand lead the French delegation at this week's G7 summit in Tokyo while he pushes through a legislative programme at home, including bills for privatisation and Bank of France independence. The leaders of France's governing coalition parties - Mr Jacques Chirac of the RPR Gaullists and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing of the UDF centre-right - had counted on Mr Balladur to quickly put the economy to rights (without acquiring the sort of political profile that might challenge their own ambitions to the Elysee in the 1995 presidential elections). Mr Balladur seems unnerved. He is having to watch his back and front. At his back, he has restive members of his own RPR party. Forty of them deserted him on the bill making the Bank of France independent, while the view of a larger number has been voiced by Mr Philippe Seguin, the National Assembly president, who has warned the government risks 'a social Munich' by surrendering hard-won welfare rights in the fight against unemployment. From the centre-right, has come the recommendation from Mr Raymond Barre that the government should bend to recession and follow a 'more flexible' budgetary policy - giving greater priority to unemployment than to the budget deficit. As if the sniping within government were not enough, Mr Balladur's problems outside cabinet are much more pressing. Some 3.1m are unemployed. The PM has no way of knowing how much higher the jobless figure can go without risking social unrest. Particularly chilling were the words last month of Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister in the last Socialist government. He said the government 'has no chance of success (in fighting unemployment) because it is roughly following the same policy as we did'. He was referring to the fact that Mr Balladur had done little more in his first budget on May 10 than reinforce the budgetary rigor on which the late Mr Pierre Beregovoy - Mr Balladur's predecessor - prided himself. The Balladur One budget involved cutting the 1993 budget deficit from FFr333bn (Pounds 38.81bn) to FFr317bn, by making FFr21.5bn in cuts and raising an extra FFr7.7bn in taxes. But it produced a backbench revolt in the governing parties because its net effect looked likely to depress the economy. Two weeks later, Balladur Two was unveiled. The centrepiece of this is a FFr40bn bond issue, to be covered by the proceeds of privatisation this autumn. Much of the state borrowing would go to expand the temporary work schemes which the Socialists had developed. Mr Balladur is still calling on people to be patient for results. 'When I hear people say they will judge our policy in September, they are talking nonsense because our measures will only have been in effect for a week or two by then,' he scolded recently. But it is now clear that he is no longer in a position to bank on the patience of his countrymen. Last week he said he would in September propose personal tax cuts in a reflationary package which will also include larger depreciation allowances for companies to boost investment. France will then have Balladur Three. Officially, the government has committed itself to a five-year plan to reduce the budget deficit from the equivalent of 4.4 per cent of gross domestic product this year, to 4 per cent next year and to 2.5 per cent by 1997. This last target is largely political, because it would put France within the Maastricht treaty convergence limits just in time for it to be eligible for the European Community's first stab at monetary union. Reducing next year's budget deficit to FFr300bn is not impossible given some growth after this year's contraction in the economy. But if it is not achievable, there will be little dismay in a government which, apart from perhaps Mr Balladur himself and his loyal budget minister, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, is more worried about recovery than book-balancing. Gaullists have always been more concerned about social welfare than, say, today's British Conservatives, while the UDF minister responsible for small business, Mr Alain Madelin, is one of France's very few genuine economic liberals. He argues, and to good effect in Mr Balladur's ear, that France's whole crisis started with investment being cut in 1991-92, and that the crisis will end only when investment picks up. Given that interest rate levels are still constrained by Germany's monetary stance, the next best thing the government can do to revive the key intermediate capital goods sector is to lower other charges, notably fiscal, on industry. In fact, the German monetary constraint on France has diminished. Since April, France has cut its interest rates 10 times, and only on two occasions has it waited for the Bundesbank to act first. If France's inflation remains lower than Germany's and its growth prospects less miserable than Germany's, and if Germany refuses (as is likely) to devalue the D-Mark against the franc, then the French currency would remain conveniently undervalued against German money. This would help French trade, at least across the Rhine. But France's record FFr16.2bn trade surplus in the first quarter of this year (triple the surplus in the same period of 1992) mainly reflects recession at home, with the fall in imports outpacing that in exports. There is nothing in it to give France the self-confidence that would change its attitude to talks aimed at reaching a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. If anything, this attitude has got tougher and more precise. Initially Mr Balladur did not seem to know where he was going. Explaining why he had three times refused Mr Balladur's offer of the agricultural portfolio, Mr Charles Millon, the UDF parliamentary leader, said: 'I never managed to discover what policy he wanted me to adopt.' Eventually, Mr Balladur decided to accept an EC accord with the US on oilseeds production, but to fight Washington, and the rest of the EC if need be, on other farm trade issues. Mr Balladur is right in claiming that Gatt is a test of the EC's identity. If the 12 were now to come apart on trade, then Maastricht and all its pledges of European unity would mean little. The prime minister is therefore taking a gamble with France's investment in Europe. In doing so, he has particular need of Mr Mitterrand's support, especially in light of the president's rapport with Helmut Kohl. That dependence on the Socialist president may yet come to haunt Mr Balladur's fellow conservatives.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Nine UK housing associations raise Pounds 83m NINE UK housing associations yesterday raised Pounds 83m (Dollars 158.53m) from institutional investors by making a bond issue through a joint venture company. The deal, underwritten and arranged by Kleinwort Benson, marks a further step in the battle by housing associations to secure long-term private sector funding. The associations are non-profit-making organisations devoted to providing low-cost housing. The cash raised will be used for building homes and upgrading housing stock. The government has pledged Pounds 1.7bn this year to back development but about Pounds 500m private sector finance is needed. Most private sector funding comes from short-term banking facilities, but housing associations are keen to raise long-term institutional cash. Yesterday's issue was made by Haco, a joint venture company set up by the nine housing associations. Similar vehicles have been used by smaller brewery companies and investment trusts to raise funds from the bond market. The bonds pay a semi-annual coupon of 10 5/8 per cent and were priced to yield 173 basis points more than long-dated UK government paper. Most of the paper was placed with UK institutional investors, although only a small number of institutions are active in the sector. Bankers estimated that yesterday's issue was bought by 25 to 30 life insurance companies and pension funds. Previous bond issues have been made through The Housing Finance Corporation (THFC), which was set up with the backing of the sector regulator, the Housing Corporation, and the National Association of Housing Associations. THFC has raised Pounds 300m through fixed-rate and index-linked bond issues. The bonds are secured on the assets of the nine associations, with interest payments covered by rental income. The nine must maintain interest cover of 125 per cent.</p>

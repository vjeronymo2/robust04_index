			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement by Social Democratic Party of Hungary: </F> "Dear Electors!"]    [Text] On 3 October 1993, the united Social Democratic  Party of Hungary [MSZDP] was established, Zoltan Kiraly is its  chairman, Istvan Podkoniczky its general secretary, and Endre  Borbely is its deputy chairman. Thus, we can represent the  100-years old social democratic values with a renewed force.    The MSZDP, the party of society, wants a Hungary,    -- where the state serves the interests of society and  individuals,    -- where the basic human rights are respected, everyone is  free to practice his religion, and, at the same time, state and  church are separate,    -- where religious, ethnic, cultural, or other minorities  cannot be discriminated against,    -- where the equality of women is not only true on paper,    -- where citizens' equality of opportunity prevails in  education and culture, and participation in health and welfare  provisions is ensured,    -- where the burden of taxation is justly shared and people  can live in security,    -- where Eastern-Central European countries that are  striving  to establish democratic societies and welfare market economies  can implement mutually advantageous cooperation,    -- where those forms of ownership that are most efficient  from the economy's and society's point of view exist side by  side, and the state does not interfere in the economy,    -- where the state accepts the obligation for ensuring  education, culture, health, and welfare provisions,    -- where tax and customs allowances are given to those  enterprises that create workplaces, and unemployment is fought  through retraining and further training,    -- where modern agricultural production is done in  cooperatives and farms,    -- where socially controlled privatization is accomplished  with the participation of the employees,    -- where the influx of foreign capital helps technical  development and the creation of workplaces,    -- where the state, local governments, and society  institutionally ensure the reduction of natural and  environmental damage,    -- where strong trade unions ensure the interest protection  of employees,    -- where the real value of pensions is preserved through  legal guarantees,    -- where the material subsistence level is guaranteed by a  social insurance system that includes all citizens,    -- where young people beginning their working life can  acquire dwellings through preferential loans.</p>

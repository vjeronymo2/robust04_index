			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Arts: Crucial times for St Paul's - Architecture An important event happened in the City of London last week. The proposals for the redevelopment of Paternoster Square, that crucial area around St. Paul's Cathedral, have received the approval, by 18 votes to one, of the City of London Planning and Communications Committee. Later this week the plans go before the City's Court of Common Council, which is likely to accept the firm recommendations of the officials and the Planning Committee and give the proposals of the long suffering Paternoster Consortium its blessing. We all know what Robert Burns had to say about the best laid plans of mice and men, and indeed there is one last hurdle to be jumped before this long saga ends and building can commence. The redevelopment of the whole area around Paternoster Square comes under the jurisdiction of something called 'Article 14', a device that effectively gives the last word to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Howard. While the City of London can make a resolution to grant planning consent it cannot actually give consent. Only the Minister can give the final go ahead. There is a perfectly sensible reason for this. It has long been felt by many people, not least HRH The Prince of Wales, that this important site should be looked at as a whole. As it is not entirely in one ownership, ensuring sympathetic approaches is both difficult and important. The Paternoster Consortium is made up of the British company, Greycoat Estates; the Japanese group, Mitsubishi Estates; and the American property company, Park Tower Realty. The Consortium owns 4.2 acres of the 7 acre site to the north east of St. Paul's, for which it paid Pounds 149m in 1989. The other major parts of the site are owned by Nuclear Electric, which owns the hideous tower Sudbury House, to be demolished; and Standard Life, which owns Juxon House, in front of the cathedral, also to be demolished.' Article 14' is being used to help the minister to ensure that all the owners reach agreement on the relationships between their sites. The architects for the replacement building for Sudbury House are Rolfe Judd and Partners and for Juxon House, William Whitfield. The Minister is a practical planning man who will see that there is now almost total unanimity on the future of this crucial site. He will surely note the sensible words of the City of London planning officer, Mr Peter Rees, who has said that 'architecture is a matter of taste', but that this scheme is 'the appropriate one for the site'. The public like the scheme and have said so at recent public exhibitions. Patient diplomacy has ensured agreement between the three major land owners. There is little point in reopening the architectural debate, or a lengthy, expensive public inquiry which will only succeed in making London look as though it is the one city in Europe that cannot make up its mind about the future of its major development sites. The one tiresome body which is apparently determined to throw its ineffectual weight about is the powerless but noisy Royal Fine Art Commission. It is difficult to take its views seriously because they seem to be based upon architectural prejudice and the festering disappointment of some members of the Commission not successful in earlier competitive plans for the same site. In a deeply subjective letter, of a kind that has become all to familiar when a traditional style of building is proposed for a prominent site in the capital, the present chairman of the commission says, 'It believes that a 'classical' scheme like Paternoster Square should be a genuine re-interpretation of Classicism in terms of our own time, the 1990's. It is Mr William Whitfield's early design for Juxon House which in the Commission's view appears to be working towards a more contemporary and appropriate solution.' Mr Whitfield is, of course, a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission who has designed some fine buildings, but surely he is too closely involved in this scheme to be held up as the ideal architect. The developers naturally hope that the Minister will not be swayed by such a partial letter that also demands a long winded public inquiry. Mr Howard is very well equipped to see that what matters for London is not the style of the architecture, but the importance of making progress on a prominent site that will not be developed, whatever happens, until almost the end of the decade. There is a lot to be said for the agreeableness of the present plans. There is a lot to be said for the Minister listening to the City of London and the public and ignoring the pontifications of a partial body, the Royal Fine Art Commission, that appears to represent the views of a very small rump of architects. May Paternoster progress - with all speed as an important symbol of the recovery of the centre of London as a key European city.</p>

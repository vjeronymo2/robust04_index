			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting of the commission for financial issues of  the Russian armed forces presided over by First Deputy Defense  Minister Andrey Kokoshin Thursday focused on the results of  financing the army over the first four months of this year and  the spending of particular units and districts.    Salaries of officers and civilian personnel, food, nuclear  security and combat training were among the priorities. It was  pointed out that the withdrawal of Russian troops and their  accommodation required an unprecedented amount of money.    As for the funds set aside from military appropriations to  pay for the state defense orders, they were used mainly to pay  for the production of combat management and communications  hardware, high- precision weapons and radio and electronic  counteraction means.    According to a Defense Ministry statement, the meeting was  told that financing the army activities involved long delays,  while the state's debt to the army and the defense industries  continued to grow.</p>

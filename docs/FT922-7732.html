			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Taking the rough with the smooth - Scheherazade Daneshkhu reminds investors that Pep charges can outweigh the tax benefits AS INTEREST rates drop, savers may be considering an investment in shares through the putative attractions of a personal equity plan. 'Putative' because the charges involved can be steep and a Pep might not be the most cost-efficient way into equities for everyone. Individuals can shelter Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and, in addition, Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep in any one tax year. Returns are exempt from income and capital gains tax. If you are thinking of having a Pep, there are two broad issues to consider. The first is your own tax position and the second is the type of Pep. Many investors see the label 'tax-free' on Peps and assume automatically that this means large profits. But this is far from the case. You must be sure that you are buying a Pep because you want to invest in the stock market. Remember that equity investment always involves risk and the rewards may take several years to come through. To minimise the risks, you have to ride out the bad times - which means being prepared to let your money sit in the market until it recovers. Those who bought in the summer of 1987, and sold in panic after Black Monday, had the worst of both worlds. But for long-term investors, the 1987 crash was just a blip in their fortunes. If you have a large portfolio of equities already, then it could make sense to place the maximum amount in a Pep this year. Over the years, you will quickly build up quite a large tax-free portfolio, and this could result in considerable capital gains tax savings. If you are a small investor (under, say, Pounds 10,000), then CGT is not likely to be much of a problem (the annual allowance is Pounds 5,800 and you also benefit from indexation for inflationary gains). So, the key benefit to you is the income tax saving. This will be quite small in the early years, particularly if you are a basic-rate taxpayer, and the charges can easily eat up these savings. Basically, there are three different types of Pep: unit or investment trusts, managed Peps, and self-select Peps. Managed Peps These are Peps run by a financial company which chooses the stocks on the investor's behalf. They can be a mix of shares with unit and/or investment trusts or shares alone. Assume that a higher-rate taxpayer puts Pounds 6,000 into a managed Pep investing solely in shares. The dividend yield on the FT-All Share index is now around 4.5 per cent (which also happens to be the average for the past 10 years). However, since the Pep is geared towards income, we can assume a yield of 6 per cent in the first year, with the income increasing by 5 per cent a year. The annual income on the Pep would thus be Pounds 360, and the tax saving for a higher-rate taxpayer Pounds 144 - or 2.4 per cent of the value of the Pep. However, charges on managed Peps are much higher than this in the first year. The initial charge is likely to be in the region of 5-6 per cent with an annual management charge of 1-1.5 per cent. VAT is payable on top of this. There will also be dealing charges. Plan managers with a low initial charge (around 1 to 3 per cent) tend to have higher dealing charges of 1.65 to 2 per cent every time shares are bought or sold. Otherwise, dealing charges can be as low as 0.2 per cent. In addition, there can be a penalty charge for partial withdrawal and transfer charges should you want to move to another Pep. Whichever method is used, it will take a number of years for the higher-rate taxpayer to see the benefits of his tax-free Pep. If we assume an initial charge of 5 per cent plus VAT, an annual fee of 1 per cent plus VAT, and 0.2 per cent for the initial purchase of the shares, the cost in the first year would be Pounds 435. This is compared with the tax saving of Pounds 144. Obviously, costs would be much lower in the second year, comprising the annual fee of Pounds 70.50. It would not be until the sixth year of the Pep that the tax break would show. But if the initial charge was lower, it would take less time for the tax saving to come through. Unit and investment trust Peps For those making their initial foray into the stock market, the Pounds 6,000 Pep limit in any one tax year would not buy a very wide range of individual stocks. The direct investor would thus be at risk if there was a sudden plunge in one of his chosen shares. One of the best ways of diversifying your risk is through a unit or investment trust which invests in scores of companies. 'The vast majority of managed Peps are either unit or investment trust Peps,' says Roz Barder of Chase de Vere, the financial adviser which produces a PepGuide. She adds: 'More and more companies offering unit or investment trusts do not charge any extra for putting the investment in a Pep.' If you were thinking of investing in the stock market through one of these vehicles, you might as well do so with a Pep. There might be a small additional charge for going into the Pep - about 0.5 per cent a year because of the increased administration of reclaiming tax on dividends. Unit trusts commonly have an initial charge of 5-6 per cent and an annual management charge of 1 or 1.5 per cent. Buying into an investment trust will involve stockbroker's commission and stamp duty; annual management fees are normally under 1 per cent. Barder expects the abolition of the Pounds 3,000 limit on unit trust and investment trust Peps to lead to lower charges by the plan managers. This is because it will no longer be necessary to 'top-up' these Peps with blue-chip shares to make up the full Pounds 6,000. Investment trusts highlighted by Chase de Vere as good performers are Touche Remnant's City of London and Fleming Claverhouse. Touch Remnant has a 5 per cent initial charge and dealing charges are 0.3 per cent. If the Pep is invested solely in investment trust companies, the annual management charge is 1 per cent; on equity investment, it is 1.5 per cent. Charges at Fleming comprise a 1.5 per cent initial fee, while the annual charge is Pounds 25 and transaction charges are 1.75 per cent. On the unit trust side, Barder recommends James Capel and Eagle Star. Capel's unit trust-only Pep charges 5.25 per cent initial (an all-in fee) while Eagle Star charges 6 per cent initial with a 1 per cent annual management fee. Unfortunately, the government's geographical restrictions on Peps mean that the broadly-based international trusts, such as Foreign &amp; Colonial, still do not qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 allowance. Self-select Peps These are much cheaper than the managed Peps because you are not paying for advice. But you have to be confident about your own ability to select shares. If you are, then price is the main reason for choosing this method. There are a number of Pep plan managers who make no initial or annual charge for dealing in shares. These include Killik (071-224-2050), Pilling (061-832-6581), Reyker Securities (071-499-9097) and Sharelink (021-200-4545). The commission on dealings at Killik is 1.65 per cent, subject to a Pounds 40 minimum, but there is a separate charge of Pounds 7.50 for dividend collection. Sharelink also has no initial fee. It has an annual administration fee (which will cover dividend collection) of 0.75 per cent, subject to a minimum of Pounds 20. Dealing charges are 1.5 per cent, with a minimum of Pounds 17.50 and a maximum of Pounds 37.50. When selecting the shares for your Pep, you need to ensure that the choices reflect your tax situation. Those who are buying a Pep for the income tax saving obviously need to choose those with a decent yield; there is, for example, no point in placing zero coupon preference shares in a Pep unless you are a regular CGT payer.</p>

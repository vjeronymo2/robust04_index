			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Feb 18 (AFP)--Some 1,783 coal mines in  northeastern China have been closed amid concern about the  growing number of fatal accidents there, the China Business  Times reported Friday.    The report blamed Heilongjiang province's Jixi city mining  accidents on poor management and said the mines would be  reorganised. The report did not say when or whether the  Manchurian mines would reopen.    In addition, mine safety would be increased, the newspaper  said.    Officials who do not properly understand mining or  management  and inadequately trained technical staff and miners will be  replaced, the report said, adding that women employed  underground will not remain in those jobs.    Emphasis will be put on upgrading safety equipment, the  newspaper said.    Northeastern China is the centre of the country's coal  mining  industry, where dismal safety standards cause large numbers of  accidents and fatalities.    In the final week of January alone, 155 people died in a  series of deadly gas explosions in coal mines. The worst  accident killed 99 miners.    Labour and coal officials held an emergency meeting early  this month after the spate of accidents.    The worst safety conditions are in the thousands of small,  private operations that have mushroomed across the country and  hired workers from the countryside without properly training  them, the newspaper said.</p>

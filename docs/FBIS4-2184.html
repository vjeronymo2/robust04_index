			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, April 7 (XINHUA) -- East China's Fujian  Province is encouraging economic co-operation between the  coastal and mountainous areas where developments are uneven.    The coastal cities of Fuzhou, Xiamen and Quanzhou concluded  hundreds of agreements on economic co-operation with the  mountainous prefectures of Ningde, Longyan, Sanming and Nanping  last year, with the former providing capital, technology and  information to the latter.    The Sanming city alone signed 154 contract on economic  co-operation with the coastal cities of Putian, Quanzhou and  Xiamen, involving a total investment of 400 million yuan. The  contracts cover the building materials, forestry and chemical  industries, according to Guan Qing, chairman of the provincial  economic cooperation office.    The economy in the coastal areas of the province is growing  faster than the mountainous thanks to the policy of opening to  the outside world. The provincial move is believed to be part  of the nation-wide bid to narrow the gap between those  comparatively developed and underdeveloped areas.</p>

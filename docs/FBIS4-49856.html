			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- A socialist market  economy will eventually replace the planned economy, and the  next few years will be crucial for that transition, senior  Chinese official Li Tieying said here today.    Addressing the '94 China Summit, the state councillor said  15  years of reform and opening to the outside world have anchored  the national economy on a fast-expansion track. As the world's  last big market, China now holds great appeal for foreign  investors.    From 1979 to 1993 China approved 174,000 joint ventures,  which absorbed actual foreign capital totaling 63.9 billion U.S.  dollars. In 1993 alone, foreign funds utilized by China amounted  to 25.7 billion U.S. dollars.    Li said that China has in recent years put more stress on  exchanges and co-operation in the opening-up drive, and  encouraged competent domestic enterprises to invest overseas.    By 1993 China had launched 4,497 firms in 120 countries and  regions, with 5.16 billion U.S. dollars in investment.    Li said that reform and opening conform to the fundamental  interests of the Chinese people and contribute to world peace,  stability and development as well.    "China will continue the reform and opening up process in  the  years to come," said Li.    Li, who is also the minister in charge of the State  Commission on Restructuring the Economy, said that since 1992  China's reform has centered around building up a socialist  market economy in unprecedentedly big strides in the reform and  opening-up policies.    He briefed the participants at the summit on China's reform  blueprint and economic development strategy.    He said China will open up further to merge with the world  economy. It will establish a transparent foreign trade system  and actively participate in international competition and  co-operation.    In pushing ahead with foreign trade reform, Li said, China  will give more autonomy to foreign trade companies and set up a  new import mechanism which will gradually allow the auctioning  of and public bidding for import quotas and permits.</p>

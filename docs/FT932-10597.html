			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (3): The end of an era - President Turgut Ozal, who was the dominant figure in Turkish politics for the last ten years, died on April 17.  Edward Mortimer assesses his achievements and legacy NO TURKISH leader since the founder of the republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, has presided over such profound changes in his country as Turgut Ozal, who was prime minister from 1983 to 1989, and president from then until his death three weeks ago. And none, at least since Adnan Menderes (prime minister throughout the 1950s), has set his personal stamp so firmly on the country's politics. Ozal chose to be buried close to Menderes's grave in Istanbul, which suggests he may have thought of him as a precursor. Both moved Turkish politics in a democratic direction after a period of authoritarian rule, while relaxing the state's grip on the economy and presiding over a period of rapidly growing prosperity. Both were firmly pro-western in their foreign policy: while Menderes sent troops to Korea and took Turkey into Nato, Ozal applied for EC membership and let Turkish bases be used for operations against Iraq during and after the Gulf war. Both found ways of exploiting the Turkish people's profound attachment to Islam without directly challenging Ataturk's legacy of secularism. Similarly, both contrived to be seen as more sympathetic, or at any rate less oppressive, than their predecessors by the Kurdish population of south-eastern Turkey, though both remained firmly committed to the unity of the country even if it had to be maintained by force. Both, moreover, were highly controversial figures, seen by many as gathering too much power in their own hands and using it to enrich themselves and their families. Both suffered political defeat at the end of their lives. But, while Menderes was overthrown by a military coup and subsequently hanged, Ozal first lost control of his own party and then saw it defeated at the polls, being thus obliged for the last year and a half of his presidency to cohabit with a government formed by his opponents. He remained in office, but out of power - a situation he exploited to regain popularity by making public gestures or statements going beyond government policy on various issues, in a direction favoured by public sentiment. His sudden death provoked an outpouring of genuine grief which, while not quite unanimous, went much wider than his popularity had done while he was in power. Many Turks realised only then how much he had done to change their lives, mostly for the better. That Ozal's career ended so much more happily and peacefully than that of Menderes reflects the fact that in fostering democracy, as in most other respects, he had been able to take things further than Menderes did. It would be hard to say how far that was due to his personal qualities, and how far to the simple fact that, in spite of setbacks, the process of change had continued during the intervening generation. No doubt whoever ruled Turkey during the 1980s would have been obliged to open up the economy to the outside world, and whoever was elected to power after the military regime of 1980-3 would have gradually relaxed political constraints and allowed greater freedom. In the latter respect, Ozal in fact moved fairly gingerly. Although his coming to power in 1983 was undoubtedly a slap in the face for the generals, who had intended the election to be won by one of their own number, it is also true that it could not have happened but for the ban on the entire pre-1980 political leadership which the generals had imposed. As prime minister with President Kenan Evren, the author of the 1980 coup looking over his shoulder, Ozal took only slow and cautious steps to dismantle censorship and other restrictions or to curb human rights violations. In the referendum on restoring political rights to the banned leaders, by then his rivals, he took a formally neutral position. Suleyman Demirel, the pre-coup prime minister who had brought Ozal into government as an economic technician, always regarded his subsequent emergence in a political role as tainted with illegitimacy. Demirel also contested the legitimacy of Ozal's election as president in 1989 by a parliamentary majority which, at that point, was far from reflecting a majority in the country. Having had his revenge in 1991, when he trounced Ozal's party at the polls and came back as prime minister, Demirel now faces the bitter-sweet prospect of succeeding Ozal as president in rather similar circumstances. An economist by training, Ozal was bolder in economic than in political reforms. Between 1980 and 1982, as deputy prime minister in charge of economic policy, he brought down inflation from 107 to 25 per cent by withholding state support from industrialist and consumer alike, allowing the exchange rate to fall and domestic interest rates to shoot up while wages lagged behind and uncompetitive firms, including some of the banks, went bankrupt. At this point he resigned and started quietly building his own political party, which the generals made the mistake of not taking seriously until too late: they probably thought he had made himself too unpopular to matter. Once in power in his own right, he continued with free-market reforms - deregulation, lowering of import barriers, abolition of exchange controls, full convertibility of the lira, and a start on privatisation  - but was much less rigorous about the money supply. By 1991 inflation was back up at 70 per cent, and though the Turkey enjoyed record growth rates through the 1980s the benefits were far from equally shared. There was a widespread feeling that the rich in general, and the Ozal family in particular, were getting much more than their due. Yet the truth is that nearly all Turks are materially better off now than they were when Ozal came to power. And he brought the country some less tangible benefits, too. Having outwitted the military and come to power with their reluctant blessing, he was less overawed by them than earlier civilian leaders had been. For the first time in the republic's history, he proved - by imposing his own choice as head of the armed forces in 1987, and by ignoring their views during the Gulf crisis in 1990 - that the civil power can control the military rather than the other way round. He was not overawed, either, by the towering figure of Ataturk, whose picture adorns every public building in Turkey. In his last years, especially, he was quite uninhibited about his public behaviour, whether observing Islamic rites, indulging his appetite for the good things of life (including some from which a stricter Moslem would abstain), or simply saying what he thought. He was a figure with whom ordinary Turkish citizens could identify, including many of those who were proud to be Kurds, or pious Moslems, or indeed both. He leaves Turkey not only a richer country, but one better equipped than it was for living at peace with itself.</p>

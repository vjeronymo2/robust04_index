			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: H&amp;C tumbles 33% but pays uncovered maintained dividend HARRISONS &amp; Crosfield yesterday recommended an unchanged final dividend of 5.4p although the 9p total for 1991 was not covered by earnings of 7p per share. Earnings in 1990 totalled 11.6p per share. Mr John Maltby, chairman, said the board had given considerable thought to the dividend. He said many of the group's shareholders were high income funds; shareholders had supported the rights issue in May 1990; the group's cashflow could sustain the payment and prospects for a recovery in profits were good enough to justify it. The shares rose 2p to 126p in response, against the market trend. However, Mr Maltby said that 1991 was 'not the happiest of years', and so far in 1992 there were 'only faint signs of recovery'. Pre-tax profits tumbled 33 per cent to Pounds 71.2m (Pounds 106.1m). Group sales were 2.2 per cent up at Pounds 1.83bn, but operating profits fell 27 per cent to Pounds 92.4m (Pounds 126m) after a loss on disposals of Pounds 1.4m (profit Pounds 6.1m). Redundancy costs of about Pounds 2.5m were charged against profits. Operating profits from the chemical and industrial division were 32 per cent lower at Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 44.3m). Mr George Paul, chief executive, said the profits were hit by falling demand from the building products industry and by increased competition from Russia. In the timber and building supplies division, profits fell 33 per cent to Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 34.2m), though in the second half the fall was shallower than in the first. The main problem was a sharp fall in UK sales volumes, although a higher gross margin following the acquisition of Crossley in May 1990 and cost savings alleviated the profit decline. The food and agriculture division, which is being boosted by the acquisition of BOCM-Silcock, suffered a Pounds 1m profit fall to Pounds 30.4m after an increase in profits in the first half. Here the sharp fall in pig prices hit pig feed profits but most other areas were ahead. Pig prices have recovered again. The group makes own-label foods for supermarkets but has just launched a branded dog food called Bakers Complete. The plantations business increased profits from Pounds 10m to Pounds 10.5m helped by higher yields, especially for cocoa where trees planted in recent years are reaching full production. The interest charge was higher at Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 19.9m). After a 31.5 per cent tax rate (30 per cent), profits attributable to shareholders were Pounds 48.2m (Pounds 75m) while the dividend cost Pounds 61.7m (Pounds 61.6m). Net borrowings were Pounds 185.3m (Pounds 176m) at the year-end and shareholders' funds were Pounds 488m (Pounds 514m). Interest cover was 4.4 times (6.3 times). The cashflow statement showed a Pounds 6m deficit. H&amp;C cut working capital by Pounds 45m, mainly in the timber division, and disposals raised Pounds 37m, covering the Pounds 31m spent on acquisitions. See Lex</p>

After the meeting, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong  Sunsiri said the two Cambodian leaders rejected the report on  Thailand's support for the Khmer Rouge [KR]. They said the  report was unreliable and released by Cambodians who did not  hold important positions and that the Cambodian Government has  warned them against spreading such accusations. The foreign  minister said Thailand still adheres to the policy of  noninvolvement with the Khmer Rouge and supports the elected  government. The Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong  Sunsiri said:    [Begin Prasong recording] I would like to reaffirm that this  government supports the elected government of Cambodia and not  any other faction. I stressed this stand during my meeting with  the two prime ministers and told them that Thailand is willing  to support their elected government in the reconstruction of  Cambodia as before. We spoke frankly to each other. [end  recording]</p>

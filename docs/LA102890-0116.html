			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: REQUESTS FOR CUSTOM TAGS GET A GOOD GOING-OVER BY THE  CENSORSHIP FOLKS  </P> <P> ONE OF THE FEW remaining pleasures of freeway driving is deciphering those  custom license plates -- the ones that say I WUV U and so forth.  </P> <P> They are called "personalized license plates" because they reflect the  interests, the occupations or the passions of their owners. They are also  called "environmental plates," since the fees paid for them go to the state's  environmental program.  </P> <P> They are often amusing, sometimes too clever to understand and sometimes too  cute to bear. One expresses a wistful wish: 02B21. Some seem close to the edge  of good taste, but few go over it.  </P> <P> The state is vigilant against sexual innuendoes and racial slurs. Plates that  violate the rules are rejected. The testing is thorough. They are even read  backwards, to avoid words that could be obscene in rear-view mirrors.  </P> <P> My wife and I have never had personalized plates. My reason is that I have  thought of only two I wanted, and both have already been taken. One was J  SMITH. One day I parked right behind a J SMITH on York Boulevard. The other was  FIAT LUX -- let there be light. I would have bought a Fiat to go with it, but,  alas, my wife saw it one day on a freeway.  </P> <P> Yvonne M. de La Paix of Westminster writes to complain about a letter she  received from the Department of Motor Vehicles ordering her to surrender her  plates. They read DOO WHOP, and the DMV explained that the Sons of Italy had  complained that word WHOP was too close to a racial epithet.  </P> <P> In the first place, De La Paix notes, she had sold the car and the plates five  months before receiving the DMV's letter. "I was still angered by the letter,  implying that I was a bigot, and that if I didn't turn over my plates in 14  days, I would be taken to court."  </P> <P> DOO WHOP, she says, was a very popular form of music in the '50s and '60s. It  might be spelled in various ways, she concedes, but WHOP is one. The Sons of  Italy demanded the recall of any plates that sounded like either of two  epithets commonly applied to Italians. The DMV told her that their computers  had turned up 400 such words among plates already issued.  </P> <P> "My license plate was not in any way a racist comment," she says. "unless the  DMV or the Sons of Italy didn't know what they were attacking. You can bet that  any employee of Burger King with a license that reads WHOPPER got the same  letter."  </P> <P> De La Paix wonders how far this sensitivity can be carried. "With media fanning  the fires of ethnic and religious tension, how far are we supposed to go to  avoid being called a bigot? Are we looking for racism everywhere, hoping to  find it? Do we have to start stretching our imagination to wild lengths to find  it?"  </P> <P> I agree with De La Paix that the injunction against WHOP is too strenuous.  There was no intent in DOO WHOP to suggest the other word; it is indeed a  different word. And in conjunction with DOO, the other word would be  meaningless.  </P> <P> Meanwhile John Kane of Rancho Palos Verdes condemns me for agreeing in a recent  column with columnist Mike Royko that the proscription of many common words and  phrases on "racist" grounds has gone too far. On the other hand, I said, there  were certain words I would never use, for the same reason.  </P> <P> "I am quite disappointed in you," Kane writes. "It seems to me that freedom of  speech means freedom of speech and that reporters and columnists (such as  yourself and Royko) should support it unhesitatingly and without any  reservations or pussy-footing around for fear of hurting someone's feelings.  </P> <P> "Either we have freedom of speech or we do not. For any newspaper and any  writer to agree that any pre-censorship is correct appalls me beyond belief. It  seems to me that once we start saying 'You can say what you wish except for . .  .' we are in serious trouble. Sir, I am ashamed of you."  </P> <P> Oh, fiddlesticks, Kane.  </P> <P> We live in a multiethnic society. In any society, the language inevitably  produces words that offend or abuse certain groups. Anyone who cares about  achieving harmony in that society will voluntarily avoid using words that act  as firebrands.  </P> <P> As Oliver Wendell Holmes said, one may not, under the protection of the First  Amendment, cry "Fire!" in a crowded theater. Likewise, one ought not to use  inflammatory terms in a crowded society. One who writes for a newspaper of  general circulation is especially commended to this discretion.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the Department of Motor Vehicles is too easily spooked in  deferring to demands for the censorship of WHOP. The next thing you know  they'll censor SECTS on the ground that it sounds too much like you know what.  </P></p>

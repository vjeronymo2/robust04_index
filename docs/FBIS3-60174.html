The officers in question are FAP Majors Alfredo Ruiz Hurtado  and Enrique Pavia Alvarez.    The information was confirmed by Defense Minister Victor  Malca Villanueva last month through a note remitted to Congress  First Vice President Carlos Torres y Torres Lara on 1 December.  The note was the defense minister's answer to a request for  details made by leftist legislator Julio Castro Gomez.    Major Ruiz Hurtado was in charge of Uchiza's Air Force base  from 2 to 31 July of last year. During that period the major  charged fees for permitting airplanes transporting drugs from  the area to take off.    The initial report on the irregular situation was made by  the  FAP personnel who replaced the major. As a consequence, a  special board was appointed to investigate the case. At the end  of the investigation the major was accused of being directly  responsible, and was immediately placed at the disposal of the  High-Ranking Officers Investigating Council and the FAP War  Council, which opened an inquiry that is still going on.    Major Enrique Pavia Alvarez, in turn, was in charge of  Sapasoa's Air Force base from 17 July to 15 August 1993. Pavia  confessed to having illegally participated in the interdiction  of a light plane carrying drugs. He testified to this effect  before the Sixth Territorial Region's commander general, based  in Santa Lucia.    According to Minister Malca's report, Enrique Pavia said he  acted the way he did, "on 14 August, the day before he was  replaced, because he was being pressured by civilian authorities  (political and judicial) and members of the city's forces of  order."    "In view of the situation the commander ordered the  beginning  of an investigation and transferred him to Lima. The case is  currently under administrative investigation by the FAP as well  as under judicial investigation by the Air Force War Council,"  Minister Malca's report said.    "It is not clearly established, however, why are they being  tried by the military justice. Neither is it a common crime,"  congressman Castro Gomez told EXPRESO.</p>

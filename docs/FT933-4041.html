			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Observer: Undermined mole Poles are beginning to feel a little edgy about who, constitutionally, controls their secret police service, known as the UOP. The circumstances surrounding the dismissal last Friday of Adam Hodysz, the chief of Gdansk's secret police unit and one of Solidarity's heroes, have now been taken up by Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka. She plans to start an official inquiry into the affair. Hodysz, 53, was the Gdansk dissident movement's mole in the local secret police headquarters from 1978 till his arrest in 1984, when he served a four-year prison sentence for his pains. Hodysz is also acclaimed for having warned Solidarity's leadership about the imminent imposition of martial law in December 1981. In the post-communist era Hodysz was reinstated, his moral credibility as high as that of anyone in Poland. He was appointed chief of the UOP in Gdansk in early 1990. What has got the gossips going is that Hodysz's replacement is Henryk Zabicki, another secret policeman who first caught Lech Walesa's eye in 1985, while in charge of watching the future president. Zabicki has more recently managed the security guards protecting the president's children in Gdansk. Constitutionally, the hiring and firing of security officials lies with the government, not the presidency. But some observers detect the presidential hand in the otherwise puzzling demotion of Hodysz.</p>

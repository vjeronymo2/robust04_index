			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Arts: Brooding Russian - Concert On Tuesday we should have heard Nikolai Demidenko playing Tchaikovsky and Rakhmaninov piano trios in the Wigmore Hall, with his violin-compatriot Grigori Zhislin and the French-Canadian cellist Sophie Rolland. But when we got there, the concert had shrunk to a solo recital by Demidenko. I might just have gone home; this formidable pianist compels admiration, but rarely any sympathetic warmth. His last-minute programme included a lot of Nikolai Medtner, however - two of whose concerti he recorded with electrifying commitment last year; so I stayed. Medtner is a peculiarly interesting composer: a contemporary of Skryabin and Rakhmaninov, and hugely fluent - but unlike them a Westernising 'conservative', because his favoured models were Schumann and Brahms. He fled Russia soon after the Revolution, and lived his last 30-odd years in Golders Green. Demidenko cuts rather a daunting figure: lofty, chilly, saturnine. His Medtner here was the Sonata Reminiscenza and the Sonata Tragica, each of them prefaced by a slighter piece from which it grew: a 'Canzona Serenata' and a 'Canzona Matinata', respectively wistful and morning-dewy. Viktoria Postnikova used to make a speciality of the Sonata Reminiscenza, which flowed under her hands continuously and hauntingly, amid subtle shadings. With Demidenko each new thematic idea arrived with a grinding clash, as if Medtner's structures were held together by main force alone. Moments of pungent character erupted as if from nowhere, lightning-flashes in no cogent order. The laser-illuminations were brilliant, their sequence fractured and unpersuasive. Demidenko had begun his recital with Tchaikovsky's Dumka, virtually an 'occasional' piece - tuneful but little more than routine concert-stuff, which he searched through with slow, excruciating tenderness, rather marvellous to hear. The second half of his programme, all Rakhmaninov (three Etudes-Tableaux, seven Preludes), was only fitfully concentrated. There was a regular scatter of finger-slips, especially in rapid bass-shots - most unlike Demidenko's usual omni-competent form. The E-flat minor Etude-Tableau began with a nervily original kind of brooding and ended in drawn-out gloom, but the middle was all-out, triple-forte bashing. The programme-notes reported the expatriate Demidenko as declaring that 'being Russian is a duty'] That may be so; but the duty need not be so icy, nor so grimly stern.</p>

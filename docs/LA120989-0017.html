			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MARIN COUNTY;  </P> <P> JUDGE LIMITS SEARCH OF PRISON VISITORS  </P> <P> Visitors at California state prisons do not have to submit to automatic strip  searches or dog searches of their vehicles, according to a court ruling. Marin  County Superior Court Judge Richard Breiner has issued a permanent injunction  forbidding dog searches of cars without visitors' written consent. It also  requires corrections officers at the state's 20 prisons to let visitors leave  the institutions' parking lots without forfeiting their visit if they refuse to  allow the search. Strip searches will not be allowed without reasonable cause,  Breiner said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Amr Nasif from Cairo] </F>   [Excerpt] In the past few days, Turah prison wardens have  separated Mahmud Nur-al-Din, leader of the Nasirite group  Egypt's Revolution, from 'Abbud-al-Zumur, leader of the al-Jihad  Organization.    Both men are serving life sentences: Nur-al-Din for his  leadership of Egypt's Revolution, a group that between 1986 and  1988 killed Israeli elements and people working for the Mosad in  Cairo; and Al-Zumur for his involvement in the assassination of  President Anwar al-Sadat.    Security sources attribute this move to the close ties that  had recently grown between Nur-al-Din and al-Zumur, culminating  in their agreement to alternate in leading the inmates in  prayers.    Nur-al-Din has won the confidence of al-Jihad inmates in  Turah jail. The prisoners treat him as a spiritual father.  Those on death row have a long meeting with him before their  execution and sometimes scribble a note of gratitude on a scrap  of their clothes for him to keep as a souvenir. Nur-al-Din, for  his part, normally leads the prayer for the absent--a memorial  service for the executed al-Jihad members.    Nur-al-Din has issued a call to the Islamic Group and the  al-Jihad Organization through AL-SAFIR, asking them to attack  Israeli targets and interests in Egypt instead of the Egyptian  police, tourism, and banks.

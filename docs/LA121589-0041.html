			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES;  </P> <P> WARM WATER LURES FISH FROM KING HARBOR TO ROCKY POINT  </P> <P> There may be a chill in the air but the ocean is warming up.  </P> <P> A massive area of warm water has surfaced from King Harbor south to Rocky  Point.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing Pier there has been a wide-open bonito bite since last  weekend for pier anglers and those fishing the rocks.  </P> <P> Warm water flowing from the Edison Plant heated the ocean's temperature in the  harbor, which was already warmer than normal for this time of year. This  unquestionably attracted the bonito.  </P> <P> The pier's fishing space was tight as anglers hooked fish on nearly every cast.  </P> <P> Two pier regulars, Ken Schultz and Barney Cohen of Redondo Beach said it's is  just like the good old days when they had wide-open fishing for all species of  surface fish.  </P> <P> Cohen said: "When we caught the five-fish limit, instead of hooking more just  to release them for sport we put the rod up and gave the space to two  youngsters."  </P> <P> Mona Green of San Pedro was at the pier Monday and caught her five-fish limit  of bonito in 10 minutes. Green changed her fishing gear to a halibut rig,  inserted a squid on her hook and brought up a halibut that weighed six pounds.  </P> <P> Five South Bay anglers who returned from Mexico after fishing aboard the  private yacht Instinct reported outstanding success using kelp patties to lure  yellowtail.  </P> <P> Rick Lyman and Pete Hoffman of Manhattan Beach caught easy limits. Phil  Friedman, Bob Alvarez and Leon Campazzie of Torrance also bagged limits.  </P> <P> Skipper Mitch Fowikes said this was the best trip of the fall. All fish weighed  15 pounds or more.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches:  </P> <P> Joe Lepe of West Los Angeles, fishing in Santa Monica Bay on the Spitfire,  caught the whopper of the week, a 36 1/4-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Ed Hopkins of Mar Vista, aboard the Betty O at the Rockpile, won the jackpot  with a 22-pound lingcod.  </P> <P> Bob Kernes of Long Beach, using cut squid at Rocky Point aboard the Victory,  won the jackpot with a 20-pound white sea bass.  </P> <P> Garth Mildner of Long Beach, fishing at Rocky Point on the Matt Walsh, caught a  18-pound white sea bass.  </P> <P> Jay Drimer of Lomita, aboard the First String at Rocky Point, brought a  13-pound white sea bass out of the rocks.  </P> <P> Pat Shoales of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Top Gun, caught a 12 1/2-pound  white sea bass at Rocky Point.  </P> <P> Eric Fugimoto of San Pedro, on the Diawa at the oil rigs, caught a 12-pound  white sea bass.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] MIDH [Movement For the Establishment of Democracy in  Haiti] supports the legislators' plan. Marc Bazin's party  considers this document to be based on a sound analysis of the  crisis and thinks it offers a satisfying framework for a  negotiated and peaceful settlement. MIDH president Bazin asserts  that the legislators' approach meets his party's objectives:    [Begin Bazin recording] MIDH fully supports this plan  because  -- as has always been known -- MIDH considers that in the  current state of the country's sociopolitical conditions, the  transition toward democracy can succeed only if it rests on a  political compromise acceptable to all, based on reciprocal  guarantees, without radical breakups, and without motives of  revenge. It is the only formula that will bring all true  democrats -- realists from the Left, reformers from the Right --  to the common task of remodeling a state in which responsible  people would have no interest in seeing even more destruction.  [end recording]    MIDH, which has always favored a compromise, invites the key  sectors in the crisis to work toward the success of the  legislators' plan.    [Begin Bazin recording] That is the reason we are inviting  all sincere patriots, especially the two concerned parties, in  good faith and without any holdouts. To ask the Haitian people  today to accept additional sacrifices can no longer honestly be  justified. It is therefore urgent simultaneously to fill the  political vacuum and to satisfy the conditions for an immediate  suspension of the economic sanctions. Those are, in our opinion,  the first inevitable steps toward the normalization of public  life and the beginning of emerging from the tunnel. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Arts: Air of harmony masks a city out of tune - The battle for survival of Berlin's three opera houses Measuring his words carefully, the intendant of Berlin's Deutsche Oper, Gotz Friedrich, says he has always enjoyed good relations with Daniel Barenboim, who heads the city's other opera company, the Staatsoper unter den Linden. 'Each strives for his house as best he can.' Over in the eastern half of the city, Barenboim's lieutenants acknowledge conflicts of interest with the Deutsche Oper, 'but the goodwill exists to live with each other'. Behind the polite avowals of harmony, the Deutsche Oper and Staatsoper are locked in a bare-knuckled fight for prestige and subsidy. Along with the smaller Komische Oper, they swallow DM235m (Pounds 94m) of state subsidy a year. In a city still coming to terms with the cost of unification, many regard three opera companies as a luxury. Chilled by the axing of one of west Berlin's leading drama ensembles, each company has been forced on to the offensive to justify its existence. The immediate cause of friction is a DM9m deficit at the Staatsoper. While Friedrich kept within the Deutsche Oper's budget ceiling, Barenboim went on a spending spree, engaging star conductors and singers in a whirlwind attempt to re-establish the Staatsoper's international reputation, tarnished by years of communist under-investment. Trade union representatives at the Deutsche Oper say that by virtually writing off the deficit, the Berlin Senate has shown favouritism, and that Barenboim's 'arrogance' could provoke calls for more closures - and job losses. One union official said: 'The Staatsoper acted as if the recession never existed. Barenboim seems to think he can get away with it just because of who he is.' After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the only cultural institutions to escape rationalisation were the three opera houses. The Staatsoper was the most run-down, but it had a distinguished prewar history and the most traditional ambience. Barenboim was hailed as the ideal figure to transform the company, and his appointment in 1992 - with a 10-year contract worth DM10m - had the blessing of Richard von Weizsaecker, the president. But change has been slower than anticipated. Although Barenboim has inspired several artistic successes - notably Patrice Chereau's staging of Wozzeck and the improved sound-quality of the Staatskapelle - he is absent for seven months of the year, leaving less gifted deputies in charge of run-of-the-mill repertory inherited from the previous regime. Because of the delay in aligning wages between east and west, staff are paid 80 per cent of what colleagues at the Deutsche Oper receive. And whereas the latter operates within one modern building, the Staatsoper's rehearsal and storage facilities are spread over six ill-equipped sites, some of which it shares with other ensembles. At the Deutsche Oper, Friedrich has a different set of problems. Before unification, he was undisputed king of Berlin's opera life. Suddenly he found himself having to share his throne with two others - Barenboim and Harry Kupfer, who has built an unassailable position at the Komische Oper. Morale at the Deutsche Oper slumped, especially when Friedrich failed to attract a strong music director. But this season has seen a revival of company fortunes, thanks to Friedrich's fiscal rectitude and a programme balancing new or unfamiliar works with unconventional stagings of popular classics. With 1,900 seats to fill each night (500 more than the Staatsoper), Friedrich cannot afford many experiments. But he has shown that the Deutsche Oper has a useful role and will not cede first place without a battle. Most critics agree that each company could do more to stress its individual identity. Poor co-ordination means you can still see three different stagings of Die Zauberflote in one week, and there is too much recycling of fashionable names like Hans Schavernoch, who designed productions at all three houses this season. In a city where culture and politics are inseparable, however, coherent artistic programming alone cannot ensure survival. Berlin's operatic future also depends on the speed of economic recovery, on the whim of politicians like Ulrich Roloff-Momin, the culture senator, and on the fickle tide of public opinion. Hans-Dieter Roser, head of artistic planning at the Staatsoper, says no one seriously doubts the long-term viability of three opera houses, 'but people expect miracles, as if the traditions of the prewar era can be revived overnight'. Roser added: 'Theatre doesn't work like that. We inherited a divided city, in which each half went its separate way for 40 years. We have to build a new system and develop it organically. That takes years.'</p>

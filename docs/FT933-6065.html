			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Time for unity in Nigeria UNLESS NIGERIA'S civilian leaders settle their differences, the grip of the military will tighten and the country's crisis will deepen. The promise by Chief Moshood Abiola to return to Lagos this week and claim the presidency denied him is dangerous and impractical. The bellicose response from Chief Ernest Shonekan's new interim government, equating such an act with insurrection, smacks of a military diktat. Neither serves the interests of 80 million anxious Nigerians. United the two men are better placed to demand that the military fulfill its promise to hand-over to civilian rule; divided they may provide General Ibrahim Babangida with a pretext to return. The general, who ostensibly stepped down last Thursday as Nigeria's military leader, has left a dangerous legacy. The new interim civilian government has little popular support, and the military regime behind it is divided. Babangida loyalists wish to extend military rule, some officers are anxious to return to barracks, while others believe it is their turn to plunder state coffers. Meanwhile the economy continues its rapid deterioration. The country's structural adjustment programme has lapsed, and mounting arrears push external debt towards Dollars 34bn, well beyond the country's capacity to service. A general strike called in support of Chief Abiola paralyses Lagos and threatens to disrupt vital oil exports. Last week's announcement of a ten-fold increase in the price of a new premium grade of petrol coincided with a nation-wide shortage of the lower grade fuel, infuriating the public and risking massive protests when the holiday weekend finishes today Confronted by the country's worst crisis since the Biafran civil war in the 1960s, civilian politicians are split into two camps. Pragmatic argument One supports the interim government led by Chief Shonekan, albeit with generals in charge, but has promised fresh elections by March next year. The other insists that Chief Abiola's victory in the annulled June presidential poll be put into effect. Both have a case. The former is based on the pragmatic argument that civilians must make the best of the army's terms; the latter rests on the principle that the electorate's verdict should be respected, and maintains that the army's record of broken promises warrants confrontation. Ethnic rivalries But underlying a division over tactics are tense ethnic rivalries, with the Yoruba south lining up behind Mr Abiola, and the Hausa-Fulani north seeking a second chance to win the presidency. Before Mr Abiola risks a confrontation that could split the nation, Mr Shonekan should be given time to show that his alternative could work. Admittedly there is good reason to be sceptical. The previous interim government was also led by Mr Shonekan. Within weeks it became clear that the civilians were powerless. Nor does the new cabinet inspire confidence. It includes a minister of information who enthusiastically endorsed the recent banning of several newspapers. The proposed minister of planning is a vociferous critic of the economic reforms Mr Shonekan tried unsuccessfully to revive. If Nigerians are to be convinced that this time round things are different, he has to act swiftly. He has already taken some first steps, persuading the military to shorten the transition period from 12 to six months. Over the weekend he released jailed journalists and human rights campaigners. He should follow this by lifting the newspaper ban. But above all he should seek an accommodation with Chief Abiola, in which together they keep up pressure on the military. The chief should be guaranteed safe passage when he returns home, together with the right to contest the March election. In return Mr Abiola should suspend his threat to form a Lagos-based government. The generals may object: in which case the interim government is exposed as a sham, and Nigeria's prospects are bleak indeed. But in the meantime Mr Shonekan annd Mr Abiola owe it to their country to exchange olive branches, not epithets. The sooner the two men find common cause, the better the chance that democracy will finally come to Nigeria.</p>

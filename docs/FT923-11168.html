			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Smith unveils new-look team: Brown named shadow chancellor as Blair takes home affairs portfolio MR JOHN SMITH unveiled his new-look shadow cabinet yesterday, leaving only one member - Mr John Prescott - at his old post of transport at his own request. As expected, the younger generation has come to the fore with the 'modernisers' - the university-educated products of the post-war baby-boom - finally coming of age at the expense of old-fashioned, blue-collar Labourism. The leader's two youthful heirs apparent - Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair  -topped the list, winning the shadow chancellorship and the home affairs portfolio respectively. One of the few remaining veterans, Mr Jack Cunningham, replaces Mr Gerald Kaufman at foreign affairs. Mr Robin Cook, the leader's campaign manager, moves up from health to shadow Mr Michael Heseltine at trade and industry. Key jobs were also given to two of the five newcomers, with Ms Harriet Harman taking over from deputy leader Mrs Margaret Beckett as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury and Mr David Blunkett taking health. Mrs Beckett succeeds Mr Cunningham as leader of the House and campaigns co-ordinator. Other women have also gained important appointments. Ms Marjorie Mowlam joins the frontbench team with responsibility to track Mr William Waldegrave's Citizen's Charter activities as well as covering Labour's women's issues portfolio. Ms Ann Taylor takes education. Mr Smith's opponent in the leadership race, Mr Bryan Gould, was appointed as shadow to Mr David Mellor at the National Heritage department, the job he is said to have sought. Mr Frank Dobson, highly placed in the shadow cabinet poll, will attack the government on employment. In an unexpected move, the new leader has also split the functions of the environment department, giving Mr Jack Straw the top job covering such questions as local government and housing. Newcomer Mr Chris Smith takes on the green issues of environmental protection. Mr Tom Clarke, the last of the new faces, has surprised some by replacing Mr Donald Dewar, who moves after nine years from Scottish affairs to social security. Analysts believe the most disappointed of the 18 elected will be Ms Ann Clwyd and Mr Michael Meacher. Ms Clwyd, at Wales, was said to be hoping for a high-profile department. Mr Meacher, until now social security, is charged with overseas aid - covered by the government from the Lords by Baroness Chalker. Mr David Clark, until now agriculture, is to take on defence. Non-elected shadow cabinet appointments are Mr Ron Davies at food, agriculture and rural affairs, and Mr Kevin McNamara, who stays at Northern Ireland. Junior appointments will be made early next week with the full shadow cabinet due to meet for the first time on Wednesday. Conference resolutions, Page 4</p>

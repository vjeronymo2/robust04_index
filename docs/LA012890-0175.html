			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUNDAY SILENCE SELECTED 1989'S HORSE OF THE YEAR  </P> <P> Sunday Silence finally beat Easy Goer by a mile on Saturday when the 3-year-old  champion of 1989 overwhelmed his East Coast nemesis in balloting for horse of  the year.  </P> <P> The near black colt with the squiggle of white down his face received 223 of  242 votes, based on a season that included victories over Easy Goer in the  Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic.  </P> <P> Sunday Silence also won the Super Derby, Santa Anita Derby and the San Felipe  Handicap, losing only to Easy Goer in the Belmont Stakes and to Prized in the  Swaps Stakes.  </P> <P> Charlie Whittingham, who owns Sunday Silence in partnership with Arthur Hancock  and Dr. Ernest Gaillard, was also a lopsided winner of the Eclipse Award for  top trainer of 1989. The Eclipse for the best jockey went to the record-setting  Kent Desormeaux. JAY HOVDEY  </P></p>

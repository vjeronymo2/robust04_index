			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Armenia appeals for CIS aid: Ter-Petrosian claims republic penetrated by Azerbaijani forces ARMENIA was yesterday appealing to other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States to take economic, political and even military measures against the neighbouring republic of Azerbaijan, according to Armenian spokesmen and news agencies. Mr Levan Ter-Petrosian, the Armenian president, was reported to have appealed to the six members of the CIS collective security pact after Azerbaijan troops allegedly penetrated into the Armenian district of Krasnocelsk, to the north-east of Lake Levan. Both sides also reported the capture by Azerbaijan forces of the tiny Armenian enclave of Artsvashen within Azerbaijan - with a loss of life estimated at between 22 and over 300. The daily Izvestia reported from Yerevan, the Armenian capital, that aircraft from Azerbaijan had dropped bombs on the district centre of Goris. This is near the Armenian-Azeri border and the base from which the Armenians launched a successful attack earlier this year to secure a land corridor between Armenia and the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan yesterday dismissed the Armenian charges and said it had no fear that fellow CIS states would join the conflict on Armenia's side. However no confirmation was available yesterday of Mr Ter-Petrosian's call being received by other members of the security pact - who also include Russia with four central Asian states. In effect, the call is for Russian protection - as Russia retains an army in Armenia and none of the other members of the pact would have the independent armed force to intervene. However, even Russia, the traditional protector of Armenia in its feuds with neighbouring Moslem nations, would be highly unlikely to respond to the call with military sanctions. The six-nation pact was concluded in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, in May this year - committing each of the states to come to each other's aid if attacked. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's foreign minister arrived in Ankara yesterday for talks on his country's conflict with Armenia on the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh and on ways of boosting co-operation with Turkey, Reuter reports from Ankara.</p>

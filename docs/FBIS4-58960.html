			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, </F> in Aden, by MBC correspondent Ahmad Manjuna on 9 May -- recorded]    [Text] [Manjuna] Can Yemen endure the ongoing fighting  developing into a protracted war of attrition?    [Al-Bid] We want to implement the Pledge and Accord  Document.  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his forces reject this. Failing to  implement the document, they resorted to war to impose another  course on the Yemeni people. We will all abide by the document  around which the overwhelming majority of the Yemeni people  rally. Even those who have been forcibly sent to the war by  'Abdallah Salih are now fighting with low morale because they  are not convinced about what they are doing. They do not know  what they are doing. What are their objectives when they advance  toward particular areas in the southern provinces?    [Manjuna] Brother 'Ali: How can you describe the military  situation? And how can you hold out?    [Al-Bid] We will hold out. But we are convinced that whoever  triumphs in this war will still be a loser. But what can we do?  As long as this war is imposed on us we will defend ourselves  and we will adhere to the course we have chosen. We have chosen  the road of unity, democracy, civil rule, and equality. We also  chose the Pledge and Accord Document on the basis of national  unanimity. We will adhere to this document and we will fight to  ensure that it is implemented.    [Manjuna] Despite the signing of the Pledge and Accord  Document, the government in Sanaa accuses the southerners of  secession and mutiny. On what grounds does the government in  Sanaa base its accusations?    [Al-Bid] This is their understanding of issues and it shows  their miscalculations. We opted for unity. We dissolved our  regime here in the south and we took our units from here to  Sanaa. Regrettably, they were besieged and attacked in Sanaa.  We did not do all this. The Yemeni people know this. History  will be the judge.</p>

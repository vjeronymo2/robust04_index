			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Calm in Indonesia Indonesian soldiers were patrolling Medan in northern Sumatra on Sunday as some shops raised their shutters and life began to return to normal after three days of violent labour protests and looting. Banks, businesses and cars were attacked in some of Indonesia's worst rioting in years and one person was reported killed. Bands of protesters barricaded roads between the city and the industrial zone and port of Belawan, stoning cars, shops and passers-by.</p>

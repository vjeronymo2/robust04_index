The sources said Hosokawa will also express Japan's hope  that  China will institute a permanent moratorium on nuclear tests and  ensure the peaceful transition of Hong Kong from Britain to  China in 1997.    China resumed nuclear tests in October and the sources said  Hosokawa will explain that Japan harbors deep concern over the  tests as a country which has been on the receiving end of two  atomic bombs.    The same sources said Hosokawa will explain during his  meetings with Premier Li Peng and President Jiang Zemin that  China's neighbors are concerned about its defense buildup.    He will also explain that greater openness or "transparency"  in China's defense budget would help alleviate concerns.    They said Hosokawa will tell the Chinese that they need to  curb their defense expenditure if they are to ensure the  continuation of their most-favored-nation (MFN) status with the  United States and join the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT).    He will also tell the Chinese that Japan will only give aid  to a country if it can be sure the money will not be used for  military purposes and that Japan will also take the country's  arms exports into account when assessing the amount of aid, the  sources said.    Last week China announced an increase of some 22.4 percent  over 1993 in its defense budget to 52.04 billion yuan (about 653  billion yen), up from last year's 42.5 billion yuan (about 533  billion yen).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 15 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Fourth  Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and government, which  has been meeting in this Caribbean city since Tuesday, today  issued a final document in which it stresses its support for  integration processes.    The document supports the integration processes "in the  context of open regionalism" and rejects the restrictive free  trade practices implemented by several governments to the  detriment of the people. The summit conclusions are recorded in  a two-part document: a first section entitled "Commerce and  Integration as Elements in Ibero-American Development" and a  second part that includes evaluations and proposals.    The text mentions that the reactivation of international  commerce is basic to accessing equitable economic and social  development and, for this reason, it condemns all policies for  further protectionism or measures that limit freedom in  international commerce.    The "Recommendations" chapter calls for "the elimination of  restrictive commercial practices" as well as "the abusive and  distorted use of commercial protection measures and tariff  barriers" that limit free commerce. It is necessary to  eliminate "unilateral coercive commercial and economic measures  which hinder the possibility of freely developing international  commerce and which damage the living conditions of the  Ibero-American people," it adds.    This recommendation has been interpreted as a "clear censure  of the blockade the United States has imposed on Cuba for the  past 34 years" and which has been maintained after the end of  the Cold War, diplomatic sources have asserted.    The conclusions manifest the need to support "the gradual  convergence and complementariness of the different integration  projects" to overcome differences and to take advantage of the  potentials afforded by the economic opening.    The document also urges the defense of the environment "as  an  essential factor to the well-being of the population" and also  calls on avoiding the use of ecological measures to further  protectionism.    The fourth summit supports the "promotion of environmental  policies as factors that will further the development of  international commerce" as it will allow access to appropriate  technologies and the flow of fresh financial resources to  increase job opportunities.    The document proposes that the role of the state be  redefined  to enable governments to concentrate efforts on strategic areas  for the benefit of the population. The document considers that  the macroeconomic advances must be used to provide the resources  for health, justice, education, infrastructure, and to "program  an equitable social development."    It proposes the furtherance of actions that will strengthen  or foster ties between nations and integration processes with  the support of "citizen participation." "Europe has become  Latin America's second leading commercial partner and Latin  America is the first market for EU investments" and that is why  "we must strengthen relations between the two areas," it adds.    The Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and  government which ends this afternoon, sets new directions in  regards to relations between the participant countries and the  current objective is to increase commerce and consolidate the  integrationist processes, the document points out.</p>

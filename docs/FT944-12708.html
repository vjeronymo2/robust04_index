			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Hong Kong - Other markets The long-awaited Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong's new airport is expected to come through early this week, with potential to stir the market, writes Louise Lucas. Airport-related stocks ticked upwards at the end of last week but many analysts reckon the agreement has already been discounted in share prices, and that the actual signing will do little to overturn jaded sentiment. A sprinkling of corporate results, beginning with the half-year figures from Hongkong Telecom on Tuesday, could spark a wave of selective buying. The telecoms stock has seen its price surge already on the back of the HKDollars 2bn investment in China announced earlier this month. Fears of interest rate rises continue to spook the market and keep investors sidelined. While a 0.5 per cent rise in the US next month has largely been factored in, fears remain of a further increase before the year-end. Compiled by William Cochrane</p>

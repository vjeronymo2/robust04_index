			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> FIRM CANCELS SMALL GROUP PLAN POLICIES  </P> <P> Great Republic Insurance Co. announced that it is canceling health insurance  policies sold as small group plans that serve 10,000 of its 60,000 California  customers. Company Vice President James O'Hanlon said in Seattle that the  decision followed discussions with California insurance regulators who  indicated that the company had inadequate surplus reserves to support the  amount of premiums it was collecting from its policyholders. Those canceled can  either obtain insurance with another company or, under the law, buy a  conversion policy that offers fewer benefits at higher premiums.  </P></p>

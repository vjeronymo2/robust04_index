			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Observer: Fishy chips TJ Rodgers, chief executive of Cypress Semiconductor, a Silicon Valley chip-maker, was once a rather odd fish in the arcane world of the US semiconductor industry. While most US chip producers rush for the trough as soon as they sniff government money, Rodgers has often bitterly attacked such subsidies. He once laid into Sematech, a government-industry semiconductor research and development consortium formed in 1987. Sematech gets half its loot from the Defence Department, the rest from member companies. Rodgers saw Sematech as nothing more than a hand-out for those chip industry fat cats not up to fighting international competition. Times change. Now Cypress Semiconductor says it's taking a Dollars 500,000 grant from Minnesota's Department of Trade and Economic Development toward the cost of building what the company describes as 'one of the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the world'. Then again, perhaps it's a virtual reality plant that doesn't actually exist.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Frane Plancic: "The Door Is Ajar"] </F>   [Text] Last Friday [4 February], Croatia again declared  that it was prepared to join the "Partnership for Peace [PFP],"  a NATO program for military and political cooperation.    The first unofficial declaration was presented in Vienna by  Bekic, our ambassador to the CSCE, and it consisted of one  sentence. The second declaration was made by Foreign Minister  Granic, and it was a little more elaborate, but was again just a  signal.    The third declaration, this time official and unambiguous,  was sent from the session of the Presidential Council for  Defense and National Security. It is worth quoting again  because of that, but also because it is a complex task for the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    "The Council has adopted the proposal to join the NATO  program `PFP' and supports the intention of the Republic of  Croatia to take part in the process. With regard to that, the  Ministry has been entrusted with preparing the final proposal  and taking steps to that effect."    The final proposal, therefore, is to be drafted by the  Foreign Ministry and presented to the appropriate state bodies  and other political factors to be finally reshaped.  <H5>  Coordinated Admission Form </H5>   The report makes it clear that the basic views of the  president of the republic, key state bodies (whose leaders sit  on the council), and of the leadership of the Croatian  Democratic Community have been coordinated. Thus coordinated  admission to the PFP process does not need to go through  parliament, for example, or be reviewed and discussed with other  parliamentary parties. Only the agreement between Croatia and  NATO worequire this, and even then it would probably boil down  to mere formal acceptance. As yet, no one has declared himself  against NATO or for nonpartnership with NATO.    However, if drafting the final proposal is a routine part of  the job given to the Foreign Ministry, preparing "concrete steps  for it" is an incredibly complex part of the job. Moreover, it  cannot be implemented without the participation of the Ministry  of Defense, the main repository of all future implementation  plans, then also of expert groups from other departments, as  well as strong public support.    It is definitely not easy to predict what lies ahead for the  Croatian delegation on the way to being registered on the list  of candidates for membership of the PFP. Croatia is not in the  position to have all the doors automatically open for it, but it  will not have any doors slammed in its face either, although it  does fall into the "high-risk group." The doors are closed to  Serbia, for example, as it is involved in a three-year war  against everything and everybody, but also because, from the  standpoint of international law, it is a nonexistent country.  The doors are wide open for Poland, for example, among other  things, because it is doing a good job of meeting the political  requirements, but also because its territory is strategically  extremely important.  <H5>  First the Center and Then South </H5>   If Croatia manages to refute accusations of intervention in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, only the fact that it is still in a state of  war will stand in the way of becoming a member of the PFP. But  that can be "patched up" with a promise to integrate the  occupied territory into the state system in a peaceful manner,  provided that the obligation is accepted and guaranteed by both  sides.    Until Croatia meets that condition, it could get into  trouble  walking both ways toward the PFP. On one hand, it would be met  by those NATO members which think that a country in a state of  war expects something that the PFP does not offer, and on the  other, by those who accept Croatia but -- because of the  principle of unanimous decisionmaking -- would hold back until  Croatia's domestic problems were solved.    All this has resulted in Croatia officially committing  itself  to the PFP so late and has made it decide to leave some time for  the Foreign Ministry to prepare the proposal and decide on  concrete steps.    In the meantime, more and more East European and European  nonaligned countries are being admitted to the PFP. Perhaps NATO  headquarters is waiting to fill the quota for those countries  first and then they will start seriously considering the  admission of countries from the territory of former Yugoslavia.  In other words, only when the problem of strategically the most  important part of Europe -- its central plain -- is solved, will  they deal with the south of Europe and with the European  Mediterranean front.  <H5>  Security Problems </H5>   The assumption is that there will be no serious problems  with  Slovenia at that point, but that it will also start demanding  safety guarantees in case the Balkan powder keg explodes. There  could be some problems with Croatia's admission and a loud  demand for mutual guarantees for a peaceful solution to the  problem of occupied territory. But this would only be for those  countries that already have such security problems or could be  predicted as having some in the future, and thus would want to  delay giving such guarantees to another country.    This variant (and there are other, easier ones) of political  problems which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is facing and the  fact that it is walking in both directions is an organizational  and working "piece of cake" compared with problems that the  ministry will have to deal with once it chooses how to get into  the PFP.    The expert group for admission to the PFP, which will mostly  consist of members of the upper echelons of the Defense  Ministry, will have to have many members, and to be very mobile,  diverse in specialities, abundantly financed, and authorized to  participate in implementing foreign policy and defense strategy.  If the group does not have the above characteristics, it will  not be able to represent Croatia as a member of the PFP, whose  demands reach far into Croatian state policy. That is also  evident from the concept of the PFP and its inner mechanism of  operation, which has only recently been publicly represented in  some detail.  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  To Mons -- Brigadier </H5>   Since the idea of the PFP being the best way to move  eastward  as evolved last summer in Washington, after the NATO summit in  January organization preparations for functioning of PFP  institutions and procedures were expedited.    The recently established Board of Directors of the PFP,  directly supervised by the NATO Council, will be in charge of  accepting signed admissions, members, and coordinating  activities.    According to Undersecretary Wisner, one of the first and  most  important tasks of PFP candidates is to draw up a "Presentation  Document." Croatia will use such a document to present to the  Board of Directors those activities that it wants to engage in  within this cooperation, and the forces and means it will place  at the disposal of the PFP; Croatia will present the main goals  of defense planning and plans for reaching common goals. In  those activities, the Croatian Army can expect to be assisted by  NATO experts, for that is the key document in which they will  together determine the goals, the momentum, and the extent of  the Republic of Croatia's participation in NATO activities.    The Board of Directors coordinates the work on a series of  such "Presentation Documents," plans common activities of all  PFP members, and assesses the progress of the PFP program  according to political and military integration.    Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), whose  seat  is in Mons (Belgium), is entrusted with drawing up military  plans. It is already planning the joint exercise, and the  command and staff exercise is to come first toward the end of  spring, while units would practise various common procedures in  autumn. It was required that small-scale exercises be held in  some East European countries.    Some rules have been established regarding planning common  activities. It is expected that high-level political  representatives will be accredited to NATO at its seat in  Brussels, while military representatives holding the rank of  brigadier will be accredited to SHAPE in Mons. With regard to  that, an additional administrative network is being formed that  will comprise a number of functions, from diplomatic to legal.   <H5>    [Box, p 3] </H5> <H5>  Three Main Goals </H5>   Regarding the concept of the PFP, it is emphasized that the  PFP has three main goals. The first is described as another  step toward a safer Europe, as it spreads democracy to new areas  and transfers strategic stability to the east of Europe. The  second goal is developing NATO's capacity to respond to  challenges that were hitherto outside the domain of the  collective defense of NATO members. The third goal is to open  the doors for new members.    Realizing that the first goal is politically extremely  important and will bring extremely difficult problems.  Primarily because the cooperation with the Russian Federation,  according to Clinton, is first on the list of priority matters  of national security. Fortunately, European strategists and  realistic politicians are placing more and more confidence in  "the artfulness of history," that is in the belief that  overcoming the Russian obstacle (complicated by the Zhirinovskiy  factor) can easily be compensated. In this way, other items from  the priority list are to be realized more quickly and  completely, and the first item is to be left for later.    Realizing the second goal would be done by means of a very  tangible method. It concerns adapting to ways of cooperation  among NATO members on the military level and beginning such  cooperation this year on operations that are being opened up in  the post-Cold-War period.    For the Croatian Army, for instance, this would mean that it  will have to get standard NATO weapons and equipment, or at  least compatible ones, and that it will develop systems of  education, training, exercises, communications, etc. totally  compatible with NATO systems. Apart from that "hardware," the  Croatian Army will have to single out units, make plans and  define joint missions together with members of NATO and the PFP.  It is planned that those will originally only be search and  rescue missions, help in areas devastated by natural  catastrophes, ecological treatment of areas contaminated by war,  or basing military forces, and, on a higher level of  cooperation, peacekeeping missions in crisis areas in Europe and  elsewhere.    The gradual implementation of the third goal, according to  F.  Wisner, political under secretary of the U.S. secretary of state  for defense, has been globally determined for the next five  years. During that period, some countries will gradually be  admitted and guarantees will be given that there will be no new  borders dividing Europe's east and west, but this will also be a  period for the United States to assess the stability or  irretrievablity of the democratization process in Russia.    During that period, very few members of the PFP can count on  being admitted to NATO as full members. Paragraph 5 of the  North Atlantic Treaty, which guarantees the total security of  NATO members, will extend to those countries and their security  problems only formally.    In spite of formal refusals to comment on what would happen  with urgent admissions to NATO if "the Zhirinovskiy factor" or  some other factor goes mad in Russia, it is predicted that  countries thus imperiled will have to be admitted rapidly and  almost indiscriminately.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Alliance Was Formed in </F> High-Handed Manner; Ozawa Moves the Stage; Political World  Reorganization Speeding Up"]    [Text] The leading actor is Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the  Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]; the supporting actor is former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa; and the scenario writer cum  director is Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party]. This is the picture one can draw from the drama  being played in the sudden formation of the parliamentary group  "Kaishin" in the House of Representatives on 25 April on the  heels of the appointment of Tsutomu Hata as prime minister.    A top leader of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ],  which was left out of the alliance within the ruling camp, could  not hide his displeasure, saying: "I could not have anticipated  something like this happening at this time." The formation of  the parliamentary group that proceeded while the cabinet was  being formed is likely not only to have a major impact on Prime  Minister Hata's power base, but will also speed up the overall  reorganization of the political world. For Hata, who had to  watch the developments alone in the prime minister's residence,  this is literally the embarkation of his cabinet on rough seas.    The man who began the work of forming the alliance this time  was Ouchi, who until very recently had sided with Tomiichi  Murayama, chairman of the SDPJ, and Masayoshi Takemura,  representative of Sakigake [Harbinger], in opposing the  Shinseito and Komeito-led concept of forming a new-new party or  a large alliance of parties. Ouchi met with Takemura and  Murayama separately on 25 April, and sought their understanding  on forming the "Kaishin" alliance. But Sakigake responded  negatively, and Murayama remained cold, stating: "All I heard  was the DSP explaining intraparty problems." A concerned  official insisted: "Ouchi pleaded with Murayama, saying, `There  is no other choice but for the DSP to go along. Please accept  it.'" There was no question that in the series of developments  over the formation of "Kaishin," Ouchi's actions were  conspicuous.    According to DSP officials, Ouchi met with Shinseito's  Ichiro  Ozawa about 23 April at the request of the latter. Takashi  Yonezawa, secretary general of the DSP and a close friend of  Ozawa, was said to have acted as an intermediary between the  two. In this meeting, Ouchi is supposed to have proposed  forming an alliance among the DSP, Shinseito, Japan New Party,  and Sakigake. Ozawa concurred, saying: "That is fine." In a  news conference following the party leaders' meeting on 22  April, which decided to appoint Hata as the ruling coalition's  candidate for prime minister, Ouchi appeared to be thinking and  still undecided about the idea of forming the grand alliance  because he said: "I want to specifically think about it." Few  people within the DSP had been consulted on the matter in  advance.    It was at the meeting of party Diet members of the two  houses on the afternoon of 25 April, following his meetings with  Takemura and Murayama, that Ouchi formally brought up the  matter. Even though the party entrusted Ouchi and Yonezawa with  decisionmaking on the matter, one who attended the meeting said:  "Most Diet members were dumbfounded."    The situation was similar in the Japan New Party. After  Ouchi and former Prime Minister Hosokawa met on the afternoon of  25 April, there was a report to an informal meeting of party  Diet members shortly past 1700 on forming the alliance with the  DSP. A party staff official admitted it came as a surprise,  saying: "No one but Hosokawa had known about it. It was an  action that came as fast as a lightening."    Now that the parliamentary group has been formed, in  assigning posts in the new cabinet their allocation will be made  on the basis of the group. This means that the "Liberal Party,"  which was recently formed by defectors from the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP], may be able to win a post in the  cabinet, and the DSP will be able to increase its posts from one  to two. Consequently, within the SDPJ there is criticism that  "Ouchi ran to Shinseito, baited by increased posts in the  cabinet." Anyway, in creating the ruling parties' largest  parliamentary group in the House of Representatives, there is  the additional aim of bringing the SDPJ under control. A staff  official from the Japan New Party noted: "The Hata government  is supposed to have done soul-searching on problems that existed  with the Hosokawa government. This may not please the SDPJ, but  there is no other choice when we think about the need for  taxation reform and about how we have to run the Diet."    The SDPJ, which met the surprise attack no sooner than an  agreement was made regarding the prime ministership, is reacting  fiercely. On the evening of that same day, a top party leader  spat out in disgust: "That is unrelated to the SDPJ. Shinseito  is probably behind all this." Following the meeting with Ouchi,  Murayama phoned Ouchi and protested emphatically: "I am  surprised this came about today. There is no way the SDPJ can  accept it."    Things are proceeding at a speed much faster than the SDPJ  expected. Even though Komeito is not participating in it,  "Kaishin" is an exact duplicate of "Kaikaku" which Ozawa and  Hosokawa sought to establish some time ago. There is no doubt  this group will become the parent body for a new-new party. The  three top SDPJ executives hastily met several times in the  evening to discuss countermeasures. Meanwhile, former SDPJ  cabinet members who assembled at party headquarters vented their  anger.    Ozawa was triumphant following a ceremony marking the  launching of the new alliance. He said: "This cannot be done  unless we make the most of such an opportunity." The curtains  for the Hata government appear to have been opened at the  "Ozawa's pace"--once again.</p>

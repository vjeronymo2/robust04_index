			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Structure" rubric: </F> "Russia's Ethnic Communities Now Have Congress. President and  Government Send Greetings"]    [Text] The founding convention of the Congress of Ethnic  Communities of Russia opened in Moscow on 29 April. Taking part  in its work are delegates from 19 ethnic-cultural societies  bringing together citizens of Russia who happen to live outside  the areas with dense populations of people of the same ethnic  origin, or those who have no such areas (dispersed ethnic  groups). Also present were representatives of several more  ethnic associations who preferred the role of observers, and  representatives of the Repressed Peoples Confederation.    The idea for holding the congress met with warm support from  the powers that be -- at least Boris Yeltsin, and Vice Premiers  Sergey Shakhray and Yuriy Yarov thought it appropriate to send  their representatives to read out greetings. In particular, the  president's message to the congress participants notes the  beneficial nature of such an action for improving interethnic  relations in Moscow and Russia. For his part Mr. Yarov's  representative, who also wished successful work to the congress,  invited them to interact with the government apparatus. Also,  messages of greetings from the National-Cultural Society to the  congress have come from the other countries of the "near and far  abroad."    In their addresses the congress delegates complained about  the disastrous state of their ethnic cultures and lack of  appropriate material conditions to revive and develop them; they  blamed both the local and central authorities for inattention to  the problems of dispersed ethnic groups which, they thought,  results from lack of understanding rather than from ill-will.  Addressing his fellow members, Mikhail Chlenov, member of the  new organization's organizing committee, called on them not to  limit their activities to culture and education but also to  ponder on how to lend the Congress the functions of a  public-political organization.</p>

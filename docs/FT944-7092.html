			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Financial teams set out to win converts South African officials set out for the world's financial centres today to prepare for a return to foreign capital markets after a two-year absence, finance minister Chris Liebenberg said yesterday, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. He emphasised the mission was not designed to raise funds yet, but to pave the way for future funding when appropriate. He said the high-powered roadshow was the first opportunity the government, which took power after the country's first all-race elections in April, had had to go abroad to market the country's policies and philosophy. The officials would use the credit ratings assigned to South Africa in October by American and Japanese risk assessment agencies 'to establish ourselves in the minds of potential investors'. Moody's Investors Service and Nippon Investors Service gave the country investment grade ratings, while Standard &amp; Poor's gave it its top speculative ranking, with a 'positive' outlook. The ratings will enable South Africa to tap a wider range of markets and investors than would otherwise be possible. Mr Liebenberg said three teams of officials would travel to Europe, east Asia and the US. Apart from Mr Liebenberg, they would include Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals, deputy finance minister Alec Erwin, and labour minister Tito Mboweni. The officials would be accompanied by represen- tatives of Goldman, Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, which have been named lead managers for the country's first global offering. The national budget for the 1994/5 fiscal year ending in March provided for R1.8bn (Pounds 327m) in possible foreign loans, but Mr Liebenberg said South Africa did not need to borrow abroad to meet the budget.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / EU court ruling upsets Cyprus peace hopes A European Court of Justice ruling which in effect bans imports from Turkish-controlled Cyprus has increased the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and injected a new, unpredictable element into UN-backed peace efforts on the divided island. The court order - that local export licences issued by the Turkish Cypriot authorities were not valid on the grounds that the EU recognised only the Greek Cypriot government - was condemned yesterday by Mr Rauf Denktash, Turkish Cypriot leader, 'This kind of decision obtained by the Greek Cypriots from international forums will only push the two communities to absolute and permanent separation,' said Mr Denktash. But a senior Greek Cypriot official in Brussels described last Tuesday's ruling as far-reaching since it weakened the Turkish Cypriot community's claim to be treated as a separate legal entity. 'It is the most important development on the Cyprus issue in the past 20 years.' The ban on potatoes and citrus products is a blow for the 160,000 Turkish Cypriots who formed a breakaway state after Turkish forces invaded the island in 1974. Growers depend heavily on the export market, though in practice they may simply reroute their products through Turkey. Diplomats were trying to assess the impact of the ruling on UN efforts to broker an agreement on confidence-building measures between the Greek and Turkish communities, including the re-opening of the Turkish-held resort of Verosha and Nicosia international airport under UN control. According to Greek Cypriot officials, Mr Denktash was told last month that re-opening Nicosia airport would have allowed Turkish Cypriot exporters to obtain licences from the Greek authorities. 'But Denktash was too greedy, he turned the offer down,' said one official. In the short term, the ban could lead Mr Denktash to stiffen resistance to a settlement, or to ask Turkey for more economic and political support, EU diplomats said. But Greek Cypriots said the rejection of the Turkish Cypriot community's legal status could increase pressure on Mr Denktash to reach a compromise. They pointed to the European Commission's recent move to review Cyprus's application for EU membership in early 1995 in the context of progress in resolving the dispute between the Greek and Turkish communities. This formulation was widely seen as a pressure tactic against the Turkish Cypriots.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Marcel Dinu, secretary of the Romanian Foreign  Affairs Ministry, returned to Bucharest today together with the  four Romanian citizens who had been pardoned and freed from  prison in Iraq following a request by Romanian President Ion  Iliescu.    Talking to our correspondent at Otopeni International  Airport, Dinu said that on that occasion he also held talks with  Iraqi authorities regarding the payment of the debts owed by  Iraq to Romania, which amount to $1.8 to 1.9 billion. The Iraqi  party asserted that after the lifting of the [UN] embargo it  will look for possible ways to pay its debts.    Talks were also held to establish contacts between Romanian  and Iraqi economic companies, while observing the UN Security  Council resolutions.    Dinu mentioned to our reporter that there are three other  Romanian citizens held in Iraqi prisons, who were arrested for  stealing. Diplomatic steps are being made to obtain the  reduction of their prison terms, Dinu said, as Iraqi laws do not  allow for the annulling of their punishment.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the permittee's development of the long-term CSO control plan, the permit writer should promote coordination between the permittee and State WQS authority in connection with possible WQS revisions. Once the permittee has completed development of the long-term CSO control plan and has coordinated with the permitting authority the selection of the controls necessary to meet the requirements of the CWA, the permitting authority should include in an appropriate enforceable mechanism, requirements for implementation of the long-term CSO control plan, including conditions for water quality monitoring and operation and maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B.

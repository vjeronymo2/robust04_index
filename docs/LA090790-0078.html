			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> RISING OIL PRICES CAUSE 31.93 DROP IN THE DOW  </P> <P> Stocks fell broadly Thursday as renewed concern over the Persian Gulf crisis  sent crude oil prices surging back above the $30-a-barrel mark.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial index fell 31.93 points, or 1.2%, to 2,596.29. New  York Stock Exchange volume remained light at 125.6 million shares, compared to  120.6 million Wednesday.  </P> <P> In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 9 to  5 in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 511 up, 960 down and 490  unchanged.  </P> <P> Worry over the Mideast was rekindled by word that an Iraqi soldier shot and  wounded an American in Kuwait. The news sent crude oil for October delivery up  $1.66, or 5.6%, to $31.43 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was  the highest close since Aug. 23 -- the same day the Dow reached its August low  of 2,483.  </P> <P> An ebb in the oil price rally last week helped stocks recoup some ground. But  crude oil has made a strong turn upward this week.  </P> <P> At the same time, fresh signs of economic weakness have begun to overshadow  hopes for a Federal Reserve move to lower interest rates. Major retailers  Thursday reported that sales were sluggish last month, adding to worries about  a potential recession.  </P> <P> "Retailers are coming into the most important part of the year -- Christmas --  and with consumer confidence at a low point and the possibility of recession  lingering, consumers may be very tight with their pocketbooks," said Jack  Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management.  </P> <P> In addition, investors are nervous ahead of today's report on employment, which  could show enough weakness in the economy to spur the Fed to act.  </P> <P> Even if interest rates fall, the prospect of deteriorating corporate profits is  proving worrisome for the market.  </P> <P> Among market highlights:  </P> <P> * Motorola plunged 7 7/8 to 61 1/2, as analysts lowered earnings estimates.  Other tech stocks also fell, including Texas Instruments, off 1 1/8 to 26 1/4,  Honeywell, off 3 1/2 to 94 3/8, and Intel, off 1 1/4 to 31 1/4. The group has  been hit hard of late on economic worries.  </P> <P> * The over-the-counter market suffered less than the Dow. The NASDAQ OTC  composite index fell 3.66 to 378.78, a 1% drop, compared to the Dow's 1.2%.  </P> <P> * Industrial stocks were big losers on renewed recession fears. GM dropped 7/8  to 37 3/8, Du Pont fell 1 to 35 1/2, Deere lost 1 3/4 to 56 and Ingersoll Rand  dipped 1 1/8 to 43 1/8. Prudential-Bache cut auto-maker earnings estimates,  citing the Mideast crisis.  </P> <P> * Worries about retail sales in light of a weak August performance hurt many  retailers. Limited lost 1 1/8 to 15 5/8, Wal-Mart fell 1 to 27 3/8, Toys R Us  slipped 3/4 to 23 3/4 and May Department Stores lost 1/2 to 45 1/4.  </P> <P> * Oil stocks rallied early, then faded. Mobil added 1/2 to 66 1/4, and Oryx  gained 1 1/4 to 53 1/2, but Arco closed flat at 138 3/4 after trading as high  as 141 1/4, and Unocal slipped 1/4 to 33 1/4.  </P> <P> Shares on the London Stock Exchange finished sharply lower amid Mideast  concerns and Wall Street weakness, dealers said. The Financial Times 100-share  index closed off 31.3 at 2,120.9, the day's low.  </P> <P> Share prices closed mixed in Frankfurt, West Germany, in thin trading. The DAX  index of 30 leading blue chips ended 7.15 points lower at 1,557.12.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Bonds End Mixed on Jobs Optimism  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/32 point, or about $1.56 per  $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which declines as the bond's price rises, edged  down to 8.95% from late Wednesday's 8.96%.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was 8.125%, down from 10% late Wednesday, when the rate surged on  technical factors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Off as Fed's Intentions Debated  </P> <P> The dollar finished mostly lower in thin trading on the world's currency  markets as speculation mounted over whether the Federal Reserve is poised to  nudge interest rates lower.  </P> <P> It took its biggest hit against the Japanese yen, falling to an 11-month low,  and gave up significant ground against the British pound.  </P> <P> The dollar bought 1.554 German marks late Thursday in New York, down from 1.558  late Wednesday. It fell to 140.70 yen from 141.85.  </P> <P> The pound, meanwhile, was bolstered by anticipation that Britain will join the  European exchange rate mechanism during a meeting of European finance ministers  in Rome this weekend. The mechanism establishes currency rates for a basket of  European Community countries.  </P> <P> In London, the British pound rose to $1.9075 from $1.8990 late Wednesday. In  New York, it cost $1.9125 to buy 1 pound, more expensive than Wednesday's  $1.9055.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Gold Up on Anxiety About the Economy  </P> <P> Gold neared $390 an ounce, the third straight day of rising prices, as the  market continued its recovery from last week's collapse.  </P> <P> But unlike last month's explosive rally, analysts said, gold's strength  appeared to reflect investor concerns about the economy rather than knee-jerk  reactions to Persian Gulf developments.  </P> <P> Gold futures settled $3.20 to $3.60 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange,  with the contract for spot delivery up $3.60 at $389.70 an ounce. The heavily  traded December contract settled at $396.20.  </P> <P> Silver for September reached $4.77 an ounce, up 4 cents.  </P> <P> Spot gold has climbed $7.40 an ounce this week after plunging $32.70 last week  amid perceptions that the U.S.-Iraq confrontation was cooling down.  </P> <P> Market Roundup, D6  </P></p>

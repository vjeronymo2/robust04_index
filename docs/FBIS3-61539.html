			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Morgenshtern: ``All This Brain Drain. </F> The West Can Find Jobs for 200,000 Russian Scientists. If Russia  Cannot Do It'']    [Text] The general mood in many Russian research institutes  can probably be characterized as a state of quiet panic.  Salaries are held back for months, and the rate is close to the  ``zero variant''; the arrival of scientific literature has  virtually stopped, there may also be no light or telephone.  Every time there is news about the departure of a colleague to  work abroad on ``outrageous'' terms, according to our and the  Brazilian concept, those left behind fall into even deeper  despondency.    What is really happening? A recently published study,  "Emigration of Scientists From Russia: Today and Tomorrow," by  O. A. Ikonnikov (Moscow, 1993, 123 pages, illustrated) strives  to answer this question. The study was carried out by order of  the Russian Federation Ministry of Science and contains abundant  analytical and statistical data on the brain drain problem, and  its impact on the Russian scientific potential.    We learn that the level of emigration from Russia is not  high  as yet, even by West European standards. The main form of brain  drain is religious-ethnic migration (Germans to Germany, Jews to  Israel); nor have so many left for contractual work or to study,  according to the fragmentary official data. Thus far, 8.1  percent of all individuals who go to Israel (6.0 percent to the  United States, 8.3 to Germany) are scientists and public  educators.    Perhaps there is nothing to worry about? Nevertheless, there  are obvious grounds to take emergency steps on the highest  level. What is frightening in today's brain drain from Russia is  that it is occurring against a background of mass change from  research activities to entrepreneurial, managerial, political  activities, loss of job or qualifications. The process will  inevitably progress with reduction of State funding of science  and obvious difficulties in balancing goals and funds in  scientific policy, from the standpoint of priorities. Thus, in  1991, 522,000 people left the field of science and scientific  services. But departure abroad of citizens working in this field  did not exceed 5,300 people.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

A. Ikonnikov, ``Hypermobility of Scientific Personnel:  Problems of Forecasting,'' 1993, No 3, pp 96-107), i.e.,  excessive movement of scientific personnel when the  scientific-technical potential is devastated, confirms the alarm  of our scientists and engineers. Is there a chance that  decisions adequate to the acuteness of the situation will be  made? Alas, only time will tell.</p>

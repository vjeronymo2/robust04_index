			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "SLC Tightened Up Its EU Line"] </F>   [Text] The congress of the Central Association of Swedish  Agricultural Producers (SLC) yesterday adopted a negative stance  on European Union [EU] membership, as did its congress in Turku  two years ago. A statement points out that because of the  northern location, long distances, and structure of Finland and  the unsatisfactory package that resulted from the negotiations,  agriculture and market gardening are not ready to meet the  competition in the EU.    The congress, which was unanimous in its statement, had  reformulated the executive's proposed statement. This was  thought to be "toothless." The executive's resolution did not  contain any clear stance.    The resolution stresses that if, despite everything, the  referendum leads to membership, the SLC expects there to be  national consensus on domestic food production and on rural  policy.    The SLC is also demanding that the scale of the proposed  national support measures for agriculture be approved by the  Eduskunta and also by the EU Commission before they form the  basis for the referendum.    Ola Rosendahl, who was reelected SLC chairman yesterday,  said  in general terms in a review of the situation that despite all  the shortcomings of the government's decision in principle it  has to be admitted that this government could hardly have  produced a better support package and that the next government  will not even come anywhere near.    He said that it remains for agriculture to consider what  possibility there is of living with the support package, and  what possibility there is of achieving a no to membership in the  referendum and how in such a situation what shape agriculture  policy can take.</p>

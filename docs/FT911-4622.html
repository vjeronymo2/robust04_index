			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Business cool to plea for economic co-operation JAPANESE business leaders yesterday reacted coolly to a plea for economic co-operation from Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. Mr Gorbachev, who is visiting Japan for the first time, made an impassioned appeal for help in a speech to an audience of 550 Japanese businessmen. He listed oil and gas, forestry, fishing, tourism and other fields where he wanted Japanese collaboration. 'Let's not lose time,' he said. 'Don't hold back from taking part in these great projects.' But his audience showed little enthusiasm, reflecting the Japanese view that the long-running territorial dispute between the two countries must be resolved before economic co-operation can begin and that the Soviet economy is in any case too chaotic to absorb much investment. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the chairman of Keidanren, the main Japanese employers' federation and host for yesterday's meeting, gave his guest a blunt message. Japanese business would co-operate with the Soviet Union but only on two conditions. 'Our two countries must solve their political problems. And since the economic conditions and infrastructure in your country are inadequate, there must be movement towards developing the foundations for an orderly market economy.' Earlier Mr Gorbachev got a similarly cool, though less blunt, response from Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese prime minister, who also said that Japan would not develop economic relations unless there was progress on dispute over Japan's claim to four islands seized by the Soviet Union in 1945. Mr Gorbachev told his business audience that Mr Kaifu had told him Japan would look at projects on a case-by-case basis.</p>

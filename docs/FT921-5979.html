			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: How Britain wrestled with the sumo factor - A look back at the success of the Japanese Festival 'OUT OF the gourd comes a pony' is a Japanese proverb for something pleasant but extremely unlikely. The Japan Festival, which finally ended this month, was the most ambitious attempt ever to introduce one country to the culture of another. So much was often stated during the Festival's duration, eight remarkably successful months. Less clear was the resemblance between it and the proverbial pony: the Festival was a rabbit which nearly did not make it out of the hat. The Festival was not an exercise in Japanese cultural diplomacy. It was a British initiative, growing from an idea mooted in 1986 by Martin Campbell-White, chief executive of Harold Holt Ltd, a firm of international concert promoters. Initial plans were for ten or so events in London. Sir Peter Parker became Chairman, and it was decided to link the Festival to the centenary of the Japan Society in 1990. More significantly, the Festival was then planned as a nationwide event. Management costs were initially estimated at about Pounds 900,000, with Midland Bank as the founding sponsor. 'The Topsy effect set in', recalls Graham McCallum, chairman of the steering committee. The Festival grew as more and more venues and events were suggested. In December 1989, the Festival's fate hung in the balance. Projects were already beginning to roll. Plans to bring events such as sumo wrestling to Britain were obviously going to be inordinately costly. But there was still no secure sponsorship. The atmosphere was tense. 'Recent disasters like the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh were always in the back of one's mind', says McCallum. Many companies turned the committee down, asking why the Festival was not sponsored from Japan. The Japanese, however, at that stage did not want a big festival. 'They could not see why they should concentrate so much effort on the UK.' says McCallum. The saviour of the Festival was Sir Ian Hunter, doyen of festivals. He suggested the committee should go for core funding, boldly asking UK companies with Japanese interests to pay Pounds 20,000 into the Festival - a figure upped to Pounds 50,000. The 25 'Festival Benefactors' would get nothing obvious in return for their largesse beyond their names on a list. But in Japan, they would be seen to have made a commitment to taking Japanese culture seriously, rather than just seeking commercial advantages. Would they bite? Inchcape plc and SG Warburg plc were approached first, and agreed. The ball had started to roll. The fundraisers' luck was extraordinary and may well prove unrepeatable, at least for the foreseeable future. According to David Barrie, a Festival director, 'If the search had started even two months later, we wouldn't have made it.' If the Gulf war had lasted a month or so longer, the Festival could have been scuppered by Japanese companies pulling out. Press coverage more favourable than the organisers had dared hope also proved to be crucial. Simultaneous fundraising in Japan was much slower to take effect. 'Three-quarters of the way through the Festival, the Japanese suddenly realised how much impact it had', recalls McCallum. In the event, hundreds of Japanese companies contributed, rewarding the efforts of a committee chaired by the formidable Shoichi Saba, former head of Toshiba. Saba had his initial doubts. 'Some Japanese companies were afraid that contributing to the event would reinforce the image of Japan being an economic animal. A fear of the festival being dubbed as a 'cultural invasion' and linked to the increase in financial and economic activities of Japanese companies in the UK did exist among some companies.' A number of Japanese sponsors doubted the Festival would work, but gave all the same. How would the British public respond to kabuki or bunraku? Or sumo wrestling? Many Japanese believed it impossible to transplant such uniquely Japanese phenomena. Toyota commented: 'We were not really expecting any direct results from sponsoring the festival'. At Hitachi, scepticism was based on the Japanese public's lack of interest in the 1990 British festival in Tokyo. Nonetheless, Hitachi went ahead with sponsorship of the sumo tournament at the Albert Hall and was comfortably surprised by by the response. 'The 'Sumo fever' was amazing, and we feel we contributed to cultural understanding between Japan and the UK.' Shoichi Saba, too, did not reckon with the sumo factor. 'I was surprised by the enormous popularity of sumo. I did not expect such an interest in it in the UK.' A final verdict on the Festival makes little sense. It was, quite simply, too vast. Two opinion surveys conducted in the course of the Festival, one by the Anglo-Japanese Economic Institute, indicated a favourable response and a good level of public awareness. In the end, however, it was not the robots, the lady lute-player in the Orkneys, nor even those glassy-eyed medieval abbots in the British Museum, who proved the most eloquent ambassadors for Japanese culture. It was the giants in pinnies, parading around the Albert Hall. The visit of the 68 wrestlers - plus an entourage of another 60 people, hairdressers, judges, and the like - cost well in excess of Pounds 2 million. But Campbell-White has three sponsors anxious to back a second visit. The Japanese pony will not come out of its gourd again, that much is sure. But at least, come autumn 1995, there is a chance that the gourd will yield us up those magical fat men.</p>

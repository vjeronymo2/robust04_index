			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Raul Llanos and Roberto Gonzalez] </F>   [Text] Representatives of the country's business and  financial sectors have expressed regret about the resignation of  Manuel Camacho Solis, Chiapas peace and reconciliation  commissioner, and have said that although economic "adjustments"  could take place, these will not be serious. Some said the  country's future looks uncertain, adding that this situation  could make the government toughen its position toward the armed  group.    Last night, Finance Minister Pedro Aspe refused to make any  comments on the effects that the resignation of the former  foreign relations secretary of state may have on the nation's  financial markets.    Meanwhile, Capital Bank President Jaime Weiss pointed out  the  former commissioner's resignation will not affect the nation's  financial markets; however, he recognized there could be some  adjustments, but these are regular adjustments already foreseen.  He added Mexican society is strong and mature and will react  cautiously to this incident. Weiss also added Mexican investors  still trust the nation's economic progress and have the  long-term foresight to keep their capital in the country.    The National Association of the Processing Industry  (Canacintra) believes Camacho's departure took place when the  peace process is at a decisive moment. It stated, however, that  this departure will have no effect whatsoever on what has been  attained so far, nor will it prevent the two parties from  sitting down to discuss and reach peace in Chiapas through a  consensus and dialogue.    "We do not think this resignation will have repercussions in  the economic and financial arenas because the country has  suitable people to continue the negotiations that are taking  place in Chiapas," the president of the National Processing  Industrialists Association (ANIT) stressed. He added: "It is a  shame he resigned; I believe he did a great job, taking into  account the governmental and nongovernmental limitations he had.  His resignation gives leeway to repressive behavior because his  role of mediator helped nonrepressive forces assume a passive  attitude. Questioned about Mexico's political and economic  future, the ANIT president said that "in general terms, it does  not look bright." This is why a replacement must be appointed  soon. As for economic impacts, he said there will be capital  flight, a bear market, and interest rate increases because the  resignation has exacerbated the atmosphere of uncertainty that  reigns in the country. He also said Camacho faced some  difficulties as he waded through pressure exerted from inside  and outside the system and from the Institutional Revolutionary  Party. He stressed: "Ernesto Zedillo's hard-heartedness  contributed to this situation."    Aurelio Tamez, president of the Sales and Marketing  Executives Confederation, said Camacho's negotiations were  difficult despite the efforts he made; his retirement is  regrettable.</p>

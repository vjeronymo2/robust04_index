			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Smoke lifts from leadership battlefield: The conduct of the contest offers some pointers to Labour's future THE SMOKE of battle cleared sufficiently over Labour's leadership contest yesterday to allow a quick survey of the terrain over which the 10-week campaign will be fought. Binoculars, however, may come in handy. Even for Labour activists, the policy differences between Mr Bryan Gould and Mr John Smith are ultimately slight, if interestingly nuanced. To the public at large - suffering acute political indigestion from the general election and now faced with the May 7 council polls - the whole business is as irrelevant and remote as the next general election. Yet the narrow parameters of debate are themselves an important factor in the way Labour addresses its future. The distinctions between soft-left (arguably Mr Gould's label) and old-right (Mr Smith's) are increasingly smudged by eight years of Kinnockite orthodoxy. Furthermore, as one senior official at party headquarters put it yesterday, the days of dream tickets and delicately balanced cabinets have gone. 'In 1983, the Kinnock-Hattersley ticket was essential to build a bridge across a sharply divided party,' he said. 'Neil's legacy is that no such bridges are necessary any more.' But is that strictly true? A colleague added perceptively that it was unfortunate that the rules had not allowed Mr Ken Livingstone to run in the electoral college on July 18. He could have served as a a focal point for the old hard left, some of whom will undoubtedly use the party's autumn conference to blame Labour's fourth successive election defeat on an insufficiently socialist programme. For Mr Smith's camp, this week was more successful than last, when his faltering opening declaration attracted widespread jibes that 'Smithism' represented little more than more of the same. In his 'manifesto' launch on Thursday, the shadow chancellor demonstrated that his Highland hill-climbing had left him sufficiently supple-jointed to straddle part of the Gould agenda as well as a portion of the political centre ground to Labour's right. By endorsing the goal of full employment - an aspiration of totemic importance to the left - while calling for a deep-rooted re-evaluation of tax policy and universal benefits, Mr Smith broadened his base magisterially. His proposed Commission on Social Justice, open to independent advice and Liberal Democrats alike, also held a door ajar to advocates of a full-blown realignment of the left. At the same time, Mr Smith threw a portion of his famous caution to the wind by restating his commitment to a redistributionist tax policy. This time, however, it is sensibly qualified by the notion that this must be limited to what political resources - voters' tolerance - allow. By taking a harder line on the unions' role in the party, implicitly hinting that the block vote should go, he also stole some of his rival's political clothes. Mr Gould will need enormous energies to turn the leadership race around. His camp claims strong support in the constituencies and is jubilant at the TGWU general union's refusal to offer Mr Smith a clear commitment, but the odds remain firmly against Mr Gould. In the deputy leadership race, there is everything to play for. Mr Gould's claim for support will be fuelled by many union general secretaries' fears that a vote for both Mr Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett looks too much like a stitch-up - an impression that could accelerate the assault on the block vote. The so-called 'sweet-and-sour' Smith-Gould package is already attracting endorsement from leftwingers who believe a little creative friction could generate the imaginative leaps Labour so desperately needs. But the 64 MPs' nominations for Mr John Prescott, who yesterday won the backing of the New Statesman, indicate that he is by no means an also-ran. Blunt-speaking, blue-collar and Yorkshire are credentials that still carry weight, even in the new model Labour party. For those still agonising over the election defeat, the danger of the leadership contest is that it postpones a post-mortem that will ultimately be more shallow as a result. Labour, they argue, should take rapid and dramatic steps to persuade the public that deep-rooted change is under way - yet another policy review is not enough.</p>

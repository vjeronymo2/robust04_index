			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Aideed frees hostages and demands peace process role SOMALIA'S rebel warlord, Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, yesterday freed a US helicopter pilot and a Nigerian soldier after four days of intense negotiations spearheaded by Mr Robert Oakley, the US special envoy in Mogadishu. Warrant Officer Michael Durant, shot down 11 days ago in a fierce battle against Gen Aideed's militias, was carried out on a stretcher from the back alleys of south Mogadishu and handed over to officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Nigerian peacekeeper, Trooper Umar Shantali, had been captured on September 5 during an ambush in which seven of his compatriots died. Their release ended a hostage crisis for the US and also appeared to secure a central role for Gen Aideed, the most hunted man in Somalia, in defining the future of his war-shattered and clan-divided country. In Washington, President Bill Clinton said no deals had been struck to secure Warrant Officer Durant's release. He said his warning last week of the consequences of harm being done to the helicopter pilot 'sent a strong message that was obviously heard'. He described the release as one of a series of 'hopeful actions' that demonstrated that US policy in Somalia was 'moving in the right direction'. A few hours earlier, Gen Aideed emerged from four months in hiding to announce the imminent release of his 'prisoners of war'. In exchange, he expected the immediate and unconditional release of his men. About 50 members of Gen Aideed's National Somali Alliance are thought to be held by the UN. Gen Aideed, who is wanted for the murder and mutilation of 24 Pakistani peacekeepers in June, said he would remain in hiding until the UN and US had sorted out their contradictory statements about his safety. He said he wanted an 'independent inquiry' into 'all the crimes committed since June'. He claimed that 9,000 Somalis had been killed or wounded since the UN launched retaliatory attacks four months ago. The general appeared confident that his demands would be granted. He promised to uphold his unilateral ceasefire, and clearly expected to form part of fresh political talks on Somalia's future. 'I want a pivotal role in the peace process,' he told reporters at a safe house in the labyrinth of the Bakara Market district of his south Mogadishu fiefdom. The UN will find Gen Aideed's demands unpalatable. The UN Operation in Somalia (Unosom) has lost 70 peacekeepers and fought itself into a military quagmire in Mogadishu in a fruitless attempt to bring Gen Aideed to justice. It was not immediately clear how the UN intended to accommodate all of the defiant warlord's demands without undertaking humiliating policy reversals. On the tricky question of whether Gen Aideed should be apprehended for the murder of the 24 Pakistani peacekeepers Mr Clinton noted, in an apparent conciliatory gesture, that Gen Aideed had written to former President Jimmy Carter proposing an independent commission of investigation. He did not exclude the possibility that the Aideed faction would be part of the political solution necessary in Somalia. He said the US had been wrong to wage a highly personalised battle which undermined the political process. In Cairo, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, and leaders of the Organisation of African Unity, the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Conference issued a joint appeal to Arab and African countries to send military and financial support to the 29,000-strong UN peacekeeping force in Somalia.

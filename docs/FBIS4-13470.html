			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Nizar Daww-al-Na'im in London, Sulayman Salim in </F> Nairobi, and Kamal Hamid in Khartoum: "Garang Paves the Way for  the Declaration of a State by Creating the `New Sudan' Entity"]    [Excerpts] The mainstream of the Sudanese People's  Liberation Movement [SPLM] led by Colonel John Garang has  declared that the movement's first general congress "has  announced the birth of a political and administrative entity  which will from now on be called the New Sudan." In its  resolutions, the congress defined the New Sudan's territory and  created military and civilian administrations, a parliament, and  a judicial system in a step believed to pave the way for the  declaration of a state in southern Sudan or for the imposition  of a confederal formula for the country. [passage omitted]    A press statement issued by the SPLM, a copy of which was  received by AL-HAYAH yesterday, said that the movement's  congress, the first of its kind since since the movement's birth  in 1983, concluded its work on 11 April in an unnamed venue  somewhere in "the liberated areas of southern Sudan." It added  that the congress "announced the birth of a political and  administrative entity which will from now on be called the New  Sudan" and that it will consist of "areas south of Kurdufan (in  the west of the country), south of the Blue Nile (in the east),  and the three southern districts of the Upper Nile, Equatoria,  and Bahr al-Ghazal," the regions identified by the movement as  the "fighting regions," which were known as the "closed regions"  under British colonialism and from which the northerners were  banned except by special permit.    The congress formed a parliament for the New Sudan and  called  it "the National Liberation Council" with a term of five years.  It also formed an Executive Council similar to a cabinet. It  elected Garang as speaker of the parliament and chairman of the  Executive Council and appointed the movement's Chief of Staff  Commander Silva Kir [as transliterated] as Garang's deputy.    The congress decided that the Liberation Council shall  consist of 182 members "of whom 132 are to be elected by popular  ballot, 38 are to represent the movement's Army and regular  forces, and 10, in addition to the speaker and his deputy, are  to be appointed."    The congress authorized the Executive Council to work for  the  following:    1. Seek to fulfill the right of the people of the New Sudan  to self-determination by all means including armed struggle.    2. Use the New Sudan's resources in the management of the  war if necessary.    3. Separate the civilian administration from the military  administration.    4. Introduce the necessary civilian administration  structures for the New Sudan.    5. Create a judiciary system to be independent from the  legislative and executive institutions.    6. Uphold the rule of law and human rights.    7. Grant a general amnesty for individuals who rebelled  against the movement or committed crimes.    Steven Wandu, the movement's spokesman, said that Garang  assured the congress members that the Executive Council would  implement the congress resolutions and he announced a general  amnesty for his opponents and emphasized that "those who return  would be given their full rights and privileges." Garang  affirmed that the Council "will do its best to achieve unity of  the people of the New Sudan."    Movement sources say that the announcement of the creation  of  a new entity coincides with the movement's call for a confederal  state in Sudan for a transitional period to be followed by a  referendum on self-determination. Observers of Sudanese affairs  see that step as a practical move toward that phase which had  been expected to materialize in the context of a peace agreement  defining the jurisdictions of the northern and southern entities  in the transitional period in accordance with the movement's  peace plan.    Commenting on the announcement of the New Sudan entity, a  Sudanese Government source has stated that the "aim of such talk  is to raise the collapsing morale of the rebel soldiers after  the successive defeats they suffered and the divisions within  their ranks." That declaration, he said, "might have been  effective had it been made in 1987 or 1988 when the rebels were  in control of all southern territories with the exception of the  three main cities, but it is ridiculous now as the government is  control of all Sudanese territory with the exception of some  isolated pockets on the borders with Uganda."

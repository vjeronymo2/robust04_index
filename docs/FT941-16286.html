			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Tomkins The jury must still be out on Tomkins' purchase of RHM. Though interim profits of Pounds 94m were a little higher than the market expected, that mainly reflected the trend in the group's other businesses. The old RHM held little surprise. Milling and baking contributed Pounds 7.1m, though it must have been the main beneficiary of the Pounds 12.3m group spending against provisions. Of course, Tomkins' supermarket customers would be asking awkward questions if it had pushed bread margins sharply higher. As it is, a further slog lies ahead, while the acquisition is made relatively less attractive by the Pounds 17m increase in the provision for deferred tax. Tomkins' balance sheet with net cash of nearly Pounds 170m is strong compared with other conglomerates. Cash generation will not be quite so impressive in the second half, when both utilisation of provisions and capital expenditure will increase. Still, Tomkins can amply afford to restructure RHM while conserving working capital resources for the upturn. It could even gear up for an acquisition, if an opportunity arose. The company must hope this flexibility encourages the market to accord it a higher rating. Indeed, there is some prospect of out-performance, not least because its high cover ratio puts Tomkins into the popular category of companies able to offer real dividend growth. The trouble is that its cash pile is also a drag at current interest rates. There would be more sense in saving up for another acquisition if RHM had already proved a winner.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Ashanti shows improvement Ashanti Goldfields of Ghana, soon to be floated on the London and Accra stock exchanges, yesterday reported record gold production and earnings. Gold output last year rose 19 per cent from the 1992 level, from 654,298 troy ounces to 770,410 ounces, while pre-tax profits jumped by 18.5 per cent from Dollars 76.4m to Dollars 90.5m (Pounds 60.3m). High capital expenditure on Ashanti's expansion programme during the year reduced the tax charge from Dollars 15.8m to Dollars 300,000 so that profits after tax accelerated by 49 per cent, from Dollars 60.6m to Dollars 90.2m. Turnover was up by 15per cent, from Dollars 238.6m to Dollars 275.1m. Ashanti has adopted the US dollar forfinancial statements, as its revenues are in dollars and most of its fixed asset purchases and costs are in currencies related to the dollar. Ashanti, a45 per cent-owned associate of Lonrho, the international conglomerate, said that last year proven and probable gold reserves rose from 16.8m to 18.1m ounces. The only surprise in the results was that, despite the steady climb in themarket price of gold last year, the average price Ashanti received for its output was down from Dollars 365 an ounce in 1992 to Dollars 357. However, its full operating costs, including depreciation and royalty payments, fell from Dollars 245 an ounce to Dollars 235. The company reported excellent progress with its Dollars 300m, four year expansion programme designed to place it among the few groups producing more than 1m ounces a year by 1996. Last year the government of Ghana, which owns 55 per cent of Ashanti, said it would sell about 25 per cent of the company via a flotation on its local and on the London stock exchanges. The float, which is expected to value Ashanti at about Dollars 1bn, is likely to be completed in March. To reflect the change in status, the name is being changed from Ashanti Goldfields Corporation (Ghana) to Ashanti Goldfields Company.</p>

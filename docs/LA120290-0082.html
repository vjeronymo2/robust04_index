			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC PARAMETERS: TAIWAN  </P> <P> "The signing of the U.S.-Singapore agreement on U.S. military facilities on  that island will, if we are to believe Dan Quayle, facilitate a robust U.S.  presence in the Pacific.  </P> <P> It may even well represent Washington's fondest hopes. But it is difficult to  see how it will turn out to be anything beyond that.  </P> <P> "The United States wants a treaty to show Americans, and perhaps the world,  that it remains a superpower. Whatever gloss Washington puts on the situation,  the fact remains that it is being driven out of the Philippines because it  cannot afford to pay."  </P> <P>  -- China News editorial.  </P></p>

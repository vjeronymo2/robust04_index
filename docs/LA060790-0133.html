			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HAHN NAME WORKS ITS MAGIC IN A LONG-SHOT RUN FOR ASSESSOR  </P> <P> He's a political novice, but one lucky enough to have a time-honored name in  local politics.  </P> <P> And now, Kenneth P. Hahn -- no relation to the prominent, and popular, Los  Angeles County supervisor of the same name -- suddenly finds himself solidly in  a runoff with incumbent John J. Lynch to be the next county assessor.  </P> <P> "You're kidding?" Hahn asked when early election night results showed him  running neck-and-neck with his boss at the sleepy assessor's office. But as the  trend continued through the night, Hahn, a mid-level manager under Lynch,  realized that the odds for what had started as a long-shot chance at victory  were narrowing fast.  </P> <P> In a fluke of democracy -- and on the strength of the Hahn name -- he was  squarely in the race for the $130,000 a year job, overseeing a staff of 1,600  that determines the tax bills for 2.2 million properties.  </P> <P> By Wednesday morning, the reality of his unusual showing was clear -- even  through Hahn's bleary eyes.  </P> <P> "It's a mess, a madhouse," groaned Hahn, 50, in an early morning phone call. "I  haven't been to bed yet. People keep calling, TV's on the other line. . . .  Damn, there goes the phone again."  </P> <P> So began the political baptism of Kenneth P. Hahn, possibly the next Los  Angeles County assessor. His strong showing, which Hahn and a host of political  observers acknowledge was due in large part to the name confusion, means that  for the first time in recent history, a sitting assessor has been forced into a  runoff for reelection.  </P> <P> In the primary election for the nonpartisan assessor's post, a candidate must  draw 50% of the vote to win outright. If no candidate receives a majority, the  top two finishers face off in November.  </P> <P> Lynch, with 29.6% of the vote, and Hahn, with 28.2%, dominated the field of  seven competitors on Tuesday's ballot.  </P> <P> Tax attorney Jay Curtis, whom Lynch had figured to be his toughest competition,  drew just 16.6% of the vote. The remaining candidates, most of whom are now  backing Hahn, drew in single digits.  </P> <P> "The Hahn name was the wild card in this race," said Lynch in reviewing the  election results.  </P> <P> But the assessor said he prefers to face Hahn in a runoff, because "the real  Kenny Hahn endorsed me and once people know that, it will be easy."  </P> <P> "The name 'Hahn' is a good name, even after 43 years" in politics, said  Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who has served on the board since 1952 and was earlier  a member of the Los Angeles City Council. "I'm sure my son will love to hear  about this."  </P> <P> Indeed, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn, said: "There's magic in the Hahn  name. . . . I know how I got elected city controller" in his first run at  political office in 1981. "The Hahn name really carried me. It still carries a  strong feeling in this town."  </P> <P> But sometimes the magic works, and sometimes it doesn't.  </P> <P> In 1986, Supervisor Hahn's older brother, Gordon, ran against Lynch for the  assessor's post and was soundly defeated.  </P> <P> "I just can't figure why (the Hahn name) didn't help Gordon," said James Hahn.  </P> <P> Lynch, who has wrested with both Hahn candidates, has a theory on that. "The  last name isn't operative in politics," said Lynch. "You need the whole handle.  And my opponent this time is blessed with that name." Joe Gardner, a retired  county administrator, has had the misfortune to lose to both Kenneth Hahns.  Gardner lost to the supervisor in 1988 and to assessor's candidate Hahn on  Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's just too much name ID to overcome," he sighed.  </P> <P> "It's something you can't buy," City Atty. Hahn said about the vote-garnering  ability of his father's name.  </P> <P> But if a politician could purchase the Hahn handle, it might carry a hefty  price tag.  </P> <P> Lynch's campaign spent more than $160,000 leading up to Tuesday's balloting,  while Hahn spent less than $5,000 to gather nearly the same number of votes.  </P> <P> Candidate Hahn acknowledges that name confusion did come up during the  campaign.  </P> <P> "I went and spoke to one group . . . and a woman asked me, 'How is your  father?' " he said. "I said he has been deceased for 10 years."  </P> <P> But the candidate also says that he deserves some credit for having run a  tough, grass-roots campaign.  </P> <P> "I feel the people have been able to sort through the hoopla," he said.  </P> <P> Hahn, educated as a biologist, has been with the assessor's office for 10  years, after careers as a chemist, social worker and credit union executive.  </P> <P> Upon joining county government in 1980, Hahn nearly took a job in the animal  control office, but at the last minute opted for an offer from the assessor's  office.  </P> <P> Currently, Hahn is an appraiser specialist, a mid-management position paying  $42,000. The post is just slightly senior to the deputy assessor position that  Lynch held before his 1986 election.  </P></p>

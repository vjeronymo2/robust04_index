			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Observer: Mirror image SG Warburg, the government's global co-ordinator in the BT share sale, threw a party on Monday evening for its directors and advisers who had worked on the float. At the end of the bash, the bank revealed the winner of its 'Warren Beatty' award, which was to go to the director who had managed to get his name into the press - (there he goes again, Ed) - more often than anyone else. It was James Sassoon, recently to be heard saying how sick he was of talking to journos. Nor did he consider his prizes - a BT3 shirt and a mirror for his wall - to be much compensation for his labours.</p>

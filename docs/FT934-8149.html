			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Insolvency service fails to speed up THE government's insolvency service failed to meet its performance targets for timely action against the directors of failed companies, its annual report said yesterday. It submitted just 33.9 per cent of disqualification reports against directors within 15 months, against a planned target of 80 per cent. It also submitted only 57.1 per cent of prosecution reports within 10 months against companies and 74.1 per cent for bankruptcies, against targets of 80 per cent in both cases. The service, which is an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry, was heavily criticised last month by the National Audit Office for failing to deal with adequate numbers of disqualification orders against the directors of failed companies. But its low performance came in a year in which 42,692 insolvencies were handled. Just 36,000 were expected. The service reported to creditors on assets and liabilities within nine weeks in 72.1 per cent of cases, against a target of 75 per cent. But it reduced the average unit cost of the initial stages of cases by substantially more than its target figure. It also outperformed its plan in dealing with certain outstanding payments. In the year to March 31 1993 the service generated fee income of Pounds 23.9m from its Insolvency Services Account, compared with Pounds 19.6m last year. Costs were up to Pounds 63.5m from Pounds 56.9m in the previous year. Mr Peter Joyce, inspector general and chief executive, said the rising number of personal and corporate failures had placed pressures on the organisation. He said the service had reviewed its policies to give greater priority to prosecutions and disqualifications that had caused most public interest and creditor concern.</p>

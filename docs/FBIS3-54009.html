			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We heard a short while ago that the leadership of  the Rally for Culture and Democracy [RCD] announced that the  party will not take part in the national conference [scheduled  to take place on 25 January].    However, the RCD has pointed out that the reason behind this  decision was that the adopted platform on the transitional  period to be discussed by the national conference contains a  retraction from the one proposed by the Higher State Council.</p>

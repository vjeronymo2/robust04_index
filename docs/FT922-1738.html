			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pension investors to face bonus squeeze - Moves to cut returns on contracts PENSION investors could face sharp cuts in bonuses and radical changes in the way these are allocated. The Institute of Actuaries wants to see rates for pension contracts, based on traditional and unitised with-profits funds, changed to reflect the poor returns of the late 1980s and the predicted low yields of the 1990s. The institute is alsolooking hard at how actuaries are dealing with unitised with-profits contracts. Little is known about the long-term implications for investors of these products; yet, by mid-1992, three-quarters of providers had replaced their traditional with-profits contract with a unitised version. With-profits pensions have been available for the self-employed and those in non-pensionable employment since 1956, initially in the form of self-employed retirement annuities and, since July 1988, as personal pensions. Until three years ago, traditional with-profits contracts formed the backbone of this thriving market. Under a traditional contract, the investor secures a substantial guaranteed sum at maturity, to which annual or reversionary bonuses are added. These bonuses, which smooth out fluctuations over the long term, are guaranteed and, once allocated, cannot be taken away. On top of this, there is a final or terminal bonus which is discretionary and reflects actual performance over the past 15 months. This method of distributing profits to policyholders became more complex with the introduction of a two-tier annual bonus system. Originally, bonuses were paid as a percentage of the sum assured plus any attaching bonuses from previous years. Now, however, most providers allocate a lower bonus to the sum assured and a higher rate to the accrued bonuses. In this way, providers hope to cut overall payouts at the expense of the shorter-term contracts. A second trend in recent years has been for providers to place greater emphasis on the discretionary final bonus. Under a Standard Life 25-year with-profits contract, for example, the terminal bonus accounts for more than 60 per cent of the total payout at maturity. At the other end of the spectrum, Commercial Union's terminal bonus accounts for under 30 per cent of final payout. Advocates of the terminal bonus argue that it gives greater investment flexibility since a smaller part of the underlying fund has to be set aside in a special reserve to cover future guarantees. The pro-guarantees lobby argues that the shift in emphasis towards final bonus constitutes a significant change in the risk profile of these contracts. In future, though, bonus rates may be cut severely as actuaries follow the guidelines expected to emerge from an investigation by the institute headed by Chris Headdon, senior assistant actuary with Equitable Life. He is chairman of the institute's working party on future bonus prospects which is examining how quickly, and by how much, bonus rates should be cut because of the influence of the European exchange rate mechanism coupled with a prolonged period of low inflation and low investment returns. Headdon says: 'It is generally accepted that bonus cuts have not gone far enough, although there are signs that the old reluctance to cut is being replaced by a more realistic attitude. The industry has not done itself any favours by treating the high declared bonus rates of the past as a sacred cow.' At the same time, the institute is examining the whole concept of the unitised with-profits contract. In spite of marketing claims that these products are easier to understand than the traditional contract, unitisation is not synonymous with simplification. This product does not offer a guaranteed sum at maturity; thus, the provider does not have to set aside such large reserves to meet its obligations. Also, the bonuses are declared in a different format from traditional contracts. Most providers increase the value of the unit price but a minority, including Sun Life and Legal &amp; General, maintain a fixed unit price and add bonuses through the allocation of extra units. Within these two systems, there are a host of variations on the way profit is distributed. Moreover, one-third of providers - including Provident Life, Prudential, Sun Life and Scottish Equitable - do not offer a guaranteed minimum bonus. The rest provide a minimum of about 4 per cent per annum. Unitised funds also apply a final bonus, but the product has only been available for a few years and a clear pattern has not emerged. The institute's working party on unitised funds is keen to investigate whether actuaries are tackling in the best way what is a relatively new product that now accounts for the majority of new pensions (and endowment) business. Unitisation also heralded the arrival of the controversial market value adjuster (MVA). These adjusters are used as a safety net for providers in case of a mass exodus of clients following a drop in the markets, and allow them to reduce the value of units. In this respect, the guaranteed nature of the accruing bonuses is not so solid after all. The working party on unitisation, which draws on expertise from the government actuary's department, life offices and actuarial consultants, requested detailed information from providers to determine how bonus rates are calculated and how the MVAs operate. The survey also examined investment policy and the level of reserves held to meet future obligations. The working party is expected to publish its findings shortly and could issue guidelines to actuaries operating unitised funds. William Hewitson, chief actuary in the life insurance division at the government actuary' s department, says: 'In most cases, life offices introducing the product have at the same time withdrawn their traditional with-profits contract. The institute felt that this new concept should be the subject of a professional study to see what sort of practices were developing with the idea of setting some broad industry standards.' The investigation also spotlights concern over the almost wholesale abandonment of the traditional with-profits concept. This seems odd at a time when volatile markets and pension scandals have sent investors in their droves seeking lower risk pension policies underpinned by guarantees. Providers claim that unitisation benefits the investor. But the proliferation of unitised contracts has taken place over the past three years when the call for life offices to cut bonuses and reduce pressure on reserves has intensified. Since it is almost impossible to compare the two types of bonus rates, cynics might argue that the switch to unitisation has given providers the opportunity to revise contracts to suit themselves without inviting unwelcome publicity.</p>

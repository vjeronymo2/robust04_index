			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / MEPs reject car pollution curbs The European Parliament yesterday rejected proposals to tighten anti-pollution regulations against car manufacturers from 1996. MEPs threw out the proposals after strong opposition from the European Commission and the auto industry which argued it threatened jobs and investment. The vote opens the way for passage of existing proposals gradually to limit car emissions through legislation due to come into force in 1996. The car industry has been working toward a set goal of lower emissions, but became alarmed after the parliament's environment committee introduced a raft of amendments for tougher standards and a faster timetable. The amendments also demanded a 50 per cent increase in air quality standards, as well as new tax incentives for clean cars and a carbon tax to limit fuel consumption. The second reading vote at the Strasbourg parliament was eagerly awaited because it provided a test of the Maastricht treaty's new clauses on co-decision. If the amendment had secured the 260 votes necessary for passage, it would have gone back to the Council of Ministers which would have been forced to broker a compromise or face a showdown with a newly assertive parliament.</p>

Yi also said the administration will submit a market  opening schedule to GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade) after taking into account the contents of similar  schedules to be submitted by major countries like the United  States, Japan and the European Union (EU).    The premier was answering questions at the fourth-day of the  National Assembly interpellation of the administration on  economic matters. He implied that South Korea may revise its  original market opening plan depending on the outcome of the  ongoing U.S.-Japan trade talks. The premier said that so far  most other countries are withholding their market opening  schedules. "This is due to their policy to cope with the  outcome of the U.S.-Japan trade talks," Yi said.    Also speaking on the Assembly floor, Agriculture Minister  Kim  Yang-pae said last year South Korea recorded a deficit of about  $5,040 million in the trade of agricultural and fishery products.    In a heated session, five lawmakers who took the floor  called  for additional steps to promote agriculture, to support small  companies and to deregulate business activities.    Rep. Kim Yong-chin of the main opposition Democratic Party  (DP) asked whether the government intends to negotiate with GATT  member nations again over the multilateral agreement to  partially open the domestic rice market which was agreed in the  Uruguay Round trade talks. He noted that the United States and  Japan are planning to hold talks to readjust agreements on trade  in the agricultural field while delaying submitting their plans  to implement UR accords.    Kim demanded that the government invest more money in  developing agriculture, charging that the 1.5 trillion won  earmarked this year for restructuring the farming sector is far  short of what is needed to implement government projects  including farm mechanization.    Rep. Pak U-pyong said the Foreign Ministry should be  expanded  so that the ministry's function could include external trade  affairs. He also suggested lowering interest rates to relieve  manufacturing industries of financial burdens and contribute to  strengthening their international competitiveness.    Rep. Pak Chong-hun of the DP suspected that there may be  political motives behind the selection of the chief contractor  for the second mobile telecommunication business.    "The government handed over the right to select the winner  to  the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI). But actually, the  government had already decided to choose Kolon as the main  contractor in a secretive manner," Pak insisted. He also called  for the government to overhaul the current taxation system in  order to relieve wage earners of their high tax burden. He  contended that the tax system runs counter to the principle of  equity by imposing a low tax levels on those living off unearned  incomes.    O Chang-sop of the DLP said the nation's industries should  be  restructured so that the manufacturing sectors could be a key  industry in achieving the nation's goal of boosting its  competitive power.    "In addition, administrative regulation son economic  activities should be eased," O said.    Finally, he called for the government to expand tax favors  to  private companies which have been eager to develop new  technologies.</p>

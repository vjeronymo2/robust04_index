			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Gaydukevich, chairman of the Popular </F> Movement of Belarus, by Andrey Korabelnikov; place and date not  given: "There Are Only Three Forces in Belarus"]    [Excerpt] There are 13 political parties and over  100 different movements in Belarus today. A SEM DNEY  correspondent has interviewed People's Deputy Sergey  Gaydukevich, chairman of the Popular Movement of Belarus [PMB],  on the real political power of these organizations.    [Gaydukevich] There are many parties and movements.  However, that does not imply that they are cardinally  different. The world has long been acquainted with the pendulum  principle. This principle accounts for only two determining  forces. These forces can be assessed in many terms, but in  their essence they are either "right" or "left." Political  power is also controlled either by the former or the latter --  it never rests in the middle. Therefore, any party or movement  gravitates either to the "right" or to the "left." One force  stands for the superiority of government property and the  implementation of major social programs, the other stands for  the superiority of the private sector and the reduction of state  subsidies for social security programs. A state that tries to  stop the movement of that pendulum is in dire straits.  Unfortunately, this is the situation in which we find ourselves.    There are only three real political forces in the Republic:  the PMB, the Belarusian Popular Front [BPF], and...the Council  of Ministers. All the others are satellites. With regard to  the Council of Ministers being a third political force, it is an  obvious fact. It is not without reason that people speak about  Kebich's policy; no other politicians or economists are  mentioned. In our situation, this force speaks of reforms, but,  thus far, its declarations have not been supported by practical  actions.    The second influential force was -- and remains -- the BPF.  This organization has a concrete political and economic  program. BPF representatives work in different command  structures, participate in Supreme Soviet activities, and exert  significant influence on mass media. The determining factor in  their activities is private property. However, their proposal  for the resolution of the national question has pushed many  people away from the BPF. The BPF is supported by fewer and  fewer people.    The third force is the PMB, which is a peculiar union of  unions. We bring together 22 parties and movements from  throughout the Republic. What does that mean? It means that  all these organizations are united in one front. Their  independence is secured, but common goals will be achieved  together. The basic principle of our movement is the return of  a strong system of state power, as well as economic diversity  with social security guarantees for workers. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / French industry output increases French industrial production increased in November and should rise further in the next few months, according to a survey of company chairmen by the Bank of France which was published yesterday. The survey supports the government's claims that the economy has stabilised after a sharp downturn at the end of last year and during the first quarter of this year. But it also reflected economists' forecasts of a slow and fragile rise from recession. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, yesterday told the National Assembly the government's forecast of 1.4 per cent growth in GDP next year was 'a reasonable estimate'. Recovery would be at 'a slow rhythm'. But he pointed to some encouraging signs, including the Bank of France survey. The survey showed rises in production in the farm and food sectors, the car industry and intermediate goods industries. In the consumer goods sector, companies reported a stabilisation in output. The survey showed strong demand for exports, especially to south-east Asia, the US and Latin America. Order books increased during the month. 'Despite persistent uncertainties, most business chiefs expect growth in activity for the coming months and say they are ready to revise upwards their investment,' the Bank of France said. There were, however, some pessimistic elements in the survey. Employment in industry continued to fall in November, adding to the 3.2m jobless total recorded at the end of October.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Reed opens office in prison REED EMPLOYMENT, the recruitment agency, yesterday opened an office inside Holloway women's prison to provide training and work for inmates. The project is the first of its kind to be run by an employer in a UK prison. Prisoners will take on typing, data processing and telephone sales work for outside companies, supervised by Reed staff. If the scheme is a success it could be extended to other prisons, Reed said. Part of the inmates' pay of about Pounds 3 an hour will go towards their keep in the prison, with the rest for pocket money and savings. Women taking part in the scheme will also be able to make a voluntary donation to the charity Victim Support. Outside businesses will be charged ordinary basic commercial rates for work done. The pilot initially involves four inmates who 'go to work' each day dressed in Reed corporate colours. A room decorated by Reed to resemble an ordinary branch of the agency, equipped with computers and telephones, has been set aside within the prison for the project. Mr Alec Reed, executive chairman, said the aim was to treat the women as ordinary temporary staff and to encourage them to identify themselves as part of the company team. He said yesterday the only difference was that 'we bring the work to them, rather than them going to the jobs'. Women would finish their sentences with valuable skills, references and job prospects, as well as earnings in the bank, said Mr Reed. Reed has set aside Pounds 20,000 for the first year of the project out of the funds of the registered Reed Charity, which was set up by the company.</p>

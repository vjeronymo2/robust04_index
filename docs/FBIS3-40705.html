It  also spells out the citizen's fundamental rights, liberties, and  duties of individuals.    A constitution is tied to the presence of a state. There is  no society with any degree of organization which does not have  some fundamental rules that explain this society's system of  government. Therefore, the lack of a constitution that regulates  government affairs throws the door wide open for political  conflicts among various political and intellectual tendencies.  Moreover, the logic of force, domination, and monopolization of  the control of government affairs prevails, thus resulting in  many negative consequences that harm society's unity, stability,  and development.    A constitution, like other laws, is a social phenomenon that  expresses the spirit of the educational, intellectual, and  cultural environment prevailing in a society. By its nature,  this environment is subject to change in accordance with the law  of ceaseless development in a society's life. This change  dictates that a degree of accord and harmony be achieved between  the new reality produced by the given facts of change and  modernization in society's social, political, and economic life  on the one hand and, on the other hand, society's fundamental  law, which is embodied in the constitution, so that the latter  will be subject to the logic of amendment that keeps up pace  with and expands to accommodate the change. In other words, any  change in life's ever-dynamic circumstances must be coupled with  and accompanied by parallel development in the laws so that  society's real conditions will not be divorced from its legal  structure.    While acknowledging that it is important and necessary that  a  constitutional system be stable, this stability cannot be so  absolute that it leads to rigidity in constitutional life.  Absolute rigidity of constitutions is incompatible with the  principle of development and it poses the threat of violent  unrest in a society's life. Moreover, absolute constitutional  rigidity results in denying sovereign nations the exercise of  their sovereignty to amend their constitutions whenever they  deem it necessary to do so. This contradicts the nature of  things. How could a group impose on itself laws which it cannot  amend afterward? In harmony with these logical considerations,  we find that the constitutional legislator himself inserts into  the constitution provisions that make it permissible to amend  one or more articles of the constitution and that spell out the  procedures that have to be observed in this regard. Thus, the  negatives of slipping into absolute rigidity are avoided and, at  the same time, a reasonable degree of stability in the  constitutional system is ensured.    In a related area, when the constitutional legislator  establishes the fundamental rules of the system of government  and of public liberties in the state, he gives expressin to the  true nature of the existing conditions and circumstances, be  they political, social, or economic, and the nature of the  tendencies and ideas prevailing at the time. Therefore, the  legislator cannot bypass the circumstances and leap ahead of  time, thus taking into account circumstances and conditions that  have not developed yet. Therefore, it is a proven fact that when  circumstances dictating amendment develop, amendment of the  constitution becomes inevitable. This is because justifications  for the continued presence of past conditions have disappeared  and because one has to keep pace with new developments.    On this basis, we find that most political, economic,  social,  cultural, and administrative ideas and opinions on the national  horizon of the Yemeni arena are unanimous that the 1981  constitution of the republic was drafted under certain political  circumstances that are different in form and content from the  current political circumstances and all their transformations,  changes, and developments.    The constitution has been founded, as everybody knows, on  harmonizing the various political ideas and the contradictory  positions that were adopted by the two former regimes under the  extraordinary conditions of partition. Thus, the constitution  document emerged as a formula which balanced the different  political and organizational ideas and tendencies of each of the  two parts. It was evident that the provisions of this document  lacked precision, cohesion, and harmony. It was even rumored  that some provisions had been written with the determination not  to achieve anything for Yemen's unity. Despite all this, the  supreme national interest dictated that the document's weak  points and deficiencies be overlooked so as to preserve the  harmony formula that had been developed and that was suitable as  an agreed foundation for accomplishing the great objective. This  formula constituted a gain then, having been achieved over a  long period of time and only after great and exhaustive efforts.    It is well-known that the period from 1981 to 1992 produced  a  number of important national, regional, and international  developments and changes, most significant of which was  accomplishment of the great civilizational plan embodied in  restoring unity and proclaiming the Republic of Yemen on 22 May  1990. This development was followed by great national efforts to  implement the process of the republic's political, economic,  administrative, and judiciary development and merger through  energetic and ceaseless efforts by the state's concerned  authorities. These authorities have begun to eliminate the  traces of partition and its hateful legacy. They have been able,  despite the state's flawed institutional structure and despite  the duality and ambiguity of the constitutional institutions, to  accomplish numerous important institutional and legislative  achievements to unify the Republic of Yemen. The recent period  has produced numerous unified laws. That period has, moreover,  led to rearranging and unifying most of the organizational and  administrative structures and to establishing unified  institutions and agencies that are engaged in various activities  and that seek varied objectives.    It is worth noting now that prior to the referendum on the  constitution, the Presidential Council had promised the people  in a statement to present to the early meetings of the elected  House of Representatives any observations brought up regarding  the constitution. The fact that the current house has been  elected in accordance with the constitution puts this house and  the Presidential Council face to face with their responsibility  to fulfill the commitments they had made to the people.    As an extension of this effective activity to build and  develop the Republic of Yemen and in view of the fact that the  practical application of the constitution has demonstrated that  its provisions-- which are based, as we have already pointed  out, on the circumstances under which it was drafted and  prepared, i.e., the circumstances of partition--cannot keep up  with the developments the region is experiencing, this  constitution has to be reviewed and examined article by article  so we can put our finger on its weaknesses and deficiencies and  on the ambiguities in its principles and rules and so we can  emerge with a new and clear vision that achieves harmony, that  embodies unity's objectives, and that keeps pace with all of the  national developments in the political, economic, and social  areas. In this review and examination, consideration must be  given to all the opinions, observations, and criticism voiced on  some of the constitution's provisions. We must deal with  whatever is raised in this regard with a patriotic and  democratic spirit that respects contrary opinion and gives  precedence to the supreme national interest. For all the general  considerations and justifications explained above, it has become  urgent to amend the constitution in order to secure the future  of the democratic procession, to strengthen national unity, and  to lay down sound foundations for building the modern state of  Yemen--a state of constitutional institutions. This step is also  a national mission with which to crown the accomplishments that  have already been achieved in an endeavor to create Yemen's  desired cultural revival under the modern edifice of a state of  constitution and laws. There is no doubt that the national  resolve which accomplished Yemen's unity is capable of achieving  a lot to serve the country with the same patriotic spirit and  peaceful national democratic dialogue which prevailed in the  achievement of unity, that great historical accomplishment.    It is established and confirmed in constitutional and legal  jurisprudence and it is unanimously agreed among jurisprudents  and interpreters of constitutional law that the concept of  constitutional amendment includes amending or abolishing what is  extant and adding what is proposed to be included in the  constitution.    Amendment includes amendment by addition, omission,  abolition, or rephrasing. This is because a constitutional  amendment is passed to meet an urgent need or to keep pace with  existing developments or developments that are likely in the  foreseeable future. Consequently, the firmness of a  constitutional base hinges on its ability to absorb society's  political, economic, cultural, and social constants and  society's aspirations in all areas of society's activities, and  for the longest time possible.    According to this legal framework, it is extremely important  to review the issues on which the demand for amendment focuses,  whether by rephrasing the constitutional article, by adding to  it, by omitting from it, by abolishing it, or by adding new  provisions to some sections and chapters of the constitution.  The reasons dictating the demand for amendment must be clarified  for every one of the issues included in the demand for such  amendment. This clarification must be made according to the  sequence of the constitution's sections and chapters, as shown  in the following:  <H6>  Section 1 </H6> <H6>  Fundamentals of State </H6> <H5>  Chapter 1 </H5> <H5>  Political Fundamentals </H5>   Article 1. It is required to amend this article by adding to  it a phrase which emphasizes that the state, both as an entity  and as people, belongs to Arabism and Islam. These two  characteristics must be underlined for both the State of Yemen  and the Yemeni people and not just for one without the other,  which is what article one of the constitution has done. The  article must also emphasize that the Yemeni people belong to the  Islamic nation, in addition to being part of the Arab nation.  The phrase "Islamic nation" should replace the "Islamic world."    Article 3. It is required to amend this article in order to  clarify the source from which laws are derived by pointing out  in a clearly worded phrase that the Islamic shari'ah is the  source of all legislation, considering that there is no  disagreement over this issue. We must do this on the basis of  our belief in the dictates of the Islamic shari'ah and in the  capacity of its tolerant teachings which can accommodate all  changes and developments at all times and in all places. The  shari'ah can accomplish this through its comprehensive sources  of its controls that are defined in the principles of  jurisprudence. These principles include sources from which laws  appropriate for the development of human societies are derived.  The sources include consensus, analogy, consent, the example of  the prophet's companions, incompletely transmitted interests,  and other evidence approved legally by Islamic jurisprudence.  All this ensures the freedom of opinion in a manner that doesn't  violate the Islamic shari'ah.  <H5>  Article To Be Added </H5>   Article...An amendment is required by adding to Chapter 1 an  article that defines the state's political identity in light of  the democratic option that is based on party pluralism in its  capacity, along with the principle of the peaceful rotation of  power, as one of the national constants that must be underlined  in the constitution and must be bolstered with stipulations  stated within the political principles incorporated in Article  39 of the constitution. This amendment shall also stipulate that  the law will define the categories of state employees who shall  be prohibited from engaging in any party activity because the  public interest dictates it.    The amendment introduced by this added article also seeks to  enhance what is already stated in the political parties and  organizations law about the impermissibility of exploiting  public jobs or public funds to serve the interest of a certain  political party or organization. The amendment also seeks to  establish this impermissibility as a constitutional principle  and as one of the state's fundamental principles so as to  strengthen the democratic system and party pluralism; to ensure  the safety and neutrality of public jobs; and to protect public  money. In order to achieve this end, the text of the amendment  must be binding to all agencies, parties, and officials in the  various positions of responsibility.  <H5>  Chapter 2 </H5> <H5>  Economic Fundamentals </H5>   Article 6. It is required to rephrase this article in order  to clarify the economic tendency so that the state's economic  policy will be founded on a free economic activity that doesn't  undermine society's interest; so that national independence will  be strengthened; and so that all interests will be tended and  balanced. To accomplish this end, clear and harmonious  principles based on the following tendencies have to be embraced:    A. Islamic social justice in economic relations with the aim  of achieving social solidarity and balance, developing and  improving production, and enhancing society's living standard.    B. Apply the rule of profitability to economic and  production  activities managed by the public sector, considering that these  activities are tantamount to a public social property that must  be managed according to economic and commercial criteria. This  is accomplished by adopting the principle of legitimate  competition which ensures fair cooperation between the various  economic activity sectors and makes sure that these sectors are  treated equally and fairly.    C. Protect and preserve private ownership so it will not be  undermined, unless for the sake of a public interest and only  with fair compensation in accordance with the law.    Article 7. It is required to amend this article in order to  eliminate the ambiguity engulfing the word "derivatives." This  word should be replaced by "kinds" because derivatives come into  existence after natural resources are discovered and produced.    Article 8. It is required to rephrase this article in order  to eliminate the restriction it contains regarding public  institutions and public resources. It is required that the  state's general plan be established with a comprehensive view of  all of society's resources. The cooperative sector should be  included as one of the sectors which, as stipulated by this  article, must be developed and enhanced through the state's  economic policy.    Article 9. It is required to amend this article to make it  compatible with free economic activity so that the government  role will be to tend and encourage rather than to direct and  control, which are incompatible with the principle of free  economy. Free economic activity shouldn't be restricted, unless  it undermines society's interest. The amendment should also  state that monopoly, which is harmful to society, is prohibited.  The amendment should also seek to encourage private capital to  invest in the various areas of economic and social development.    Article 15. It is required to amend this article so as to  make a distinction between contracts on the utilization of  natural resources which, as stipulated by the article, must be  concluded by law, and concession contracts connected with public  utilities. It is difficult to conclude the latter contracts by  law in every case because they take many and varied forms and  because most of them are small contracts, such contracts to  manage rural water projects, a park, or a school cafeteria.  Therefore, the text should state that these contracts shall be  concluded in accordance with the law and not by a law.    In addition to the articles that are required to be amended  in this chapter in the manner demonstrated above, amendment  should also be made through the addition of a number of articles  to Chapter 2 so as to deal with the deficiency from which the  current constitution suffers in a number of important areas  connected with economic components for which no provisions  exists. These amendments should be included in five articles  that deal with the following issues:     -  article...concerning the inviolability and protection of  public property.    -  article...to ban the confiscation of public property and to  require a court decision for the confiscation of private  property.    -  article...on alms tax as one of the resources which the  government must collect and which it must spend for purposes  specified by the shari'ah.    -  article...to underline the inviolability of awqaf [religious  trusts] and to improve their resources and spend them in a  manner that ensures achievement of the objectives and goals of  these trusts as specified by the shari'ah, thus ensuring that  they perform their role in development in accordance with the  shari'ah.  <H5>  Chapter 3 </H5> <H5>  Social and Cultural Fundamentals </H5>   Article 12. Because various provisions of the constitution  state explicitly that numerous relations and activities shall be  regulated by the law, it is extremely important that a provision  be added to this article of the constitution to stipulate that  the law shall regulate unionist and and professional activity  and relations between labor and work owners so as to ensure that  these relations are founded on an economic basis that observes  the rules of social justice.    Because there is an evident deficiency in this chapter  regarding a number of important social components that are  compatible with the principles of Islam and the principles and  objectives of the Yemeni revolution and that reaffirm the noble  values which have been ingrained in the Yemeni society's  conscience throughout its life and development, the constitution  must incorporate and confirm these components in articles that  should be added to this chapter as follows:     -  an article stipulating that the Yemeni society is based on  a social solidarity founded on justice, freedom, and equality;    -  an article on family as the basis of society and on religion,  morals, and love of the country as the mainstays of both family  and society;    -  an article on the government's role in protecting maternity  and  childhood;    -  an article on education, health, and social services as  mainstays of society's structure and progress and on the  government's and society's role in providing them;    -  an article on the role of women in society;    -  an article on natural disasters and general catastrophes and  the need to ensure that the government, in solidarity with  society, shoulders the burdens emanating from them;    -  an article on the government's preservation of historical  antiquities and on cooperation by the citizens with the  government to incriminate those who undermine the inviolability  of antiquities.  <H5>  Chapter 4 </H5> <H5>  Fundamentals of National Defense </H5>   Article 21. So that the ban stated in the text of the  article  on the formation of military or paramilitary organizations by  any circle or group may include political parties and  organizations, it is extremely important to amend the article by  inserting into it an addition to make it state that the ban  includes the formation of any military or para- military  organization by any political party or organization for any  purpose and under any name whatsoever.    Article 25. The subject of amendment in this article should  focus on clearly defining the police's relationship with the  judiciary authority, on eliminating the ambiguity as to who  controls the police, and on requiring the police to adhere to  orders issued to them by the judiciary authority in accordance  with the law.    Article...The national interest dictates that an article be  added to this chapter to underline the armed forces' neutrality  in order to reflect their embodiment of the national unity, to  prevent their exploitation for the interests of any party,  individual, or faction, and to protect them from all forms of  discrimination.  <H6>  Section 2 </H6> <H6>  Citizens' Fundamental Rights and Duties </H6>   The amendment's main tendency in this regard is to replace  some words or phrases over which there has been controversy  because their indications have been understood vaguely by some  people. Because of the confusion created by this vague  understanding and in order to settle the controversy, it is  necessary to replace these words and phrases by other words or  phrases that serve the purpose clearly and in a manner that  leaves no place for ambiguity and that creates no verbal  controversy. The amendments should be as follows:     -  Article 27. It is required to amend this article so that  it will stipulate that all citizens are equal in public rights  and duties and that the state may not discriminate or make  distinctions in human rights because of sex, color, origin,  language, profession, social status, or religion.    -  Article 31. This article should be amended by replacing the  phrase "by law" with the phrase "in accordance with the word  of...." This article should be rephrased so that it will make it  clearly understood that no penal law may be issued with a  retroactive effect.    -  Article 32. It is required to amend this article so as to  eliminate the contradiction in some of its paragraphs, to  achieve a clearer and more realistic definition of the  authorities concerned, to underline the public prosecution's  authority to keep somebody detained for a maximum period of  seven days, and to make the law spell out the maximum duration  of precautionary detention.    -  Article 33. It is required that this article be amended so  that  any ambiguity regarding its intent will be eliminated. Amendment  should be done by rephrasing the article to make it clear that  its intent is to ensure that the execution of penalties is  carried out with proper means and that no laws to the contrary  may be passed.    -  Article 37. It is required to amend this article by adding to  it a provision stating that education shall be compulsory in the  basic phase and that the state shall exert efforts to eliminate  illiteracy and to expand technical and vocational education.    In a related area, some provisions must be added to some  articles of this section of the constitution in order to fill  the gap it contains and to underline a number of the citizen's  fundamental rights that haven't been stipulated by this  constitution and that are no less important than the right to  education, which is stipulated by the constitution.    These rights must be stipulated by amendments that add to  this Section 4 articles that cover the following:     -  an article that ensures the right to defense directly or  indirectly throughout the phases of interrogation and litigation  before all courts and that makes certain that the state provides  legal aid to those who are financially incapable;    -  an article on the right of all citizens to health care--an  article that calls for a law to regulate the medical profession,  for expanding free medical services, and for spreading health  awareness;    -  an article to ensure that the government provides the  citizens  with social guarantees in cases of sickness, disability,  unemployment, and old age, as well as guarantees for martyrs'  families;    -  an article on the citizens' right to vote, to run for  election,  and to express their opinion in referendums. The law should  regulate the rules governing the exercise of this right.    Considering that this chapter is concerned in the first  place  with the citizens' fundamental rights and duties and that the  constitution has failed to define the citizens' fundamental  duties in this same section, amendment should be made by adding  three articles on the following:     -  an article on the duty to pay taxes and public costs in  accordance with the law;    -  an article on the duty to perform the national defense  service  [military service], which is regulated by the law;    -  an article on the duty to preserve national unity, to protect  state secrets, and to respect laws and abide by their provisions.  <H6>  Section 3 </H6> <H6>  Regulation of State Authority </H6>   It is important to point out that the title of this section  as it is currently found in the constitution has the word state  "authority" and not state "authorities." This section  incorporates four chapters that regulate the state authorities,  which are embodied in the House of Representatives, the  Presidential Council, the Council of Ministers, and local  government agencies. The section does not include the powers of  the judiciary authority as one of the state's three main  authorities. Rather, a separate section, namely Section 4 which  is entitled "The Judiciary and Public Prosecution," has been set  aside for this authority under a title which gives the  impression that it is no more than a service utility. It is  evident from this that Section 3 regulates several state  authorities and not just one authority, as implied by its  current title. Moreover, the provisions concerning the judiciary  are listed in Section 4, which means that this authority is not  considered one of the state authorities. This position clearly  reflects the totalitarian conditions and concepts which existed  under the partitioned Yemen and which did not acknowledge the  principle of plurality of powers and of their separation. There  is no doubt that this position has reflected negatively on the  content of a number of the constitutional provisions, especially  in this regard, considering that these provisions are either  vague, two-sided, or deficient. This is a normal outcome of the  balancing approach which governed the method that was used to  draft the constitution under the conditions of a partitioned  Yemen. Were it not for the collective sense of national  responsibility which the entire political leadership has  displayed in dealing with state affairs and with the  authorities' relations with each other, numerous dangers and  crisis would have surfaced and it would have been difficult to  obviate their consequences and ramifications. This is one of the  fundamental motives and justifications for the endeavor to amend  the constitution. The constitutional provisions regulating the  state authorities must be clear and specific in a manner that  does not permit duality in powers and authorities and that does  not allow the undermining of one authority vis-a-vis the other  authorities. These provisions must leave no place for the  inability to determine accountability or to prevent overlapping  in the authorities' exercise of their powers so they can make it  easy to determine the areas of integration or cooperation  between the authorities. Obviation of the negatives existing in  the constitutional provisions and the likely future perils of  these negatives cannot be just left up to the patriotism of the  people in charge of the various authorities and to their assumed  wisdom in dealing with issues. It is a national duty to draft  constitutional provisions that regulate the state authorities  precisely so that we can have a firm and clear base for the  future; can ensure, cement, and protect the country's gains; and  can move forward with firm steps to achieve our people's  legitimate aspirations.    Before we deal with the main amendment tendencies concerning  each chapter of this section separately and before we tackle the  articles that need to be amended, which will be listed later, we  will review briefly here the structural composition of the state  institutions which the amendment seeks to establish so that  components of Section 3 will be as follows:  <H5>  Chapter 1 </H5> <H5>  Legislative Authority: House of Representatives </H5>   Article 40. The amendment listed for this article is as  follows:    1. The word "approve" should replace the word "decide"  because this is compatible with the house jurisdiction,  considering that the word "decide" signifies drafting and  preparing more than it signifies giving approval.    2. The word "guidance," which precedes the phrase "and  control" should be abolished, considering that the House of  Representatives is concerned with legislation and control. The  constitution defines the means of constitutional control to  which the house is entitled and which are embodied in:  ratification of treaties and agreements (Article 48); approval  of the state's final account (Article 49); approval of the state  budget (Article 50); approval of the transfer of any sum of  money from one section of the general budget to another and of  any expenditure not listed in the budget or exceeding the  estimates (Article 51); approval of the law which determines  provisions of the public establishments and organizations  budget, of their accounts, and of the independent budgets and  their final accounts (Article 52); and the right to offer  directions, meaning recommendations, to the government on public  issues. It is then the government's duty to explain to the house  why it cannot implement the recommendations, if it cannot  implement them (Article 68).    The house is entitled, if 20 percent of its members so  request, to hold a general debate and to query the government  policy on any public issue and to exchange ideas on it (Article  69). The house is also entitled to form a special fact-finding  committee or to assign one of its committees as a fact-finding  committee to investigate issues in numerous areas and with broad  powers (Article 70). The house is also empowered to approve  public economic and social development plans by a law. At the  same time, the house passes the law that defines how plans shall  be drafted and presented to it (Article 71). On top of all of  this, the house grants the government the vote of confidence  (Article 72) and is entitled to withdraw it from the government  (Article 73). The house is also empowered to refer the prime  minister, his deputies, and ministers to the courts (Article  111). Every house member is entitled, moreover, to query and  question [the government] and to propose laws and law  amendments. All these are constitutional control instruments.  Even if a small part of them is used well, it will be beneficial  to the country, the people, and the country. This is why it is  better not to keep the word "guidance" or to cling to it. Its  presence serves no purpose. All this word does is arouse futile  debate and conflicting ideas that contradict the constitutional  structure and the principle of the separation of powers.    Article 42. The amendment listed for this article is as  follows:    1. Provision (3) of Paragraph (B), which merely stipulates  that a candidate running for election to the House of  Representatives shall not be illiterate, must be replaced by the  requirement that a candidate must master reading and writing so  that the house can achieve greater efficiency.    2. Add to the prerequisites the requirement that a candidate  running for election to the House of Representatives must  observe the religious rites and must not have been convicted of  the crime of violating honor and trust, unless rehabilitated.  The objective is to underline the important aspects of good  conduct and behavior and to encourage those who wish to run for  election to the house to behave accordingly.    Article 46. It is required to amend this article so as end  dual jurisdiction over election disputations, listed as  jurisdiction that belongs to the Supreme Court. This amendment  should be made by either abolishing the article or by rephrasing  it.    Article 48. It is required to amend this article by  rephrasing it to define clearly and precisely the issues which  have to be approved by the House of Representatives so as to  steer away from the inapplicable generalization of the current  article. What should be approved by the House of Representatives  are: treaties and agreements connected with defense, alliances,  peace, or border modification; treaties and agreements that  result in financial obligations to the state; and treaties and  agreements which require that a law be issued for their  implementation.  <H5>  [13 Sep, p 6] </H5>   [Text] Following are the main tendencies of the amendment  needed for each chapter of this section separately, according to  the classification noted above, as well as the articles required  to be amended within each chapter:  <H6>  Section 3 </H6> <H6>  Regulation of State Authorities </H6> <H5>  Chapter 1 </H5> <H5>  Legislative Authority: House of Representatives </H5>   Article 40. The amendment listed for this article is the  following:    1. The word "approve" should replace the word "decide"  because this word is compatible with the house jurisdiction,  considering that the word "decide" signifies drafting and  preparing more than it signifies just approval.    2. The word "guidance," which precedes the phrase "and  control," should be abolished, considering that the House of  Representatives is concerned with legislation and control. The  constitution defines the means of constitutional control to  which the house is entitled and which are embodied in:  ratification of treaties and agreements (Article 48); approval  of the state's final account (Article 49); approval of the state  budget (Article 50); approval of the transfer of any sum of  money from one section of the general budget to another and  approval of any expenditure not listed in the budget or  exceeding the estimates (Article 51); approval of the law which  determines provisions of the budget of public establishments and  organizations, approval of these organizations' accounts, and  approval of independent budgets and their final accounts  (Article 52); and the right to offer directions, meaning  recommendations, to the government on public issues. It is the  government's duty to explain to the house why it cannot  implement the recommendations, if it cannot recommend them  (Article 68).    The house is entitled, if 20 percent of its member so  request, to hold a general debate and to query the government  policy on any public issue and to exchange views on such a  policy (Article 69). The house is also entitled to form a  fact-finding committee or to assign one of its committees to  investigate issues in numerous areas and with broad powers  (Article 70). The house is, moreover, empowered to approve  public economic and social development plans by law. At the same  time, the house passes the law that determines how plans shall  be drafted and presented to it (Article 71). On top of all of  this, the House of Representatives grants the government its  vote of confidence (Article 72), and it is entitled to withdraw  this confidence from the government (Article 73). The house is  empowered to refer the prime minister, his deputies, and  ministers to the courts (Article 111). Every house member is  entitled, moreover, to question and query and to propose laws  and law amendments. All these are constitutional control  instruments. Even if a small part of them is used well, it will  be beneficial to the country and the people. This is why it is  better not to keep the word "guidance" or to cling to it. Its  presence serves no purpose. All this word does is arouse futile  debate and conflicting ideas that contradict the constitutional  structure and the principle of the separation of powers.    Article 42. The amendment listed for this article is as  follows:    1. Provision (3) of Paragraph B, which merely stipulates  that  a candidate running for election to the House of Representatives  shall not be illiterate, must be replaced by the requirement  that a candidate must master reading and writing so that the  house can achieve greater efficiency.    2. Add to the prerequisites the requirement that a candidate  running for election to the House of Representatives must  observe the religious rites and that he must not have been  convicted of the crime of violating honor and trust, unless  rehabilitated. The objective is to underline the important  aspects of good conduct and behavior and to encourage those who  wish to run for election to the house to behave accordingly.    Article 46. It is required to amend this article so as to  end  the dual jurisdiction over election disputations, listed as  jurisdiction belonging to the the Supreme Court. This amendment  should be achieved by either abolishing the article or by  rephrasing it.    Article 48. It is required to amend this article by  rephrasing it to define clearly and precisely issues which have  to be approved by the House of Representatives so as to steer  away from the inapplicable generalizations of this article. What  should be approved by the House of Representatives are: treaties  and agreements connected with defense, alliances, peace, or  border modification; treaties and agreements that result in  financial obligations to the state; and treaties and agreements  which require that a law be issued for their implementation.    Article 50. The amendment listed for this article is purely  formal. It calls for dividing the article into two paragraphs,  making the final sentence of the article an independent  paragraph, listed as paragraph B. What precedes this paragraph  will be listed under paragraph A. This is because even though  the final sentence is short, it encompasses several important  provisions that are distinctive from the rest of the article.    Article 52. The amendment listed for this article calls for  adding the word "otherwise" before the phrase "shall be subject  to the provisions...." The purpose is to phrase this article  precisely. The fact that this word is missing in the article  negates the justification for the entire article because the  main purpose of this article is to have the law establish  special provisions for the budgets and accounts of public  authorities and establishments, and for independent and attached  budgets and their final accounts. This is what justifies  creating these authorities and establishments and making them  financial accountability independent of that of the state. The  provisions governing the general budget and its final account  will thus become the general rule where no special provisions  exist.    Article 54. The amendment listed for this article seeks an  effective structure of the house leadership by stipulating that  this leadership should consist of a speaker and three  representatives who constitute the House of Representatives  Office. The amendment also stipulates that the house shall have  a general secretariat headed by a general secretary, provided  that the house bylaws spell out the provisions concerning  formation of the secretariat and other related provisions.    Article 57. The amendment listed for this article seeks to  ensure complete clarity and absence of duality regarding  convocation of the house's ordinary and special sessions. It  stipulates that the house shall convene two ordinary sessions.  It makes it permissible, meanwhile, for the house to convene  special sessions on a decree issued by the president at his own  wish or in response to the written request of the house office  or of one third the house membership. It also stipulates that  the session convened in the final quarter of the year shall not  be adjourned until the general state budget is passed. This  determination is very important for making the house efficient,  considering that the current text is deficient and that past  experience convinces one that this amendment is necessary.    Article 66. To ensure that the House of Representatives  member is effective and that the house membership rises to the  level of the house's immense responsibility and the level of the  voters' good opinion of the house, the amendment listed for this  article focuses on making a member's serious violation of his  membership duties, as defined by the house bylaws, a reason that  makes it permissible to drop his membership. One should keep in  mind that the constitution empowers the house to draft its  bylaws in accordance with the text of Article 45 of the  constitution.    Article 67. The amendment listed for this article seeks the  following:    1. Omit the power granted to unions and mass organizations  to  propose, through their representatives, draft laws or law  amendments because this is in violation of the character of the  House of Representatives member as a general representative of  all the people and because this stipulation is incompatible with  the reality, considering that there are no House of  Representatives members who represent unions of specific  organizations directly.    2. To ensure that no bills to increase, abolish, or reduce  taxes, to lower some taxes, or to allocate a part of the state  funds for a certain project are initiated, the amendment  requires that such such bills be presented by the government or  by one-fourth the house members. For further clarity, the  phrasing should be amended to state explicitly that a law  proposal may be submitted by one or more members of the House of  Representatives.    Article 68. It is required to amend this bill by replacing  the word "directives," which occurs twice in the article, by the  word "recommendations" because the word recommendations is  compatible with the principle of the separation of powers that  is founded on cooperation and integration. The purpose is to  eliminate the word "directives" as a cause of controversy over  whether the word signifies or does not signify the separation of  powers. If the word "directives" is understood to be binding,  then it means that there is no separation of powers. Such an  understanding is incompatible with the powers and other control  instruments granted to the house but is compatible with the  totalitarian system, as we have pointed out in connection with  the amendment concerning Article 40.    Article 72. It is required to amend this article by adding  to  it a phrase that clarifies what is meant by the phrase  "government program," which is mentioned in the text of the  article, and to eliminate the ambiguity engulfing this program.  The phrase that is required to be added is "which defines the  broad lines of the domestic and foreign policy." To eliminate  any future ambiguity or controversy, the word "program" should  replace the word "statement" which occurs in the article.    Article 77. The majority of the provisions of this article  repeat provisions already stated in Article 55 of the  constitution. It is required to rephrase this article so that  this repetition will be eliminated. The amendment should also  state that a final vote shall be taken on every draft law and  that the house bylaws shall determine the relevant procedures.    Article 78. The amendment seeks to fill the gap existing in  the article regarding the practical procedures that have to be  established in case it is planned to dissolve the house--such as  procedures that set the period during which elections have to be  held and that suspend house sessions until results of the next  election appear. It is very important to regulate these aspects  so that lack of provision will not be a cause for offhandedness  or conflict.    In a related area, the amendment needed for this article  should not require that the cabinet resign before an election  because the election is supervised by an independent and neutral  committee, namely the Higher Election Committee. The cabinet has  no role in the election.    Article 79. The amendment focuses on adding a provision on  the consequence of the president's nonpromulgation of a law when  the constitutional period for the president to return the law to  the house has expired or when a law has been returned to the  house and passed again. The consequence should be that the law  has been issued by the force of the constitution without the  need for it to be promulgated. The law should be published in  the Official Gazette immediately and should be enacted two weeks  after its publication.    (Added) article. To eliminate any confusion regarding the  permissibility or impermissibility of combining House of  Representatives membership with other jobs, it is proposed that  an amendment be made in this regard by adding an article that  incorporates contents of the provision stipulated in the current  general election law. The added article should read as follows:    Article...on...It is impermissible to combine House of  Representatives membership with membership in a local council or  with any public job. As an exception, it is permissible to  combine House of Representatives membership with cabinet  membership.  <H5>  Chapter 2 </H5> <H5>  Executive Authority </H5>   The executive authority consists of the presidency and the  government. Because the president of the republic is the head of  state and the top of the executive authority at the same time,  this chapter will be divided into two branches: the first is the  presidency of the republic and the second is the government.  <H5>  First Branch </H5> <H5>  Presidency of the Republic </H5>   Determining the shape of the presidency is one of the most  important issues with which amendment must deal as part of the  effort to organize the state authorities in a manner which  ensures ideal stability that agrees with the givens of the age,  that is compatible with the real situation, and that is in  harmony with the human experience.    In accordance with the constitution, the presidency of the  state is currently based on the principle of collective  leadership, which is embodied in the Presidential Council. This  principle, like others contained in the constitution, reflects  the political, cultural, and social environment which was  created and defined by the extraordinary factors and conditions  of a partitioned Yemen under which the constitution was drafted.  The principle of collective leadership or of partnership in the  presidency of the state was one of the compromises made at the  time to overcome those conditions. It was a compromise made from  the perspective of serving the conflicting political and  organizational positions and tendencies of the two previous  regimes, not from the perspective of what is dictated by the  national interest and what embodies unity of the Yemeni people,  thus making the presidency of the state harmonious with the  people's unity and with democracy.    Now that the people's great historical dream of regaining  their unity has been accomplished; in light of the important  national and foreign transformations and changes that  materialized since creation of the blessed Republic of Yemen,  changes and transformations that are different in form and  essence from the circumstances and conditions under which the  constitution was drafted; and to strengthen the mainstays of  unity and stability, the current form of presidency of the state  must be reexamined and restructured so that the powers of the  presidency, i.e., the "head of state," will be exercised by the  president of the republic and so that the president will have a  vice president. This means a change from collective leadership  of the presidency of the republic, which is embodied in the  Presidential Council, to another form that has prevailed in the  world throughout history and in today's world, namely the form  of president of the republic.    Organizing the presidency of the republic in the manner  proposed above accomplishes numerous positives and eliminates  all the faults and negatives associated with the collective  leadership method. The most important justifications and  considerations confirming and clarifying the soundness of  adopting the proposed form of presidency can be summed up as  follows:    1. It embodies the principle of national unity, represented  in the president of the republic who symbolizes unity of the  country, its sovereignty, and its independence. This is the  system prevailing in today's world as a result of the human  experience generally.    2. This form is compatible with the special characteristics  of the Yemeni society which does not have a multiplicity of  ethnic groups which, when they exist, are careful to be  represented in a collective council.    3. As a general rule, management of the state by the  collective leadership system is unsuccessful because it is  engulfed in numerous negatives that weaken the movement of the  country's higher political and economic leadership. The most  significant of these negatives are:    A. The indifference and dependence that prevail in the  collective leadership's exercise of jurisdiction and powers  connected with the presidency of the state, the subsequent  weakness at the control and execution level, and the negligence  of numerous important issues.    B. The difference of visions and ideas for dealing with  issues--a difference which reflects itself in the decisionmaking  process.    C. Complexity of the collective leadership's work system and  its negative impact on prompt decision making, especially on  issues and subjects that cannot be delayed.    D. The multiplicity, confusion, and contradiction of  directives issued by the collective leadership members, and the  subsequent confusion they cause the administrative process.    E. A collective leadership's members often stay on the  peripheries of a productive practical life and far from action  in the central executive authority because of their equal status  as collective leadership members and because they are tied down,  at the same time, by regular meetings.    In light of the above, it is necessary to rephrase and  reorganize articles of the second chapter that need to be  amended in a manner compatible with the fundamental tendencies  of the proposed amendments for the first branch of Chapter 2.    It is also normal that when the required amendment  concerning  the form of presidency of the state is passed, the phrase  "presidential council" will be automatically replaced by the  phrase "president of the republic" wherever it occurs in the  constitution. In the article concerning the vice president, it  should be stipulated that the provisions of Articles 85, 86, 88,  89, 90, 92, 93, and 101 will be applied in this regard.    Following are the articles required to be amended:    Article 82. It should be amended to read that the presidency  of the republic, i.e., "chairmanship of the state, shall be  exercised by the president of the republic, who is the head of  state and who shall be elected in accordance with the  constitution. The president shall have a vice president, shall  select his vice president, and shall announce his name so he  will be known before the general presidential election is held.    Article 83. It should be amended so that nomination of the  candidates for president and vice president will be as follows:    1. The president of the republic shall be elected by the  people in a competitive election.    2. Nominations shall be presented to the House of  Representatives.    3. Nominations shall be examined by the House of  Representatives speakership to make sure that candidates meet  the constitutional prerequisites.    4. The names of candidates who meet the prerequisites shall  be submitted to the House of Representatives for approval.    5. Any nominee gaining the approval of 10 percent of the  House of Representatives shall be considered a candidate for  presidency of the republic.    6. To ensure that the election is competitive, the House of  Representatives shall be required to name at least two persons  to run for the position of president of the republic prior to  presenting the candidates to the people for a competitive  election.    7. The candidate gaining an absolute majority of the votes  of  those who take part in the election shall be the president of  the republic. If no candidate gains such a majority, both  nomination and election shall be repeated in accordance with the  aforementioned procedures.    Article 84. It should be amended to state that the president  of the republic shall work to underline the people's  sovereignty, to respect the constitution and supremacy of the  law, to protect national unity and the principles of the Yemeni  revolution, to tend the peaceful rotation of power, and to  establish the bounds for the various authorities so as to ensure  that they perform their roles.    Article 85. It should be amended to state that every Yemeni  who meets the established prerequisites is fit and entitled to  run for election to the position of president of the republic.  An amendment should be made to require that a candidate's  [minimum] age must be 40 and that a candidate must not be  married to a foreigner, must not marry a foreigner during his  term, must be of upright conduct and character, and must observe  the religious rites.    Article 87. It should be amended by adding to it a provision  that limits the president and the vice president to just two  five-year terms.    Article 91. It should be amended by adding to it a provision  stating that the vice president shall replace the president for  a period of no more than 60 days in case the president's  position becomes vacant. New presidential elections should be  held during the aforementioned period. In case the vice  president's position becomes vacant, the president should select  a vice president and submit his name to the House of  Representatives for approval.    Article 98. It should be amended with a provision which  states that the president and the vice president shall exercise  the executive power on behalf of the people within the bounds  stipulated by the constitution. The amendment is required to  fill a noticeable deficiency in this regard and because the  justification for the existing provision that concerns the form  of the presidency will have ended, considering that it is  proposed to amend this form.    Article 99. It should be amended to state that the president  of the republic is the supreme commander of the armed forces.  This amendment is required in order to fill a noticeable  deficiency in this regard, considering that this command is  underlined in the National Defense Council law and the military  service law and that this provision is a given in the various  constitutional systems.    In addition to the articles in this chapter that need to be  amended in the aforementioned manner, whether in content or form  or whether by replacement, the public interest dictates that the  following three articles be added to this chapter:    Article...The president shall be assisted in his duties by  the vice president, and he may delegate some of his powers to  the vice president.    Article...An advisory council comprised of experts and  specialized capabilities shall be formed to expand the base of  participation with opinion and to organize utilization of the  accumulated national capabilities and expertise. The law shall  determine the provisions concerning the council.    An article to prevent carrying out death sentences, unless  approved by the president of the republic: The president of the  republic shall be empowered (except in cases of religious  punishment) to pardon or reduce the punishment. A general  amnesty shall be by law only.    All constitutions agree to tie this provision, which  requires  the president's approval for the execution of a death sentence,  to the head of state. The same thing applies to tying a general  amnesty to the law.  <H5>  Second Branch </H5> <H5>  The Government (Council of Ministers) </H5>   In the skeletal structure of state authorities, the  government represents the second branch of the executive  authority. This is its normal status. The provisions concerning  the government are listed in Chapter 3 of the constitution. This  gives the impression that the government is an authority that is  far from the state presidency whereas most articles of the  various chapters of the constitution contain explicit and  specific provisions concerning the status of the government as a  higher state executive and administrative authority. The  president of the republic supervises the formation of this  authority and its performance of its duties; controls its  activities; and brings its members to account. This authority is  also subject to the control of and accountable before the House  of Representatives. According to the structure of state  authorities that has just been presented, inclusion of the  provisions pertaining to the government in a branch within the  chapter on the executive authority will set matters right, will  accomplish the required clarity in the structure of the  constitutional institutions, and will regulate relations between  these institutions.    The above reflects the main tendency concerning  classification and the indications emanating from  classification. As for articles that are required to be amended  within the framework of this branch, they are the following:    Article 103. The constitution is the law which defines  fundamentally the powers of the Council of Ministers, the prime  minister, and the ministers. Therefore, there is no place for a  special law to define these powers. However, there is nothing to  prevent laws from stipulating that special tasks or powers may  be assigned to the Council of Minister, the prime minister, or  the ministers, depending on the nature of the issues with which  each law deals separately and on what is dictated by the nature  of the activity exercised by each minister. It is extremely  difficult for one law to encompass the powers of the ministers  that are scattered in various laws. But on the other hand, it is  logical that the law should spell out the general rules for  organizing cabinet ministries, the various state agencies, and  public establishments and companies. But to define the powers of  cabinet ministries and their outfits by law is extremely  difficult. It is difficult practically and in terms of the sound  concept of administrative reform and of what is dictated by the  science of administration. This science requires reasonable  flexibility in organization and modernization, which are  tantamount to an ongoing and ever-renewed process that is  governed by the general organizational principles determined by  the law. Therefore, the required amendment dictates that the  legislator be content with ensuring that the law defines the  general principles of organization, including the criteria and  controls that must be observed in organizing the cabinet  ministries, establishments, and other administrative divisions.  The law must also define the other legislative instruments with  which this administrative division is accomplished.    Article 111. This article should be rephrased to ensure that  the House of Representatives is empowered to refer the prime  minister, his deputies, the ministers, or their deputies to  interrogation and trial instead of being empowered to just  recommend such referral and trial. The amendment should also  make clear the natural sequence of the relevant procedures.    Article 113. It should be amended to empower the prime  minister to ask the president of the republic to relieve a  minister with whom the prime minister deems it impossible to  cooperate. This would replace the provision stipulating that the  prime minister merely refer the matter to the president to  determine what he deems fit. Thus, discipline will be achieved  at the cabinet level.    Article 114. It should be amended by adding to it that in  case the House of Representatives withholds and withdraws  confidence from the cabinet and in case a new general House of  Representatives election is held, then the prime minister must  submit his cabinet's resignation to the president of the  republic.    Article...It is required to add an amendment to this branch  to define the prerequisites a cabinet minister has to meet, the  same as in the case of house members, bearing in mind that a  cabinet member may not be less than 30 years old.  <H5>  Third Branch </H5> <H5>  Local Government Agencies </H5>   The main amendment tendencies in this connection--in  addition  to the new classification which will put this authority under  the Third Branch instead of Chapter 4, thus making it harmonious  with the aforementioned skeletal structure of the constitutional  institutions-- focus on adding some provisions to fill the  deficiencies in some aspects and to expand the powers of local  councils, considering that they are an indivisible part of the  state authority. The amendment tendencies also focus on  rearranging some paragraphs within the articles of this chapter  as follows:    Article 117. It should be amended by adding to it a  provision  so the law will indicate how the heads of administrative units  are selected and so it will state on what scientific principles  and criteria administrative division is founded. Two paragraphs  in this article should be transferred to Article 119.    Article 118. It should be amended to state clearly that  governorate and district councils shall be elected in a general  and free direct referendum. The amendment should also expand  these councils' powers in the areas of public services, of  proposing programs, plans, and budgets for the administrative  unit, and of supervising and bringing to account local  government agencies in accordance with the law. The amendment  should also adopt decentralized administration as a basis for  the local government system.    Article 119. It should be amended by adding to its beginning  some provisions transferred from Article 119 because this would  be the natural place for these provisions. The phrase "president  of the republic" should be added next to the phrase "Council of  Ministers" in connection with the accountability of governors.    Article...An amendment is required by adding an article to  this branch on promoting and nurturing cooperative development  bodies in the administrative units, considering that they are  among the most important instruments of local development.  <H5>  Chapter 3 </H5> <H5>  The Judiciary Authority </H5>   In harmony with the main amendment tendencies that seek to  clarify the skeletal structure of the constitutional state  institutions, amendment seems to be most urgently needed in the  judiciary authority, whether in terms of classification or of  the name under which the judiciary authority is listed. It is  noticed that in the current classification of the constitution,  the judiciary authority is not considered one of the state  authorities included in Section 3. A subsequent section, i.e.,  Section 4, has been set aside for this authority. This  classification gives the impression that this authority is just  a service utility. The title of this section, namely, "The  Judiciary and Public Prosecution," creates confusion. Therefore,  the normal thing is to classify the articles governing the  judiciary authority under Section 3. In the new tendency, this  section is entitled "Organization of the State Authorities."  Chapter 3 of this section should be devoted to this authority  and should be entitled "The Judiciary Authority." On the one  hand, this title is compatible with the conventional well-known  division of state authorities and, on the other hand, it  eliminates the confusion created by the current title in  connection with the judiciary authority's unity.    In addition to the aforementioned amendment concerning  classification and title, the main amendment tendencies focus on  achieving greater guarantees of independence for the judiciary  and on eliminating the duality and overlapping connected with  supervision over the judiciary, as well as the subsequent  negatives emanating from this duality and overlapping. These  guarantees are achieved as follows:    Article 120. It should be amended to stipulate that courts  shall have the power to settle all disputes. It should also  state explicitly that it is not permissible to grant judiciary  powers to any authorities other than the courts, thus  reinforcing the original provision in Article 121 which  prohibits setting up special courts under any circumstances.    Article 123. It should be amended to strengthen the  judiciary's independence by granting the Supreme Judiciary  Council the power to study and pass the judiciary budget prior  to its inclusion as one figure in the state's general budget.    Article 124. It should be amended in a manner that does not  undermine the judiciary's unity by providing for the presence of  a single supreme court in the republic. But this should not  prevent the presence of specialized courts, including  administrative courts which are specialized in settling  administrative disputes and disciplinary court cases, in order  to ensure the supremacy of the principle of legitimacy and to  emphasize judiciary control over the administration's activities.    To safeguard this [control], the required amendment should  include the Supreme Court's powers, adding to them the power to  interpret laws and to try the president of the republic, the  vice president, the prime minister and his deputies, and the  ministers and their deputies.    The numbers used to enumerate paragraphs shall be replaced  by  letters of the alphabet so as to make them compatible with the  various articles of the constitution. Paragraph 3 formerly C in  the proposed amendment, on election disputations shall be  amended to ensure that its objective is achieved and that  duality of power over these disputations will be eliminated.  <H6>  Section 5 </H6> <H6>  Principles of Constitutional Amendment and General Rules </H6>   In light of the aforementioned proposal to amend the  classification concerning the judiciary authority so that it  will be covered by an independent chapter in Section 3--which  governs the organization of state authorities--instead of being  covered, as it is currently, by provisions in Section 4, future  amendment will change this condition, turning Section 5 into  Section 4 and Section 6 into Section 5. This is a part of the  main amendment tendencies in the area of form.    Article 129. The main tendency of the principles of  constitutional amendment focuses on providing greater protection  for the constitution and for tying any future amendment of the  constitution or of its provisions to the people. The amendment  will add a provision that states that the issue of amendment of  the constitution shall be presented to the people under all  circumstances so as to get their approval of such amendment  through a general popular referendum. Thus, no amendment will  become valid unless it gains the approval of the majority of the  citizens who take part in the referendum and who are included in  the voter lists. This important addition has its roots in the  need to refer to the people for amendment of the constitution  which was approved by a popular referendum. Therefore, amendment  should be made with the same legislative instrument with which  the original constitution was approved, namely public referendum.    Article...It is required to include a transitional provision  concerning the president of the republic and his vice president  in this section to stipulate that when this amendment is passed  by the House of Representatives, the president will be elected  by the house just once after the approval. Candidates for the  position of president should be nominated by one-fourth the  house members.    A candidate who gains the majority of the house votes will  be  the president. This should be done because of the lack of time  and out of consideration for the citizens who were summoned to  vote in a general election only recently.    Article...an article should be added to state that an  independent and impartial higher committee shall supervise and  control general elections and referendums. It should also  stipulate that the law will determine how this committee is  formed and appointed, what its powers are, and what  prerequisites have to be met by its members.    Article 130. It must be abolished because of the  partitionist  traces it reflects and because there is no need for it now that  the transitional period has ended, considering all the laws that  were passed during this period.    Article 131. It should be amended by adding the phrase "I  will adhere to the Koran and to His apostle's sunna" at the  beginning of the constitutional oath out of harmony with the  people's Islamic faith.</p>

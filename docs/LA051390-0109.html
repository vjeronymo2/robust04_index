			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON CRIME AND PUNISHMENT;  </P> <P> ALTERNATIVES TO PRISON SUIT CONSERVATIVE AIMS  </P> <P> Michigan Gov. James Blanchard says that his state will not build any more  prisons after 1992, when the current $900-million, 27-prison construction  project is scheduled to be completed.  </P> <P> It is not that Blanchard is growing "soft on crime." The state simply can no  longer afford the cost. Instead, Blanchard told a conference of the newly  created Office of Community Corrections, he will be counting on local  communities to place nonviolent, non-dangerous petty criminals in alternative  programs.  </P> <P> "We can't afford to send a five-time shoplifter to Jackson Prison," said  Blanchard, who said he believes that keeping nonviolent criminals in local  punishment programs will be the trend for the 1990s.  </P> <P> According to growth projections by the Michigan Department of Corrections, the  already overcrowded state prison system (more than 22,000 are now locked up) is  expected to top 50,000 by Jan. 1, 1993.  </P> <P> Nearly 53% of Michigan inmates are in prison for non-assaultive offenses.  Nationally, 34% of all state prison inmates have never been convicted of  violent crimes, according to Justice Department statistics. It costs $20,000 a  year to keep someone in prison and, like everything else, the costs continue to  rise.  </P> <P> The national recidivism rate remains above 80%. The prison system does little  but train and harden criminals to commit more crimes. But alternative sentences  for those who are not violent have proved remarkably successful where they have  been tried.  </P> <P> In Georgia, only 16% of all participants in the state's intensive supervision  probation (ISP) program are rearrested within 18 months of completing the  program. In New Jersey, only 8%. In Illinois, it's 5%.  </P> <P> The ISP program saves Georgia $10,000 per offender per year compared to  imprisonment. In New Jersey, the annual savings per offender is $11,000 and in  Illinois, $13,000.  </P> <P> When restitution is included as part of the punishment, the results are even  more startling, and rightly so.  </P> <P> If I steal your car and wreck, it might make you feel good to know that I am  sitting in jail, but your insurance rates will go up and your taxes, too, to  pay for my time in prison.  </P> <P> Wouldn't it make more sense if I was forced to work to pay you back, thus  keeping insurance rates stable and not further burdening the taxpayers?  Restitution also provides an important link between the criminal and the victim  which is itself rehabilitative.  </P> <P> The way to place alternative sentencing proposals on the fast track is for some  conservative politicians to get behind them. Alternative sentences for  nonviolent offenders is a way of getting tough on crime by reducing crime. It  is also a way of holding the line on taxes, another conservative goal. With  alternative sentencing, everybody wins. It's the ideal issue.  </P></p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / International Company News: Credit Suisse downgraded CREDIT Suisse, a unit of CS Holding, said it was not worried by the downgrading of its long-term debt by Moody's Investors Service and was sure its long-term strategy would maintain the group's strength, Reuter reports from Zurich. The US credit rating agency said it had cut the long-term deposits and guaranteed senior Eurodebt of Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse Financial Products to Aa2 from Aa1. It added that it had done so because the Volksbank takeover earlier this year would have an adverse impact on the consolidated asset quality of the CS Holding group.</p>

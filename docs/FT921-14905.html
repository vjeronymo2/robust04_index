			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Outhwaite 'should have known of crisis' LLOYD'S of London underwriter Mr Richard Outhwaite should have known that the insurance of US asbestos liabilities was 'a potential problem of enormous magnitude', the High Court was told yesterday by another underwriter. Mr Outhwaite is at the centre of a civil action brought by 987 members of Lloyd's syndicate 317/661 managed by RHM Outhwaite Underwriting Agencies. The members allege that the negligence of the agency and 81 other underwriting agencies in placing them with Mr Outhwaite's syndicate was responsible for insurance losses of more than Pounds 200m. The court heard evidence from Lloyd's underwriter Mr Peter Wingett who said the insurance market had had plenty of warning about the asbestosis crisis of the early 1980s. He said: 'Articles appearing in the press . . . were making it very clear that we had a tip-of-the-iceberg situation. It was an extremely volatile situation.' Defence counsel Mr Jonathan Playford said Mr Wingett was acting in hindsight. The case continues today.</p>

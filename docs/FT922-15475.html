			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Bonds: Norway and Abbey National launch ambitious deals TWO bold new issues finally broke a period of drought in the international bond market, with Norway and Abbey National launching substantial benchmark deals. Norway came with a Dollars 1bn five-year offering, lead-managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets, which underwrote around 60 per cent of the deal. The 7 1/4 per cent paper was priced to yield 25 basis points more than US Treasury bonds, a level seen as fair by market participants. Demand for Eurodollar bonds remains lacklustre and the deal was seen as ambitious in scale by underwriting firms. Some said that only 55 per cent of the bonds had been placed with investors by the end of the day; others estimated up to 80 per cent of the paper was firmly in the hands of investors. Against this, Norway's earlier Dollars 1bn five-year Eurodollar issue was launched in November last year to yield 28 basis points more than US Treasuries and was yesterday trading at a yield spread of 12 to 15 basis points. The good performance of the earlier deal had encouraged investors to buy new bonds, syndicate officials said. Buying was reported from central banks, which are mostly restricted to buying large, sovereign bond issues. Many firms also saw interest from institutional investors in Asia. The paper was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.58, and by the close of trading in London was quoted by the lead manager at 99.65 bid, for a yield spread of 26 basis points over US government bonds. In the afternoon, Abbey National surprised the market with a Pounds 250m five-year issue, wholly underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The 10 1/2 per cent bonds were priced to yield 30 basis points more than UK government bonds, seen as aggressive by many market participants. However, BZW said that it had identified firm demand for the bonds - including demand from a specialist investor requiring a sterling asset to back a structured financing. The issue follows recent 25-year and 10-year subordinated Eurosterling issues by Abbey National. Mr Gareth Jones, treasurer, said that the creation of liquid benchmarks would ease Abbey National's path to the sterling bond market in future. The paper was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.498, a level held by BZW until the close of trading. Prudential Funding Corporation, the funding subsidiary of the US insurance company, launched a CDollars 125m five-year issue, lead-managed by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The retail-targetted paper was designed to attract investors with maturing Canadian dollar bonds and a positive view of the outlook for the currency. The 9 1/8 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.625, for a yield spread of 47 basis points more than Canadian government bonds.</p>

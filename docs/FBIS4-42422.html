			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Leo Delcroix by Paul </F> Goossens; place and date not given: "A Government Program Based  on Security"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Goossens] What happens if  Prime Minister Dehaene leaves for Europe?    [Delcroix] That will be a very serious problem because  Dehaene is far more than the engine of the government. He is  also its bodywork. I see two possibilities. Either we finish  gracefully and the elections are advanced to early 1995--I am  not radically opposed to that--or we find a new prime minister  and succeed in updating the government program. We cannot  continue for another year as we are doing now. Public opinion,  which must be considered, would not accept that. In any case I  want to do so, because I can thank public opinion for a great  deal. Without the public's support, I would perhaps not have  succeeded in abolishing national service.    [Goossens] What would be the main points of that new  government program?    [Delcroix] The emphasis must be on the security problem and  fighting crime. Then there are immigration policies. A time  must come when we have the courage to say that the country is  saturated. We must put a figure on that. Then we must also take  adequate measures against the illegal immigrants. I do not  think that we must reintroduce borders, but we must organize  something, and also take measures for combating drugs. In my  view, the Army can and must play a role here. It could be  deployed in this area. In the community field, I support more  homogenous packages of powers. I also feel that the federal  state should be more than a skeleton. It must also have  substance; otherwise it cannot survive.    [Goossens] The Flemish Bloc will take pleasure in many  points  in your program.    [Delcroix] I am not a fan of the Flemish Bloc, and I do not  call for it to be brought into the government. However, I think  it is wrong to isolate it. It is bringing up problems that have  been neglected by the other parties, including the immigration  problem.    [Goossens] Are the Flemish Liberal Democrats an ideal  coalition partner for you?    [Delcroix] That is not self-evident. Much will depend on how  the electoral campaign is conducted, and just like everyone else  they will have to make compromises after the elections. I  belong to the right wing of the Christian People's Party (CVP),  and that makes me unacceptable for some positions in the eyes of  the French-speaking Socialist Party. This does not bother me,  however, nor does it bother me that in the CVP there are people  who have a far greater interest in the welfare sector than the  business world. We are a true people's party.</p>

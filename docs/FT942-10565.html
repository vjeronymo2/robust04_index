			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Yeltsin upset by plans for Berlin farewell President Boris Yeltsin yesterday appealed to the west not to humiliate Russia after a row blew up in Germany over plans to exclude Russian troops from a farewell parade of Allied forces from Berlin. American, British and French troops are due to mark the departure from Berlin with celebrations organised by the city authorities on June 18, nearly 50 years after Berlin surrendered to the Red Army. But the Russians have been told they cannot take part. And Chancellor Helmut Kohl has excluded them from the federal government's send-off due to be held in Berlin on September 8. The German government and western allies have agreed on separate ceremonies on the grounds that the role of the Russian troops as an occupying force was very different from that of the west. The planned farewell celebrations will be discussed by Mr Kohl and Mr Yeltsin, who arrives in Germany tomorrow for an official visit, and final details are due to be settled this week. Russia has been offered two civilian ceremonies in Berlin and in the southern city of Weimar on August 31, which Mr Yeltsin will attend. Moscow has made clear it sees plans for a separate send-off as shabby treatment. President Yeltsin, reflecting hurt national pride, said yesterday during Victory Day celebrations in Moscow: 'It is important to remember just one thing. 'Russia must always be addressed in a tone of respect because our people will never accept anything else from any country, such is the will and testament of those who died defending the honour and independence of our Motherland.' It is clear from the differing reactions in east and west Germany that the Russian role is seen differently in both halves of the country. Divisions erupted yesterday within Germany's opposition Social Democratic party, which split along east-west lines on how to say goodbye to the remaining 46,000 Russian troops, who will officially leave on August 31. East German leaders of the opposition Social Democratic party want the Russians to be included in the ceremonies with the three western allies in the name of peace and friendship. The cold war, they say, is over. But the west German SPD leadership, including Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, says the Russians must march alone. Mr Scharping yesterday backed Mr Kohl's government, arguing that a joint ceremony would confuse the role of western troops with Moscow's virtual occupation of east Germany.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank clarifies role at Daimler DEUTSCHE Bank's announcement yesterday that it was planning to reduce its stake in Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial company, follows months of speculation about the bank's intentions. A member of the bank's board hinted earlier this year that a partial sale was being considered. However, until yesterday the bank's formal position was that it had 'no present intention' to reduce the stake. Deutsche, Germany's largest bank, said it was likely to sell a 3 per cent stake in Daimler through an offering to US shareholders. At current prices, that will raise just under DM1bn (Dollars 625m) for the bank, leaving it with a 25 per cent stake worth some DM8bn. The move is linked to Daimler-Benz's plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange on October 5, making it the first German company to have a 'Big Board' listing on the world's largest capital market. Deutsche said the sale of some of its shares would help Daimler achieve its objective of broadening its shareholder base in the US. The offering is unlikely to take place until early next year. Deutsche said it would wait until shares in Mercedes Aktiengesellschaft Holding (MAH) had been converted into ordinary Daimler shares. MAH was a holding company set up at Deutsche's initiative in the 1970s to protect Daimler from takeover. It serves no purpose other than to hold 25 per cent of Daimler's stock. Earlier this year Daimler said it would disband MAH, chiefly because, for technical reasons, it makes it expensive for Daimler to raise cash via the equity market. Deutsche's relationship with Daimler is one of the enduring features of German capitalism. It dates back to the late-1920s, when Deutsche helped advise on the merger of two automotive manufacturers to create Daimler-Benz. Since then, the bank has maintained its influence through its shareholding and via the supervisory board. By tradition, the chief executive of the bank has always been chairman of the Daimler supervisory board, a position currently occupied by Mr Hilmar Kopper. Deutsche's role in Daimler's affairs has been subject to criticism from those who say the bank - bigger in profits terms than its next two German rivals - occupies too powerful a position in German corporate life. This is cemented by dozens of shareholdings in Germany's largest companies, and by hundreds of positions on German supervisory boards. Under Mr Alfred Herrhausen, the bank's chief executive who was murdered by terrorists in 1989, Deutsche was not shy about this influence. Mr Herrhausen used to explain Daimler's strategy in the press, and was reported to have been instrumental in ousting Mr Werner Breitschwert from his position as Daimler's chief executive. Mr Edzard Reuter, Daimler's current chief executive and architect of the group's controversial diversification strategy, was Mr Herrhausen's protege. Under Mr Hilmar Kopper, who succeeded Mr Herrhausen, the bank has played down its powerful role in German industry. It has said that, in principle, it wants to reduce its extensive industrial holdings as the capital could be better invested in its mainstream banking business. However, a 3 per cent reduction does not amount to a withdrawal from Daimler's affairs. The bank's 25 per cent stake and the role on the supervisory board will leave the relationship much as before. That the move is taking place does, however, show the willingness of the German corporate and financial establishment to 'think the unthinkable' amid the worst recession in Germany since the second world war. Daimler's listing in New York, to which Deutsche is co-adviser with Goldman Sachs, is also evidence of this. The listing will require Daimler to disclose significantly more financial information than is required under German accounting rules. It is also likely to influence the way in which the group is managed, putting the management board under greater pressure to generate short-term profit and pay higher dividends to performance-oriented US shareholders.</p>

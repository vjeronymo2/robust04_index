			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Self-Defensive Right Cannot Be Encroached Upon" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Chinese Foreign Ministry declared in connection with an  underground nuclear testing on June 10 that China always stands  for complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear  weapons and, within this context, the realization of a  comprehensive nuclear test ban, and said China fully respects  and understands the position and concern of many non-nuclear  weapon states on the question of nuclear testing.    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says it is the  United  States which tops the world's list in nuclear testing and  stockpile of nuclear weapons and it is again the U.S. which has  deployed them in all parts of the world and interferes in  others' internal affairs, threatening them with those weapons.    The analyst goes on:    The United States has carried out over 1,000 times of  nuclear  tests for the development and modernisation of nuclear weapons  since the 1940s. It decided to allocate 11.7 billion dollars to  the production of nuclear warheads of new types in fiscal 1995.    It wantonly interferes in the internal affairs of other  countries on the pretext of "non-proliferation of nuclear  weapons" and recently worked out even a "nuclear  non-proliferation strategy". The "strategy" is intended to  counter "proliferation of nuclear weapons" even by using such  kinds of weapons.    Such being the situation, nuclear states which have  relatively few nuclear weapons, to say nothing of non-nuclear  states, cannot but stand against the nuclear threat of the  United States and seek a self-defensive measure. The  underground nuclear testing of China this time can be considered  in this context.    A self-defensive measure stands out as a more urgent matter  for Korea. The U.S. hardline conservative forces are increasing  military threat as never before, pursuing "sanctions" against  the DPRK. International reactionaries and some countries are  doing base acts, dancing to the tune of the U.S. this proves  that the United States and its followers are trying to isolate  and stifle Korean socialism at any cost over the nuclear issue.    We have done and are doing everything we can to solve the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. But the moves for  stifling us are assuming growing intensity. Under this  condition, we cannot but take a tough action as has been  decided. We have the right to take a self-defensive measure.    The United States and its followers must know that this is  not an empty word.</p>

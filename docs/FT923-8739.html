			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Awaiting Sid's return to market - The argument for flexibility in the listing rules It has been a dismal summer for companies seeking a stock exchange listing. Many of those that have come have seen their hopes of a good price and a well-received issue dashed, while some planned for the autumn have already been postponed. The blame has been laid on the lack of interest from private investors - collectively known as 'Sid' ever since the British Gas privatisation marketing campaign in 1986. Once a regular feature of new issues, the small investor who 'stagged' issues, applying in the hope of making a quick profit, appears to have gone. Has Sid vanished for ever or is he simply avoiding new issues because of the gloomy stock market background? If Sid has gone for good then the exchange might as well change the rules for new issues so that they can be sold directly to the final holders. But it would be politically difficult for the exchange to abandon the private investor given the Government's policy of widening share ownership. Ironically the privatisation programme, which was used to promote share ownership through low pricing and incentives to buy shares, is partly blamed for Sid's lack of interest in recent issues. 'Privatisations have spoiled the public,' says one broker. While a quick profit was built into privatisation issues, other companies are trying to price their shares to match demand so that there is not too much for the stags to go for. This summer many issues have been labelled flops, as large proportions of shares aimed at the public were left with underwriters. Meanwhile, shares were placed with institutions, apparently without too much difficulty although not always at the price the sellers would have liked. A director of one of the leading issuing banks says:'In the old days the excitement of the stags helped the selling exercise. Now the tail is wagging the dog. You have to price an issue so it is not a total flop with the public, though the institutions might pay more.' Arguably, if a company obtains a listing, sells shares and raises capital, a flotation ought to be called a success. But the ingredients of a successful issue should also include a share register with a high proportion of long-term holders and a share price which does not slump below the issue price in the immediate after-market. Many bankers and brokers involved in recent issues believe they would have more nearly achieved these goals if they had not been required under the exchange's listing rules to make offers to the public. Without the requirement for a public offer, the whole process of an issue could be speeded up, cutting out the market risk and allowing much finer pricing. Says one broker involved in some of this summer's deals:'In an ideal world we would book-build on Monday, price on Tuesday and start dealings on Thursday.' This would be closer to the US system where pricing is conducted after the close of business one day and the shares are all sold before trading opens the next. Buyers having been lined up in advance. Mr David Barclay, of County NatWest, which sponsored MFI Furniture Group's flotation, says that the best way of selling shares is by directing them towards the pockets of demand. Trying to force shares on unwilling buyers will not work, he claims. At present, the exchange's starting point is that half the shares being sold in an issue of over Pounds 30m must be offered to the public. This looks high against the latest estimate of private ownership of shares of about 19 per cent, a figure falling by 1 percentage point a year despite the Government's efforts. One broker prominent in the new issue market says:'If the exchange insisted on 50 per cent now it would stop some companies from coming to the market.' The exchange itself has recognised the problem by indicating that it will take a more flexible attitude when applying rules for listings. Advisers to MFI asked to reduce the public offer on the basis that demand was weak. The exchange agreed that it could be limited to 25 per cent, although MFI's advisers argued for an even lower limit. In the end the public applied for only 15 per cent of the 137m shares available through that offer, although sub-underwriters applied for another 29 per cent. Although labelled a flop the shares went to a premium in first day dealings. The exchange is now suggesting that in certain circumstances it would countenance a placing of an entire issue, so long as the public could subscribe to shares clawed back from the placees. Institutions which underwrite issues are not keen on the idea. They would lose their sub-underwriting commissions - 1 1/4 per cent - but risk having the shares taken from them by private investors if the issue looked attractive. A limit would have to be set on the amount available under the clawback or they would not take the placing at all. Corporate financiers also fear that an issue would still be called a flop if the clawback was not fully triggered. It might, however, help the aftermarket by removing the perception that there was an overhang of underwritten stock. An alternative they put forward is the so-called 'green shoe' option which has been developed in the US. Under this the entire issue is sold, but the company can increase the offer size if extra demand comes in. This requires the company, or its existing shareholders, having flexibility over the number of shares they wish to sell. Another idea is to approach Sid in a different way. In public offers investors apply for shares 'off the page' - by clipping application forms from newspapers or copies of the prospectus. Issuers are now experimenting with offers through financial intermediaries, although this met with little success in the MFI float. Under this arrangement firms such as regional stockbrokers, or possibly banks and building societies, sell shares to clients, taking a commission for doing so. This would be a step towards US style offers where shares are only sold through such intermediaries. The drawback is that to give the brokers the incentive to sell US commissions are much higher than those in the UK. US brokers have built extensive distribution networks on the back of these commissions, but in the UK this channel would only reach relatively high net worth individuals - Sydney not Sid. Perhaps Sid will reappear when the market recovers. But if not, and while the market background is dull, companies may be better served if flotations are targetted at buyers more likely to pay up for the shares than at Sid.</p>

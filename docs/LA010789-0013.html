			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOSING U.S. MILITARY BASES  </P> <P> We see in The Times that Uncle Sam is planning to close a few U.S. military  bases to save a few million dollars each year. Why don't we close a few of our  bases in foreign lands and save a few billion dollars?  </P> <P> Who are we protecting these people from? Why are U.S. citizens paying the tab  to "protect" other countries' citizens from whomever it is they need protecting  from? Has anybody ever told us how many trillion dollars we have spent to  provide this service?  </P> <P> Let's ask Uncle "Sucker" to charge all "protected" nations for services  rendered. If we are in the business of protecting all the free nations of the  world, then let's make the business "capitalistic" and debit them or credit  their debts to us for the cost of military bases in their countries at cost  plus.  </P> <P> Goodby, deficit!  </P> <P> KING D. CHRISTOPHER  </P> <P> Big Bear Lake  </P></p>

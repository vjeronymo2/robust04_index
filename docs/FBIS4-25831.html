			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 14 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government  is staging a massive training program to produce certified  public accountants [CPA] across the country to cope with the  ever-growing demand.    "Our target is to produce over 60,000 CPAs in the next six  years to bring the total number to some 100,000 by the end of  this century," Vice-Minister of Finance Zhang Youcai told the  press here today.    He said that CPAs will be directly involved in the business  accounting of some Chinese firms this year. These firms will be  large state enterprises, conglomerates and large shareholding  companies.    In fact, Zhang said, all business accounting should be  verified by CPAs in a market economy. But this cannot be  realised at present since China at the moment only has 38,000  people with CPA qualifications.    According to Zhang, seven Chinese universities will open  specialized courses of study for CPAs for the first time this  autumn, with 300 students to be enrolled.    The new course of CPA studies will be expanded to more than  20 colleges and universities next year.    Apart from university study, the government will set up  three  CPA training centers -- in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The  centers will begin to operate in two or three years, Zhang said.    The Law on Certified Public Accountants which went into  effect at the start of this year stipulates that anyone who  wants to obtain a CPA qualification must pass the national  examinations.    China held two such exams in 1991 and 1993. Last year 13  percent of the 2,900 people who sat the exam obtained CPA  qualifications.    The government will make the exam an annual practice and it  will be open to foreigners in addition to people from Hong Kong,  Macao and Taiwan, beginning this year.    People from overseas with Chinese CPA qualifications will be  allowed to form CPA firms on the mainland on a partner basis,  according to Zhang.</p>

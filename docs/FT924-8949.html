			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Aga profits slip 3% to SKr1.03bn at nine months AGA, the Swedish industrial gas group, reported profits of SKr1.03bn (Dollars 172m) for the first nine months, down 3 per cent from the same period in 1991. Sales fell to SKr8.56bn from SKr9.40bn, reflecting Aga's earlier merger of its Uddeholm energy unit with Swedish power group Gullspangs Kraft. The group's ongoing opera-tions, gas and the Frigoscandia food processing and cold storage business, increased sales by 1.5 per cent during the period. Operating income fell 9 per cent to SKr946m from SKr1.08bn, mainly because Frigoscandia's equipment operations were affected by the international recession. The group said it was on target to produce full year profits of SKr1.43bn, unchanged from last year and in line with an earlier prediction. It expects the downturn at Frigoscandia to be offset by its share of earnings from the new Gullspang.</p>

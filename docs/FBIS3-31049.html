			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Pavel Novotny: "Crude Oil as a Weapon"] </F>   [Text] Russia has been and will be a country where  tomorrow means nothing at all [reference to the communist slogan  "The country where tomorrow means yesterday"]. The country  aggrieved by poverty and willfulness is about as close to  stability as a pendulum clock. Regions that no one controls are  forming regional "republics" like on an assembly line, and the  new prime minister, Chernomyrdin, is proud of his nickname, "the  Red Manager."    In this situation, the report came that there is imminent  danger of a halt in shipments of Russian crude oil. The  drilling enterprises are said to be in debt up to their ears,  allegedly through the fault of the "nonpayers" from among the  former Soviet republics. A collapse of the Russian oilmen may  result in a halt in the supply of energy raw materials also to  the countries that otherwise pay properly. There is almost  nothing one can educe from the traditionally contradictory  comments by the central bodies, except perhaps endeavors that  the "real culprits be punished."    At exactly the same time, reports have been heard of  intended  talks between Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting  Countries [OPEC]. A joint approach to the world market is to be  the main topic on the agenda, and neither side makes any secret  about their objective: to raise the price of oil while cutting  production.    It is clearer than the sun who would be hit hardest by such  a  play--the former communist countries that, in the framework of  the economic superintegration COMECON [CEMA], have oriented  themselves toward a single source of raw materials, the Soviet  Union. "The inseparable friendship" of the past years condemned  the Czech and Slovak Republics to the role of a beggar for  Russian strategic raw materials. Other postcommunist countries  of the Central European region, which are more or less dependent  on shipments from Russia, find themselves in a similar situation.    It is important that the post-November governments realized  the danger implied by this situation. After all, nothing worse  could happen to the Czech Republic than to get under the thumb  of the Eastern neighbors. Therefore, it is vitally important  for us to expedite the talks on the construction of the new  Ingolstadt oil pipeline. The sooner it is completed, the better.</p>

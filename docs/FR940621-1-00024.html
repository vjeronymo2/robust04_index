			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sturgeons are thought to swim upstream to spawn (Becker 1983). Shovelnose sturgeons, based on telemetry studies conducted during the spawning season, were found to migrate limited distances (Hurley  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1987). Spawning habitats for the Alabama sturgeon are generally unknown. Spawning shovelnose sturgeon in the Mississippi River system generally use hard substrates that may occur in main-channel areas or deep-water habitats associated with channel-training devices in major rivers or possibly in tributaries (Hurley and Nickum 1984). Observations by Burke and Ramsey (1985) suggest that the Alabama sturgeon prefers spawning habitat similar to the shovelnose sturgeon in the Mississippi River system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currents are required for the development of sturgeons' adhesive eggs, which require 5 to 8 days to hatch (Burke and Ramsey 1985). Spawning of the shovelnose sturgeon in the Mississippi River system apparently occurs from April to July (Moos 1978). The spawning period for the sturgeon probably depends upon water temperature and flows (Moos 1978), as it does for numerous other fish species. Henry and Ruelle (1992) conducted a study of shovelnose sturgeon reproduction in the Mississippi River system, concluding that they do not spawn every year and that poor body condition may result in the production of fewer eggs or infrequent spawning attempts. The reproductive biology of the Alabama sturgeon is poorly known. However, given what is known concerning the chronology of Alabama sturgeon collections and the reproductive biology of other sturgeon species, populations of Alabama sturgeon may be cyclical, with peak numbers possibly occurring every 7 to 8 years (Mayden and Kuhajda 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several studies have aged sturgeon of the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scaphirhynchus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by cross-sectioning pectoral fin spines. Helms (1973) aged shovelnose sturgeon in the Mississippi River at up to 12 years. Durkee  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1979) aged shovelnose sturgeon at up to 14 years in the upper Mississippi River system. Ages ranged from 8 to 27 years for 288 shovelnose sturgeon sampled from the Missouri River (Zweiacker 1967). However, Zweiacker (1967) could not validate the marks interpreted as annuli (Moos 1978). Ruelle and Keenlyne (1993) aged three pallid sturgeons at 10, 37, and 41 years. Considering the longevity of this genus, the rarity of the Alabama sturgeon, and the several-year hiatus that occurs between major year classes, frequent Alabama sturgeon encounters should not be expected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Burke and Ramsey (1985) conducted stomach analyses of a few Alabama sturgeon. They found that aquatic insect larvae were a major dietary component, but fish eggs, snails, mussels, and fish were also taken. Shovelnose sturgeon, based on a study conducted in the Missouri River, are opportunistic feeders (Modde and Schmulbach 1977). Various groups of aquatic insect larvae generally comprise their diet (Modde and Schmulbach 1977, Durkee  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1979). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recent capture of a single specimen of the Alabama sturgeon afforded scientists the opportunity to obtain fresh tissue samples and compare its genetic distinctiveness with other sturgeons. The only completed, but unpublished, study comparing the genetics of these two sturgeons (Schill and Walker 1994) concluded that the Alabama sturgeon and the shovelnose and pallid sturgeons of the Mississippi River system were indistinguishable based on estimates of sequence divergence at the mitochondrial cytochrome  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  locus. This result is similar to other studies where no cytochrome  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  differentiation was found among other fish species within a genus where the species were based on well accepted morphological, behavioral, and other characteristics (Avise 1994). If the Alabama sturgeon's taxonomy is subsequently revised to subspecies or population status and is generally accepted by the scientific community, the Alabama sturgeon would still qualify for protection under the Act provided that it is not extinct. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3(15) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1544), specifically provides for listing species, subspecies, and distinct population segments of vertebrate species as endangered or threatened species. Although the Service finds that there is some disagreement among ichthyologists concerning the Alabama sturgeons' taxonomic status, the Service has determined that the Alabama sturgeon warrants recognition as a species as defined by the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Alabama sturgeon was included in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices of review for candidate animals in 1982, 1985, 1989, and 1991. In the 1982 notice (47 FR 58454) and in the 1985 notice (50 FR 37958), this fish was listed as a category 2 (sufficient information indicates proposing to list may be appropriate, but conclusive data are not currently available to support a proposed rule). In the 1989 and 1991 notices (54 FR 554 and 56 FR 58816), the Alabama sturgeon was listed as category 1 (substantial information supports listing). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the June 15, 1993, proposed rule (58 FR 33148) and through associated notifications, interested parties were requested to submit factual reports and information that might contribute to the development of a final rule to list the Alabama sturgeon as endangered with critical habitat. The comment period was open until October 13, 1993. Appropriate Federal and State agencies, county governments, scientific organizations, and interested parties were contacted by letter dated June 21, 1993; a copy of the proposed rule was enclosed, and their comments on the rule were solicited. A total of 34 letters were sent. Legal notices were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Birmingham News, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Birmingham, Alabama, on July 25, 1993; the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mobile Press-Register, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Mobile, Alabama, on July 25, 1993; the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Montgomery Advertiser, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Montgomery, Alabama, on July 24, 1993; and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Clarion Ledger, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Hinds County, Mississippi, on July 23, 1993. The proposed rule also stated that a public hearing would be conducted to answer questions and gather additional information on the biology of the Alabama sturgeon and discuss issues relating to the proposed listing and critical habitat designation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

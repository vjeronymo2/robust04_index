			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIXING THE COUNTY'S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM FOR NEGLECTED CHILDREN  </P> <P> Kudos to Freedman's article "A Charade of Justice for Adults Only." That, and  his 17 suggestions to prevent future inequities should be applauded and  implemented by everyone.  </P> <P> His account of what happens to the child after abuse has been reported was  disturbingly accurate. I called the police about my ex-husband's physical and  mental abuse of my son, who was 10 years old at the time. We were thrown into  the system and really were lucky to come out with our sanity. That was 12 years  ago, but obviously the workings of the system remain the same. Every adult  needs to readjust priorities. We think nothing of spending great amounts of  money on cars, homes and entertainment, but when it comes to the future of this  country, our children, their needs are at the bottom of the list.  </P> <P> SUE DEVLIS  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

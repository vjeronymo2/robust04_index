			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ICI to get Pounds 235m in swap with Du Pont IMPERIAL CHEMICAL Indus-tries, the UK group, and Du Pont of the US, yesterday announced the completion of the swap of their respective fibres and acrylics operations. ICI will be paid up to Pounds 235m because of the difference in value between the two businesses. This is less than the Pounds 250m mentioned at the time the deal was first struck in April last year because of the deteriorating market for European fibres. ICI stressed yesterday it was exiting a business that loses money for one that makes it. The British company will receive Pounds 100m shortly after the deal is completed. A series of deferred payments totalling Pounds 110m will follow between 1994 and 2002. There is also a performance related payment of up to Pounds 25m if turnover at ICI's nylon textile filament business meets agreed targets between 1994 and the end of the decade. The disposal of ICI's nylon business and associated costs will lead to an exceptional pre-tax loss of about Pounds 70m. ICI loses about 5,200 employees from the deal, while it recruits about 350 from Du Pont. The deal had been delayed by the US Federal Trade Commission. The FTC has insisted that ICI divests to a third party a proportion of its downstream acrylics polymer production. It is understood that this will affect one US plant which was not acquired as part of the deal. ICI already has two American acrylics operations, K-S-H, which it bought in 1989, and Continental Polymers which it acquired in 1991. Both manufacture acrylic extruded sheet and moulding polymer. Du Pont's acrylics business, had turnover last year of about Pounds 200m. The assets, stock and goodwill of the business, which is profitable, was estimated at Pounds 180m-Pounds 190m. ICI's fibres operations had a turnover of Pounds 585m last year, and incurred a loss of Pounds 13m. Assets, stock and goodwill were valued at about Pounds 360m.</p>

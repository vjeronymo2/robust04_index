			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> VICTORY VOW;  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS MAYOR SAYS HE'LL FINISH CIVIC CENTER, 'EVEN IF I HAVE TO DO IT  MYSELF'  </P> <P> Taking office as the 34th mayor of Beverly Hills, Maxwell Hillary Salter vowed  to see the city's grandiose new City Hall finished within 12 months -- or else.  </P> <P> Salter, a genial, bearded garment-district magnate, spoke at a Tuesday night  ceremony that paled in comparison with the dramatics of Monday night's Beverly  Hills Follies, a musical revue making fun of city officials for the benefit of  Beverly Hills schools.  </P> <P> He won applause and laughter for his vow: "I solemnly swear, take an oath,  commit, pledge that the Civic Center will be finished before I leave office  even if I have to pour cement, paint and plaster it myself."  </P> <P> The City Hall was originally scheduled for completion a year ago this month.  The latest predictions are for it to be ready sometime in 1990.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Commitments  </P> <P> In his speech, delivered under a white tent set up for the occasion in the  driveway of a new fire station, Salter also committed the city to maintain  balanced budgets, help fund the school district, make more parking spaces  available downtown, take steps to fight traffic gridlock and draw up an  emergency preparedness plan.  </P> <P> As is his habit, Salter quoted from the Talmud, an ancient work of rabbinical  commentary, to bolster his case for emergency preparedness, saying: "He who  saves one life, it is as though he has saved the world."  </P> <P> But none of it was as entertaining as the Follies on Monday night, when all  five City Council members did a chorus-line version of "Puttin' on the Ritz,"  rewritten for Beverly Hills as "Puttin' on the Glitz."  </P> <P> Their version, which included the invaluable tip for politicos, "Kiss  everybody," was closer to Peter Boyle's clumsy efforts as the monster in "Young  Frankenstein" than to Fred Astaire's original.  </P> <P> But the sell-out crowd of 300, which paid $125 a head for the evening of inside  humor, loved it, and they roared at raunchy references to a controversial  statue that was installed in a park along Santa Monica Boulevard last year.  </P> <P> Other acts featured chiefs, policemen and firemen from the city's public safety  departments and City Manager Ed Kreins, costumed as Henry VIII, revealing a  forceful baritone in a song declaring, "I rule the city with a velvet glove."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Fiddler' Parody  </P> <P> There was also a parody of Salter as Tevye the Milkman from "Fiddler on the  Roof," a fictional character who also liked to cite Holy Writ.  </P> <P> "The most important men in town will come to pressure you," a Salter look-alike  sang, holding his head and paraphrasing the lyrics of the song "If I Were a  Rich Man."  </P> <P> "They will ask you for a favor: Will you change their zoning, so they'll stop  this phoning . . . and they build a house that's 50 stories high!"  </P> <P> Outgoing Mayor Robert K. Tanenbaum poked fun at his own political ambitions,  and his vision of Beverly Hills as Camelot, in an off-key takeoff that was even  less musical than Richard Burton's original.  </P> <P> "In Beverly, the hills of Beverly. . .," he croaked. "If I'm going to be  district attorney, to qualify to run politically, I know I'll have to take a  little journey . . . from Beverly."  </P> <P> Produced by Salter's wife, Janet, and written by contributors including Joel  Pressman, who chairs the performing arts department at Beverly Hills High  School, Rabbi Jacob Pressman, Joel's father, and writers Stanley Ralph Ross and  Loni Marston, the show was billed as a first annual event.  </P> <P> But Janet Salter said a new edition may have to wait for a new cast of targets  to be lampooned.  </P> <P> "I think we should actually do it every other year, because we'll have a new  council that way," she said Wednesday. "The phone has been ringing all day, and  people said the show really helped bring people together."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Surplus Expected  </P> <P> She said that once expenses are paid, organizers hope to have a $10,000 surplus  to be divided among the Madrigals, an amateur singing group, the Beverly Hills  Education Foundation and the city's YMCA.  </P> <P> At the City Council ceremony Tuesday night, Allan Alexander was named vice  mayor. In Beverly Hills, the office of mayor rotates annually among the five  council members.  </P> <P> The mayor wields more influence than his colleagues because of his roles in  setting the agenda and summing up the conclusions of the governing body once  decisions are taken.  </P> <P> The mayor also gets more publicity because he acts as spokesman for the city of  32,000.  </P> <P> Council members, including the mayor, receive stipends of $330 a month.  </P></p>

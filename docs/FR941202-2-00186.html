			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Elements (a) through (d) under announced assessments are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also applicable to unannounced assessments;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Performance evaluation samples may be distributed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses run in the categories and for the methods that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are determined by and prescribed by the inspector; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) All performance evaluation samples and other analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by the inspector are to be done as directed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the inspector. These include parameters such as:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified equipment, analysts and times, but are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to these factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Factors Examined in Announced and Unannounced Laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Refer to On-site Assessments for assessment criteria required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be satisfied for accreditation. It should be noted, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspector is not limited to these factors in reaching an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation and conclusion. Other factors may be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and documented as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Laboratories will be furnished with an inspection report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documenting any deficiencies found in the factors listed above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or any others considered by the inspector. It shall also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include whether a specific method passed or failed based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Performance Evaluation sample. All such reports are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public record and any or all of the information contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therein may be put into the National Database. Proprietary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data will be excepted from all public records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The laboratory will have no more than 45 days from the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the report to correct deficiencies noted in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection report. At that time, if no remedial action has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been taken to correct the noted deficiencies, accreditation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for categories or specific methods within those categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be immediately revoked.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.1.3&blank;Performance Evaluation Samples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A critical component of laboratory assessments is the analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Performance Evaluation Samples. Refer to Performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation Testing, specifically Testing of Samples, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional information regarding separate treatment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Performance Evaluation samples, discussion of issues of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability, and purity and distribution. Performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation samples would be used and evaluated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accreditation process in the following manner:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) All laboratories seeking National Accreditation must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive, examine and analyze initial performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation sample(s) for each category (e.g., drinking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water, hazardous waste, etc.) in which they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting accreditation. The analysis must be completed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the results reported to the performance evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing organization or the Inspector within 45 days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the receipt of the sample.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Each laboratory seeking national accreditation shall also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be required to perform analyses on at least two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance evaluation samples, two concentrations, two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times per year in each category for which they have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied for accreditation or for which the laboratory is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently accredited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The laboratory will be informed of the results of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance evaluation sample analysis within 60 days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt by the state agency or authorized third party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractor. The results of all of the performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation sample tests indicating satisfactory or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unsatisfactory compliance will be public record and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be recorded on the national database.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The results of the performance evaluation sample analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be considered, along with other information obtained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from announced and/or unannounced assessments in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining whether accreditation should be granted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denied or modified for a category, or whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory should lose accreditation for a category or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method within a category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.1.4&blank;Corrective Action Reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the corrective action report is to have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written record of response to deficiencies that are noted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the laboratory assessment procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) After being notified of deficiencies from the laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection, the laboratory has 45 days from the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the deficiency report to submit a corrective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The state authority or authorized third party contractor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will respond to the action noted in the corrective action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report within 30 days of receiving it. The report must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address each of the deficiencies noted on the deficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) A laboratory can lose accreditation in a category or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method within a category by any or all of the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> items:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.

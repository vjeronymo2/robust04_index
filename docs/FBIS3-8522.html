			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with RSK Foreign Minister Slobodan Jarcevic by </F> news announcer in the Belgrade Radio studio on 10 March--live]    [Text] [Announcer] Mr. Jarcevic, could you briefly give us  your comments on the latest attacks by Croatia?    [Jarcevic] Croatia is not attacking the Serbian positions in  the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK], but has carried out  aggression on the territory of the Korenica commune. Supported  with artillery and tanks, Croatian soldiers have stormed that  territory. Moreover, in northwestern Dalmatia, they are  attacking the communes of Obrovac and Benkovac.    In the eastern part of the republic of Serbian Krajina,  around Vinkovci, they are also attacking us with artillery and  infantry weapons. This is only a prelude, and I am expecting  all-out war between the Republic of Croatia and the republic of  Serbian Krajina.    [Announcer] On what do you base your views?    [Jarcevic] General Tudjman was given support in all the  international bodies, in the United Nations, the CSCE, and the  European Union. Washington is now firmly supporting him in his  calls for the reintegration of the republic of Serbian Krajina  into the Republic of Croatia. He knows that he cannot  accomplish this with the agreement of the Serbian people who  live in the republic of Serbian Krajina or those Serbs whom he  has expelled from the Republic of Croatia. He is only left with  war and it is certain that in the secret connections with  Western countries he has been given the green light for that.    [Announcer] Thank you.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA NIGUEL CITYHOOD FOES CANCEL MEETINGS  </P> <P> The only group opposing cityhood for Laguna Niguel has canceled campaign  appearances for the past two weeks, a lull following the release of a report  predicting a $3.5-million budget surplus should voters approve incorporation  next month.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Stop Cityhood, which had claimed that the area could not  afford to become a city, confirmed Monday that the group has made no campaign  appearances since Oct. 9.  </P> <P> "We're not dead," said Debi Larsen of Stop Cityhood, "We're just researching  (the report)."  </P> <P> Cityhood backers said Monday that the lack of opposition in the final weeks of  the campaign boosts their chances for victory on Nov. 7.  </P> <P> Denny Harris, a member of the executive committee of Citizens for Cityhood,  said that "without a doubt" pro-cityhood prospects had been enhanced by the  opposition's unexpected silence. The report is convincing skeptics that the  finances of the proposed city would be sound, Harris said.  </P> <P> "We've always said that people would be won over if they got the correct  information," Harris said.  </P> <P> Larsen, who describes herself as a homemaker opposed to "rushing into  cityhood," said Monday that she is not convinced by the report, but that she  and the other 24 Stop Cityhood members will continue to review it.  </P> <P> "We took some time to study the budget because we didn't want to go out there  and make fools of ourselves," she said. "We have a meeting Tuesday night, and  we'll be deciding what to do then."  </P> <P> The Oct. 9 report, by Christensen &amp; Wallace Inc. of Oceanside, concluded  that Laguna Niguel would operate comfortably in the black -- and even amass a  $3.5-million surplus in its first year -- if the community becomes a city.  </P> <P> Harris said Monday that Citizens for Cityhood will continue to mount a strong  campaign as the election nears. "We have many speaking engagements, including  (talks) to homeowner associations," Harris said. "We have not changed our  schedule or slowed down one bit."  </P> <P> Harris said that pro-cityhood workers and candidates for council seats in the  proposed new city "are reporting at least 75% support from residents as they go  door-to-door and talk to the voters."  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel would become Orange County's 29th city if more than 50% of those  voting Nov. 7 approve the proposal. Cityhood would be effective Dec. 1.  </P></p>

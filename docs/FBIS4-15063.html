			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- "Russia is ready to take an  active part in the reconstruction of iron and steel mills in  Turkey," Russian First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets said here  today during a meeting with Turkish Minister for Construction  and Settlements Onur Kumbaracibasi.    Soskovets regards the petroleum and gas industry as one of  the most promising areas of Russo-Turkish cooperation. He moved  to set up an international consortium for building a pipeline  between Russia and Turkey with the participation of Azerbaijan,  Kazakhstan and Armenia. He said that Russia had efficient  technologies for the production of pipes and could help train  highly skilled specialists.    Taking into account Russia's rich experience in power  engineering, Soskovets offered the Turkish side to build a new  atomic power plant in Turkey. "Russian nuclear power plants  have dependable safety systems," he said. "Moreover, they are  much cheaper than the world prices".    Kumbaracibasi went on record for the construction of a new  pipeline for transporting petroleum from the former USSR to  Turkey. He said this would partially help solve the problem of  the passage of tankers through the Bosphorus.    Russian Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Oleg  Davydov,  who took part in the talks, drew the Turkish delegation's  attention to the "prospects of cooperation in marketing Russian  special technologies". He said a 95 million U.S. dollars  contract had already been concluded. "This will help Russia  settle its debt to Turkey in the Paris Club within three years,"  he stressed.</p>

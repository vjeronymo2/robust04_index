			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Lawson reveals Bank post offer LORD Lawson, the former chancellor who resigned from the cabinet over Baroness Thatcher's refusal to put sterling into the European exchange rate mechanism, has joined the controversy over Britain's place in Europe. In a preview of his memoirs in today's Daily Telegraph, he reveals that when Lady Thatcher was prime minister, she tried to persuade him to stay in the cabinet with an offer of the governorship of the Bank of England. As Mr Nigel Lawson he walked out of the cabinet in October 1989 after a four-year battle with the prime minister over monetary policy. Lord Lawson reveals that during the first cabinet-level discussion of ERM entry in 1985, Lady Thatcher threatened to quit if her cabinet forced her to tie sterling to the D-Mark. He says the possibility of his succeeding Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton at the Bank was tacitly agreed by Lady Thatcher in 1987. She then reminded him of the possibility in a vain attempt to prevent his departure.</p>

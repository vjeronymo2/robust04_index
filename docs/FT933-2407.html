			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Storm clouds over shares - Diary of a Private Investor ON October 15 and 16 1987, gale force winds wreaked havoc in my garden in Dorset, southern England. Trees were ripped up, branches crashed down. On October 19 that year the New York Dow Jones Index plummeted 508 points; in London the FTSE 100 share index fell 250 points. It subsequently fell further. On October 20, 1989 gale force winds wrenched branches from my trees. But the stock market 'mini crash' that year started on October 13. Last Sunday (September 12) gale force winds again damaged to the trees in my garden. So will the stock market fall? Or has the 'crisis' already passed.? In 1927 women tended to favour shorter skirts than in previous years, but by 1930 day-skirts had lengthened to mid-calf or lower. The great Wall Street crash was in 1929. During the 1968-72 period the mini-skirt was popular and share prices boomed until the midi-skirt became the height of fashion and the stock market plunged. Where are dress lengths now? Skirt lengths, sun spot activity, and all sorts of other things have been put forward by people as indications of stock market trends. Perhaps just as valid, therefore, are the effects of gales on the south coast - or my own discovery: the slimness connection. Looking back in 20th-century history, whenever there has been a reaction against ultra-thin fashion models, there has been a market downturn. Twiggy was the world's most famous model from 1966 to 1971. When people considered her then look to be no longer fashionable, the market went down (1973). In 1992 followers of top fashion model Kate Moss tried to emulate her physical shape - but recently there has been much newspaper comment against the 'waif-like' look. So will the market go down if figures expand? I am not seriously advancing gales and dress sizes as indicators of market trends - I much prefer a closer look at market activity and general future prospects for companies. It was fairly easy to predict the crash of 1987 - indeed, I did so in this column in August and October of that year. The average price earnings ratio of US companies was then at its highest level for 26 years. I had a genuine feeling of unease about the market, which seemed increasingly to be influenced by rumours and by institutional investors playing 'pass the parcel' with ever-increasingly overpriced shares: what would happen when no one wanted the parcel? On reflection, there was another good indicator of that crash. A bull market is at its peak when the amount of 'bull' written about why the market will continue to rise is also at its peak. When people seek to justify a continuing rise in the market by looking for unusual explanations, then the market is due for a fall. But what of the stock market today? Many market commentators have already stated that the US and UK markets cannot continue to rise at the same rates as earlier in the year. Price earnings ratios have again reached record levels. There will have to be a setback eventually - or at least a lengthy pause on a plateau. There is much less bull talked about why the market will rise. I think the future direction of the market is now in the hands of margin traders and institutional investors in the US and pensioners and the institutions in the UK. Many private investors in the US deal 'on margin': they pay cash for only a part of the cost of their shares and borrow the rest from their brokers. Comparatively low interest rates and rising share prices have made this increasingly attractive. But were there to be a sudden downturn in the market and/or an increase in interest rates, some of these investors may not be able to meet their 'margin call' and their brokers would sell some of the shares they are holding as security for the loans. This could deepen any downturn. In the UK many pensioners have been severely affected by the drop in interest rates on their bank and building society deposits. They have been forced to look elsewhere for a means to achieve good returns with which they can supplement their pensions. Unfortunately, in a similar way that some pensioners were attracted to Barlow Clowes for its 'higher-than-usual' returns, so they have been beguiled by the 'attractions' of penny shares and other highly-speculative ventures. While a number of companies with a share price of less than, say, 35p are safe and sound, some of them are rubbish. Increasing investment support for this rubbish has made it overpriced rubbish. Even for some non-penny shares, dividend yields achieved in the past may no longer be feasible and future prospects could be grimmer than originally anticipated. But it is the institutions which hold the key to the direction of the stock market. In the Wall Street crash of 1987 it was discovered that the top 15 sellers on the stock market accounted for about 20 per cent of the total sales. In the futures market, the top 10 sellers accounted for roughly 50 per cent of the business. It therefore only takes a relatively small number of fund managers to panic and the market will plummet, with computer traders, trackers and others following in their wake. I wonder how many of them follow fashion trends - or even the weather? And how many people will be unable to jump ship before it takes on water? I feel the private investor needs to follow the market very closely at the moment. It may plateau-out - or it could drop sharply and suddenly. At the time of writing, I am ready to jump at the slightest hint of trouble.</p>

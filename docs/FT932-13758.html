			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Tanker route scheme attacked A GOVERNMENT plan for a traffic separation scheme for the sea route between Fair Isle and the southern tip of Shetland, scene of the Braer tanker disaster earlier this year, was unnecessary, ill-conceived and could be counter-productive, professional mariners told the Donaldson inquiry yesterday. The criticism came from two witnesses appearing for the Nautical Institute, an international body with 6,000 members in 100 countries, on the second day of the hearing investigating the wider implications of the Braer disaster. Captain Peter Russell, an experienced pilot and institute fellow, said he could see no advantage in the plan, which would require expensive radar surveillance equipment to be effective. He said too few ships used the channel to justify special routing procedures. He said: 'If you put it in when it is not needed mariners will treat it with derision.' Mr Julian Parker, institute secretary, said that in cases such as the Braer accident better ship-to-shore communications and a faster response time by the emergency ser-vices were the key to pre-venting pollution, not the presence of radar surveil-lance. The two institute witnesses voiced concern over declining standards among crews, growing problems with safety equipment and increasingly frequent mechanical breakdowns, which now account for a quarter of all large tanker 'casual-ties'. The inquiry, being held in London, also heard that there are growing problems with communications at sea where English is meant to be the international language. The inquiry continues.</p>

Yesterday  letters from Maritime Kray Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko  containing a request to support the idea of establishing free  economic zones on the territories of individual Nakhodka  industrial enterprises were delivered to the apparatus of the  president and prime minister. Thus, for all practical purposes  Nakhodka is rejecting the status of free economic zone  previously granted to it as an administrative territory. Up  until now, not a single one of the free economic zones has made  such proposals.    The idea of establishing local free economic zones reflects  the desire of the directors of major industrial enterprises who  have become owners of them as the result of privatization to  strengthen their positions by obtaining special status for the  industrial zones they control. Their initiative is actively  supported by the administration of Nakhodka and Maritime Kray.  However, it is fairly unlikely that it will be approved by the  federal authorities.    The prospect of establishing microzones was considered for  the first time during a Maritime Kray visit by Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy, chairman of the Yabloko parliamentary faction, to  Nakhodka, where he held a meeting with representatives of the  city administration and industrial circles. At that meeting  local industrialists made their concept of the development of  the Nakhodka Free Economic Zones public for the first time.    Thus, Viktor Gnezdilov, head of the city administration,  stated in a discussion with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy that, since the  idea of developing the free economic zone as a unified complex  of industrial and agricultural territories had so far not found  support in the structures of federal authority, the free  economic zone's new administration considered the strategy of  developing local zones around Nakhodka's major enterprises to be  more effective.    According to that concept, in place of the Nakhodka Free  Economic Zone, about eight enclave zones, including the Nakhodka  Commercial Port Zone, the Vostochnyy Port Zone, the Nakhodka Tin  Can Factory Zone, and the Reinforced Concrete Structurals Plant  Zone, should be established.    Despite the fact that the heads of the city administration  and executives of local enterprises are putting forward the  concept of local free economic zones, what evidently would be  involved are duty zones, the conditions of operations in which  fully meet the ambitions of Nakhodka enterprise executives.    KOMMERSANT: In Russia the regulations for duty-free  zones that have been legislatively approved provide for the  possibility of placing and using imported goods in them without  regard to customs duties and taxes. What is attractive about  duty-free zones, for both Russian and foreign businessmen, is  not just the fact that imported goods may be kept on their  territories without customs inspection for as long as one likes,  but also the fact that production operations may be carried out  in them and, in such cases, export duties, the value-added tax  and excise taxes will be based only on the components that were  brought in from elsewhere in Russia.    World experience indicates that, because of the half-way  nature of the special breaks established by legislation,  duty-free zones have not been an effective tool for attracting  investments. In this connection, the idea of establishing  microzones around major industrial facilities could not result  in fundamental changes in the socioeconomic situation in  Nakhodka. From every indication, those who have initiated the  idea of establishing local zones are also guided, first and  foremost, by their own "local" interests, which square poorly  not only with federal goals but with the objectives of regional  development. Such a situation is a result of privatization,  whereby the executives of the leading enterprises received large  packages of stock in the new joint-stock companies and, for all  practical purposes, became the owners of their enterprises.  Following that, in December 1993, the representatives of the  industrial lobby, in alliance with the city administration, took  over the leading positions on the free economic zone's  Administrative Committee.    As strange as it may seem, the idea of local zones was  supported by the Maritime Kray administration and the kray  governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko. The kray authorities' interest in  establishing the microzones is understandable--such zones, only  very nominally oriented toward federal structures, would be  tightly linked to local authorities who controlled their power  supply and utilities. Moreover, the establishment of a network  of "growth points" on the basis of the kray's strategic  enterprises could become a pretty good substitute for the  separatist idea of singling Maritime Kray out as a separate  enclave "growth zone."  <H6>  Stages in the Development of Free Economic Zones in Russia </H6>   1991: The status of free economic zones is granted  to nine territories on the scale of oblasts and republics within  Russia.    1992: The status of free economic zones is granted  to three more regions.    1993: All free economic zones with the exception  of Kaliningrad Oblast are deprived of duty breaks and  privileges. The first three duty zones are  established: Sheremetyevo, the Moscow Free Port and the Free  Port Terminal.    1994: The Nakhodka Free Economic Zone rejects the  status of a free economic zone and submits a proposal to  establish four local zones that resemble duty zones  on its territory.</p>

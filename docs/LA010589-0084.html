			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: GLENDORA;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS TO HONOR TEEN  </P> <P> The neighbors of Charles Collins, a 16-year-old who helped extinguish a rooftop  fire during December's high winds, plan to present him a plaque in honor of his  courage.  </P> <P> About 2:30 p.m. Dec. 7, Collins noticed that the wind had caused some power  lines to snap, setting trees on fire and causing a fire on the roof of Roger  and Becky Tschirgi's home. The Tschirgis were not home at the time.  </P> <P> Collins, along with neighbor William Capp, watered down hot spots on the roof  for about half an hour. County fire crews arrived about 10 minutes later.  Although the roof had to be replaced, the house escaped major damage. No date  has been set for the ceremony honoring Collins.  </P></p>

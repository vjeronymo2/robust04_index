			<p>BFN     [Text] In his Friday prayer sermons, Ayatollah Ahmad  Jannati, the acting Friday imam of Tehran, said that the  martyrdom-seeking attack by a Palestinian youth was a clear  example of the uprising of Muslims against the arrogance's  injustice and oppression.    He referred to the compromise plans in connection with the  Palestinian issue and said: Compromise by claimants to  leadership of Palestine does not solve any of the Zionist  regime's problems.    In his second sermon, Ayatollah Jannati referred to the  emphasis by the eminent leader [Khamene'i] on the importance of  work ethics, the social order, and a serious attitude towards  work. He said that the lack of such an attitude constituted one  of the shortcomings of the society, and called for greater  efforts in this area.    He then alluded to the grave responsibilities of the Voice  and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran as a medium for  communications. He stressed the need for greater efforts, as  well as more help for that organization, so as to enable it to  provide a more valuable service.    The acting Friday imam of Tehran then set out to describe  all  the pressures exerted by America with the aim of forcing the  Islamic Republic of Iran to surrender. He stressed once again  that the Iranian nation would never surrender to tyranny and  oppression.</p>

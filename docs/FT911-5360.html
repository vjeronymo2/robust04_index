			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / A monetarist disciple at the helm of Treuhand MRS Birgit Breuel, a disciple of economic liberalism, this weekend took on one of the most daunting economic assignments Germany has to offer. The 53-year-old Christian Democratic (CDU) economics official was chosen to succeed the late Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, assassinated by terrorists earlier this month, as president of the Treuhand agency for the privatisation of east German companies. Mrs Breuel had served since last October as the Treuhand board member responsible for its regional offices. Faced with an imminent collapse of industrial production and mass unemployment in the East, Treuhand recently announced a big shift in its priorities. Henceforth, company reorganisation is to take precedence over privatisation at all cost. Mrs Breuel, however, sought to reconcile the two when she noted that privatisation was the 'best form of reorganisation'. Investments and the securing of jobs would be 'at least as valuable' as proceeds from the sale of companies to the private sector, she said in east Berlin. Mrs Breuel was chosen in a unanimous vote by Treuhand's administrative board after receiving the approval of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Theo Waigel, the economics minister, who oversees the agency. A newly-created post of Treuhand vice-president is to be filled by a prominent west German company executive and is designed to compensate for the new president's lack of managerial experience. A Treuhand official, acknowledging Mrs Breuel's competence, nonetheless criticised her for being the 'Margaret Thatcher' of the agency. It was politically inopportune to have someone with her economic views in the top post at such a critical time he suggested. As if to belie this reputation, Mrs Breuel spoke compassionately to the media of her 'great sympathy for the worries of people'. Her late father, Alvin Munchmeyer, a prominent Hamburg banker, instilled economic discipline in his children by demanding a strict accounting of how they spent pocket money, she has recalled. She studied political science in Hamburg, Oxford and Geneva and worked for a time in economic research posts in New York and Hamburg. Her reputation as a disciple of monetarist economist Mr Milton Friedman stemmed from extensive praise of him in her book, Unsaddling The Bureaucratic Nag. Mrs Breuel was a CDU member of the Hamburg legislature from 1970 to 1978 and served as economics minister of the state of Lower Saxony and its finance minister until she joined Treuhand last year.</p>

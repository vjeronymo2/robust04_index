			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Japan's Political Crisis: A faint smile as the knife goes in  -Robert Thomson observes a polite betrayal MR Tsutomu Hata smiled faintly last night as he took centre stage in the Japanese parliament and voted against his party to bring down the government. Before throwing in his lot with the opposition last night, Mr Hata, 58, bowed to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who sat sad-faced as the betrayal was played out in front of him. For a party rebel who has torn at the Liberal Democratic Party's seams, and was on the verge of creating a rival party last night, Mr Hata is mild-mannered and polite. When the time came to justify his actions, he spoke without a sense of elation, preferring to emphasise that the decision was not easily taken. 'It is a very difficult thing to have done,' he said. 'But we have reached a turning point in Japanese politics and the pressure for change is intense. What path we will take is something that our faction must now discuss.' Mr Hata draws his confidence from the perception that he represents the aspirations of ordinary Japanese. He is self-consciously populist, and has appeared on television in the company of showgirls and comedians, all in the interests of political reform. Having worked at a bus company for 10 years before entering politics, he dubbed himself the 'salaried worker MP' to distinguish himself from the career politicians and the sons of career politicians who dominate the ruling party. The image developed during a term as agriculture minister, when he cultivated the farm vote by touring the provinces, insisting that the rice market would be permanently closed to imports. His rural home town is in central Japan, and he felt at ease in the company of farmers. The coming election will test whether his perceptions of his political faction's role as the representative of the people are correct. It may be difficult for some Japanese to ignore the company he keeps. By Japanese political standards, Mr Hata is clean, but his colleague Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a former LDP secretary-general, is known as a backroom manipulator. Mr Ozawa has provided the numbers to give the Hata faction substance, but the credibility of his recent conversion to the cause of reform will be an issue during the election. Mr Ozawa and Mr Hata share a building in central Tokyo, but they lead separate lives, one still working behind the scenes, and the other working the Japanese media. The 34 faction members who joined Mr Hata in voting against the LDP are an odd collection, the pro-reform remnants of a larger faction which split late last year. There are the elders whose ruddy faces tell of late-night drinking and bargaining sessions, and for whom the events of last night are an unexpected thrill near the end of long careers. And there are the younger members, noticeably nervous when they arrived at Hata headquarters yesterday morning for the meeting at which they collectively decided to vote against the LDP. They will be vulnerable at the election now that they have left the comfortable hierarchy of the LDP, which would have delivered ministerial posts after a few more terms in office. Mr Hata is hoping for defections from other LDP factions in coming days to enlarge and strengthen his faction. Then he will need to gather the funds necessary to compete with the extensive resources of established factions, which is where the well-connected Mr Ozawa is supposed to come in. In the past, the LDP's factions have generally not been divided by ideology, but they have bickered over sharing the spoils of power. Mr Hata is also no ideologue. He believes in free trade, and the creation of a more transparent government. He has repeatedly argued that changes to the electoral system would only be the first stage of change, and should lead to an upheaval of the present political parties and the creation of a parliamentary system more responsive to emerging issues and less focused on factional whim. 'Reform will help to raise the people's awareness of politics. Reform will help to nurture real political parties, and it will help Japan to develop a more independent foreign policy and to take diplomatic initiatives,' he said this week. These are observations which play well in urban Japan, where dissatisfaction with the LDP is greatest. But the salaried worker MP could find that the most infertile political fields are those of rural Japan, where the support for the LDP is strongest and the vested interests run deep.</p>

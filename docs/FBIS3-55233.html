			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich at a meeting </F> with diplomatic corps in Minsk on 29 December]    [Text] Dear compatriots, ladies, gentlemen, colleagues!    Let me pass my most sincere greetings and wishes of  prosperity and happiness to you and the entire diplomatic corps.  I want to emphasize that I am extremely happy to have the  chance to meet you and share opinions with you on various issues  of bilateral relations and international problems.    I am grateful to you for the nice wishes and opinions that  you have repeatedly voiced at meetings with me and other Council  of Ministers representatives.    I sincerely hope that the spirit of mutual understanding,  friendship, and personal sympathy will prevail in our relations.  I am convinced that this will serve the interests of our states  and nations.    Due to the nature of your work you are well-informed about  the problems Belarus are experiencing. I do not want to conceal  the fact that we are living through hard times -- critical  processes in the economy are aggravating which has a negative  impact on the sociopolitical sphere and causes negative reaction  on the part of certain social groups. Many people have  difficulties comprehending what is going on, and demand that the  course of reform be abandoned.    We clearly see the seriousness of the current historic  period  and are doing our best to decently exit the situation.    Of course, the economy is not the only important factor. A  radical reshaping of the political and administrative systems is  under way that involves changes in mentality and ideology and  thus, the entire system of personal and social values.    At the same time, everyday mentality fails to follow these  processes, also because we have not formed a comprehensive  theoretical footing for the latter. This causes frustration and  dissatisfaction and optimistic thinking often gives way to  pessimism. Doubts continue to grow regarding the authenticity  of the path upon which the Republic has set out. Diametrically  opposing opinions are voiced -- some suggest orienting toward  the East, while others maintain that the key to resolving our  problems lies in the West.    With regard to this, I would like to answer one question  that  disturbs me: Does Belarus has its own foreign policy?    Yes, we have such a policy and its essence is not seeking  priorities from the so-called "class perspective." Its essence  is to be driven solely by national-regional interests.    It is based on refraining from using force or  threatening to use force.    As you know, the Republic of Belarus, having proclaimed  independence and won statehood, declared a ban on possessing  nuclear arms and ever since, has been consistently pursuing this  policy on the international arena.    Thus, we were the first among the former USSR  republics, and in general, among the world's nations, to  initiate nuclear disarmament without putting forward any  preconditions.    By doing this, we laid our own little brick into the common  foundation for European and international security. At the same  time, we are not expecting any gratitude from the world  community. The main issue for us is trust, mutual  understanding, and an opportunity for full-blooded international  cooperation.    These principled approaches determine the primary directions  of our foreign policy, based on our vision of world problems and  ways to resolve them. This does not depend on conjuncture --  this is a result of our convictions and the political evaluation  of the Republic's place and mission as a European state. This  is a form of our participation in resolving global international  problems.    We carefully examined the initiative voiced by NATO states  on  implementing a new concept of European security called  "Partnership for Peace." I believe that these issues will be  discussed in detail in the course of President Clinton's visit  to Belarus. We are ready for this, and we will try to be  reliable partners for our neighbors both in the East and the  West.  <H5>  On Domestic Situation </H5>   I have already said that our domestic situation is  complicated and contradictory. Its major peculiarity lies in  the fact that proclaimed democratic values and goals have not  received legislative footing. The lack of a precise scheme for  the division of powers often becomes the source of instability  and political opposition. Paradoxical situations arise when the  sprouts of the market economy are treated with an iron hand of  administrating, while the emerging entrepreneurship is fought as  dissidence. I mean the notorious reports on corruption.    What happened? In my opinion, certain forces, intentionally  or not, used data that lacked judicial evaluation to launch an  attack on democracy. These groupings decided to review the  process of democratic reform and reverse market changes. When  left and right radicalisms merge, this may initiate mob rule  which may block the Republic's path to the market, destroy  social accord, and hamper the process of political changes in  general.    Of course, all this should be submitted to an in-depth  analysis, but many people have already understood that the  government, just like the legislature, needs more reliable legal  and constitutional protection and immunity against cheap  populism and petty heroism.  <H5>  A Couple of Words on Our Economy </H5>   The socioeconomic development of Belarus has recently been  accompanied by further exacerbation of critical phenomena, the  shrinking of production and investments, inflation and  deregulation of the consumer market. This has led to a  deterioration in living standards. The main cause of the crisis  is the destruction of the single economic space of the former  USSR. However, there also exist domestic factors.    Due to well-known historic conditions, an abnormal  structure of production has developed in the Republic,  inadequate for the demands and purchasing power of our citizens.    The Belarusian economy is currently one of the most open  economies. The Republic exports 19 percent of its products,  importing 18 percent of consumer goods. For example, in 1992,  Belarus imported 100 percent of natural gas, coal, steel pipes,  cars, tractor trailers, wood processing machines, and so on.    Aside from this, high material and power outlays are the  typical traits of the Belarusian economy. The situation was not  that acute when the country received cheap raw materials,  semimanufactures, and power resources from Russia and the other  republics of the former USSR. Today, when prices for raw  materials and power have reached the world level and the quality  of Belarusian products does not meet international standards,  further development of the structure of the economy granting  competitiveness to just 3 percent of its products would lead to  complete bankruptcy.    Thus, the primary task currently facing the state is  global structural reshaping. We are trying to  exercise maximum control over this process to alleviate  inevitable accompanying hardships afflicting society.    With difficulty, so far, we have managed to achieve this.  Belarus has the lowest rates of reduction in major economic  indicators among all the CIS states with a similar socioeconomic  structure, although due to understandable reasons prices for  main power resources are five to 10 times higher in the Republic  than in Russia. This is the principal factor determining the  low exchange rate of the Belarusian "hare" as compared to the  Russian ruble.    Local peculiarities aggravate the situation. Among these, we  should first of all underline the demographic structure  unfavorable to economic development -- pensioners and elderly  represent a significant part of society. People from many  regions of the former USSR have often preferred to retire in  Belarus.    The second negative peculiarity is the unheard-of  concentration of the former Soviet Army's units and the  necessity to observe USSR's commitments in the field of  disarmament. Belarus is strictly implementing these commitments.    Third, we are continuing an exhausting battle against the  aftermath of the Chernobyl accident.    We are forced to direct huge financial resources to resolve  these problems, complicating and retarding the progress of  reform. However, we are steadily pursuing the course for  privatizing state property, demonopolizing industries, and  fundamentally reforming the credit and banking system.    We understand that unlike the deregulation of prices, these  systematic institutional changes cannot be carried out  overnight, even if the former enjoy sociopolitical acceptance on  the part of the people.    Serious problems emerge on our way. The "invisible" hand of  the market brings changes undesirable for society. This is  demonstrated by the experience of many countries living through  a transitional period. When prices are set free, the  application of Western-type monetary methods is often  inefficient and may bring opposite results.    The government has a concept as to how to resolve these  problems. This concept is based on the sober evaluation of our  potential and understanding of an active involvement of the  state in realigning the economy. Interaction with Russia  is the cornerstone of this concept.    You have probably noticed that the government needed civic  courage, resoluteness, and untraditional thinking to take some  of these measures. We have often had to conduct acute political  battles, debate with our opponents, and break through the lack  of understanding. We are absolutely positive that we took a  correct line in stipulating an economic union within the CIS  framework, a single ruble zone with Russia, and a coordinated  customs legislation. This will give our people the possibility  to live and work in a civilized manner.    To persuade the people, the government is forced to act as a  political organization, and sometimes perform similar functions.  It is not through coincidence that we are occasionally called a  "team" or even a "party." With regard to this, I want to  emphasize that we are carrying the burden of political  responsibility for the fate of the nation.    In light of this, the social orientation of West European  democratic and social-democratic parties seems most attractive  to us. The virtues of these parties are widely known. They  were the first to give a theoretical footing to building a  society of class peace, took an active part in eliminating the  postwar economic crisis in Europe, and substantially contributed  to the building of the states of law. Their cooperation on the  international arena has granted a lasting peace in Europe;  onetime enemies have been actively cooperating; economic  integration is being accompanied by a political one.    I believe that these achievements can be successfully  applied  on Belarusian soil after introducing appropriate corrections  given the new historic conditions.    Speaking in the town of Mir a year ago, I formulated the  government's economic and sociopolitical strategies. Ever  since, nobody has come up with an alternative program oriented  toward the interests of the people. This gives me confidence in  the correctness of the chosen path. I am ready to cooperate  with all the forces sharing these democratic and social values.    I hope for understanding and support from all political  forces loyal to the ideas of the national renaissance of the  Republic of Belarus.    I also count on your understanding and support.    Happy New Year! With all my heart I wish prosperity, peace,  and well-being to your nations.    I am addressing all the Belarusian citizens and compatriots  abroad with New Year greetings. I wish you good health,  happiness, and success in work for the benefit of our native  land.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Gardening (Plant of the Week): Betula ermanii This can be one of the most beautiful of the Asiatic birches but it is a very variable tree and it is necessary to get a good form of it. This will make a straight trunk 230 ft or more high, covered in white bark which peels in papery strips to reveal a pinkish layer of bark beneath. The side branches are not very long and are fairly upright so that the tree makes a rather narrow head very suitable for cultivation in gardens. It is hardy and grows well in all reasonably fertile soils provided they are well drained. Leaves are similar to those of our native silver birch tree. It is widely available from tree nurseries and sometimes from garden centres and should be selected for the good colour of its bark. There is a reliable variety named Grayswood Form.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Air pollution is on the increase AIR POLLUTION has been worsening recently, although levels are generally better than a decade ago, details in the Department of the Environment's 15th annual digest of environmental statistics show. The UK's emissions of carbon dioxide, a contributor to global warming, were 3 per cent higher in 1991 than in 1990, although they have fallen by a fifth in the past decade. Environmentalists fear the recent rise could jeopardise Britain's ability to meet international targets on global warming. Rising transport levels emerge as one of the worst environmental problems. Traffic emissions of nitrogen oxide rose by 73 per cent between 1981 and 1991, and emissions of black smoke by 86 per cent. The report adds: 'Poor air quality was recorded at all urban monitoring sites in 1991.' People are also increasingly concerned about noise. Complaints in England and Wales rose by 40 per cent in the year to March 1991 compared with the previous year. Scotland saw a rise of 8 per cent. There are some improvements, however. Sulphur dioxide emissions from industry have fallen during the decade and the UK consumption of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), implicated in damage to the ozone layer of the atmosphere, is sharply down. Recycling schemes have also won increasing support. Aluminium can recycling has risen to 0.2kg per person last year, a tenfold increase in the three years since the start of the national scheme. Recycling of steel cans rose in the same period from 0.82kg per person to 1.43kg. The number of UK beaches complying with European Community bacteria standards rose by 3.4 per cent to 328 last year, according to the National River Authority's annual report on bathing water, published yesterday.</p>

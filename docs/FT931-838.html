			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Daimler-Benz Two conclusions can be drawn from Daimler-Benz's plan to seek a New York listing. The first is that unification has created a long-term need for capital which is driving German companies to court overseas investors. That would imply a significant change towards an equity culture and a loosening of the banks' stranglehold on Germany's economy. Better treatment of shareholders would, over time, close the rating gap between German and US equity markets. The other possibility is that the US has compromised on its strict listing standards because of the NYSE's need to drum up extra business. Both elements have probably influenced Daimler's move but their relative weighting will only become clear after full details of the listing deal are unveiled next week. Daimler's 'disclosure' of DM4bn in reserves is less of a concession than it looks. It relates to the treatment of pension fund surpluses in subsidiaries but is unlikely to affect group figures. More important is whether Daimler is prepared to give quarterly segmental and geographical details of its business and, if so, what exemption from US accounting standards it has won in return. For the US to relax disclosure requirements simply to win new business for the NYSE could be counter-productive for all concerned. Daimler arguably needs capital after the acquisitions of recent years, and to finance its expansion into leasing. But its ability to expand its shareholder base depends on its level of disclosure not just on the listing. If Daimler grasps this nettle, then it is to be applauded. But German companies may not rush to follow suit. Giving up one's right to smooth profits is especially hard at the onset of a recession.</p>

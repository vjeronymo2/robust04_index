			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tender process does not lead to best solutions Sir, I wonder if organisations which invite consultants to tender for business are aware of an increasingly counter-productive trend. Tendering is becoming more widespread, particularly in the public sector under pressure to demonstrate that it is able to manage costs in a business-like fashion. Indeed, increasingly we are being asked not just to tender for work, but to spend a great deal of time compiling information in order to be placed on the list of those who might later be invited to tender. The words 'market testing' might thrill civil servants, but they send a chill of horror through the hearts of a great many small consultancy outfits. There is a strong feeling that responding to tenders in the 'softer' areas such as management development is in effect giving away free consultancy. This is very different from tendering to more technical specifications where it is entirely appropriate to compare costs of using one provider rather than another. Cost comparison is rarely the best means of evaluating tenders in non-technical areas. Tendering takes time, and time is what consultants sell. Time not only to put the response together, but to hold discussions with the inviting organisation so that it is offered what is believed to be the best solution. However, this is not charged to the inviting organisation - even travel expenses have to be absorbed - and therefore becomes a hidden cost to other organisations with which they work. This is grossly unfair. If those who can provide the best solutions are being deterred from offering them, something is going badly wrong. The original intention is not being achieved and some more creative thinking is required to provide an effective alternative that will encourage providers to encourage rather than put them off.

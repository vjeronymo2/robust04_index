			<p>CSO     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota -- In a crackdown on the drug  traffic, the Antinarcotics Police conducted a series of  operations resulting in the seizure, in several of the country's  cities, of a total of 1,754 chemical substances and elements  used for processing cocaine and other hallucinogens.    The operation, called "Volatil Uno," was carried out in the  Cundinamarca locality of Mosquera, and in the cities of  Medellin, Barranquilla, Cali, Pereira, Bucaramanga, Ibague, and  Cartagena.    The largest confiscation took place in the Atlantico  capital,  where over 1,014 tons of those products were seized.    It was reported from Bucaramanga that thousands of gallons  of  acids and hundreds of kg of other substances were confiscated  from a factory apparently being operated illegally. In  connection with it, however, the amounts of components stored  were found not to coincide with those registered by the supplier  firm.    Included among the components seized were butyl acetate,  ethyl acetate, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, ammonia,  butanol, both dense and light sodium carbonate, hexane, N.E.K.  [expansion not given], methanol, toluene, and different types of  solvents.    The police attached particular significance to the  confiscation of these types of precursors, because their control  is one of the fundamental points in the strategy devised by the  national government to battle the drug trafficking Mafias.</p>

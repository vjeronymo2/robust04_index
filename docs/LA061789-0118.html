			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POETS TO RAISE MONEY AT COMEDY STORE FOR CHILDREN'S AIDS FOUNDATION  </P> <P> For reasons known but to the Muse, the Los Angeles poetry scene, long dormant,  has begun to burgeon again, most notably under the inspirational aegis of a  group called Poetry in Motion.  </P> <P> PIM has attracted not only a host of prominent California poets but the sizable  support of celebrity votaries as well, many of whom join in the readings, some  from their own body of work.  </P> <P> Having outgrown its regular Tuesday night sessions at the ultrachic Helena's,  PIM recently moved to Heartbreak Cafe, only to overflow again and decamp to  Cafe Largo. On June 25, however, a benefit performance will be held at the  Comedy Store, 8433 Sunset Blvd., starting at 9 p.m. and contributing to the  Children's AIDS Foundation.  </P> <P> Tentatively scheduled are such local poets as Wanda Coleman, Austin Strass,  Jack Grapes, Hubert Selby Jr. and Lewis MacAdams. Among celebrities will be the  accomplished (and published) Macdonald Carey as well as Ally Sheedy, Justine  Bateman, Ed Begley Jr., Drew Barrymore, Dennis Christopher and Michael O'Keefe.  </P> <P> The price of tickets (a tax-deductible $20) will help relieve the suffering,  meet daily and emergency needs and strengthen the wills and hopes of children  infected with the AIDS virus through special projects tailored to the youths'  proclivities.  </P> <P> Tickets available at Ticketron locations; for nearest outlet, call (213)  642-4242.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 6 YEARS LATER, MCMARTIN CASE GOES TO JURY;  </P> <P> TRIAL: THE FIRST ARREST OCCURRED IN 1983 AND IT COULD TAKE MONTHS YET FOR THE  PANEL TO RENDER VERDICTS IN THE MOLESTATION CASE. IT HAS BEEN THE LONGEST AND  COSTLIEST CRIMINAL PROCEEDING IN HISTORY.  </P> <P> Six years after the first arrest in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case,  12 jurors -- 10 of whom are parents themselves -- gathered around an  eight-sided table Thursday to render judgment on the school's director and her  son, accused of sexually abusing 11 children.  </P> <P> The process could take months. It requires sifting through the testimony of 124  witnesses compiled over a 2 1/2-year period and weighing the painful, sometimes  bizarre, accounts given by the children against the defense's appeal to common  sense and the defendants' claim of innocence.  </P> <P> "It seems like a historic moment, but I'm too tired to enjoy it," Los Angeles  Superior Court Judge William Pounders said with a sigh after the jurors  adjourned to select a foreman and begin deliberations.  </P> <P> Pounders had expressed fears repeatedly that he would have to declare a  mistrial, as health and job problems forced him to release six of the original  18 regulars and alternates. By the end, the strain on the judge, the jury and  the litigants had become visible.  </P> <P> "All of the jurors are present on a day I think you may have felt would never  arrive," he told the panel as it assembled for final instructions. "But it has,  and as of today, we'll be turning the baton over to you . . . and we will sit  back and watch."  </P> <P> The judge then read 32 pages of jury instructions, some of which addressed  children's testimony specifically:  </P> <P> "Although, because of age and level of cognitive development, a child may  perform differently as a witness from an adult, that does not mean that a child  is any more or less credible a witness than an adult," he instructed. "You  should not discount or distrust the testimony of a child solely because he or  she is a child, nor should you believe such testimony solely because he or she  is a child."  </P> <P> When Pounders finished, the eight-man, four-woman panel retired to the  18-by-21-foot jury room, where it will decide the guilt or innocence of  defendants Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey.  </P> <P> Participants in the trial have said privately that the jurors' lack of  attention in recent days indicates they may have made up their minds already --  although not necessarily in unanimity.  </P> <P> Jurors will not be sequestered, but will be watched by a bailiff while in the  courthouse and escorted to and from lunch. Having been advised by Pounders to  keep working when things are going well -- and to take frequent breaks or go  home early when impasses occur -- the panelists will set their own daily  schedule.  </P> <P> The jury is to turn in a verdict on each of the 65 counts as it is reached. The  verdicts will be sealed and either read at intervals or when all have been  completed, Pounders said.  </P> <P> In the $15-million case -- the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in  history -- Ray Buckey, 31, faces 52 counts of molestation involving 11  youngsters who attended his family's nursery school in Manhattan Beach. His  mother, Peggy Buckey, 62, is charged with 12 counts of molestation involving  four children. Both are charged with a single shared count of conspiracy.  </P> <P> If convicted on all counts, both could be sentenced to life in prison.  </P> <P> In its simplest form, the case now boils down to a question of whether the jury  believes the testimony of the alleged victims, their parents, and physicians  who examined them, or that of the defendants and other former teachers at the  school.  </P> <P> The prosecution contends that the children were raped, sodomized, forced to  participate in oral copulation, play "naked games," engage in pornographic  photo sessions and satanic rituals, and were silenced by threats underscored by  animal mutilation.  </P> <P> The defense maintains that the children were programmed by therapists to  believe something bad had happened to them, that their stories defy common  sense, and that the medical evidence is unreliable and perhaps fabricated.  </P> <P> The case began in August, 1983, when the mother of a 2 1/2-year-old called  Manhattan Beach police after her son complained of rectal pain and she noticed  he had a red bottom and implicated "Mr. Ray." Two physicians found medical  evidence indicating he had been sodomized.  </P> <P> Ray Buckey was arrested and released, but the investigation continued --  eventually widening to include seven teachers at the prestigious seaside  school.  </P> <P> In March, 1984, the seven teachers, including elderly school founder and family  matriarch Virginia McMartin, were indicted by a county grand jury on 115  counts. That indictment was superseded by a 208-count complaint two months  later.  </P> <P> After an 18-month preliminary hearing, all seven were ordered to stand trial on  135 counts. But a week after the hearing ended, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner dropped  charges against five defendants, citing "incredibly weak evidence."  </P> <P> The trial began in April, 1987, with 100 counts against Ray Buckey and his  mother; the prosecution ultimately presented evidence on 65 counts.  </P> <P> Throughout, the proceedings were marked by bizarre twists and turns: unforeseen  delays, the capitulation of a prosecutor to the defense, the alcohol-related  death of the young mother who triggered the case, the suicide of a defense  investigator on the eve of his testimony, and the accidental drug overdose of  an uncharged suspect that occurred after several McMartin children implicated  him.  </P> <P> Courtroom argument was so heated and character attacks so hostile that the  judge commented several times that the case had "poisoned" everyone it had  touched.  </P> <P> In the end, it became a race against time, with Pounders prodding the attorneys  to wrap up testimony while there were still enough jurors left to deliberate.  </P></p>

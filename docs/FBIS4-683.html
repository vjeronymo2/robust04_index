			<p>BFN     [Text] The DP [Democratic Party] has come under attack at  the University of the Western Cape [UWC]. The party's PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region chairman, Mr. Tony  Leon, narrowly escaped injury after he abandoned a lunch-hour  meeting. The SABC's cameraman, Ezra Zweli, was slightly injured  while trying to film the event. Gerhard Grobler has the story.    [Begin recording] [Grobler] It started off peacefully, but  it  soon became apparent that the large crowd would not afford Mr.  Leon the opportunity to speak. SASCO [South African Students'  Congress] President Nale Mashapa stepped in. He appealed for  calm. He was followed by the university's rector, Prof. Jaques  Gerwel, and ANC NEC [National Executive Committee] member Kader  Asmal.    [Asmal] Wave your flags, ask your questions, hold up your  banners, but we must allow every voice that is entitled in the  elections to be heard, to be heard in this university.    [Grobler] An uneasy calm descended over the meeting, before  students continued to disrupt Mr. Leon's speech. The DP decided  to call the meeting off. Mr. Leon and security men moved out of  the building to a waiting car. They sped off. They were forced  to reverse across an open stretch of grass with hundreds of  students chasing them. Stones, cans, and other objects smashed  into the car as they fled to safety. This is undoubtedly one of  the worst instances of political intolerance that we've seen in  the Western Cape up to now. There was a very real possibility  that Mr. Leon could have been seriously injured. Will the DP  return to the UWC campus for the umpteenth time to try and  practice their democratic right? It seems unlikely. [end  recording]</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA HAD ITS OWN ZAIBATSU IN EARLY DAYS  </P> <P> I found Michael Schrage's article ("Applying Zaibatsu Principles in the U.S.,"  March 8) fascinating.  </P> <P> I had just read a history of Bechtel Co.  </P> <P> ("Friends in High Places" by Laton McCartney) that commented that the Bechtels  and other companies associated with the six companies in the Boulder Dam  project made up a California zaibatsu. They clearly fit Schrage's description  of the "developmental conglomerate," associating more informally than formally,  pooling resources and jointly pursuing projects of a scope that none could do  alone.  </P> <P> Furthermore, they did this at a time when California and the West were short of  capital and when Western companies were at a political disadvantage for  securing federal contracts or Wall Street financing.  </P> <P> I have always been dissatisfied with discussions of this group that tried to  fit them into the traditional "robber baron" or "military/industrial complex"  models (although in the postwar period Bechtel, at least, certainly conforms to  the latter image). This approach, somehow, seems to miss the creative and  critical role that they played in California's emergence as a modern industrial  state.  </P> <P> LESLIE M. ZOMALT  </P> <P> Solvang  </P></p>

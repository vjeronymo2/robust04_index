			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONTROLLER REPORT RAPS TREASURER'S OFFICE, CITES 11 POSSIBLE TAMPERINGS  </P> <P> A city controller's report today found "discrepancies" between the accounts of  Mayor Tom Bradley and Far East National Bank Chairman Henry Hwang regarding a  pivotal telephone conversation about city deposits with the bank.  </P> <P> In releasing an audit of the city treasurer's office, Controller Rick Tuttle  also criticized the department for numerous management defects and said he  found that 11 competitive bid sheets, including one involving Far East, may  have been altered through illegal tampering.  </P> <P> Tuttle said "there was a major breakdown in internal control" within the  treasurer's office March 22 this year, the day following Hwang's telephone call  to Bradley, who had been paid $18,000 in 1988 as an adviser to the bank.  </P> <P> Following Hwang's call to Bradley and the mayor's conversation with Treasurer  Leonard Rittenberg, the treasurer's office reinstated a $1-million time deposit  with Far East that had expired and added another $1 million.  </P> <P> Hwang told investigators in sworn testimony that he called the mayor to ask his  help because he had learned that the city was removing a $1-million deposit  from Far East. He said he had no recollection of discussing other banks or  broader city policy with the mayor.  </P> <P> Bradley testified that Hwang had asked him whether it was true that the city  was withdrawing funds from "all banks." The mayor said he then called  Rittenberg because of concerns that the city was in "serious desperate  financial straits."  </P> <P> Bradley and Rittenberg have both said the mayor did not try to pressure the  treasurer into making deposits with Far East.  </P> <P> Someone in the treasurer's office later tried to cover up a notation showing  that the mayor had inquired about Far East. A bid sheet was also altered to  hide the fact that the $2 million was deposited without competitive bids from  other banks in violation of office policy.  </P> <P> Tuttle's report found that 11 of 53 other time deposits reviewed by his office  showed use of correction fluid that "may indicate falsification and tampering  of public records," which is a felony. The other deposits did not involve Far  East.  </P> <P> The controller said police have custody of the altered documents and are  investigating whether there were criminal violations.  </P> <P> "Our audit of the treasurer's office has disclosed that the office has major  weaknesses that has resulted in violations of their system of internal control  on competitive bidding and review procedures," Tuttle said.  </P> <P> The treasurer's office has been the subject of at least three major audits or  investigations in the past six months -- all prompted by the actions of  Bradley, Rittenberg and his staff in the days following Hwang's March 21  telephone call to the mayor. Each of the reports has been strongly critical of  operations within the treasurer's office.  </P> <P> While Bradley was cleared by City Atty. James K. Hahn last week of any criminal  wrongdoing involving Far East and other business relationships, Hahn criticized  the mayor for lax ethical standards in his outside dealings. Hahn also filed a  civil suit against Bradley for failing to publicly disclose, as required by  law, six of his business investments.  </P> <P> Also contributing to this article were Times staff writers Frederick M.

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / School role seen for Careers Service Bids to provide the Careers Service would be welcome from private and state schools, Miss Ann Widdecombe, the employment minister, said last night in a written answer. Miss Widdecombe said expressions of interest should be made by the end of the month. Bids for running the Careers Service from April next year were likely to be invited by the autumn. Local education authorities were stripped last year of their supervisory role for the service. The government wants a variety of local organisations to provide the new service.</p>

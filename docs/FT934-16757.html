			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Technology: No end to MiniDisc madness Sony has launched a series of MiniDisc products which take miniaturisation one stage further with a 50 per cent reduction in the size and number of components used. The latest MiniDisc offerings, which follow a first-generation range launched last year, include a portable MiniDisc player/recorder that is about half the size and weighs 45 per cent less than its predecessor. The reduction in size and weight was made possible by using smaller and fewer integrated circuits for digital signal processing and by the miniaturisation of other components. At the same time, Sony has been able to increase the density of its chip boards and thus reduce their size by some 40 per cent. The latest range uses lithium ion batteries which have the advantage over the nickel cadmium batteries used before of offering greater reliability and longer play-back time - two and a half hours, or seven and a half when they are used in conjunction with alkaline batteries. Less than a year since its launch, MiniDisc is selling roughly twice as fast as CDs did at a comparable stage after their introduction, Sony says. In the 10 months between the launch in November last year and this August, 300,000 MiniDisc units have been shipped worldwide. Sony's shipment figures also appear to disprove the argument that the lack of compatibility with existing systems would discourage consumers, particularly in Europe, from buying MiniDisc players which do not play any existing medium. However, Sony's shipments to Europe, at roughly a third of the 300,000 total, have been comparable to shipments in Japan and the US. Whether MiniDisc takes off or not will depend, however, largely on the availability of recorded discs and on a substantial reduction in price. Sony says 1,200 titles are already available, but this is far behind the 17,600 CD titles launched last year in Japan alone. As for price, the Y55,000 (Pounds 340) cost of a playback unit - and Y75,000 for a recodable player - seem slightly extravagant in today's penny-pinching environment.</p>

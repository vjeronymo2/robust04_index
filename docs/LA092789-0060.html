			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE REJECTS INCREASE IN 'STAR WARS' SPENDING;  </P> <P> SOVIET VIEW THAT PLAN WON'T IMPEDE ARMS TALKS MAY HAVE WEAKENED SUPPORT  </P> <P> The Senate dealt a serious blow Tuesday to the "Star Wars" missile defense  system by rejecting any increase in spending for the program in the fiscal year  starting Oct. 1.  </P> <P> It was the first time that the Senate has cast a vote against "Star Wars," a  missile interceptor program known officially as the Strategic Defense  Initiative.  </P> <P> The 66-34 vote reflected a dramatic deterioration in support for "Star Wars" in  Congress, apparently hastened by the Kremlin's recent decision to de-emphasize  the issue of defensive nuclear weapons in U.S.-Soviet arms control  negotiations.  </P> <P> By rejecting an increase of $300 million proposed by Sens. Malcolm Wallop  (R-Wyo.) and John W. Warner (R-Va.), the Senate accepted the decision of the  Appropriations Committee to set the "Star Wars" spending level at $4 billion,  or slightly less than this year. And that figure is certain to be cut even  further in negotiations with the House, which has voted to cut "Star Wars"  spending to $3.1 billion.  </P> <P> The action came as a surprise to "Star Wars" supporters, who had anticipated  that the Wallop-Warner proposal would pass easily and thus strengthen the  bargaining position of senators in negotiations with the House on a final  spending figure for SDI. To improve their chances of winning, they had even  added some increased spending for a number of popular conventional weapons.  </P> <P> The Council for a Livable World, a leading anti-nuclear group, hailed the  surprise vote as "another nail in the 'Star Wars' coffin."  </P> <P> The Senate action virtually guarantees that President Bush will receive less  money for "Star Wars" in fiscal 1990 than he did in the current year -- the  first real cut that the controversial program has suffered since it was  initiated by former President Ronald Reagan six years ago.  </P> <P> Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), a leading "Star Wars" critic, predicted that  the House and Senate would settle on a figure of $3.6 billion for the program.  He also predicted that funding would decline in future years, making it  impossible for the Administration to achieve its goal of deploying a nuclear  defense system by 1994.  </P> <P> "People are just finally running out of enthusiasm for this program," Johnston  said. "This is just a dose of reality. I am sure that this Congress is going to  bring this program back to reality."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loss of Support Observed  </P> <P> Even before the vote, senators on both sides of the aisle had observed that  "Star Wars" was losing its traditional support in Congress as a result of  recent improvements in U.S-Soviet relations, stiff competition for government  dollars and what some members view as Bush's lackluster support for the  program.  </P> <P> In a floor speech, Johnston argued that the Administration had failed to even  define the missile defense system, despite the expenditure of $20 billion on  research since Reagan initiated it. "They cannot to this day tell you what the  purpose of SDI is or what it will look like," he said.  </P> <P> As proof of the Administration's alleged failure to adequately explain "Star  Wars," SDI opponents cited a recent statement by Vice President Dan Quayle in  an interview with The Times. Quayle said that Reagan's original promise of an  impenetrable shield against Soviet missiles had been nothing more than  "political jargon."  </P> <P> Furthermore, Johnston argued that the need to fund "Star Wars" had been reduced  by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's announcement over the  weekend that Moscow no longer sees U.S. development of "Star Wars" as an  obstacle to negotiating a treaty reducing the superpower arsenal of strategic  nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> "The Soviets are not so concerned about SDI anymore," Johnston said. "I think  it is a recognition of the fact that they are not so concerned about the  progress we're making" in developing a missile defense system.  </P> <P> "They are really not afraid of the program anymore," Johnston later added.  </P> <P> But their strategy clearly backfired, with many Senate members seeming to be as  opposed to the "sweeteners" as they were to the increase in "Star Wars"  spending. Furthermore, some senators appeared to be convinced by the argument  of Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.) that the House would never accept the  $4.3-billion spending level proposed by Wallop and Warner.  </P> <P> "Voting to put this extra SDI money in here is a complete waste of time," Dixon  said. "It can't possibly happen."  </P> <P> But the sentiment against added spending for space-age weapons did not extend  to the controversial B-2 Stealth bomber. Shortly after voting against an  increase for SDI, the Senate voted, 71 to 29, against a proposal by Sen.  Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) that would have forbidden the Air Force to buy more  than 13 of the bombers.  </P> <P> The Senate also voted, 65 to 34, for a "reassessment" of the current commitment  of 43,000 troops to South Korea. By accepting this amendment, the Senate turned  aside a competing proposal by Sens. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) and Johnston that  would have mandated the withdrawal of 10,000 troops from Korea.  </P> <P> It was the first time in this decade that Congress has considered a proposal to  limit troop strength in Korea, and supporters of the Bumpers-Johnston proposal  viewed it as the opening shot in what they expect will be a heated debate on  the subject over the next few years.  </P> <P> Bumpers said the United States cannot justify such a costly commitment of U.S.  troops in the area, especially when the South Koreans are reducing the  percentage of their own gross national product that they are spending on  defense.  </P> <P> "If South Korea is so terrified of North Korea, why don't they spend the money  to have another 400,000 troops under arms?" he asked. He said they would rather  rely on "Uncle Sugar . . . Uncle Sucker."  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, the Senate voted, 86 to 14, to reject a plan to reconsider  the decision of a federal commission to close 86 military bases and to scale  down five other bases. The base closing decision was based on the Pentagon's  expressed need to reduce defense spending in future years.  </P> <P> The vote came as Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney was threatening to close even  more military bases to meet future cuts in defense spending imposed on the  Pentagon by the Democrat-controlled Congress.  </P> <P> "Given all the demands to redirect dollars from the defense budget to other  areas, I've got no choice but to find ways to close additional bases," Cheney  said.  </P> <P> SOVIETS INVITED: U.S. offers to allow Soviets to tour TRW "Star Wars" plant in  Orange County.

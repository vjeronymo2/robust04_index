			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hays expands in Pounds 32m German acquisition: Services group to benefit from European unity HAYS, the UK business services group, has furthered its pan-European ambitions by acquiring a national distribution business in Germany. Hays will pay an initial Pounds 32m in cash for a 75.1 per cent stake in Mordhurst, a private company with more than 500 employees and operations throughout Germany, including the former East Germany. Mordhurst, based in Kiel, specialises in multi-user warehousing and next-day delivery for manufacturers of car parts, agricultural chemicals, oils, office products and wine and spirits. Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman of Hays, said: 'We believe that the current recession in Germany will accelerate the trend towards the use of third party distribution contractors such as Mordhurst, as has been the case in the UK and France.' Hays, which in the UK distributes for retailers such as J Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer, last year paid Pounds 37.5m for Fril, a French distribution company with a national network. Mr Frost said: 'We will now be able to offer pan-European manufacturing and retail customers a comprehensive distribution service operating on both a dedicated and multi-user basis.' Last year Mordhurst made pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.5m on turnover of Pounds 64.8m. It has net assets of Pounds 10m and borrowings of Pounds 8m. The acquisition will increase Hays' gearing from 30 to 55 per cent. The remaining 24.9 per cent of Mordhurst's equity is owned by Mr Hermann Rothert, managing director, who will continue to run the business. Hays has a profit-related option to acquire his stake from 1998, for a maximum of Pounds 34m. Mr Frost said: 'As Germany recovers from recession, we expect the economies of eastern Europe to grow particularly strongly. German manufacturers will take advantage of this growth and are expected increasingly to use third party contract distribution specialists to provide an efficient service throughout Germany and into eastern Europe.' On current trading, Mr Frost said a number of the group's businesses had seen clear, measurable signs of recovery in the UK. Hays shares closed 5p higher at 239p.</p>

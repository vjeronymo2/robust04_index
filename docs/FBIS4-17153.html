			<p>BFN     [Text] The speaker of the Russian State Duma Ivan Rybkin  stated that he not disappointed with the discussion of a draft  treaty on civil accord in the lower chamber of parliament on  Thursday. Speaking to journalists, he said that speeches by  deputies were "adequate considering what is happening in the  country."    Rybkin considers that it is far from certain that political  parties at their conferences, plenums and congresses scheduled  for this weekend will support positions of their parliamentary  factions which spoke against signing a civil accord agreement.    "Having been to the most remote regions of the country,  where  electricity appeared only in the `70s, I get convinced that  nobody wants conflict, people are seeking accord," the speaker  pointed out.    Rybkin said that during his meeting with the president  scheduled for April 22 at 15:00 he intends to discuss with Boris  Yeltsin a further course of debates over the draft agreement.    "This is very difficult issue. We should sew with a thin  needle, and not to take a pitchfork and thrust it in deputies'  sides," the speaker of the State Duma noted.</p>

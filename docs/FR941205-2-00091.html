The Variable Account is a separate account registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. The Variable Account consists of several subaccounts (``Subaccounts''), each investing solely in a corresponding portfolio of the Endeavor Series Trust (``Series Fund'' or ``Series Fund Portfolios''), or in shares of WRL Growth Portfolio (``WRL Growth Portfolio''), a portfolio within the WRL Series Fund, Inc.'s (``WRL Fund''). Both the Series Fund and the WRL Fund are registered open-end management investment companies of the series type. Shares of the Series Fund Portfolios and the WRL Growth Portfolio will be sold to the Separate Account at net asset value. Series Fund Portfolios and the WRL Growth Portfolio are responsible for all of their respective expenses, including applicable investment advisory fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

The Contracts are individual flexible premium variable annuity contracts offered in connection with retirement plans that may qualify for favorable Federal income tax treatment (``Qualified Plans'') or on a non-tax qualified basis (``Non-Qualified Plans''). A registration statement on Form N&hyph;4 to register the Contracts under the Securities Act of 1933 has been filed with the Commission. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants state that the Contracts currently are being issued by International Life Investors Insurance Company (``ILI'') through its ILI Endeavor Variable Annuity Account (``ILI Separate Account''), and that the AUSA Contracts are identical to the ILI Contracts except for the identity of the depositor and the issuing separate account. Applicants further state that ILI intends to transfer its variable annuity business to AUSA Life through an exchange offer to be made in compliance with the requirements of Rule 11a&hyph;2 of the 1940 Act. Applicants represent that their request for exemptive relief is identical in all material respects to the relief previously granted ILI and the ILI Separate Account in connection with the ILI Contracts. Both ILI and AUSA Life are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of AEGON USA, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AEGON n.v. and, thus, affiliates of each other. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moldovan President, Mircea Snegur, has joined the  Agrarian Democratic Party, INTERFAX was told by sources close to  the Republic's leadership.    At the parliamentary elections on 27 February, the Agrarian  Democratic Party won a substantial victory gaining 56 out of 104  seats in parliament. It put together the government and other  structures of the executive power.    After the elections the president repeatedly said that the  Party was capable of solving the problems facing Moldova and  that it could be considered a party of renaissance with a  promising future.    In an interview in the newspaper "Zemlya i Lyudi" (Land and  People), Snegur made it clear that he was prepared to seek  re-election relying on the support of the Party.    Political observers believe that the president entered the  party to rely on its force in the current transitional period.    One of the leaders of the Agrarian Democratic Party, Vice  Chairman of Parliament Nikolay Andronik told INTERFAX that the  Party backs the current political course of President Snegur.    Prime Minister Andrey Sangeli and speaker of parliament Petr  Luchinskiy are also connected in this way or other with the  ruling party. The latter is not a Party member but stood for  elections on the ticket of the Agrarian Democratic Party and  repeatedly said that he shared the aims of the party.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Sunleigh buys Maclaren for Pounds 19.2m Lazy babies, who enjoy a bit of sailing and golf, will be able to buy all their vehicles from Sunleigh after its acquisition of Maclaren Group. The maker of Powakaddy motorised golf trolleys and Laser sailing dingies yesterday announced plans to pay up to Pounds 19.2m for Maclaren, the manufacturer of baby buggies and pushchairs. Founded 30 years ago by the late Mr Owen Finlay Maclaren, an aeronautical engineer, the group also makes golf trolley wheels. But Mr Alan Hancock, Sunleigh's chief executive, insisted there was rather more to the deal than that. 'The enlarged group will cover three distinct consumer durable sectors but the fundamental characteristics, cultures and skills of the business are very similar.' To fund the acquisition Sunleigh is increasing its share capital more than fourfold with a conditional placing of 320.1m new shares at 6p. Shareholders can apply for 96.5m of these on a 1-for-1 basis at the same price. Sunleigh is buying the business from the management team who acquired it in 1990 from BET, which in turn bought it as part of its Hestair acquisition. Hestair bought it from the Maclaren family for Pounds 12.9m in 1988. It made an operating profit of Pounds 2.3m on turnover of Pounds 26m in the year to August. Trading in Sunleigh's shares, suspended at 8p on the USM last week, should resume on the Official List on June 30.</p>

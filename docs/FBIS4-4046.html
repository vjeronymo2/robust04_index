			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "At the Provincial Meeting on Media and </F> Ideological Work, Li Zemin Stressed the Need To Do a Good Job in  Media and Ideological Work by Proceeding From the Overall  Situation of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics"]    [Text] On the morning of 8 March, the provincial party  committee held a provincial meeting on media and ideological  work in Hangzhou. Li Zemin, provincial party committee  secretary, attended and spoke at the meeting. He emphatically  pointed out: Comrades of party committees and government  departments at various levels and the media and ideological  front must understand the extremely important nature of media  and ideological work in carrying out the strategy of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and implementing the  party's basic line in an all-round way. Under the new situation  of building a socialist market economic structure, we must take  a clear-cut stand on the task, content, and battle front of  media and ideological work, on what should be publicized and  advocated and what should not be allowed, and on what should be  resisted and opposed and what should be encouraged. We must pay  special attention to guiding theoretical study, public opinion,  social customs, and the creation of nourishment of the mind. We  should effectively strengthen and improve ideological and  political work at the grass-roots level.    The meeting was presided over by Lu Zhangong, provincial  party committee deputy secretary . Liu Xirong, Li Jinming, and  Liang Pingbo, Standing Committee members of the provincial party  committee, attended the meeting.    Li Zemin fully affirmed the work and achievements made by  workers on the media and ideological front in the province. He  said: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, reform, opening up, and economic and social  development in this province have developed, the people have  emancipated and changed their minds through explorations and  creations, the broad masses of media and ideological workers  have worked hard and played a great role in improving and  strengthening media and ideological work with great vitality.  The media and ideological work have vigorously promoted the  people's ideological emancipation and change of concept, created  a favorable public opinion for speeding up reform and opening  up, and promoted economic development. The media and  ideological work have united the party and the people's hearts;  have protected social stability; have promoted healthy social  customs; and have provided a powerful spiritual motive force and  ideological guarantee as well as powerful intellectual support  and favorable public opinion in the society and a good  environment for carrying out reform and opening up.    Li Zemin said: At present, there is an unprecedented good  trend in reform, opening up, and economic construction in  Zhejiang like other places of the country. However, in the  course of making progress, we have also met with some new  situations and contradictions. To maintain this good trend in  carrying out reform and development and to overcome difficulties  and contradictions on our advancing road, we must implement the  policy put forward by the party Central Committee for "seizing  the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting  development, and maintaining stability," and correctly handle  the relations between reform, development, and stability. Media  and ideological work should be carried out in light of the  overall situation. Li Zemin called on media and ideological  workers to proceed with their work by keeping their minds on the  overall situation of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and to consider the following points as their  guiding principles: 1) Taking economic construction as the  central task; 2) persisting in being responsible to the people  as well as the party; 3) adhering to and vigorously advocating  the main theme while allowing diversification; and 4) keeping to  democratic principle and the policy of explaining things to the  masses.    Li Zemin also put forward four correct ways and one basic  task for implementing the guidelines of the national work on  media and ideological work, further implementing the "Zhejiang  provincial program for building socialist spiritual  civilization," and doing a good job in media and ideological  work in Zhejiang in the future.    Earnestly organize the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  conscientiously provide a correct theoretical guidance. Party  committees at all levels should take theoretical study  seriously, make the study of Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping the central element, and combine it  with the study of the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee and policies, laws, and  regulations related to socialist market economy. We must link  the study of theory with practice and our efforts to implement  this year's general task and to study, investigate, and grasp  new situations and resolve new problems. We must continue to  make use of the party committee's core study group system to  improve the quality and results of the study. We must earnestly  carry out the theoretical education and training of party  members and cadres. Comrades in the propaganda and ideological  departments should take the lead in studying theory deeper and  better. They should do a good job in theoretical study and  propaganda. Under the current circumstances, every front must  serve and subordinate itself to the party's general task.  Particularly, it should earnestly study and comprehensively  understand Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important thinking on reform,  development, and stability and use it to guide work in every  field.    -- Create a favorable public opinion for deepening reform,  promoting development, and maintaining stability, and earnestly  guide public opinion. Party committees, propaganda departments,  news media, and publishing units must guide public opinion well  with a strong sense of responsibility and work hard to create a  public opinion conducive to reform, opening up, and economic  development; to the building of socialist spiritual  civilization, democracy, and a legal system; and to promoting  national unity, easing people's minds, and promoting social and  political stability. Foremost, we must clearly recognize the  situation; understand the overall task; grasp well relations  between reform, development, and stability and between the  partial and general interests; and do our best to truthfully  reflect problems. Second, we must keep ourselves in touch with  reform, opening up, and economic construction and with the  masses and real life. Third, we must use a variety of  propaganda forms and typical examples to guide the masses, avoid  the tone of teaching, and carry out our work in a way loved by  the masses. Fourth, we must help supervise public opinion,  avoid confusing it, focus on resolving practical issues, and  settle and resolve conflicts. Fifth, we must strictly observe  propaganda discipline and differentiate between internal and  external consumption [nei wai you bie 0355 1120 2589 0446].    In light of this year's situation and task, we must  emphasize  the following in guiding public opinion: First, we must change  the ideology guiding economic work. We must shift from the  previous practice of doing things blindly on a large scale and  of expanding our businesses and managing them loosely to one of  optimizing structures, improving qualities, raising efficiency,  and developing externally. Second, we must stabilize and  strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the  economy. The entire party and society must attach importance to  agriculture and protect and support its development. We must  maintain stability in the total output of grain and balance  between regions. We must gradually establish a macroeconomic  regulation and control mechanism to strengthen, protect, and  support agriculture. We must work hard to overcome the relative  low economic returns from growing grain and guide the peasants  onto the path of intensive management in agriculture to benefit  from the economies of scale. Third, we must vigorously promote  reform in five major areas. We must guide the masses to  correctly understand reform and ardently support and actively  take part in it. We must guide enterprises to adapt themselves  to changing external environments; to explore and experiment  boldly; to become independent socialist commodity producers and  dealers, responsible for their own profits or losses and for  their own decisions about whether to expand or not; and to enter  the market. Fourth, we must attach importance to strengthening  correct guidance on flash-point social issues, do more work to  promote stability, and truthfully report what we have done and  accomplished to win the masses' understanding and support.    Actively advocate good social ethics and earnestly guide it  to achieve the goal of bringing up a new generation of socialist  people with ideals, morality, knowledge, and discipline. To  achieve the goal of bringing up such a new generation, we must  make patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and Comrade Jiang  Zemin's 64-character pioneering spirit the central elements of  education and set different demands on different people at  different levels. We must pay close attention to guiding  people, especially juveniles, to cultivate correct idealism,  faith, and outlook on world, life, and value; to oppose money  worshiping, pleasure-seeking, and ultra-individualism; and to  resist the corrosive effects of decadent capitalist and  feudalist ideas. Society, school, and family must closely  coordinate with each other, earnestly summarize their  experience, promptly popularize effective educational forms and  methods to earnestly carry out this work. We must promote  traditional Chinese ethics such as making selfless dedication,  acting heroically to promote justice, supporting the poor and  people in need, and taking pleasure in helping others. We must  promote truth, goodness, and beauty and denounce falseness,  ugliness, and evil. We must concentrate our efforts on changing  prevailing habits and customs in the countryside and advocate  healthy and rewarding lifestyle. We must adopt multiple  measures to curb the spread of such evil practices as holding  wedding ceremonies and funerals in a big way, engaging in feudal  superstition, and gambling. We must guarantee religious  freedom, advocate atheism, strengthen the management of  religions, and actively guide religions to adapt themselves to  socialism. We must extensively launch cultural activities among  the masses and promote the development of cultural activities in  communities. We must make cultural activities in enterprises  our focus and advance cultural activities in villages and towns,  campuses, and homes to mold people's temperament. We must  integrate cultural development in communities with education in  professional and social ethics and with the building of  civilized units. We must bring about the improvement of our  social ethics through measures implemented in various regions  and trades and professions.    -- Work hard to create more and better spiritual products to  satisfy people's cultural needs, and earnestly guide their  creation. We must uphold the policy of grasping two links at the  same time, attaching equal importance to both. We must promote  the creation of outstanding and healthy spiritual products to  bring prosperity to our cultural market and at the same time,  pay attention to managing and cleaning up our cultural market to  improve people's tastes in appreciating beauty and mold their  spirits. We must work hard to create high-taste spiritual  products to bring prosperity to the cultural market. We must  encourage cultural workers to immerse themselves among the  masses and penetrate deep into life to actively create spiritual  products that are healthy in content, particularly products that  eulogize reform, opening up, and modernization and are  artistically appealing. Each year we must produce a large  number of outstanding motion pictures, television programs,  dramas, operas, music, dance, fine arts, and literary works that  are loved by the masses. We must continue to carry out the  project of creating spiritual products that are outstanding in  five areas, and we must earnestly organize cultural activities  on major holidays. We must carry out the work of eliminating  pornography by strengthening the management of the cultural  market, focusing on the management of the publication of books,  newspapers, magazines, motion pictures, television programs, and  audio and video tapes, as well as performances and  entertainment. We must regulate the cultural market by  controlling both production and circulation.    -- Strengthening and improving grass-roots ideological and  political work. This year particular emphasis must be laid on  bringing into full play political advantages to correctly handle  contradictions among the people and effectively strengthen  grass-roots ideological and political work. To ensure a good  job in the work of this aspect, it is necessary to, first of  all, clarify the principle for pooling efforts and achieving a  common understanding; second, to adhere to an effective method  of guidance for clearing contradictions, neither sidestepping  nor aggravating them; third, to emphasize, understand, and  reflect the truth so as to obtain a real good grasp of  situations; fourth, to stress the need to establish a  responsibility system at each level for solving contradictions  at the grass roots in the embryonic stage without reporting them  to higher authorities; and fifth, to urge leading cadres to  improve their style of work, to forge close ties with the  masses, and to conduct ideological work in light of solving  practical problems for ordinary people. This year, ideological  and political work in rural areas should be focused on  stabilizing the role of agriculture as the foundation of  national economy; on striving to win a bumper grain harvest; on  continuing to develop agriculture toward a pattern of high  yields, high quality, and high efficiency; and on increasing  incomes of peasants; so as to harness their enthusiasm, protect  their interests, and maintain stability in rural areas. In  enterprises, ideological and political work should be carried  out with a clear objective in mind along with the progress in  establishing a modern enterprise system and on the basis of  different ownership structures, organizational forms, and  operation conditions. A special effort must be made to conduct  ideological and political work in enterprises experiencing  hardships to guide their workers and staff to heighten the  spirits and overcome difficulty while doing everything possible  to help them tide over difficulty, thereby safeguarding  stability of enterprises. In schools, it is necessary to pay  close attention to carrying out ideological and political work  among teachers and students, and to ensure the stability of  schools of higher learning, in particular.    Li Zemin emphasized: Propaganda departments and, even more,  party committees at various levels are duty-bound to strengthen  propaganda and ideological work. Under the current situation of  establishing a socialist market economic structure, party  committees at all levels should bear in mind the ideology of  "grasping two links at the same time." We should focus  attention on reform, development, and stability, and attach as  much importance to propaganda and ideological work as to  economic work. We should put propaganda and ideological work on  the top of the agenda, conducting the work several times a year  to analyze the situation, to keep abreast of social trends and  ideological traits of the masses, to publicize their work plans  and focal points, and to outline tasks and measures. In  conducting propaganda and ideological work, the provincial,  city, prefectural, and county party committees should discuss  and deal with major issues related primarily to direction,  including the direction of theory, of public opinions, of social  trends, and of intellectual products; and should ensure that  propaganda and ideological work develop along the correct  direction. We should pay close attention to the overall quality,  and show concern and support for the input into propaganda and  cultural undertakings and the construction of their facilities.  We should attach importance to the pattern and adopt policies  to foster a rational pattern and to encourage intellectual  products to reflect the spirit of our times. We should stress  coordination and pool the efforts of the press, publications,  radio, television, and other cultural departments. We should  concern themselves with reform, improve the party and  government's leadership system and method of propaganda and  ideological work, support the reform of propaganda and cultural  undertakings, and invigorate propaganda and ideological work.  We should pay close attention to personnel and continually  enhance their ideological and political awareness and  professional competence by supporting them politically,  ideologically, and in their work and everyday life. By doing  so, we can bring into full play the talent and wisdom of  ideological and political workers and enable younger ones to  grow to maturity quicker.    In the afternoon, Liang Pingbo, Standing Committee member  and  director of the Propaganda Department of the provincial party  committee, relayed the guidelines of the national propaganda and  ideological work conference.    The meeting was attended by deputy secretaries of all city  (prefectural) and county party committees in charge of  ideological work and their propaganda department directors;  leaders of lecture groups, foreign publicity office directors,  and editors-in-chief of party newspapers of all city  (prefectural) party committees; party committee officials of  enterprises and schools of higher learning affiliated with the  provincial government; officials of work committees for organs  under the provincial party committee and the provincial  government, for schools of higher learning, and for enterprises;  and responsible persons of the propaganda departments of the  Provincial Trade Union Council, the Provincial Communist Youth  League Committee, and the Provincial Women's Federation.    The meeting was also attended by representatives to a  provincial conference of cultural bureau directors on radio and  television propaganda work and press and publication work, and  to a Hangzhou city propaganda and ideological work conference.</p>

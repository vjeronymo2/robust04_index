			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> DIVERSE ACTS CONVERGE AT 'GATHERING OF TRIBES';  </P> <P> CONCERT: THE ALL-DAY POP SMORGASBORD ATTRACTED A FAIR-SIZED CROWD. THE 14-ACT  BILL HAD STYLISTS RANGING FROM HARD ROCK TO FOLK TO RAP.  </P> <P> Chalk up one small blow for diversity, if not for overriding musical  excellence.  </P> <P> Dubbed "A Gathering of the Tribes," the all-day pop smorgasbord on Sunday at  the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa attracted 9,000 to 10,000 people,  according to promoters -- not bad for a 14-act bill that lacked even a single  marquee name capable of headlining an amphitheater in Orange County.  </P> <P> This gathering sprang from English rocker Ian Astbury's idea of creating a  festival of contrasting stylists ranging from hard rock to folk to rap. While  at least 95% of the audience was white, listeners' enthusiastic embrace of the  lineup's two rap acts, and their willingness to sample and enjoy the 10-hour  day's full range of performers, showed that diversity has a constituency.  </P> <P> Any worries about rap being rejected, or merely tolerated, disappeared the  moment Queen Latifah burst onto the stage late in the afternoon with hammering  beats and exuberant personality.  </P> <P> Her raps offered overworked, boastful themes, but what she said mattered less  than how she said it. The New Jersey rapper's 20-minute set communicated zest,  humor and friendliness, and a healthy measure of confidence and self-respect.  She also got Sinead O'Connor to come out and say "hello," but that's all.  </P> <P> The lineup's other rapper, Ice-T, was all profane bluster and attitude: some  good comments on the racism involved in rap censorship, and some unrepentant  sexism in his raps.  </P> <P> More rap was expected, but the popular, controversial Public Enemy didn't  appear as first advertised. Speaking angrily to the crowd at separate  junctures, Astbury, Latifah and Ice-T said Public Enemy was missing because of  pressure from local authorities.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa Police Chief David L. Snowden denied that his department had  anything to do with preventing Public Enemy from playing. A Public Enemy  spokesman was still attempting Tuesday to determine why the band did not  perform.  </P> <P> Michelle Shocked, backed by Tower of Power and romping with rocking blues and  R&amp;B, turned in a satisfying set that also included a stark, eloquent new  ballad about coping with grief.  </P> <P> Despite some lovely harmonies, the Indigo Girls could have taken some hints  from Shocked about the advantages of not being too solemn. Iggy Pop was awfully  restrained considering his well-earned position as one of rock's most  combustive live performers. The day's least-known acts, Canadian folk-rockers  Crash Vegas and British '60s revivalists Charlatans U.K., were promising  newcomers.  </P> <P> As for the rest, the London Quireboys regurgitated old Rod Stewart and the  Faces stuff, sans the warmth, humor and bonhomie. The Cramps played longer --  and worse -- than any other band on the bill. Soundgarden packed a rumbling  wallop, and singer Chris Cornell's emotional howls lifted some numbers out of  the instrumental murk.  </P> <P> Mission U.K.'s barefoot singer Wayne Hussey was an extremely energetic  panderer, but still little more than a panderer. Former Sex Pistols guitarist  Steve Jones makes a decent hard-rock sidekick, but his singing was too weak to  make him much of a band leader.  </P> <P> Things improved when Astbury took over the vocals for the last three songs, and  his partner in the Cult, Billy Duffy, arrived to add some guitar riffing. But  it wasn't enough to fire up a crowd that was tiring near the end of a long day.  </P></p>

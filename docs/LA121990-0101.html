			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING AHEAD: REASON TO RUSH INTO CLEANER FUELS  </P> <P> Much of the burden of the Clean Air Act recently enacted by Congress will fall  on oil refiners, who must embark on a major and costly reformulation of  gasoline.  </P> <P> Until now, oil companies have hoped to avoid this burden, or at least to soften  the blow. Now that legislation is in place, it's becoming clear what must be  done to meet the letter of the law -- and, more important, what opportunities  exist in a changing business environment.  </P> <P> The drive for cleaner fuels will mean that oil refiners can profit if they  reformulate before their competitors do. It is also likely to bring new  opportunities to natural gas and electric utility companies, not to mention  entrepreneurs and investors.  </P> <P> The reformulation ahead represents the most significant change in fuels since  unleaded gasoline. To produce cleaner gasoline, new hardware must be installed  in refineries to reduce levels of objectionable compounds and toxins and to add  oxygenates for leaner combustion and lower carbon monoxide emissions.  </P> <P> It will be costly. By the year 2000, domestic refiners will need to invest from  $10 billion to $22 billion. This investment will raise gas pump prices by about  a nickel a gallon. But the prospects are not nearly as dire as some industry  lobbyists have predicted.  </P> <P> Companies that respond quickly to the changes ahead can gain a competitive  edge.  </P> <P> The Clean Air Act mandates that gasoline sold in nine metropolitan areas --  including Los Angeles, San Diego, New York and Chicago -- undergo reformulation  in phases, beginning in 1995. The shift in marketing patterns will be  far-reaching.  </P> <P> Although on paper the law affects only certain regions, in practice it is  likely that gasoline sold in most areas of the United States will be  reformulated by the decade's end.  </P> <P> Logistics is one reason.  </P> <P> Terminals supplying reformulated gasoline to a legislated region typically also  supply bordering areas.  </P> <P> Furthermore, many city and state governments are likely to extend the federal  standards to their areas.  </P> <P> Competition, too, will drive change. Companies are already realizing that  reformulated gasoline offers excellent product differentiation in an age of  environmental awareness.  </P> <P> In California, Atlantic Richfield is adding to market share by promoting and  selling a form of cleaner gasoline.  </P> <P> Marathon, Phillips and Conoco market their gasoline in the Midwest, largely in  cities not covered by the law.  </P> <P> Yet these companies are already positioning themselves by selling reformulated  gasoline in cities such as Denver, St. Louis and Detroit.  </P> <P> Consumers in these cities, not lawmakers, are the force behind this marketing  strategy.  </P> <P> Among domestic refiners, the likely winners will be those who quickly  reformulate, differentiate their products and stake out their markets.  </P> <P> They can reap profits in the next few years. Some companies may back out of  regions where they are not strong.  </P> <P> Overall, the competition and marketing changes brought by reformulation will  contribute to the current trend of industry consolidation.  </P> <P> Because foreign suppliers are unlikely to meet U.S. reformulation standards, at  least for a few years, the resulting drop in gasoline imports should favor  domestic refiners.  </P> <P> Reformulation may also benefit U.S. auto makers, who are hopeful that the more  uniform compositions of gasoline will make it somewhat easier for them to  design vehicle improvements to further reduce tailpipe emissions.  </P> <P> In the next 10 to 15 years, the role of alternative fuels will likely be  limited to a small share of fleet vehicles, such as urban buses, delivery  trucks and government and company vehicles.  </P> <P> Methanol is often mentioned as an alternative fuel, but it appears more likely  that compressed natural gas (CNG) will be the choice for safety, operational  and cost reasons.  </P> <P> A variety of suppliers could market CNG, most notably local gas companies.  Entrepreneurs could also play a role in marketing CNG.  </P> <P> Amoco has announced that it will introduce CNG refueling stations at some  locations to take advantage of its vast natural gas reserves.  </P> <P> In the long term, electric fleet vehicles appear to be an attractive answer to  emissions problems in polluted areas. Milk trucks in London now run on  electricity. However, such vehicles need to improve operating range and  efficiency.  </P> <P> If cost-efficient electric vehicles are introduced, the winners would be  electric utility companies.  </P> <P> Although new fuel requirements may be difficult and costly, those who  successfully take up the challenges of reformulation and cleaner energy will be  rewarded.  </P></p>

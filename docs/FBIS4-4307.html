			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Intelligence Surveillance of `Civilian Government'" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- It has been brought to  light recently in South Korea that the rulers set up three watch  posts around the house of former Chairman of the Democratic  Party Kim Tae-chung in Seoul in 1979 to keep an eye on his every  movement and have continued surveillance till today.    Papers here today say this act of the Kim Yong-sam group has  proved that political surveillance over politicians is as  vicious and persistent as under the military "regimes", though  it claims a "civilian government" has been established in South  Korea.    An analyst of NODONG SINMUN notes:    It is a serious matter that the traitor Kim Yong-sam  continues vicious political surveillance over civilians, though  he committed himself to build "a society where human rights are  respected" and "stop intelligence surveillance" when taking the  "presidential" seat.    With the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique and such notorious  intelligence tools as the "Security Planning Board" and the  "secret affairs command" left alone, the South Korean people  cannot evade being targets of intelligence surveillance.    A MINJU CHOSON commentary stresses that if human rights and  democracy are to be guaranteed and the people are to live in  peace in South Korea, all the political charlatans like the  traitor Kim Yong-sam who stirs up horror and uneasiness and  resorts to terrorism and plots must be removed.</p>

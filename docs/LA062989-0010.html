			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOBILE MISSILE DEAL IS SHOT FULL OF HOLES  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has struck a Faustian bargain with members of Congress  concerning mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles. In broad outline, the  deal involves the following:  </P> <P>  -- The executive branch will agree to find almost $1 billion extra from the  defense budget to invest in the development of the Midgetman ICBM over the next  four years.  </P> <P>  -- Congress is supposed to agree that it will approve the Administration's  funding request for both a rail-mobile version of the MX and a road-mobile  Midgetman.  </P> <P>  -- Once that is done, the Administration will abandon the proposal in the  draft strategic arms reduction treaty that calls for a complete ban on such  mobile systems, offering instead schemes for constraining the permitted numbers  of mobile missiles and for verifying such limitations.  </P> <P> This is a political compromise that makes no sense fiscally, strategically or  in terms of prudent arms control.  </P> <P> Under present and prospective budgetary conditions, mobile missiles -- at  upwards of $25 billion for the Midgetman and $5 billion for the MX -- are an  unjustifiable expense. Even if the country could afford to pay for them, it is  inconceivable that the United States could operate the missiles -- either in a  rail-based or road-mobile scheme -- in a manner offering levels of  survivability comparable to those enjoyed by Soviet SS-24s and SS-25s.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the Soviets have some decisive advantages with their mobile  missiles -- for example, the enormity and barrenness of the country's landmass  and the absolute priority given to the military in that society. As a result,  such systems are routinely and realistically exercised in the Soviet  countryside. By contrast, American mobile missiles, if they can be deployed at  all, seem certain to be constrained in ways that will impinge on (if not  eliminate) their benefits. The Air Force plans to deploy the rail-mobile MX  missiles on its bases, from which they would be dispersed in times of crisis or  conflict. Unless and until they are dispersed, these missiles would be even  easier to destroy than if they were left in their present silo launchers. They  simply could not escape the operating bases in the event of a surprise attack.  It is even a debatable point whether the nation's political leadership would be  willing to disperse the MX force onto the rail network in a time of escalating  tensions but before warning of an actual attack. Such flushing of the missiles  could be misinterpreted by Moscow as the signal that preparations for a U.S.  nuclear strike were under way, thereby risking Soviet preemption.  </P> <P> Similarly, Midgetman may have its own survivability problems. Cost  considerations would probably preclude significant numbers of these missiles  from ordinarily being deployed away from their operating bases on U.S. military  reservations. Missiles not so dispersed would be readily targetable. In other  words, under any foreseeable circumstances, U.S. investment in an effort to  mimic Soviet mobile-missile programs is unlikely to produce strategic benefits  commensurate with the cost in defense resources.  </P> <P> The Administration and congressional supporters of its mobile-missile plan have  also set the stage for a rout in the arms-control negotiations. The Soviets  have been put on notice that the United States is not serious about its current  proposal calling for a complete ban on such missiles. Evidently, in exchange  for congressional funding commitments that have proven in the past to be  utterly ephemeral, the Administration has promised that it will, instead,  introduce a proposal for limits on mobile ICBMs.  </P> <P> There is simply no way to verify such limitations. Over the years, a variety of  possible solutions to this intractable verification conundrum have been  considered and found wanting. Were mobile missiles to be permitted under START,  militarily significant Soviet cheating would be greatly simplified. Mobile  launchers enable non-deployed and/or covertly stockpiled missiles to be  utilized rapidly and with a minimum of discernable preparations. Sufficient  Soviet capability could be retained under any identified limitation scenario to  permit Moscow to minimize, if not largely offset, the strategic effect of  reductions stipulated by a START treaty.  </P> <P> It is time for those who consider themselves serious about arms control and  responsible about national security to recognize the new deal on mobile  missiles for what it is: an impermanent marriage of convenience that will make  effective strategic arms reductions even more problematic and preclude steps  urgently needed to provide for the common defense. Resources should be applied  differently, namely to development and deployment of effective strategic  defenses and to less ambitious ICBM modernization programs -- programs that are  compatible both with U.S. deterrent requirements and with verifiable  arms-control agreements.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report in the "Day at Home" column: "J. Moravcik on </F> the Arms Trade"]    [Text] Slovakia also has the conditions for becoming  involved in the arms trade. Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik said  this in an interview for Radiozurnal in connection with the  recent visit made by a Chilean military delegation to the Czech  Republic. In trading in arms, however, Slovakia must proceed  correctly and in a manner corresponding to its international  obligations, said the Slovak prime minister. "I do not even  rule out the possibility of trade with Chile because it is a  democratic country, and selling arms to this region would not  harm our foreign policy interests," said J. Moravcik. As far as  Augusto Pinochet is concerned, Moravcik is aware of the  complexity of the issue of all that General Pinochet meant in  Chile's history. First and foremost, it is up to the people of  this country to come to terms with this issue, added Moravcik.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 3 (XINHUA) -- A senior official of  the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said here  today that the CAAC is to put flight safety first to ensure a  healthy, steady and continued development.    Applications to open new air companies will be scrutinized  strictly, according to sources with the CAAC.    Import of new planes will be strictly controlled, according  to the official, who added that investment will shifted to  training and ground facilities.    Sources quoted the unidentified official as saying at a  working conference here that in the past few years business  volume of the CAAC kept growing at 30 percent annually, a rare  phenomenon in the development of international air companies.    "It is not the will alone that decides what the development  speed should be. Flight safety will certainly be endangered if  we keep seeking quick results and work against the realizable  possibilities," the official was quoted as saying.    Previously there were six sub-administrative bureaus under  the CAAC and ten flight fleets, which have by now been expanded  into 33 air companies and 45 flight fleets, with 754 planes of  all kinds.    In 1986, total passenger seats in CAAC topped 15,400, with  288 domestic and international air routes and business amounting  to 1.5 billion ton-kilometers, while in 1993 the seats increased  to over 50,000, with 610 home and international air routes and  business totalling 5.1 billion ton-kilometers.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (6): A strong sense of survival - Montreal MONTREAL feels a dash of nostalgia for the Expo 67 World Fair. It casts a glance of envy at Seville's Expo 92 as Montreal celebrates its 350th birthday party this year. Expo 67 marked the pinnacle of Montreal's achievements. Francophones, Anglophones and more recent immigrants worked together to build an international exhibition on a clump of small islands in the St Lawrence river. The federal government and the other provinces chipped in generously, with only one or two scrooges. It was a rare national effort. After that it seemed Montreal, with its multilingual services, large inland seaport and two commercial airports, proximity to New York and Boston, Toronto and Chicago, might host several international organisations, including part of Unesco. But little happened. Over the next 25 years, Montreal and its 3m inhabitants struggled through recessions, two world energy crises, the increase of separatism, an exodus of 100,000 Anglophones and a divisive constitutional debate. The current recession has been the worst since the 1930s and there is no free spending for the 350th birthday party. Nonetheless, the city retains its grace and insouciance, and its inhabitants have not lost their sense of humour. Satire continues to prosper in Montreal, and the city stages an annual Festival of Laughs besides international film and jazz festivals. Montreal, still feeling snubbed by the hauteur of Quebec City, the provincial capital, realises it urgently needs an international vocation, if only to express its growing ethnic mix - 70 per cent Francophones with the rest Anglophones and immigrants. In spite of the financial burden of Dollars 1bn-worth of debt from the 1976 Olympics, the city has expanded its cultural heritage, restored the waterfront and the Old City and extended its museums and theatres. It has come to terms with the age of skyscrapers and insists on variety and renewal, while adjusting to the post-industrial revolution. Montreal's population fell behind that of Toronto in the late 1950s and may yet be overtaken by fast-growing Vancouver. But it is still a gateway from Europe and is North America's most European big city. Its hotels and restaurants are among the continent's best, and winter and summer sports are just an hour away. Founding Montreal on a 35-mile-long island in the St Lawrence system was called la folle entreprise. A French tax collector believed God wanted him to build a hospital inside a mission. Some rich French families put up money, the story goes, and soldier Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve, landed at Quebec in 1641 with a clutch of settlers. They set out for Montreal Island the next spring, and De Maisonneuve swore he would found a colony 'were every tree on the island changed to an Iroquois'. They built their first stockade on the waterfront, later moving to higher ground near today's Place d'Armes and the old Sulpician seminary. Soon Montreal was a centre of the fur trade. The French voyageurs and explorers left from there to build their network of trading posts and probe North America as far as the Rockies and to Mexico. With the conquest, the French were cut off from France, and Scottish merchants soon moved in and prospered from successive waves of immigration. By 1845, Montreal's population numbered 50,000, and it was Canada's import-export centre. The new railroads fanned out west from Montreal, and Canadian Pacific was formed in the city in 1880. Montreal's three great growth periods were 1850-60, 1900-11 and 1950-61, but two world wars forced the pace of industrialisation and liberalised the social structure. Though the job is not completed, Montreal's rebuilt waterfront and Old City, with its stone buildings and cobbled streets, is a charming place to stroll in spring and summer. The St Lawrence is fast-flowing as it turns slightly and continues 1,000 miles to the Atlantic. Montreal vies with Baltimore as the eastern seaboard's second biggest container port. Old Montreal includes many buildings from the French period, including the Grey Nuns' first hospital, and the Bonsecours Chapel. The Old City is connected with the new and the suburbs by a 65-station 45-mile rubber-tyred Metro. The Olympic Stadium needs a new roof but boasts a Swiss-built funicular running up the 600 ft tower. The Place des Arts, containing the main concert hall and several theatres, has been modernised and expanded, and the Musee d'Art Contemporain added alongside. Montreal's four universities have many cultural facilities. The Canadian Centre for Architecture, the brainchild of a daughter of Mr Sam Bronfman, the liquor magnate, is a mecca for architects throughout the world. The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, with a general collection and which specialises in international exhibitions, last year opened a controversial addition designed by Mr Moshe Safdie. The rebuilt McCord Museum, owned by McGill University, specialises in ethnology and Canadian history. Montreal's Circus School has just burst on to the international scene, providing the performers for Le Cirque du Soleil, an acrobatic extravaganza performing in North America and in Europe. Montreal may have lost power and influence, but it has a rich historical and cultural heritage and a strong will to survive and grow again.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             KEY FACTS AND ECONOMIC INDICATORS FOR QUEBEC  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                1989     1990     1991     1992     1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GDP            (Dollars m)  149,932  154,066  155,500  160,940  172,900                   % change      5.4      2.9      0.9      3.5      7.4 Personal dis-  (Dollars m)   99,146  105,263  108,420  110,370  117,650 posable income    % change      6.2      6.2      3.0      1.8      6.6 Retail sales   (Dollars m)   45,451   47,740   44,225   45,400   47,900                   % change      1.0      0.6     -3.3      2.7      5.5 Housing            (units)   49,058   48,070   44,654   43,000   50,000 starts            % change    -15.5     -2.0     -7.1     -3.7     16.3 CPI             (1986=100)    112.9    117.7    126.4    129.2    133.1                   % change      4.3      4.3      7.4      2.2      3.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Statistics Canada, Royal Bank Economics Department forecasts for 1992-93  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

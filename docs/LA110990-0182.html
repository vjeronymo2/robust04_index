			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FERNANDEZ ADVANCES IN SLIMS  </P> <P> Second-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez overcame a blister on her serving hand in  beating Amy Frazier, 6-3, 6-4, in a quarterfinal match in the New England  Virginia Slims tennis tournament today.  </P> <P> Fernandez, treated at a hospital for the problem this week, got the hand taped  by a trainer early in the one-hour, 19-minute match.  </P> <P> "I've had the blister for about three months," Fernandez said. "It bothers me  on volleys when I have to grip the racket hard. It doesn't bother me as much on  serves because I hold it more loosely."  </P></p>

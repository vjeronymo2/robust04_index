			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Shishov, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA </F> correspondent: "Candidates Are Searching for Arguments"]    [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod--The cards are on the table:  Yevgeniy Krestyaninov, 45, deputy to the Federal Assembly,  chairman of the Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast Soviet, decided to join  the contest for the position of the Nizhniy Novgorod local  self-administration head. He will be running against Dmitriy  Bednyakov, head of the city administration. Several other local  parties are also collecting signatures for their candidates,  among them are members of the Travkin and the communist parties.    During a press conference, Ye. Krestyaninov announced his  decision not to run for the oblast legislature. In doing this,  he hopes to avoid any accusations of trying to stay in power at  any cost. According to Krestyaninov, the local  self-administration head ought to establish a dynamic, lawful  parity in the activity of the city duma administration office  and it should not try to prevail over the representational body  of power. Recently, he thinks, unnecessary contradictions have  appeared in the relations between the city and the oblast.    Krestyaninov does not agree with the policy of the city  administration and its head, D. Bednyakov. He thinks that the  privatized enterprises of the public services area have been  left to the mercy of fate. Public transportation is performing  badly. Such services as shoe repairs have almost completely  disappeared.    The famous quartet of Nizhniy Novgorod reformers, consisting  of former city soviet chairman A. Kosarikov (he is now deputy  governor for ecology), Ye. Krestyaninov, B. Nemtsov, and D.  Bednyakov, has broken up. The apparent reason for the antagonism  among the four must have been the fact that the current mayor of  Nizhniy Novgorod started to conduct his own policy, without  paying much attention to the interests of the oblast.    The general election to the representative organs of  Nizhegorodskiy Kray will take place on 27 March. Thirty four  deputies are supposed to be elected to the city duma. The  districts have been determined, the city electoral commission is  functioning, potential candidates are actively collecting  signatures.    According to the regulations of the oblast soviet, a  candidate to the city duma needs to gain the support of only one  percent of the constituency. The city administration ruled to  more than triple this figure. The procuracy announced a protest  in this respect, but no concrete decision on it has been passed  yet.    Governor G. Nemtsov declared that the oblast administration  would not participate in the coming election as it adhered to  the principle of separation of power. Ye. Krestyaninov  characterized this Nemtsov announcement as practical respect of  the kray executive power for the decisions of its  representational branch.</p>

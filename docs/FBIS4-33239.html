			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Speaking on behalf of the executive branch,  Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, minister of the Central Information  Office [OCI], has denied Amnesty International's predictions  that very serious incidents will take place in Venezuela because  of the socioeconomic situation the country is now facing.  Vicente Briceno has this report:    [Begin recording] [Briceno] The OCI minister downplayed  Amnesty International's report that urges the government to be  on the alert for social unrest that could emerge within the next  few months. According to the government spokesman, there is no  reason why such incidents, which would have a negative impact on  democracy, should emerge in Venezuela. In turn, he said those  who are forecasting chaos are harbingers of doom.    [Alvarez] These predictions make no sense. We certainly  respect Amnesty International, an international nongovernmental  organization, and we respect its right and obligation to monitor  human rights. Amnesty International prepared a report on  Venezuela and pointed out there were human rights violations in  Venezuela during the past few years. We find it unusual that an  Amnesty International spokesman has turned his attention to  Venezuela, because currently there are a great many  opportunities to exercise all democratic rights. He is telling  us, I do not know based on what, that we must be on the alert  because of the crises that might arise in Venezuela within the  next few months.    [Briceno] In another turn of events, Minister Alvarez said  he  was pleased with the civic Lights Against Crime campaign,  whereby Caracas drivers turn on the headlights of their cars to  call attention to rising violence. The movement last staged a  peaceful demonstration on 31 May. Alvarez also said he is not  planning to request another Special Powers Law at the National  Congress, and he recalled that the previous Special Powers Law  was not requested by the Rafael Caldera administration.

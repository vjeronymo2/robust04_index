Unnamed officials of the state-owned Posts and  Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) were quoted in Sunday's [20  March] edition of the independent SUNDAY GAZETTE as saying about  200 government telephone lines had been disconnected in the last  two months.    Last week alone 80 lines were cut, including Mugabe's hot  lines. The latter were quickly reconnected "after a directive  from government", the newspaper added.    Other victims last week were 23 lines from the Immigration  Department which owes R45,000 [rand], 36 from the Zimbabwe  Institute of Public Administration and Management for  non-payment of its R35,000 bill while the Ministry of Mines' was  completely cut off for an outstanding bill of R68,000.    The switchboard at Jongwe Printers, the printing company  owned by the ruling ZANU (PF) [Zimbabwe African National  Union-Patriotic Front] party, went dead after a cheque meant to  pay for its bill of R5,500 was bounced by the bank.    In January the Foreign Ministry lost its 70 lines, including  direct lines, fax and telex services used by Mugabe's office  when its bill went unpaid.    Sources said that the PTC was one client among hundreds of  creditors that is owed money by the government.    Under World Bank economic austerity programmes, the Ministry  of Finance has issued ironclad instructions that it will not  bail out government departments that overspend their budgets,  with the result that millions of dollars of bills go unpaid.</p>

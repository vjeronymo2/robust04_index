			<p>BFN     [Text] After fierce fighting on the Kladanj front, the  free territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been expanded by 32  square kilometers. Sabotaging the plans of chetnik generals  Milovanovic and Krstic, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army fighters  smashed the Chetnik offensive and penetrated deep into the  occupied territory toward Zeravica and Vlasenica. Our units  have progressed to the line of (Sokoli), [words indistinct], and  (Bijela Stijena). All attempts by the Chetniks to recapture the  lost territory have been in vain.    Over 100 chetniks were killed in this fighting, 20 of whom  were [word indistinct], and the number of the wounded is several  times higher. The result of this operation is two tanks, two  mobile antiaircraft weapons, two 105-mm howitzers, and one  antiaircraft gun destroyed. The chetnik units in this region  have been completely smashed, and the volunteers from Serbia are  fleeing to where they came from in the first place.</p>

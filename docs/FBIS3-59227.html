According to  exclusive information secured by I MAKHI, the United States was  represented at the meeting, which lasted 20-30 minutes, by U.S.  Ambassador Richard Boucher and high-ranking diplomatic officer  Carolyn Huggins and the United Nations by Clark and Gustave  Feissel. The UN secretary general's special representative  briefed the Americans on his contacts and the problems and  difficulties that surfaced and asked the Americans to help and  contribute so that the Turkish side will withdraw the conditions  set out in [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas' letter and  that make discussion of ways to implement the  confidence-building measures impossible. The same reliable  sources note that Clark and Feissel expressed certainty that the  road to begin discussing ways to implement the  confidence-building measures will open up if the Turkish Cypriot  side withdraws the three basic points from the conditions it set  out in Denktas' letter. The same reliable sources said that for  this reason and following a demand by the U.S. ambassador, the  communique issued after the meeting of the five ambassadors  included an explicit reference to the UN secretary general's  report to the Security Council dated 1 July 1993. This report  noted, among other things, that the secretary general's three  documents on the confidence-building measures must be accepted  in principle and without conditions by the two sides. The three  points that Clark and Feissel noted prevent dialogue from  beginning are:    1. Denktas' demand to operate the illegal Tymbou airport at  the same time as Nicosia Airport reopens. This is something  that will clearly give political advantage to the Turkish  Cypriot side, since UN permission to operate the occupied  airport will, as a result, constitute recognition of the  pseudostate.    2. The "security" points the Turkish Cypriot leader raises  and the conditions set out for handing over the whole of the  fenced-off area of Famagusta.    3. The "possibility" of Denktas demanding that the United  Nations retake the town if he is not satisfied with the  measures. [passage omitted]</p>

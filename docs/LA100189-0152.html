			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PARDEE IS RIGHT MAN IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME  </P> <P> One of Jack Pardee's University of Houston assistants called his boss into an  office the other day, turned out the lights and started a film projector. "Got  a kid I'd like to show you," the assistant said, his Cheshire cat grin hidden  in the dark.  </P> <P> The film was dark and a little grainy, as you might expect since it was more  than 30 years old. And there, on the screen, was a scrawny return man fielding  a kickoff for Texas A&amp;M University, eight yards deep in his own end zone,  and boldly running forward, into the teeth of the opposition, finally getting  slammed down a few yards short of his own 20.  </P> <P> Jack Pardee had a good laugh when he saw that film, though he also recalled  that his shoulder ached for weeks from the impact of the hit. But soon enough,  Pardee was back to the future, plotting strategy for last Saturday's game at  Arizona State, where the highly regarded played their second game of the young  season, Pardee's third season as their head football coach.  </P> <P> Pardee has always preferred not to live in the past, and that has not changed  since the days when he played six-man, high-school football in West Texas, then  went on to star for the Aggies, the Los Angeles Rams and the Washington  Redskins before embarking on a coaching career that has been nothing short of  spectacular almost everywhere he went.  </P> <P> And now, Pardee is back in what he considers home. His son Ted, all arms and  legs as a 7-year-old ballboy at the Redskins training camp 10 years ago, is a  thick-necked sophomore reserve linebacker on the Cougar team who even wears his  dad's old No. 32. Pardee's wife Phyllis, a twirler for the TCU Horned Frogs way  back when, has returned to her hometown. Four other grown children are  scattered from Richmond to the West Coast. "I don't think my dad could be any  happier," said young Teddy.  </P> <P> Well, of course he could. He would prefer that his Houston football team be  allowed to play in a bowl and appear on national television this season, but  that's not going to happen. The Cougars are on NCAA probation for  transgressions committed before he took the job three years ago.  </P> <P> Pardee had spent the previous season working for the Green Bay Packers as a  scout, that being the year the United States Football League folded, with  Pardee the head coach of the Houston Gamblers. He was the man who brought the  run-and-shoot offense to professional football, but now the runners and  shooters were all out of jobs.  </P> <P> Still, a man with Pardee's impressive credentials could not be out of work for  very long, and when Houston President Richard S. Van Horn came to pick a coach,  "there really was only one decision to make," he said.  </P> <P> "He just had an impeccable record as a player and a coach," Van Horn said the  other day from Norman, Okla., where he is now president of the University of  Oklahoma. "But the most important thing to us was the fact that he had an  unblemished record of integrity. He wants his players to get an education and  to graduate. And he was committed to operating within the rules. He was a  perfect fit."  </P> <P> Well, almost. Pardee came into town and started hustling for a staff and for  players. It was common knowledge that Houston was being investigated by the  NCAA for transgressions that included paying money to players by longtime coach  Bill Yeoman and his staff. Not big money, mind you, because Houston has always  been the undernourished commuter school with mostly hand-to-mouth financial  support.  </P> <P> The oil business helped fill the coffers at Texas A&amp;M, Southern Methodist  and Texas. But not here on this sprawling campus filled with parking lots,  modern architecture and hundreds of moss-covered oak trees and bordered on one  side by a freeway, on another side by railroad tracks and on another by a  dreary slum neighborhood.  </P> <P> In any case, the threat of NCAA sanctions kept some high-quality athletes away,  and when the NCAA finally announced the probation last season, the  throat-cutting by rival recruiters intensified. "During the investigation,  they'd tell the kids, 'Don't go to Houston, you'll never play in a bowl, you'll  never be on TV,' " Pardee said the other day. "That was the hardest part. The  investigation was a hammer hanging over our head. It's much easier to deal with  reality than speculation. Now at least we know what we're up against, and we  can live with that."  </P> <P> And prosper, as well, though it took a while for this unpretentious coach at  this unpretentious school. After the Cougars opened the Pardee Era by losing  six of its first seven games in 1987, they turned the season around by stomping  Texas 60-40 that year and finishing 3-0-1 down the stretch. Last year the  Cougars were 9-2 and just missed a Cotton Bowl trip (the bowl ban was for this  season), settling for a visit to the Aloha in Hawaii.  </P> <P> And they opened this year with a 69-0 thrashing of Nevada-Las Vegas, good  enough to earn them the No. 1 ranking ahead of Miami and Notre Dame in USA  Today's computer rating system based on strength of schedule.  </P> <P> They are doing it with the same run-and-shoot Pardee employed so successfully  in his stint with the Gamblers of the USFL, and a pro style 4-3 defense Pardee  has always played and coached.  </P> <P> "I've always tried to find the right way to win with the talent you have  available," Pardee said. "In Chicago, I had Walter Payton, and you don't have  to be a genius to know that you give it to Walter Payton. When I came to the  Gamblers, we had a great quarterback (Jim Kelly) and a lot of little guys who  could catch the ball (including Redskin Ricky Sanders). Everybody's always  looking for the great athlete, the 6-3, 215-pounder like Charley Taylor. But  there are a lot of good athletes out there if you don't put such stringent  physical requirements on them.  </P> <P> "When we came to this program, we knew that to have a chance to compete, we  couldn't do the same things Texas and Arkansas and A&amp;M were doing. We  couldn't jam the ball down anyone's throats with what we had. We didn't have a  big line and a great runner. But we had a lot of kids who could fly, and now  we're staying with it."  </P> <P> The man in control of all those fabulous flyers -- four receivers and more than  occasionally the set back go down field -- is a softspoken junior quarterback  from Dickinson, Texas. Andre Ware is his name, and passing is definitely his  game.  </P> <P> Originally recruited by Yeoman as a veer quarterback, Ware started playing  regularly as a freshman until he broke his arm in midseason. But after three  years, "I feel real comfortable with it," Ware said.  </P> <P> Last year Ware set conference records with 25 touchdown passes, 39 completions  in one game and 471 yards in another. Against UNLV, he threw for five  touchdowns in the first half, another Southwest Conference mark, and completed  30 of 48 passes for 396 yards.  </P> <P> Pardee also is learning about the college game. His first year, his playbook  was probably too thick and he had to remind himself that he also was coaching  students who had to go to class. So he adjusted.  </P> <P> He's simplified things, scheduled team meetings whenever he could and made sure  he had an assistant coach live in the team dormitory and another academic  coordinator to make sure his players were going to class.  </P> <P> "He's wonderful to play for," Ware said. "He's laid back, he doesn't beat  anything into you and he treats you like a man. It's a pleasure to play for  him, but you always know that if he tells you something, you better believe it  because he means it. And he really wants to win."  </P> <P> Some have speculated that Pardee really wants to get back into the National  Football League. His last experience there was a bitter one, essentially fired  by Jack Kent Cooke in 1980 over so-called philosophical differences with  then-Redskins general manager Bobby Beathard.  </P> <P> Pardee does not like to dwell on that situation, though now, years later, he  will admit that he might have made a mistake leaving the Bears for the Redskins  in the first place. But he loved Washington, had a beautiful home and some land  outside Middleburg, Va., and thought "I could spend the rest of my life there.  </P> <P> "That was the only job I ever lost in my life," Pardee said. "I just went back  there too soon. ... Looking back, I should have stayed in Chicago ... The owner  (Cooke) didn't hire me. He wanted it structured the way he wanted it. When I  run something, I want to run it the way I want to run it."  </P> <P> There has been speculation here that Pardee will not be at Houston very long.  When Jackie Sherrill was fired at Texas A&amp;M, Pardee's name was mentioned.  There will always be talk about him going back to the pros, and even Pardee  admits that he wonders why, after he left in 1980, no NFL owner ever called  with a head-coaching job.  </P> <P> "You wonder what criteria people have to hire a coach when you see some of the  guys who have been hired," he said, without naming names. "But I've never been  a part of that fraternity. I was never being groomed or brought along.  </P> <P> "All I know is the good Lord has always provided for me. I've never had a set  road. When one thing ends, another door seems to open. There's no conspiracy  against Jack Pardee, I'm sure not that paranoid to think that people are out to  get me."  </P> <P> No, Pardee has other priorities. He's already licked cancer, once in 1964 when  a melanoma on his arm almost killed him; again in 1986 when he needed surgery  to remove a growth in the back of his neck.  </P> <P> "You can't imagine how happy I am to be here," Pardee said. "I enjoy the  lifestyle, my wife is home. The school has been very good to me, and I've got a  great bunch of kids to work with. Sure there are problems, but nothing you  can't solve. I'd like to have more depth, I'd like not to have to recruit so  many junior-college kids. I'd like to go to a bowl and be on TV. But it will  come."  </P> <P> For Jack Pardee, it always has.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRANCES BAVIER; WON AN EMMY AS 'AUNT BEE'  </P> <P> Frances Bavier, an Emmy Award-winning actress remembered by millions of fans as  the devoted Aunt Bee on "The Andy Griffith Show," died Wednesday night at her  home here. She was 86.  </P> <P> Miss Bavier was released early this week from Chatham Hospital, where she was  being treated in the coronary care unit.  </P> <P> A native of New York City, Miss Bavier attended Columbia University and was a  graduate of the American Academy of the Arts. She had more than 20 years of  stage experience, including stints in vaudeville and on Broadway, where she  appeared in such productions as "Kiss and Tell," "Point of No Return" and "The  Lady Says No."  </P> <P> Miss Bavier became famous for her television role in the popular show starring  Andy Griffith as a Southern sheriff, which she continued in the short-lived  series "Mayberry RFD." She won an Emmy for the role in 1967.  </P> <P> "Andy Griffith" was near the top of the ratings from October, 1960, to  September, 1968, when Griffith left the show.  </P> <P> "Many episodes focused on her and she was essential to the success of the  show," said John Meroney, founder of the Andy Griffith Show Appreciation  Society. "When she started on the show she was 57 and had more experience going  in than any of the other cast members. She was the only one from a large city  and the fact that she could portray Aunt Bee showed the depth of her talent."  </P> <P> A private person, she had refused media requests for interviews for some time.  </P> <P> "She was never big on doing interviews. But in my conversations with her she  was always open and willing to talk about her days on the Andy Griffith Show, "  Meroney said.  </P></p>

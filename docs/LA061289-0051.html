			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NEW MARINERS MAKE PITCH TO MAKE UP FOR LOSS OF LANGSTON, 6-3  </P> <P> When the Seattle Mariners turned down some big names to get three young  pitchers for Mark Langston last month, it raised plenty of eyebrows.  </P> <P> The Mariners, it turns out, may have known exactly what they were doing.  </P> <P> Brian Holman earned his first American League victory and Gene Harris got his  first major-league save Sunday at Cleveland as the Mariners beat the Indians,  6-3. Holman and Harris both came in the trade with the Montreal Expos.  </P> <P> Randy Johnson, the third player obtained from the Expos, pitched three-hit ball  for 7 2/3 innings in Saturday's 3-1 victory over the Indians, improving his  record with Seattle to 3-0.  </P> <P> "I like what I see a lot," Manager Jim Lefebvre said. "That's three top quality  arms and three competitors out there. I'm tickled to death for us."  </P> <P> Holman (1-1) allowed seven hits, including a homer, double and single by Pete  O'Brien, in Brian Holman  </P> <P> 5 2/3 innings. Harris worked the final 3 1/3 innings for the save.  </P> <P> "We're not Mark Langston," Holman said. "We're Randy Johnson, Gene Harris and  Brian Holman. People are never going to be satisfied if they're looking for us  to be Mark Langston.  </P> <P> "I think maybe I was trying too hard to impress people (at first) because it  was a big trade."  </P> <P> Seattle's Bill McGuire hit his first major-league homer, a three-run shot off  Bud Black, in a four-run sixth inning that made it 5-1.  </P> <P> Black (5-7) yielded five runs, two of them earned, on seven hits in 5 2/3  innings.  </P> <P> Oakland 5, Texas 1 -- Dave Parker and Mark McGwire hit back-to-back homers in  the sixth inning as the A's increased their AL West lead to three games over  the Angels by downing the Rangers at Arlington, Tex.  </P> <P> Mike Moore (8-4) allowed Texas three hits in 6 1/3 innings, lowering his  earned-run average to 1.91. Greg Cadaret got one out and Gene Nelson retired  all seven batters he faced for his first save and Oakland's 23rd, tops in the  majors.  </P> <P> The A's had a 2-1 lead when Parker led off the sixth with his ninth home run  and McGwire followed with his 12th, both off Kevin Brown (5-3). McGwire also  had a sacrifice fly in the first.  </P> <P> Minnesota 5, Chicago 2 -- Randy Bush hit a two-run homer and Kirby Puckett  added a two-run single, leading the Twins past the White Sox at Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Allan Anderson (7-4) allowed eight hits in seven-plus innings and got solid  relief from Juan Berenguer and Jeff Reardon.  </P> <P> Berenguer entered with a 4-1 lead, the bases loaded and none out in the eighth.  He retired Ivan Calderon on a foul pop and struck out Carlos Martinez before  walking Dan Pasqua to force in a run.  </P> <P> Reardon came on to get the side out and pitched a scoreless ninth to register  his 11th save.  </P> <P> Melido Perez (3-8) lost for the fifth time in six games.  </P> <P> Toronto 4, Detroit 0 -- Mike Flanagan and Duane Ward combined on a four-hitter  at Toronto and the Blue Jays handed the Tigers their fourth shutout of the  season.  </P> <P> Flanagan (4-5) allowed three hits in seven innings. It was his first outing  since a sore left shoulder forced him to miss two starts. Ward finished for his  fifth save, striking out four.  </P> <P> Toronto rookie Junior Felix went four for five with a two-run homer. Rookie  Mike Schwabe (1-1) shut out Toronto until the fifth, when Rance Mulliniks  doubled and Felix hit an 0-and-2 pitch into the second deck for his fifth home  run.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 3, Baltimore 1 -- Rob Deer doubled home the go-ahead run in the ninth  inning at Baltimore and the Brewers handed the Orioles their fourth loss in  five games.  </P> <P> The Orioles, leading the AL East, won eight straight before their recent slump.  Milwaukee has won eight of 12.  </P> <P> B.J. Surhoff got a bunt single with one out in the ninth against Kevin Hickey  (1-1), who gave way to Gregg Olson. Surhoff stole second and third before  coming home on Deer's double. Deer took third on Mike Felder's single and  scored on Olson's wild pitch.  </P> <P> Chuck Crim (5-3) pitched one inning to get the victory. Dan Plesac worked the  ninth for his 14th save.  </P> <P> New York 4-8, Boston 2-7 -- Rickey Henderson snapped an eighth-inning tie with  a run-scoring pinch single to win the nightcap and Don Mattingly drove in six  runs as the Yankees swept the Red Sox at New York.  </P> <P> Mattingly hit a pair of two-run homers in the second game and had a two-run  double to back the pitching of Andy Hawkins (6-7) in the opener. Hawkins  allowed four hits and two runs in eight innings.  </P> <P> Mattingly was five for eight for the day and has 40 runs batted in this season.  His second home run gave New York a 7-2 lead in the seventh inning of the  second game, but the Red Sox rallied for five runs off Lance McCullers to tie  the score. Scott Nielsen (1-0) halted the Boston rally and got the win.  </P></p>

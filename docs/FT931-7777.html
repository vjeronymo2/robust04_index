			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Lloyd's weighs pollution options LLOYD'S of London is expected to rule out the possibility of ordering all the insurance market's syndicates to leave open their accounts for 1990, its most recent underwriting year, when its newly established market board meets today. Instead the board is expected to examine a series of less radical measures aimed at improving the management of Lloyd's exposure to pollution and asbestosis. The board consists of a group of senior market professionals and leading outside businessmen who are developing a 'business plan' for the market. Claims from asbestosis and pollution have been one of the market's thorniest problems in recent years.

An executive summary of the panel's report will be studied by the market board today. The panel is expected to complete its final report within the next few weeks. Mr Stockwell suggested the that the emphasis would be on a wider role for two vehicles owned by the Corporation of Lloyd's. These are Centrewrite, a reinsurer, and Syndicate Underwriting Management, which manages run-off syndicates - those that no longer underwrite new business. 'We have to centralise the problems of 'old years' as much as possible,' said Mr Stockwell. 'There are no magic wands.'</p>

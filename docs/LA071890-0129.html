			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> $20,000 FOR CONCERT AT AIRPORT REJECTED  </P> <P> The City Council, or what was left of it at 2 a.m. Tuesday, voted down a  proposal to pay $20,000 for a performance by the Pacific Symphony at a  black-tie, VIP reception for the John Wayne Airport dedication.  </P> <P> Citing budget constraints and the event's exclusivity, Councilwoman Sandra L.  Genis presented what she called "the Marie Antoinette Memorial Let 'em Eat Cake  Award" and handed out spongecake snacks to council members.  </P> <P> The proposal was introduced by Councilman Orville Amburgey, who walked out of  the meeting during Genis' presentation. The council then voted, 3-0, against  the request. Councilman Ed Glasgow had left the meeting earlier.  </P> <P> The grand opening of the expanded airport will be Sept. 7 and 8, including  receptions, tours, performances, ceremonies and special events. If the council  had agreed to sponsor the symphony's performance, it would have received 100  free tickets to the event.  </P> <P> Genis also reminded council members that in reviewing the city's 1990-91  budget, the council had decided that the city could not afford to hire two more  police officers to catch drunk drivers.

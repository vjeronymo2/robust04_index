			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ANOMIE FARM;  </P> <P> ROOTIE KAZOOTIE BY LAWRENCE NAUMOFF (FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $18.95; 262  PP.)  </P> <P> In this second novel (his first was "The Night of the Weeping Women"), Lawrence  Naumoff attempts a satire -- or so it seems -- of the moral unrootedness and  consequent marital vagaries of domestic modern life. The trouble is that in  order to write about lives in a morally shallow world, Naumoff has summoned up  a cast of equally shallow characters, none of whom, except now and then as if  by fleeting accident, lays claim to a reader's affections. The result is an  oddly wooden, half-hearted, artificial novel that looks in vain for a heart to  give it the pulse of life.  </P> <P> Caroline and Richard, childless and in their late 30s, have been married for 14  years, living in a small house in rural North Carolina on the patch of land  that they had once idealistically thought could become their own  self-sustaining Eden. As the novel opens, however, things aren't going so well.  Caroline has begun to get on the laconic Richard's nerves (she talks far too  much, as against his far too little), and Richard himself has fallen into the  clutches (as yet without consummation) of Cynthia, a rich and glamorous  divorcee down the road.  </P> <P> The engaging comedy of manners and morals that might ensue -- as Richard at  last leaves Caroline, as Caroline goes on a jealous rampage in response, as  things flare hot and then grow depressingly chilly between Richard and Cynthia  -- is jeopardized from the outset by Naumoff's telltale shortcuts and vain  efforts to give depth and background to his surface-only characters.  </P> <P> Disconcertingly often, for example, he falls into a vacuously hastened language  that characterizes only in the broadest of cartoon strokes -- as when he  explains in hurried telegraph-ese that Cynthia "had . . . felt a strange  homesick longing and kinship to (Richard's) simple way of life and his quiet  style," that she had "called Richard and . . . pow, she was just knocked over,  completely and totally knocked over," and, lest one continues (as one does) to  doubt, that "She was truly crazy about him."  </P> <P> Fruitful dramatic comedy needs something at its center, and one assumes early  on that the center in this novel is to be the figure of the abandoned Caroline,  who is wronged both by the ersatz-minded Cynthia and by the seldom-talking and  apparently hunkish Richard.  </P> <P> And yet Caroline, too, although the only one here capable of demonstrating  either humor or passion, is treated with equally damaging effect to Naumoff's  get-it-over-with-quickly characterization: "Caroline taught first grade and she  loved her children and they loved her. Lately, though, . . . all the paperwork  and the bureaucracy and so forth . . . had begun to get her down." Such  flurries of dead phrases, here as so often elsewhere in the book, reveal  Naumoff skimming in an unthinking, pell-mell shorthand across his material in  order to get -- where?  </P> <P> What a reader gradually comes to realize is that, in fact, there's no place for  Naumoff finally to get at all, since the inside of his characters, if they have  an inside at all, is a world that seems wholly closed to him. In the middle of  the book, Caroline follows an apparently stray dog deep into the woods, where  she comes upon a rustic cabin inhabited by a beautifully perfect young man and  a beautifully perfect young woman (and, of course, by their dog. Says Caroline:  "I love your dog, though. He's really special").  </P> <P> The cabin, of course, symbolizes the Eden that Caroline and Richard are said to  have dreamed of once, a self-sufficient, pure, untroubled world of two. And in  this symbolic center-point of the book, if anywhere, one could fairly expect  the inner substance and stabilizing verities of Caroline's true self to be  revealed. What one discovers, though, are just trivial inanities expressed in  language to match.  </P> <P> To the questioning of her rustic but advertisement-perfect hosts, Caroline  says, "Actually, I feel really great now. Really. Just sitting here in this  beautiful house is making me feel really, really good." At bedtime (she stays  overnight), she explains that "It's so quiet and so really special out there  I'd just like to sleep in the yard."  </P> <P> As if aware of the inward poverty of his characters and of their consequent  dramatic inertia, Naumoff reaches clumsily for authorial intensifiers and  fillers of various sorts: "Who could know, who could ever have guessed that  long ago this handsome man and these two gorgeous women . . . would later find  themselves stuck in the time warp of the broken life . . . " Or, somewhat more  grammatically: "Had a team of scientists examined this twentieth-century  couple, how much could they possibly have discovered about them?"  </P> <P> Sadly, the last question answers itself: not much, indeed.  </P> <P> Stirring this novel-stew of cut-outs and surfaces as best he can, Naumoff  resolves things at last with a comic coincidence that will surprise no one, a  medical deus ex machina and a country homily. Along the way, Caroline provides  some briefly raucous farce while driving a tractor and wearing a piece of  "Cynthia's new lingerie on her head"; Cynthia's teen-aged children parade their  materialism; the craven Cynthia demonstrates the depths of her intellect ("You  have to be loved and you have to give love, and when you do that, all of the  rest of the good follows. I've thought a lot about it"), and Richard gives one  of his longer speeches ("It's just everything, okay?").  </P> <P> What keeps this novel, finally, from coming to life is not its lack of ambition  -- it endeavors to take on, at one point or another, all kinds of targets --  but instead its own peculiar lack of a real substance. "Times had changed,"  writes Naumoff. "People had changed. What was once wrong might no longer be  wrong. Things had been lost. Reasons for acting or thinking in a certain way  had been lost. The sense of absolute right and wrong had failed. People tried  to do their best, but no one was sure anymore."  </P> <P> But that's not a convincing apologia, itself falling into yet another authorial  cliche, and one furthermore unconnected to the characters in the book, who in  fact aren't particularly bothered by questions of that sort.  </P> <P> "It's hard to figure out," Naumoff writes yet again. "Some of the best-looking  women ended up with these guys you wouldn't have thought they'd look at twice.  You saw it and it made you think." If, one might ask, that really could be  called thinking, or perception.  </P></p>

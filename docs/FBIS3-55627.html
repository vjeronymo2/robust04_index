The commanders will discuss  illegal migration and drug trafficking across outside borders of  the commonwealth states.    They will also examine principles of cooperation in logistic  supplies to border troops. The meeting will last two days.    Turkmen president Saparmurat Niyazov received the commanders  on Monday morning. At the reception, the Turkmen president  pointed to the importance of political factors which, emerging  under the influence of new processes, affect positively  relations between neighbouring states.    He instanced relations between Turkmenistan, on the one  hand,  Russia and Iran, on the other, which, "thanks to mutual respect  and trust, opened a possibility to find ways for settling all  problems, including border issues".    Niyazov singled out the factor of inviolability of the  present borders as a guarantee of peace and quietude, stressing  that his recent talks with Iranian President Rafsanjani  "revealed full concurrence of the two leaders' views on these  and other issues of cooperation".    "While touring the world, we saw that there were no borders  with barbed wire anywhere. They remain only as a heritage of  the former Soviet Union," Niyazov noted. He expressed hope in  this connection that the present Ashgabat meeting and the  following ones will bring closer the solution of problems  existing on CIS borders.</p>

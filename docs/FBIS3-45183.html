			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- China will set up  large- scale coal bases in its northern areas to supply energy  for the development of its national economy in the 21st century.    Named the "three-xi project", it aims to turn Shanxi,  Shaanxi  and western (or in Chinese, "xi") Inner Mongolia into China's  coal bases by the end of this century. "These bases will be  comprehensive ones covering concerned projects such as coal  mines, electric power plants, railway transportation, gasworks  and concrete plants," said a high-ranking official of the  Ministry of Coal Industry.    According to the ongoing work conference on the coal  industry, the plan will be worked out later this year, and the  project will be approved at that time.    Statistics show that the proven coal deposits in those areas  account for 63 percent of China's total. By the year 2000,  about 370 million tons of coal there are expected to be  allocated to other areas of China.    China is rich in coal reserves and coal accounts for about  75  percent of its primary energy consumption.    In 1993, China's coal output reached 1.14 billion tons, and  it is expected to top 1.4 billion tons by the end of this  century.    According to experts, China can be divided into three parts  in terms of coal distribution. The resources in 19 provinces  lying east of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway are short of  demands. The "three-xi" areas are rich in coal deposits and  will supply coal to other areas, while deposits of coal in  western China meet the region's own demands.    The official said that consequently, in the coal producing  areas with large deposits and high efficiency, a batch of large  energy bases combining transportation of coal and electric power  will be set up to support China's national economy.    To promote the sustained, fast and healthy development of  the  coal industry, the official said, in 1994, no efforts will be  spared to set up 20 comprehensive development bases with major  state-owned coal mines as the foundation.    Meanwhile, more attention will be paid to the construction  of  15 commodity coal mining areas and 100 key coal-producing  counties with state-owned, locally-run coal mines and township  coal-mines as their respective mainstays.</p>

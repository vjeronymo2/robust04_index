			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Observer: Discounting Sir Tom Cowie's failure to win control of rival motor dealer Henlys in a hard fought Pounds 32m bid could be put down to the fall in the stock market or sympathy for the under-dog on the part of Henlys' shareholders. But perhaps his choice of advisers played a part. Sunderland-based Cowie employed Noble Grossart, the Edinburgh merchant bank, and Dickinson Dees, a Newcastle-based lawyer. It brought in an external PR firm halfway through the campaign. It estimates its costs at around Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 650,000 - 'we drive a hard bargain' boasts Gordon Hodgson, Cowie's chief executive. Henlys fees, by contrast, are in the Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 900,000 region. But then that may not be such a high price to pay if it helps secure the firm's continued independence.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii on Tuesday [5 April] praised efforts by private financial  institutions to liquidate their bad loans.    "I have a feeling that it got off to a steady start," Fujii  said of the bad-loan liquidation at a regular press conference  after a morning cabinet meeting. He was referring to results  for the October-March second half of fiscal 1993 reported Monday  by a debt-purchasing body established by financial institutions  in January 1993.    Cooperative Debt Purchasing Co. said it bought 2.65 trillion  yen worth of principal of bad loans, up 2.2 times from the  previous fiscal half year.    Welcoming the steady move without relying on public funds,  Fujii noted financial institutions are expected to have also  liquidated such problem loans through other measures in their  fiscal book closing last Thursday. He said the government must  support their efforts by promoting tax, information and other  programs included in the September economic stimulus package to  facilitate liquidation of real estate held as collateral for the  bad loans.    The debt-purchasing firm reported it managed to recover only  27 billion yen, with 24 billion yen collected, of the bad loans  it purchased by selling collateral real estate.    Concerning recent declines in stock prices, Fujii stressed  the importance of steadily implementing the 15.25 trillion yen  stimulus package to buoy the economy. The finance minister  declined to comment as usual on stock movements but said he  would "quietly watch."    He said cabinet ministers agreed at the morning meeting to  place priority on united efforts to start Diet deliberations and  enact the fiscal 1994 budget "as soon as possible."</p>

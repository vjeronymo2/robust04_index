			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> Well, the latest state elections are over in Germany, and the folks at Killer  Music in Hollywood are happy with the results.  </P> <P> After all, the Christian Democratic Union's ruling coalition scored a near  sweep.  </P> <P> Killer Music, you see, wrote the CDU's campaign song, "Touch the Future," which  has been getting plenty of air time on radio in Germany. The big test will be  in less than two months, when the national elections are held.  </P> <P> Killer was chosen for the job, Executive Vice President Dain Blair said,  because it has composed numerous commercial songs for U.S. and international  companies.  </P> <P> "Touch the Future," an inspirational-type ditty with lyrics like, "See the sun  rise / Feel the power," never mentions the CDU or Helmut Kohl. And it's in  English.  </P> <P> "When we asked why (the CDU wanted English lyrics)," Blair said, "they told us  they were seeking support from a younger demographic group. And the youth of  Germany grew up listening to American and British pop records."  </P> <P> The following are some memorable student evaluations of psychology professors  and teaching assistants at one institution of higher learning.  </P> <P> * "Brown shoes do not go with black pants."  </P> <P> * "You're really cool, like, y'know, but you wrinkle your eyebrows funny."  </P> <P> * "Russ is too tall."  </P> <P> * "Dude, the earring is really nice. But get a life, you're not the teacher. I  mean, give us a break, your lectures are dry. But I really like you. Chow  (sic), baby."  </P> <P> Where did these pearls of wisdom originate? They're featured in an article by  UCLA grad student Russell Johnson in the fall issue of UCLA Magazine.  </P> <P> Clip out and save, USC alums.  </P> <P> There hadn't been a spectacle like it in the City Council chamber since way  back last year and the presentation of a delegation of pro-roller-skating  Venice characters, including a turbaned man playing a guitar on wheels.  </P> <P> This time, the visitors were fans of the "Rocky Horror Picture Show," who  showed up to see the cult film honored on the 15th anniversary of its opening  in Hollywood. They were appropriately dressed and undressed. Maybe you have to  have seen the picture . . .  </P> <P> Plead Radio:  </P> <P> Famous disc jockey Rick Dees, accused of sex discrimination Tuesday by his  37-year-old, former female sidekick, signed on to his KIIS-FM show Wednesday  morning as "The Defendant."  </P> <P> The traffic mess is worse than ever, of course. But newcomers to L.A. can take  some comfort in the fact that it's been a problem for decades. Thirty years  ago, in fact, the late Bill Kennedy wrote in his "Mr. L.A." column in the late  Herald-Express:  </P> <P> "Here is the perfect solution for our traffic problem: Make all L.A. streets  and freeways one way, going north. So what happens then? Who cares? Then it's  Santa Barbara's problem."  </P> <P> In its eternal search for knowledge, Only in L.A. was struck by this  philosophical observation:  </P> <P> "It is not impolite to pass others in line if there is a vacant space ahead."  </P> <P> It's on a sign in a snack shop at LAX.  </P> <P> Chow, baby.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> In affluent Rolling Hills, the law says that any new house must be one-story,  ranch-style design and painted white.  </P></p>

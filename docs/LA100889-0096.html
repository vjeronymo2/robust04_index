			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NIGHT MOVES: AT BEOGRAD, ROBUST FOOD, REVELRY TRANSLATE INTO ONE WORD:  YUGOSLAVIAN  </P> <P> You might not know Marshall Josip Tito from Archduke Francis Ferdinand.  </P> <P> Perhaps you've never entertained the notion of pljeskavica or raznjici.  </P> <P> But consider, for a moment, Yugoslavia's robust wines, filo dough, stuffed meat  pastries and Serbo-Croatian folk songs crooned by the Balkans' answer to Frank  Sinatra.  </P> <P> The proprietors of Beograd, a restaurant and nightclub in North Hollywood, have  given all of these Yugoslavian amenities a great deal of consideration. The  bland exterior of the restaurant, in a mini-mall near Magnolia and Cahuenga  boulevards, gives little indication of the Slavic delights that lie within.  </P> <P> The food is tasty, hearty and reasonably priced. The service is friendly  without being overbearing. And where else in Los Angeles can you and your loved  ones get serenaded by Zvomko Mitrovic, a pinstripe-suited Yugoslavian who puts  his big Croatian heart into the songs he belts out to packed crowds each Friday  and Saturday night?  </P> <P> In the year since Ljijana Javorina and Vojkan Kalnic opened Beograd, the  nondescript corner has turned into a little slice of Yugoslavia on weekend  nights, attracting Americans as well as Montenegrans, Serbs, Croats and other  representatives of Yugoslavia's six republics and two autonomous provinces who  come to rekindle memories of their homeland.  </P> <P> Don't be surprised if some of your fellow diners jump to their feet in the  midst of their chicken Paprikash, link hands and begin dancing an ethnic  fast-step that takes them in a half-circle around the room.  </P> <P> Although Beograd opens at 5 p.m, things don't really kick into gear until about  10:30 p.m. Sometimes the revelry extends late into the night. One recent Sunday  morning at 1:30, the musicians were still singing to a packed (and rapt) house.  </P> <P> Javorina and Kalnic used to own Yugoslavian Village, a now-closed restaurant on  Barham Boulevard near Cahuenga. Kalnic, who often plays accordion in the house  band, is in contact with musician friends he left behind in Belgrade 17 years  ago. As a result, Beograd is a showcase for visiting Yugoslavian musicians, who  come to Los Angeles for six-week stints. The revolving door ensures that  singers know the newest Slavic pop songs in addition to more traditional fare.  And there's no cover.  </P> <P> One night, an accordion player from Belgrade coaxed unusual, vibrato-like  sounds from his instrument, and Mitrovic's vocals evoked the quavering  plaintive singing one associates with Islamic music. The band can switch to  rousing polkas at the drop of a hat. Drum machines are verboten, and Mitrovic  works the room like a celebrity entertainer in Las Vegas, maneuvering from  table to table, trailing a long microphone cord, and trading jokes with the  crowd in Serbo-Croatian.  </P> <P> Since Yugoslavia was cobbled together after World War I from the republics of  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia, Slovenia and Croatia and two  autonomous provinces, Vojvodina and Kosovo, Yugoslavian cuisine, like its  music, is really a melange of influences. But dieters be warned -- this is not  low-cal food.  </P> <P> Dinners run from $9.95 to $13.95 for specials and include a tomato-based spicy  fish soup or salad that comes with "mysterious Yugoslavian dressing," according  to a waitress. This translated into a salad of crisp romaine with what tasted  like a Caesar dressing.  </P> <P> Chicken breasts came stuffed with feta cheese, rolled in nutty-tasting bread  crumbs and fried, accompanied by sauteed peppers, carrots, rice and potatoes.  </P> <P> And the pljeskavica? That's a mixture of ground pork, beef, lamb and bell  peppers served on a bed of onions.  </P> <P> Among the desserts, palacsinka -- stuffed crepe suzettes topped with a  chocolate sauce -- stands out.  </P> <P> Beograd also offers strong, 12%-alcohol Yugoslavian beer for $3.50, mineral  water, Turkish coffee and a variety of "Jugoslavian" wines at $11.95 a bottle.  </P> <P> Javorina, who has worked in restaurants for 25 years and does most of the  cooking, says she plans to get a Yugoslavian publishing house to start sending  over some Belgrade newspapers to make her Slavic customers feel at home.  </P> <P> But whether you're a Serb or an Angeleno, "When you come here, you feel like  you are in Yugoslavia."  </P> <P> Beograd, 10540 Magnolia Blvd., North Hollywood, is open from 5 to 10 p.m.  Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday; from 5 p.m. until 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday.  Visa and MasterCard accepted. (818) 766-8689.  </P> <P> </P></p>

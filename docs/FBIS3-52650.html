			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in </F> Tunis by Wolfgang Labuhn in Cologne on 5 January; 'Arafat  answers in English, with superimposed German  translation--recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] My colleague Wolfgang Labuhn had an  opportunity this morning to ask Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis when the  talks with the Israelis will be continued.    ['Arafat] It depends on the Israelis, and not only on the  Palestinians. We are now expecting results from the Israelis in  this respect. They appear to be insisting on a number of  conditions that are far from the Declaration of Principles that  we signed at the White House in Washington in September last  year. We insist on the implementation of this agreement, on its  accurate and honest implementation.    [Labuhn] What conditions has the Israeli side set?    ['Arafat] To take one example: According to the Israeli  administration, the dimension of Jericho is 712 square  kilometers. To start with, they offered us 27 square kilometers,  which was then increased to 55 square kilometers. They want to  control the access routes and border crossings, or, in other  words, they want to put us into a ghetto or a Bantustan. But  who would accept having to live in a Bantustan or a ghetto? The  third issue is that the number of Jewish settlers in Gaza is no  more than 3,000, and they insist on approximately 40 square  kilometers for those 3,000 settlers, whereas the population  there totals approximately 1.2 million, as you know. Can you  imagine that this is fair? Could anyone accept this?  Regrettably, I must say that they are demanding unacceptable  guarantees. They only want to humiliate the Palestinians, and  they do not want to solve problems or make peace with the  Palestinians.    [Labuhn] Should these problems be seen as a package, or  should they rather be solved step by step?    ['Arafat] I prefer to solve them step by step, because we do  not want more than the accurate and serious implementation of  the agreement.    [Labuhn] In your view, what problem is the most important  one?    ['Arafat] We are confronted with these problems, and we are  ready to discuss them in frank and open talks in the sense of  the framework agreement concluded with Israel.    [Labuhn] Israel insists on security measures for its  settlers in the occupied territories. Do you understand these  concerns?    ['Arafat] They have no right to use this as an excuse,  because we have accepted that in addition to our own  responsibility in these areas, Israel can have full  responsibility for their security. So this cannot be an excuse  for Israel's position.    [Labuhn] Will the talks with Israel be continued this week?    ['Arafat] We hope so.    [Labuhn] When? In a few hours, days, or not before next  week?    ['Arafat] It seems in a few days.    [Labuhn] The implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement is  now lagging three weeks behind the agreed time schedule. When  are you hoping to move into your residence in Jericho?    ['Arafat] It all depends on how the Israelis treat us,  whether they continue maneuvering in order not to have to  observe the exact dates.</p>

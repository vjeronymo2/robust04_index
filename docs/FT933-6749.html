			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Wetlands protection plan attacked by developers: Lawsuit filed against US administration US MINING and development interests have attacked the Clinton administration's plans to end the divisive debate over protecting US wetlands, hours after these were announced. Interest groups, led by the National Association of Home Builders and the American Mining Congress, filed a suit in Washington late on Tuesday, in an effort to stop one of the plans' provisions. The suit challenges the administration's ability to require permits for all building excavation in wetlands areas, which would be a toughening of previous policy. The suit alleges that the nine federal agencies which developed the plan acted illegally by adopting the new rule administratively, rather than submit it to Congress. 'This is going to cause a lot more people to have to get permits in a system that is already overburdened,' said Ms Cynthia Adcock of the home builders' association. Developers, agricultural interests and environmentalists gave mixed reactions to the plan, which offers some concessions to all parties but satisfies none completely. Developers are to be allowed to operate 'mitigation banking', whereby property owners may buy the right to drain a wetland by contributing to a fund set up to restore such land elsewhere. Also, a new rule would allow property owners denied building permits the right to appeal without going to court. Environmentalists are pleased with a provision that would prevent indiscriminate development of more than 1.5m acres of wetlands in Alaska, and with the president's commitment to no net loss of wetlands in the short run and to restoration in the long run. Many are angry, however that the agriculture department would be responsible for identifying wetland areas and that the plan does not protect more than 53m acres of wetlands drained prior to 1985. 'We believe that the package, on balance, is a net loss for America's wetlands,' said Mr Michael Crook of the National Wildlife Fund. He said mitigation banking could encourage development of wetlands by making it easy for property owners to comply with requirements.</p>

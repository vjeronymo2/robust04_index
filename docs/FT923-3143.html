			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / A weekend of telephone calls across Europe MASSIVE and futile intervention by the Bank of Italy and the German Bundesbank last Friday to support the lira triggered the surprise weekend devaluation of the Italian currency. After the lira had twice fallen below its D-Mark floor of L765.4 in the exchange rate mechanism on Friday, it had become clear to the Bundesbank's currency traders in Frankfurt that the Italian currency would not lift off the bottom of the ERM in spite of extremely heavy buying by the German central bank. Their reports to the Bundesbank directorate came after weeks of mounting tension in the ERM. There followed a weekend of intensive phone calls across Europe that culminated in the first significant change in the ERM for more than five years. The intervention was a new headache for Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president. Only a week before, at a press conference after a meeting of European Community finance ministers in Bath, he had indicated that the scale of intervention to contain strains in the ERM was not yet posing serious problems for the Bundesbank. By last Friday, German buying of the lira had become so great as to threaten further increases in Germany's already swollen money supply. Mr Schlesinger's reaction on Friday was to discuss the problem with Mr Carlo Ciampi, the Italian central bank governor, who was experiencing a haemorrhaging of Italy's foreign currency reserves. At about the same time, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, and Mr Horst Kohler, the state secretary in the finance ministry, became involved in consultations. German officials said there had been a growing feeling from Thursday onwards that a realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism would be needed to deal with a 'very considerable' flow of funds from the Italian lira to the D-Mark. Probably by Friday evening, and certainly by Saturday morning, Germany was proposing a realignment of the Italian lira and German interest rate cuts. The Bundesbank was also motivated to act in expectation that the government in Bonn and both sides of industry would take more effective measures to curb inflationary pressures in Germany. During Saturday morning Mr Schlesinger also contacted the Bundesbank's regional central bank presidents to prepare them for a special meeting of the Bundesbank's central council today at 9am Frankfurt time. Mr Schlesinger wants the council to discuss cuts in Germany's discount and Lombard rates from 8.75 and 9.75 per cent respectively. By Saturday afternoon, the apparatus of the European Community was involved in the plan through Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, director of the French Treasury, who also chairs the EC's monetary committee. It was around this time that the UK Treasury was informed of the plan. Sir Nigel Wicks, the Treasury's second permanent secretary for international monetary affairs and a member of the monetary committee, passed news of the planned 'double whammy' to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Over the weekend, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton and Mr Eddie George, Bank of England governor and deputy governor, were brought into discussions. Mr Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, met his economic ministers on Sunday. He said he had been in touch with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the governors of the Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy as well as the German finance minister and treasury minister to co-ordinate the operation. Yesterday evening, the move was announced in a communique from the monetary committee.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WORLD BASKETBALL LEAGUE IS MAKING IT BIG  </P> <P> One of Steve Ehrhart's first acts as World Basketball League commissioner was  to tell David Stern, his National Basketball Association counterpart, "We're in  no way going to be competing with you."  </P> <P> Neither do the two leagues see eye-to-eye on matters of height or manner of  play.  </P> <P> The Memphis-based WBL stresses speedy, high-scoring games and is limited to  players who are 6-foot-5 or smaller -- a height restriction that would  eliminate the majority of NBA players.  </P> <P> The WBL, which begins its third season in May, is truly a "world" league. North  American teams play touring international non-league teams (which aren't  subject to the height restriction) in games that count in WBL standings. The  WBL plans to feature European and Asian divisions within three years.  </P> <P> In short, the WBL concept appears to be catching on.  </P> <P> "The average size in the NBA is now 6-9 (just over 6-7, the NBA claims)," said  Ehrhart, 42, former executive director of the defunct United States Football  League. "So many of the (NBA) players -- especially backup players -- are just  not excellent athletes. They're there because they are big and big only. The  most entertaining players are usually under 6-5. Michael Jordan told me he's  pretty close."  </P> <P> The WBL players don't play in Jordan's air space, nor for his astronomical  salary. The league's five returning franchises from last season are in  Youngstown, Ohio; Worcester, Mass.; Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Springfield,  Ill.; and Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Memphis will have a team this season. Franchises also are expected in  Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, and possibly in another American city.  </P> <P> Top WBL players have included 6-4 Alfredrick Hughes of Loyola-Chicago, the  fifth-leading scorer in NCAA history; 6-4 Perry McDonald, a two-year starter at  Georgetown; and 6-4 Carlos Clark, a former Ole Miss star and member of the 1984  NBA champion Boston Celtics.  </P> <P> The average salary is $15,000, and each team has a $150,000 annual salary cap.  A team's typical annual budget is $750,000. By contrast, New York Knicks center  Patrick Ewing last year earned an NBA-best salary of $3.5 million.  </P> <P> The WBL's lower salaries translate to lower ticket prices. League attendance  averaged 2,700 in 1988 and 2,900 last season.  </P> <P> Only the Youngstown Pride, last year's league champs, have shown a  single-season profit.  </P> <P> "It takes some time because of the newness of the product," Ehrhart said.  "We're still in the process of fighting for name recognition. There are people  who haven't even heard of us."  </P> <P> But by selling short, the WBL is able to make a strong pitch.  </P> <P> For example:  </P> <P>  -- Close, fast-moving games. The average score is 111-107, Ehrhart said.  </P> <P>  -- Players don't foul out. Beginning with a player's seventh foul, the  opposition gets a foul shot or shots and possession.  </P> <P>  -- In overtime, the first team to seven points wins.  </P> <P>  -- The WBL uses the international three-point line of 20-feet, 6-inches. The  NBA's line ranges from 22 feet on the baseline to 23-9 at the top of the key.  </P> <P>  -- A player fouled on a three-point try receives three free throws.  </P> <P> The WBL also is entering the second year of a three-year television deal worth  nearly $2 million with cable network SportsChannel America.  </P> <P> Officials think the NBA and WBL can coexist. They also believe that WBL owners  may one day have the chance to own NBA teams.  </P> <P> "This gives us the opportunity to prove ourselves with this team," Memphis  interim general manager Pat Carter said. "Hopefully, we'd be in line, in  consideration for an NBA team."  </P> <P> The WBL seems to be doing legwork for the NBA on matters of expansion, in the  United States and around the world.  </P> <P> "No question," Ehrhart said. "They're watching us."  </P> <P> But NBA Vice President for Public Relations Bryan McIntyre said the league  isn't watching the WBL's international expansion plans. He called the NBA,  whose teams have played overseas exhibitions, "the top professional league for  basketball in the world."  </P> <P> A group including investors and promoters contacted Ehrhart in late 1987 about  becoming commissioner. When he took the job in early '88, Ehrhart virtually was  in a league by himself.  </P> <P> "No players had been signed," he said. "They were debating whether to make the  height 6-4 or 6-5. There was no name for the league."  </P> <P> And the league was to begin play in May. "That was just a total all-out sprint  to get stadiums, dates, players signed, rules adopted and published -- to tell  people who we are and what we are, battle for recognition," he said.  </P></p>

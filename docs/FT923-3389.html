			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Tarmac Tarmac's announcement that it is cutting a third of its brick production and a tenth of its concrete block output is welcome news for an industry plagued by overcapacity. The depressing reality, though, is that this is only a partial solution for the company, while several competitors must be thinking of following suit. The ideal solution for Tarmac would have been a joint venture with Steetley, but this proposal was trumped by Redland's bid. As a result the costs of withdrawal now have to be taken unilaterally, though the assumption is that last year's Pounds 18m provision should be sufficient to cover the bill. Mutterings about mothballing some of the plant, moreover, should protect the balance sheet: the company can presumably argue that there is no need for a write-off. Since it has only 5-6 per cent of the market and is unable to take a more aggressive stance, one nevertheless wonders whether Tarmac should be in the brick business at all. Yesterday's announcement obviously raises the prospect of similar moves from the likes of Ibstock Johnsen and London Brick. There will always be a temptation to hang on and try to poach market share, but with Redland in the background that may not be prudent. Ironically, the controversial practice of acquisition accounting provides Redland with a spur to take the right commercial decision. The company is expected to signal hefty restructuring provisions against Steetley when it reports its interim figures next month, enabling it to speed up rationalisation of the sector.</p>

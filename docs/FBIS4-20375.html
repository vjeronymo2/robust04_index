			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gu Kejian (6253 0344 7003), Faculty of Economics </F> and Trade, Zhongnan University of Finance and Economics:  "Macroeconomic Coordination of Foreign Trade and Foreign  Investment Policies"]    [Text] In implementing China's policy of reform and  opening, foreign investment in our enterprises has become a  positive force which incrementally expands our export-import  boundary. In the first three quarters of this year, the total  export value of foreign-funded enterprises as a percentage of  China's total export value has increased to 26.4 percent from  19.8 percent of the same period of the year before. In China's  foreign trade area, foreign-funded enterprises now play an  increasingly important role, leading to calls for relaxing the  current foreign trade policy controls and enlarging the foreign  trade policy sphere to include foreign investment activities,  particularly in terms of effectively using the mechanism for  coordinating the two closely related production models utilizing  foreign capital, namely, import substitution and foreign  exchange earning exports.    I. Theoretical Inquiry Into Coordination of Foreign  Investment and Foreign Trade Policies    In terms of China's foreign trade objectives and choice of  methods in the utilization of foreign capital, we should use as  foundation the best macroeconomic approaches for raising capital  and handling returns on investment. Generally speaking, in the  process of attracting foreign investment, the macroeconomic  approaches to capitalization and returns on investment involves  the creation and outflow of national income. The main factors  which influence this process include: 1) the basic structure and  changes in enterprises as a function of the production; 2)  determination of the points of competition; 3) the risk of  imbalance in foreign exchange receipts and expenditures  accounts. We should consider the composite effect of the  above-mentioned three main factors in deciding how foreign  investment policy should be coordinated within the foreign trade  policy area.  <H5>  1. Foreign investment policy and the objective of an </H5> export-oriented foreign trade policy    The exports of China's foreign-funded enterprises are geared  to markets of developed countries, and some products are even  exported directly back to the investors' home countries; because  of fierce competition in developed countries and in order to  remain reasonably competitive in their marketing environment,  foreign investors in China must fully exploit the two major  advantages in establishing and operating any enterprises,  namely, host country's low costs and investors' own relatively  superior managerial standards. In considering the various ways  for utilizing foreign capital, direct foreign investment which  transfers a series of key components of capital, technology,  management and operating procedures, particularly the "surplus"  managerial component of multinational companies, can help our  enterprises expand their exports and rapidly realize the goal of  earning foreign exchange via exports. This year, China's  external trade has shown a sharp decline, but exports are  booming for the export-oriented foreign-funded enterprises or  processing enterprises in which foreign capital plays a leading  role, which clearly demonstrates the stable relationship or  linkage between direct foreign investment and the scale of  exports. On the other hand, indirect foreign investment which  uses a resource-matching method and transfers only needed single  components can hardly help our enterprises increase their  overall competitiveness for exports in terms of their marketing,  technology and domestic channels, and can only serve the single  function of raising capital, replenishing domestic savings or  filling foreign exchange gaps.    For foreign investment policy to serve the objective of an  export-oriented foreign trade policy, foreign capital should be  used in ways which are compatible with foreign exchange earning  exports; various foreign investment policy measures should be  used to attract and guide foreign investors to correctly utilize  production factors of low costs and labor supply which are  clearly in China's advantage, and to promote these variables in  enterprise production function to achieve maximum effect in  terms of production quantity and exports. If China's foreign  investment policy seeks to attract foreign capital only on the  basis that China offers relatively advantageous conditions, the  result will not only prevent China from realizing maximum trade  benefits but also easily lead to national income loss and,  through theoretical projections of the nonfarm production cycle,  to a quagmire in which any long term improvements of trade  conditions will be difficult to achieve and China prevented from  competing and winning in the evolving system of international  division of labor by rationalizing and upgrading our export  enterprise structure. Therefore, mindful of China's foreign  trade policy goals within the international arena, China's  foreign investment policy must vigorously and quickly upgrade  the export product structure of foreign-funded enterprises,  conclude the third stage of the nonfarm production cycle,  encourage foreign investment in the second stage of this cycle  and, through enterprises with competitive export advantage,  quickly take a commanding lead in the first stage of a new  nonfarm production cycle by seizing the rare opportunity early  on where the supply-demand price elasticity has not yet  escalated, improve the export trading conditions faced by  China's foreign-funded enterprises, and through an open economy  model vigorously strive to open up abroad new directions in the  nonfarm production cycle which match the "win through quality"  export strategy now being pursued and implemented by China.  Otherwise, in the competitive export production of  foreign-funded enterprises, the foreign investors' ability to  accumulate and retain earnings will be hamstrung by the current  export structure. Furthermore, since China's naturally endowed  production advantages are in flux and evolving, and once the  labor cost advantage becomes less decisive or even disappears  entirely, the simple processing-for-export model of  foreign-funded enterprises will face a dim future. At present,  many foreign investors already consider China's labor intensive  model to be less attractive and therefore are giving up their  plans to invest further in China.  <H5>  2. Foreign investment policy and the objective of an </H5> import-substitution foreign trade policy    Import substitution involves confining foreign capital  utilization and the market it generates to within the host  country, even though the host country's economic conditions are  backward and the competitive standards set by the foreign-funded  enterprises cannot match those in the investors' home countries.  Because monopolistic enterprises control the supply-demand curve  in making decisions regarding production quantity, they can lead  to improper allocation of resources; China's utilization of  foreign capital in practice also clearly demonstrates that  without adequate competition, the managerial factor brought in  by foreign investors is minimally utilized in the host country.  A typical factual example which provides a basis for observation  and judgment is the fact that China, through joint domestic and  foreign funding, has established several automobile production  lines, but their scale of production is considerably below not  only that in the investors' home country but also the  competitive standard recognized internationally. Aside from the  joint funding of research and development costs and their  separate usage, it hardly reflects the quality of an effective  economic model. It can conclusively be stated that in the early  stages of China's import substitution policy, the growth of  foreign-funded enterprises in this area was mainly due to  increased inputs of single component of labor or capital, and  productivity based on a composite of important managerial and  economic factors was still very low. In many localities, the  so-called foreign investment was in reality investment of  personal savings, not corporate investment, to say nothing of  investment of the surplus managerial factor. Because China as  host country has a vast potential market, unless the foreign  investment was clearly irrational, any foreign investment in  short-term joint venture projects invariably involved no risk at  all.    To prevent any long-term imbalance in international balance  of payments, foreign investors should not be allowed to earn an  excessively high rate of investment return; at the same time,  because of relatively low competitive level of enterprises in  the import substitution area, and the fact that re-establishing  these enterprises is uneconomical, the managerial factor  introduced by multinational companies is only partly effective  and the economy of scale only partially realized. Therefore, in  attracting foreign capital to the import substitution area,  China's reliance on investment in single, separate production in  effect is using indirect foreign investment to fill the  technological gaps created by the process of upgrading China's  enterprise structure. In the 1980s, China initially approved  bringing in some 2,000 technology projects which vigorously  supported the development of China's electronic industry,  basically satisfied the consumption demands of our domestic  market and enabled our enterprises to begin developing the  ability to penetrate the world market.    In calling for more indirect investment in the import  substitution area or for using foreign capital in stages, it  does not mean that foreign- funded enterprises are excluded. In  this regard, we should take note of two kinds of situations:  First, promoting basic reform in state-owned enterprises by  bringing in new management factors through direct foreign  investment is essentially going outside of the reform sphere and  does not relate to any foreign trade and investment policies;  second, to develop technologically advanced enterprises which  will maintain a leading edge for a relatively long period of  time, we should allow direct foreign investment in those  domestic enterprises which have developed the basic competitive  capacity, especially those producing high-grade capital goods in  the import substitution area.    II. Contradiction in Carrying Out Coordination of  Foreign Trade and Foreign Investment Policies and Possible  Remedies    The boom of foreign investments in China has revealed  numerous contradictions between China's foreign trade and  foreign investment policies, and maintaining appropriate  coordination of the two policy goals is an urgent task if  continued healthy development of foreign- funded enterprises is  to be assured.  <H5>  1. Based on foreign trade objectives, implement structural </H5> adjustment and quantitative control in foreign capital  utilization    In terms of China's current utilization of foreign capital,  aside from controlling indirect foreign investment by monitoring  debt repayments and rates of interest payment, which reflect the  extent to which exports are being restrained by foreign debt  regulations making the latter serve the implementation of  foreign trade policy objectives, the types of structural  adjustment in foreign investment utilization and the scope of  direct foreign investment are still not well coordinated within  the foreign trade policy area. Last year, direct foreign  investment in China for the first time exceeded China's  borrowing from abroad. But what is a cause of concern is that,  lacking any clear-cut foreign trade policy guidance, the  percentage of foreign-funded enterprises oriented toward exports  and their rate of exports are both very low. Among  jointly-funded enterprises, these two indices have long been  kept at around 20 percent; the fact that only 5-8 percent of the  high-tech enterprises produce foreign exchange earning exports  or products which can reasonably be used for import substitution  and the above-mentioned percentage indicate that a total of  70-80 percent of such enterprises utilize only run-of-the-mill  technology and produce for domestic sales and consumption; even  in Shanghai which sets the national standard in this area, the  sum of the two indices this year is only 53 percent. As a  result, the foreign exchange transactions of foreign-funded  enterprises have exerted a negative effect on China's  international balance of payment, and reduced the efficacy of  using foreign trade policy to encourage exports. Therefore, we  should clearly spell out our foreign trade policy objectives on  import substitution and foreign exchange earning exports, and  positively encourage direct foreign investment in the foreign  exchange earning exports area; in the import substitution area,  we should attract direct foreign investment to those high-tech  enterprises whose products can clearly substitute for imports of  technology and can also effectively be used to disseminate the  technology to all domestic enterprises through their internal  structural changes. In the broad import substitution area,  however, we should as appropriate attract indirect foreign  investment to activities which bear on import substitution, and  promote multifaceted indirect investment by taking advantage of  opportunities made possible by the current trend of increased  credit use in international capital transactions. We should,  therefore, develop a major structure in which more and more  indirect foreign investment will be drawn to the import  substitution area, and more and more direct foreign investment  to the foreign exchange earning exports area.  <H5>  2. Using foreign trade policy measures, sweep away </H5> restrictions on foreign capital transactions in the import  substitution and foreign exchange earning exports areas    Using different foreign trade policy objectives to determine  methods of foreign capital utilization, because of numerous  factors, would result in superficial implementation. In reality,  China has already extended numerous preferential treatments to  foreign-funded enterprises, with China herself enduring the pain  of reducing prices to the lowest possible point (such as land  prices) to encourage foreign investors to establish high-tech  and exports producing enterprises. Despite the restriction on  the enterprise financial budget, the government has allowed  foreign-funded enterprises to maintain foreign exchange receipts  and expenditures accounts and use various channels including the  foreign exchange swap centers to remit foreign exchange earnings  and consolidate compensations for purchasing domestic products  for exports. The restrictions on enterprise foreign exchange  budgets are clearly being relaxed, which in the longer term will  lead to exports falling below the contractually specified export  ratios. In the past, we have relied on the enterprises  themselves to find their own ways to maintain foreign exchange  equilibrium, and we have successfully encouraged foreign-funded  enterprises, particularly the sole-source investment  enterprises, to maintain a rather high export ratio in direct  contrast with other developing countries' experiences with sole-  source foreign investments. Because of this, we should use our  foreign trade policy objectives to lead and guide investment  decisions on production quantity made by foreign-funded  enterprises.    First, we should change the policy of granting preferential  treatments based on locality, enterprise and even the type of  enterprise to a policy based on end-results and, guided by our  foreign trade policy objectives, extend preferential treatments  to high-tech enterprises and the foreign exchange earning  exports area. At present, an important adjustment in our foreign  investment policy is to change the focus from locality to  enterprise in foreign capital utilization, but in practice  implementation is still held up by the static protocol of  policy. In this respect, we have overlooked one basic fact,  namely the opportunities for promoting economic growth and  developing export potentials exist not only in certain  localities or enterprises, but in various types of enterprises  in the broad context of the economy. An end-result oriented  policy should give equal rewards and encouragements to all  localities, departments and enterprises operating within the  scope of this policy so that they will strive for incremental  gains consistent with the policy's macroeconomic intent. In  giving preferential treatments to foreign investment based on an  end-result oriented foreign trade policy, we should continue to  incrementally reward any transactions which promote foreign  exchange earning exports or which increase the technological  content of import substitution enterprises. In using this  concept to guide the reform of China's foreign capital taxation  system, we should request that all localities or departments  change from giving preferential treatment on income taxes and  adopt a new system of reducing or rebating indirect taxes and  customs duties in the export-import cycle in conformance with  customary international practices to arrive at an indirect tax  rate which effectively encourages exports. In the past, we have  made a priori determinations of the export ratio for exporting  enterprises and the technological standard for import  substitution enterprises, and these in different degrees  reflected the directions of our foreign trade policy, but this  system was ultimately based on an objective of encouraging  particular enterprises rather than an objective of giving  even-handed encouragement to increasing the quantitative flow of  foreign trade. This demonstrates that our foreign trade policy  was incomplete and lacking in thoroughness. For example, in 1988  among China's foreign-funded enterprises, the proportion of  export-oriented enterprises and their export ratio were almost  identical, at 20.92 percent and 20.75 percent respectively. This  means that non-exporting enterprises were not given any  preferential treatments such as the reducing or waiving of  income taxes enjoyed by export-producing enterprises, and they  could not achieve the goal of maximizing the export potentials  of foreign-funded enterprises.    Second, change the past policy of keeping trading activities  of foreign-funded enterprises separate and apart from those of  domestic enterprises, and implement the foreign trade policy  goal of encouraging and assisting foreign investors to develop  strategic export enterprises which enjoy competitive advantage  internationally. An important external factor in the mushrooming  growth of foreign-funded enterprises in China is traceable to  the pressures of currency devaluation and rising costs in  developed countries and newly industrialized Asian countries  that force enterprises there which have lost their production  advantages to relocate abroad. Whether China can seize this  historic opportunity and carry out its externally oriented  economic development policy, not only in terms of the extent to  which foreign investors are attracted to use China's labor  resource advantage to lower their production costs, but more  importantly to see, with foreign investment in labor-intensive  enterprises and their exports replacing exports of  resource-intensive enterprises, whether foreign investment can  quickly enter into the stage of developing competitive strategic  exports, and whether products of foreign-funded enterprises  produced with benefits of all the advantageous factors will make  a good start in a new cycle unhampered by low-grade products  which will avoid pitfalls in the nonfarm production cycle. Last  year, the export ratio of China's foreign-funded enterprises  rose to 20.5 percent, much higher than their industrial  production value of 8.5 percent, and judging by their export  ratio and their share of the total production value in terms of  international competitiveness, China's foreign-funded  enterprises scored 41.46 percent on a comparative index of  international competitiveness, which is better than even the  highest standard reached in the 1980s by the Republic of Korea.  What is astonishing to us is that examining the competitiveness  index in terms of imports, the 1992 index is a negative value of  minus 20.64 percent, and even after eliminating foreign  investment in import facilities, the index still shows a  negative number. Going one step further in the analysis, because  we treat foreign investment in our enterprises as an independent  externally oriented activity, and strictly insist that these  enterprises maintain balanced foreign exchange accounts, this  has forced foreign investors to resort to utilizing the  processing-for-export production method on a large scale,  resulting in a 1992 ratio of as high as 88.8 percent. Since  China relies on the low labor cost advantage in its exports,  this production method which adds minimal value and requires  only a limited processing cycle makes it difficult for China to  attract foreign investment and to gain maximum export benefits.  Therefore, we should follow a strategic foreign trade policy and  attract or match up foreign investors through a series of  developmental steps to establish export processing areas, export  production bases, special plants and factories, and bring  foreign-funded enterprises on to the track of developing China's  strategic foreign trade.  <H5>  3. Correct the operations of foreign-funded enterprises in </H5> accordance with foreign trade policy objectives    First, controlling transfer pricing control. China's  foreign-funded enterprise rely on transfer pricing which leads  to shocking and painful foreign exchange losses and national  income outflows. Transfer pricing in essence is the result of  market internal operations, and eliminating transfer pricing  will have a negative effect on the host country; we need to  externalize our domestic market and let enterprises follow the  principle of basing transfer pricing on market price and not on  cost of capital in production. Therefore, through a system of  open competitive bidding (and foreign partners in any enterprise  may be given limited preferential treatment and priority in  bidding) and pricing based on customs estimates which  approximate open market pricing to promote enterprises in the  import cycle, we can help strengthen the supply- demand pricing  elasticity of open market and control the tendency of quoting  high prices for imports and holding down prices for exports. In  this way, the customs authorities using their own information  network can supervise and control any unreasonable export  transfer prices quoted by foreign-funded enterprises by  comparing these prices with those of China's specialized  companies and industrial-commercial firms; in the import cycle,  a system of open competitive bidding can in varying degrees  spell out the open market conditions, control foreign businesses  from cutting into the capital base and profits of jointly-  funded enterprises through reckless tactics of investment in  infrastructure facilities, and help establish a strategic,  alliance type of cooperative enterprises to gain sale outlets  and channels and speed up product developments. As for the  structural advantages of multinational companies or allied  enterprises in lowering their transactional costs in the  domestic markets, these would not be diminished as a result.  This is because that permission given to any reasonable internal  transfer pricing is limited to enterprises determined by  research as having difficulties to adopt to market conditions or  to enterprises which nevertheless incur relatively high trading  costs after searching for reasonable pricing in an open market;  these technical factors affecting transfer pricing also apply to  any new or original products or projects, i.e. even though open  market exposure will not lead to unnecessary increase in  transaction costs, but precisely because of filtering and  screening by the open market, they are found to be worthy of  support because they are well suited to trading in the domestic  market. In this way, the supervision and control of transfer  pricing will play an important role in terms of our foreign  trade policy objectives.    Second, estimating the scale of exports. Foreign capital  utilized in foreign-funded enterprises and exports processing  enterprises is an effective way to make reasonable use of the  domestic market, lower transaction costs and search for the most  advantageous structure among the wide range of international  productive enterprises. Nevertheless, it is difficult to prevent  or control foreign-funded enterprises' exports and their  subsequent re-exports from being included in other countries'  foreign trade accounts and estimates within the scope of  international trading activities. We should consult the  practices in other countries -- particularly regarding  regulations governing the country of origin for imports, the  percentage of added value, the percentage of native resources  used, and what proofs of place of production are required for  different products of the exporting countries -- and accordingly  add the exports to the quota of concerned countries trading with  China, and thereby bring foreign-funded enterprises and export  processing enterprises within the scope and control of China's  foreign trade policy.</p>

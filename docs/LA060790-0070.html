			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INCUMBENTS COAST, 2 CHALLENGERS STRUGGLE  </P> <P> South Bay incumbents breezed through their primaries, but a pair of Democrat  challengers remain locked in a struggle to determine which of them will face  U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) in the Nov. 6 general election.  </P> <P> Of the dozen congressmen, assemblymen and state senators up for reelection in  the region, only U.S. Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) and Assemblyman Dave  Elder (D-San Pedro) faced primary opposition Tuesday.  </P> <P> Neither politician was put to the test.  </P> <P> Dymally trounced two challengers, Inglewood lawyer Lawrence A. Grigsby and  former Compton College Trustee Carl E. Robinson Sr., garnering 73% of the vote  to Grigsby's 15% and Robinson's 12%. Elder crushed his lone opponent,  unemployed physics teacher Ed Musgrave of Long Beach, winning 85% of the  ballots.  </P> <P> "Rarely in my experience does an incumbent get more than 70%," Elder said  Wednesday. "This is quite a pleasant outcome."  </P> <P> The South Bay's other state and federal legislative races involved little-known  challengers running for the right to face U.S. Reps. Rohrabacher, Glenn M.  Anderson (D-San Pedro) and Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) in the fall.  </P> <P> In the fight among Democrats vying to take on Rohrabacher, political science  instructor Guy C. Kimbrough of Huntington Beach was only 14 votes ahead of  computer industry publisher James Cavuoto of Torrance with more than 38,000  ballots counted.  </P> <P> A third candidate, retired high school teacher Bryan W. Stevens of Rolling  Hills Estates, was 1,204 votes off the pace. Election officials said an  undetermined number of late-arriving absentee ballots remain to be counted.  </P> <P> In a two-man GOP battle over who would challenge Levine, West Los Angeles  lawyer David Barrett Cohen sailed past Playa del Rey computer salesman Hans  Yeager with 64% of the vote.  </P> <P> Another two-way GOP battle, this one for the right to challenge Anderson, was  won by Sanford W. Kahn, a gas company salesman from Long Beach, who collected  58% of the vote to beat Jerry Bakke of Wilmington, an insurance agent and  former truckers union leader.  </P> <P> Operating with shoestring campaign budgets in districts dominated by the  opposing party, the winning challengers acknowledged Wednesday that they will  have a hard time unseating incumbents in the Nov. 6 general election. But they  expressed optimism nonetheless.  </P> <P> Said Kahn of his upcoming race against Anderson, an 11-term incumbent: "I think  there is a strong anti-incumbent feeling. If I can play on that . . . I think  the public is ready."  </P> <P> Dymally's win came amid charges by Grigsby that the five-term incumbent is too  closely tied to Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko, whose government has been  identified by the U.S. State Department as repressive and corrupt.  </P> <P> One of Grigsby's flyers said: "Your congressman works for a billionaire  dictator. Not for you." Dymally, a longtime supporter of Mobutu, dismissed  Grigsby's attacks as part of a plot by the New York-based New Alliance Party to  discredit him.  </P> <P> Having prevailed in the primary, Dymally must now beat Republican Eunice N.  Sato, a former Long Beach City Council member, to keep his seat in the 31st  Congressional District, which includes Hawthorne, Gardena, Carson and Harbor  Gateway in the South Bay.  </P> <P> Elder's victory followed an extremely low-key primary campaign. Musgrave,  Elder's opponent, said he had enough money to campaign in only four of the 204  precincts in the 57th Assembly District, which embraces San Pedro, Wilmington,  Harbor City and much of Long Beach.  </P> <P> Elder's Republican challenger in the general election, welfare caseworker  Rodney D. Guarneri of Long Beach, says he will also have limited supplies of  campaign funds. But Guarneri vows he will hit the streets.  </P> <P> "I don't have resources of the kind Dave Elder has, but I'm going to meet  people at the door," Guarneri said. "With the kind of stamina I have and the  time I have, I should be able to walk a lot of precincts. I'm going to be going  full bore."  </P> <P> The closest thing to competition in the South Bay's legislative races occurred  in three congressional primaries where challengers vied with each other for the  right to take on incumbents in November.  </P> <P> Most striking was the still-unresolved race by Democrats competing to run  against Rohrabacher in the 42nd Congressional District, which stretches from  Torrance and the Palos Verdes Peninsula to Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> The race may boil down to Kimbrough's decision to send a campaign mailing to  absentee voters -- and Cavuoto's failure to do so.  </P> <P> Election officials in Los Angeles and Orange counties said Wednesday that the  only ballots remaining to be counted were absentee votes received on Election  Day. Kimbrough, who had been outpacing Cavuoto among absentees by better than a  2-1 margin, appeared confident that he would win.  </P> <P> "I would expect the absentee ballots would be pretty much in line with the  earlier ones," said Kimbrough, who lost to Rohrabacher 33% to 64% in the 1988  general election. "The final tally will likely show me a few hundred votes  ahead."  </P> <P> But Cavuoto, making his first run for public office, expressed confidence. Many  of the absentee voters whose ballots were received on Election Day may not have  left home before getting his regular campaign mailings, he said.  </P> <P> "I think I've got a good chance," he said. "I'm very encouraged." Cavuoto said  he had not decided whether he would request a recount.  </P> <P> In the GOP primary in Anderson's 32nd Congressional District, which includes  San Pedro and Lomita, Kahn won despite collecting less than half the amount of  campaign cash raised by Bakke. That gives him a chance to challenge Anderson  for the second time. In 1988, Anderson beat Kahn by a margin of better than 2  to 1.  </P> <P> In Levine's 27th Congressional District -- which in the South Bay encompasses  Lawndale, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, El Segundo and parts  of Torrance and Inglewood -- both GOP challengers were political newcomers.  </P> <P> But Barrett Cohen quit his job as a corporate lawyer to devote all his time to  the campaign, out-organizing and outspending Yeager. On Wednesday, he vowed he  would give Levine a fight, despite the incumbent's gargantuan $1.5-million  campaign war chest.  </P> <P> "I think we're going to surprise a lot of people," Cohen said. "I don't intend  to be anybody's sacrificial lamb."  </P></p>

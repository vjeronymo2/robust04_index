			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television If you find it is not so much the politics which are hard to take in this election campaign but the politicians, you may want to watch World In Action (8.30 ITV). It will look not at politicians but at electors: some of those in Hampstead and Highgate who have avoided being listed on the electoral register because they have not paid their poll tax, and others in South Africa who will be voting even though they left Britain nearly 20 years ago. Which outfit runs the toughest test in the British armed forces? That's right, whichever is the subject of this week's documentary. Today it is the 'All Arms Course' run by the Parachute Regiment, according to Cutting Edge (9.00 C4). Best drama adaptation so far this year, and quite likely to remain so, is BBC2's The Old Devils which has splendid ensemble acting from a marvellous cast including Bernard Hepton, Elizabeth Spriggs, and John Stride (9.30 BBC2). Northern Exposure is described as a 'cult American comedy drama series' which means they don't expect most of us to like it. Having watched the slow and not very funny opening episode I am not surprised.</p>

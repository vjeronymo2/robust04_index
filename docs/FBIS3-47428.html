			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- South Korean pollack  fishing in Russian economic waters resumed Monday after a lapse  of three years, with 32 vessels from 16 deep sea fishing  companies casting their nets in the North Okhotsk Sea, off the  North Kurile Islands and Southeast of Kamchatka peninsula, the  fisheries administration said.    The resumption of pollack fishing will relieve the financial  difficulties of the fishing companies as a smooth supply is  expected.    The Russian Government approved a 30,000-ton quota for  Korean  fishermen in 1992 and a 150,000-ton quota in 1993, but prices  were not agreed on at a Korea-Russia private meeting so fishing  did not take place.    At a Korea-Russia private meeting in December in Moscow,  both  sides agreed Korean vessels would begin catching pollack on Jan.  10 in order not to miss the season and prices would be set later.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEFT NEW LEADER PAVES THE WAY FOR TOLL ROADS;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: WILLIAM C. (WILD BILL) WOOLLETT JR. IS RIDING HERD OVER THE  FIRST EFFORT TO BRING MAJOR USER-FEE HIGHWAYS TO CALIFORNIA.  </P> <P> His friends call him Wild Bill. Some weekends he can be found roaming rustic  Bommer Canyon in Irvine, or sailing a 16-foot catamaran off the coast, or river  rafting in Colorado.  </P> <P> But at age 61, William C. Woollett Jr. says he has met his biggest challenge:  serving as executive director of Orange County's Transportation Corridor  Agencies, which plan to build a 70-mile, $2-billion network of three tollways  by mid-decade.  </P> <P> "I like this job because it involves something that's never been done before,"  Woollett said.  </P> <P> Indeed, Woollett presides over the first effort to bring major, publicly owned  user-fee highways to California.  </P> <P> Although Woollett may not be well known outside of Irvine, where he served for  17 years as the city's first city manager, he is one of Orange County's  highest-paid public officials, receiving $118,000 a year.  </P> <P> It's a pressure-filled job. John Meyer, Woollett's predecessor, quit last  summer, citing job burnout. Developers and politicians clamor to have the roads  built "yesterday"; environmentalists threaten to file lawsuits at every turn,  and engineers spend the agencies' money for design work faster than developer  fees can pay for it.  </P> <P> Woollett has been at the tollway post less than five months, but agency board  members, transportation officials and developers already give him high marks  for boosting morale and gaining control of what was an understaffed, unfocused  operation.  </P> <P> "I have been tremendously impressed by him," said San Juan Capistrano Mayor  Gary L. Hausdorfer, who chairs the Foothill-Eastern Transportation Corridor  Agency board. "He is a very quiet and competent leader. He's a good organizer.  He is a quick learner who very quickly grasps very complicated transportation  issues."  </P> <P> For instance, Hausdorfer said, Woollett hired a financial expert -- Wallace D.  Kreutzen -- as a deputy director to bring board members much better cost- and  cash-flow analyses than they had before. Also, Woollett has been giving board  members written, weekly updates on financial, environmental and construction  issues.  </P> <P> In addition, final design contracts have been signed for portions of the  tollways, with construction expected to begin later this year or in early 1991.  </P> <P> But Woollett still faces major hurdles, including:  </P> <P> Foothill-area opposition to federal legislation that would permit Orange  County's tollways to pass through parkland, and an almost-certain environmental  lawsuit aimed at blocking the planned San Joaquin Hills tollway bridge across  Laguna Canyon.  </P> <P> Continuing criticism from some public officials and developers who complain  that the San Joaquin Hills tollway project is already two years behind  schedule.  </P> <P> Pending final tollway financing plans, with tollway officials still negotiating  developer fees and offsetting credits for donated rights of way and grading.  </P> <P> Even Hausdorfer has acknowledged that tollway financing will be "very tight"  and critically dependent, perhaps, on projections that motorists will be  willing to pay tolls higher than the $2 to $3 maximums previously anticipated.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be easy," Hausdorfer said. "But I'm confident the roads will  be built."  </P> <P> Said Woollett: "I didn't come here to fail."  </P> <P> Seeking to head off potential financial problems, Woollett has discussed with  some officials the possibility of borrowing money from the state or other local  transportation agencies, who would be repaid when tolls are collected.  </P> <P> Tollway employees say Woollett is best at bringing people of opposing views  together and then quickly deciding what needs to be done.  </P> <P> But there are some people who remain unconvinced.  </P> <P> When the Tustin Hills Homeowners Assn. recently alleged that tollway officials  were white-washing projected tollway noise levels in their community, Woollett  promised to respond with the best scientific data available, even if it hurts  his cause.  </P> <P> Said Jeffrey Katz, president of the homeowners' group: "We'll see. He listens  to us, but it's clear that he knows who he works for. . . . He wants to get  the" tollways "done."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, developers such as the Mission Viejo Co., which had griped last year  that the tollways were taking too long to build, have been mostly quiet after a  series of private briefings begun by Woollett's predecessor.  </P> <P> During such sessions, Woollett has developed a reputation for saying exactly  what's on his mind, even to the influential Irvine Co., one of the agency's  staunchest defenders and a major donor of rights of way.  </P> <P> "I was attending a meeting with him and several others recently, when we got  into an argument and he turned to me and said simply, 'Hugh, you're full of  crap,' " said Irvine Co. transportation planner Hugh Fitzpatrick.  </P> <P> Still, critics point out that the tollway agency has spent about $54 million  since its inception in 1986, without any concrete poured. Much of the money,  though, has gone for environmental and route alignment studies, legal advice  and legislative lobbying in Sacramento, and costly design contracts.  </P> <P> And while Woollett is under pressure in some quarters to quickly appoint a  respected transportation engineering expert to an unfilled, second deputy's  position on his staff, he has bided his time, saying it's not easy to attract  the best people at a salary the agency can afford.  </P> <P> Woollett, the father of a son, 29, and a daughter, 27, reads historical novels  and admits to a certain fascination both with futurism and management  expertise.  </P> <P> No stranger to issues such as growth control and land-use planning, Woollett  once worked privately on the development of Hollister Ranch north of Santa  Barbara, which is not unlike the Irvine Ranch.  </P> <P> While he was Irvine's city manager, his office discovered an error by the  city's Community Development Department that had led to too many development  permits being issued for the tightly controlled Irvine Business Complex.  </P> <P> And although urban planners have criticized Irvine's reliance on mostly  pro-automobile, anti-pedestrian development, Woollett has a jaundiced view of  the car.  </P> <P> "During World War II, we were forced to look at alternatives," Woollett said.  "But now it just isn't as high a priority for us -- at least not yet.  </P> <P> "Front porches allowed people to see what was going on around them, to  communicate face to face with their neighbors and children playing in the  neighborhood. Now nobody builds them anymore. We've lost that source of  communication. Similarly, cars have cut us off from each other. We're wrapped  in steel, chrome and glass."  </P> <P> But in a county where some government officials drive Cadillacs, Mercedeses and  BMWs, Woollett wheels around town in a 1969 El Camino that was so much in need  of a face lift that his former Irvine co-workers sprang for a bright red,  $2,000 paint job.  </P> <P> "He's basically a cowboy at heart," said Paul Brady Jr., who succeeded Woollett  as Irvine's city manager. "The El Camino fits right in."  </P></p>

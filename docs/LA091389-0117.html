			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> $57.5-MILLION PARKS BOND ISSUE IN IRVINE ENDORSED BY COUNCIL  </P> <P> In an effort to expand the city's network of recreational facilities, the  Irvine City Council on Tuesday night endorsed a bond measure that would raise  $57.5 million to build and maintain more community parks.  </P> <P> If passed by voters on the March 6 city ballot, the bond issue would levy  annual taxes of $120 per household and begin in the 1990-1991 tax year.  </P> <P> Under the measure, about 100 acres of parkland would be purchased within five  years. The bond issue also would pay for the redevelopment and maintenance of  several existing parks.  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Agran hailed the plan as the most comprehensive parks bond measure  in county and state history.  </P> <P> "I think it will provide for current and future residents of Irvine a park  system that will have no rival in the entire state of California," Agran said.  "It will be a park system that will go well into the 21st Century. We don't  intend on going back year after year for additional funds."  </P> <P> The council also approved a last-minute change proposed by Councilman Cameron  Cosgrove that would lower the tax to be paid by residents of the city's  estimated 700 mobile homes. The council agreed to lower the annual tax to $60  for mobile-home residents and to make up the difference by raising slightly the  tax on commercial property.  </P> <P> "I think it's reflective of the unique nature of this issue," said Cosgrove,  who said many mobile-home dwellers live on fixed incomes. "It responds and is  responsive to the community. I think it is right in line."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan dissented, saying that mobile-home dwellers  aren't the only Irvine residents living on fixed incomes. "I think that would  be discriminatory. There are 15,000 seniors in Irvine, so I want to know what  we do with the rest."  </P> <P> Cosgrove predicted that Irvine voters next spring will provide the required  two-thirds vote needed for approval of the $57.5-million measure. "It is not a  small amount, but it is an investment in the future," he said. "I have  confidence this will go through in March."  </P> <P> In June, the council endorsed an initial "wish list" of parks programs. Among  those to be included were park improvements, additions and maintenance, bike  and running paths, a senior center, a fine arts center and a gymnasium.  </P> <P> Among the list of projects that may be built with the bond money:  </P> <P> * A 22-acre community park for the Village of Woodbridge, at a cost of $11.5  million.  </P> <P> * A 52-acre community park next to the Civic Center, costing $14.1 million.  </P> <P> * A $3.8-million expansion of Harvard Community Athletic Park.  </P> <P> * Redevelopment of a now-defunct 1.5-mile railroad path into bicycle and  running trails, for $2.5 million.  </P> <P> * Expansion of the Irvine Fine Arts Center, costing $1.5 million.  </P> <P> * Creation of an additional 8.5 miles of bicycle trails in the Village of  Northwood, for $1.8 million.  </P> <P> * Funding of a working, model farm, including the purchase of farm house and  development of a picnic area, costing $600,000.  </P> <P> * Support of the Irvine Theatre, now being built on the UC Irvine campus, for  $1.5 million.  </P> <P> * An additional gymnasium to be shared by Irvine High School and Harvard Park,  costing $1.25 million.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the council moved to raise money for the parks through what  is known as the Mello-Roos style of taxation, under which every homeowner would  pay the same amount regardless of his or her income or the size of his or her  home. Owners of rental properties would pay $120 for each home or apartment  unit.  </P> <P> Over the term of the 20-year bond, officials said the annual tax would probably  increase slightly. Commercial properties would also be hit with the tax, paying  10.15 cents per square foot each year. (The amount was increased Tuesday night  from 10.05 cents in reducing the tax for mobile-home residents.)  </P> <P> In all, city officials said, 45% of the new tax would come from residential  property owners, 50% from commercial property owners and 5% from owners of  undeveloped land.  </P> <P> "I think the Irvine voters know what is good for the community and will approve  of a tax raise," Agran said. "In regards to giving breaks to segments of the  community, we are trying to address the question of low-income residents  through other means. Cutting back on this ambitious program would place it in  jeopardy."  </P> <P> Sixteen years ago, the newly incorporated city approved a $16-million parks  bond measure in what turned out to be a blueprint for a community now known for  planning. Unlike its predecessor, the latest proposed bond issue would provide  money for maintenance and operation of the city's parks.  </P></p>

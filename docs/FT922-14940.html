			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Attali issues warning over CIS prospects THE industrial west must open up to exports from the former Soviet Union, and must commit substantial extra funds to reconstruction if upheavals are to be avoided which could escalate into civil wars across Europe, Mr Jacques Attali, head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, warned yesterday. He predicted at a conference in Paris on world trade and investment that the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) faced the prospect of 50m unemployed, a balance of payments deficit of Dollars 40bn (Pounds 23.1bn) in 1993, failure to fund national budgets, and a crumbling of the state system. Noting a 20 per cent plunge in exports from the CIS, and a 30 per cent fall in output over the past year, he warned: 'We have not touched the bottom of the recession. This is merely the first stage of a major decline in foreign trade, and a considerable worsening of their growth capacity. 'Eastern Europe has emerged towards civil war, dragging the whole of Europe towards civil war,' Mr Attali said. 'The dangers are huge.' In a speech that is likely to preview statements at the first annual meeting of the EBRD in Bucharest at the weekend, he called for a four-pronged effort to tackle the region's financial problems, of which the Group of Seven's pledges on Wednesday of Dollars 24bn in aid to Russia would form just a part: Funds for commercial investment, led by EBRD itself, with funds of Ecu10bn (Pounds 7.15bn) that can be expected to attract private sector investment of up to Ecu50bn. Funds for industrial training as industries are rebuilt. Balance of payments support. This amounted to Dollars 20bn in 1991 in Russia alone, he said. By 1993, it would amount to Dollars 40bn in the absence of funds to aid structural change. Long-term funding for restructuring the system. He foresaw the need for up to Ecu500bn to fund closure of factories across the CIS, and the building of new industries. Closure of 16 dangerous nuclear power stations, and the refurbishment of 45, would in itself cost Ecu10bn. Mr Attali attacked western countries for pressuring states in eastern Europe into radical reform while refusing to open markets to their exports. He called on the EC to move promptly to negotiate a 'contractual common market with 40 countries across Europe'.</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Accounting change leaves BR over Pounds 100m better off BRITISH RAIL is braced for a hostile reaction to an accounting move that will benefit its profit-and-loss account by more than Pounds 100m when it publishes its annual results tomorrow. Critics are likely to claim the figures have been massaged in an effort to stimulate private sector interest in railway privatisation, due to start next year. BR will defend itself by saying the move is a delayed response to a long-standing government directive requiring its accounts to conform with normal commercial practice. The move will boost operating profits by nearly Pounds 90m for InterCity, one of the most attractive parts of the railway to private-sector train operators. In the year to March 1992, InterCity originally reported a profit of just Pounds 2m. That is now understood to have been restated to show a profit of Pounds 91m. In the latest year, ending March 1993, InterCity was expected to have suffered heavily from recession. Now it is expected to be substantially in profit. Overall, BR has been left Pounds 120m better off by the move, reducing last year's pre-tax losses of Pounds 145m to a loss of just Pounds 25m. In the year just ended, the effect is expected to reduce losses of Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m to a loss of about Pounds 170m. BR says the change was ordered by the Department of Transport in December 1989 to give a more accurate picture of business performance, and has taken until now to introduce. The main effect is to alter the way BR accounts for infrastructure renewals such as track replacement or resignalling. Previously, these were counted as costs in the year in which they were incurred, and were charged to the profit-and-loss account. Under the new policy, infrastructure spending will be counted as capital investment and charged to the balance sheet. The only cost charged against the profit-and-loss account will be an annual one for depreciation calculated over the asset's lifetime. A further boost will come from a change in the treatment of grants for capital investment. Instead of being written off in the year in which they are received, they will be released to the profit-and-loss account over the lifetime of the investment, partly offsetting the depreciation charge. BR said InterCity was a particularly big beneficiary of the accounting change because it was the division that had invested most. BR pressed over rolling stock, Page 8</p>

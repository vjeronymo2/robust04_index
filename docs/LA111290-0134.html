			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BECKER STILL HAS A CHANCE AT EARNING NO. 1 RANKING WITH VICTORY AT THE ATP  </P> <P> Boris Becker set one goal for 1990: earn the No. 1 spot in the world tennis  rankings.  </P> <P> That goal still is attainable as the inaugural ATP Tour comes to a climax with  the season-ending World Championships that begin Tuesday.  </P> <P> Some of Becker's peers think he already is above the rest of the field.  </P> <P> "He is the best tennis player in the world," said Pete Sampras, the U.S. Open  champion.  </P> <P> Becker trails Sweden's Stefan Edberg by 225 points on the computer rankings of  the Assn. of Tennis Professionals.  </P> <P> If Becker wins the $2-million event and Edberg falters in the semifinals,  Becker will have achieved his goal: He will end the year as No. 1 in the world.  </P> <P> But Becker has a torn muscle in his left thigh that forced him to default in  the recent Paris Open final. He was still in Munich today, training with Nikki  Pilic, Germany's Davis Cup coach.  </P> <P> Richard Evans, an ATP spokesman, said Becker also was undergoing treatment.  Evans said Becker would not be scheduled to play until Wednesday, giving him  more time to recover.  </P> <P> Becker began the year by announcing that he was skipping the Davis Cup in order  to concentrate on capturing the No. 1 ranking. This was a blow to the German  team, which had won the Davis Cup title twice in a row with Becker's help. This  year, the Germans were eliminated early.  </P> <P> The computer ranking system could allow Becker to claim the No. 1 spot although  he failed to win any of the four Grand Slam tournaments.  </P> <P> The players are ranked according to the points earned in their best 14  tournaments of the year.  </P> <P> Although he might benefit from the system, Becker has said that Grand Slam  tournaments should carry more weight in determining the rankings.  </P> <P> Becker has won five titles this season, and reached the final in five others.  </P> <P> The ATP Championships features the world's top eight players. In addition to  Edberg and Becker, others competing are Sampras, who is ranked fifth; Ivan  Lendl, the former No. 1 who won the Australian Open and now is ranked third;  No. 4 Andre Agassi; No. 6 Andres Gomez of Ecuador, the French Open winner; No.  7 Thomas Muster of Austria, and No. 8 Emilio Sanchez of Spain. Goran Ivanisevic  of Yugoslavia is the first alternate should one of the eight be forced to  withdraw.  </P> <P> The players are split into two groups of four each. After round-robin matches,  the two top players from each group advance to the semifinals. The champion  will receive $600,000.  </P></p>

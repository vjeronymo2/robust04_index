			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Observer: Back to basics Funny how the big jobs in Swedish business are suddenly being handed out to grey unknowns. Volvo's Pehr Gyllenhammar has been replaced by ABB's Bert-Olof Svanholm and now Ericsson's Jan Stenberg has stepped into Jan Carlzon's old slot at Scandinavian Airlines Systems. A couple of less flamboyant figures would be hard to imagine. Stenberg, a low-key business executive, has spent his entire career at the telecommunications group and Svanholm has also been plucked from the heart of Swedish industry. But different times require different types. Carlzon was a super salesman who never got a proper grip on SAS's costs while Gyllenhammer's grand visions rarely seemed to pay off. The challenge now is to ensure that the two companies can survive long-term after the collapse of their ambitious merger plans. All the signs are that SAS will concentrate on its core airline and Volvo on cars and trucks. The new faces at the top of SAS and Volvo may be rather grey but the appointments are a belated recognition that both SAS and Volvo are finally going to have to swallow some of the unappetising medicine already downed by their counterparts elsewhere in Swedish industry.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Rebroadcast of Pale Serb Television news item; from the HTV </F> "Slikom Na Sliku" political magazine program]    [Excerpts] The army of so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina today  again launched a desperate attack from Trebesko Brdo, Mount  Bula, and the valleys of the Drina and Praca against the front  lines of the Serb army's 2 Drina Brigade near Ustipraca.    The attack with mortars, recoilless guns, and anti-aircraft  guns began early this morning. Then the artillery also joined  in. Well prepared for this sort of surprise, the Serb soldiers  responded with all available weapons. [passage omitted]    The enemy attack was halted and the green berets withdrew  deep into their territory. One Serb soldier was killed and two  were wounded.    General Ratko Mladic today visited the first combat lines of  the Serb army at the Gorazde front. He had lenghty talks with  the commanders and soldiers.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Shchebet: "Privatization Voucher in </F> Belarus Has Eight Degrees of Protection From the People"]    [Text] Privatization in Belarus has begun. Back in  1991. Citizens of the country, however, received their first  vouchers designated "Property" only in April of this year. This  was the peculiar feature of Belarusian privatization: First,  some state property--almost free, in the form of a lease--was  made available to some citizens of the country (as a rule,  employees of small enterprises who had the opportunity and  connections to formalize buy-sell papers); then, in 1994, the  Ministry of State Property [MSP] counted the remaining property  and is now distributing vouchers to everyone.    The value of a voucher is 25,000 Belarusian rubles [R].  According to the terms of the "Council of Ministers lease,"  Belarusian state property could be sold to foreigners and  persons without citizenship. Now the vouchers are issued only to  those who were living in Belarus at the time they became  citizens (November 1991).    There are no lines in savings banks where certificates on  the  quantity of vouchers are issued. People are in no hurry to take  the vouchers, because they do not know what to do with them. At  this point there are no investment funds in the country; the  first 30 enterprises will put their stock on the market only in  June. Property in Belarus is divided into republic and municipal  ownership. Well, in Minsk the list of municipal property (which  until now belonged to local bodies of authority) subject to  privatization includes only 400 entities. The choice is not  extensive: several public restrooms, as-yet-unprofitable shops,  stores on the outskirts. This is not much for the private sector  in the capital of an independent state, but quite enough to  serve as a cover for an illegal sellout of state property.  Nobody in Belarus would undertake today to count how many  prestigious entities have been sold "under the table": The  process of privatization has been stretched out too long, and  there has been confusion in processing and reprocessing of  documents, caused by legislative chaos. This works for those who  know how to turn on the green light giving the right of way to  structures implementing privatization: Supreme Soviet  commissions, the Council of Ministers, and the MSP. The best  state property bringing dividends has already been bought up. A  new scandal is in the making. The parliament commission on  economic reform proposes to make an amendment to the Law "On  Leasing" which will enable the state to take property back at  any time "in the interests of the state." If this "reform" is  implemented, bureaucrats will get a substantial windfall both  from those who will try to keep the lease and those who will  want to acquire new property.    My neighbor, pensioner Maria Nikitichna, does not plan to  take her vouchers at all. She has calculated that getting a chit  confirming her labor record (officially) will cost her R14,000;  the document on the status of her account in the Savings Bank as  of 1 January 1991 (which also is required in order to have  "Property" issued to you) will cost between R7,000 and R24,000;  add the 15-percent tax for processing the certificate on the  quantity of vouchers owned, and it will pretty much equal the  value of these same vouchers.    Privatization vouchers in Belarus are nominal. This makes  them different from the Russian ones. One can only use them  through a personal account in the Savings Bank, keeping only the  certificate of the quantity. There are rumors that this document  has eight degrees of protection, but an acquaintance of mine--a  specialist with the MSP--confessed to me that it is useless to  steal vouchers: There will be nowhere to invest them in small  quantities anyway. One can give vouchers as a gift or sell them.  The transfer procedure is simple: Vouchers are transferred from  one personal bank account to another.    The quantity of vouchers issued is predicated on labor  record  and age. Persons over 35 years of age will get 50 vouchers;  between 30 and 35--40; between 25 and 30--30, and between 16 and  25--20; and parents of youngsters will receive 10 vouchers. For  those who have died waiting for their vouchers, "Property" will  be issued to relatives--provided, of course, that the "dead  soul" was on the lists put together in August. One voucher is  issued for each year in the labor record. It has been calculated  that those who will be entitled to the greatest number of  vouchers are disabled veterans of the World War II (up to 30  extra vouchers) with up to 30 years' labor record.    The state has reserved R260 billion worth of property to be  sold for vouchers. There are 1,800 enterprises that will not be  privatized. Nobody has yet seen, however, the list of entities  that will be for sale.</p>

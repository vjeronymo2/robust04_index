			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Devonport plan to save jobs at Rosyth AN INGENIOUS proposal to save 1,000 jobs at the Rosyth dockyard in Scotland by developing an oil tanker refitting facility has been put forward by Devonport, its arch-rival for naval contracts. The two yards are competing fiercely for the contract to refit the navy's Trident nuclear submarines, which both regard as critical for their survival in the business of servicing a reduced fleet. The government promised earlier this month that both dockyards would be kept open, but the yard that does not acquire the nuclear order will inevitably see its future as less prosperous and less secure. Rosyth declared 550 workers redundant earlier this week. The latest move by Devonport, which took the Rosyth management by surprise, is seen as a practical, if cheeky, attempt to shift the argument in its favour. Detailed plans have been sent to the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry for assessment. The proposal suggests land at Rosyth originally reclaimed to build nuclear submarine refitting docks should be used instead to refit oil tankers. An independent analysis sponsored by DML, the private sector managers of the Devonport dockyard, shows a need to rebuild the cargo sections of around 140 vessels from 1995 to extend their seagoing life. The Braer oil tanker disaster off the Shetland coast has also increased pressure for all tankers to be fitted with double hulls. DML believes up to 25 ships a year could be refitted at Rosyth. Mr Mike Leece, managing director of DML, said: 'This is a classic example of making swords into ploughshares. It also has export potential and environmental advantages, and would provide the right work for the range of skills at the dockyard.' If taken up, the plan would allow Devonport to become more efficient by taking a bigger part of the naval refit work, rather than sharing it with Rosyth. Mr David Batty, director in charge of defence work at Rosyth, said: 'We have heard nothing about this . . . it is quite surprising that they (DML) have the energy to devote attention to this sort of thing when they are trying to provide value for money for the MoD down at Devonport.'</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 92: Tory defeat expected to topple Willis RENEWED pressure on Mr Norman Willis to retire early as general secretary of the Trades Union Congress is expected if Labour wins the election. Some senior TUC and trade union officials say privately that unless Mr Willis is replaced by Mr John Monks, the able deputy general-secretary, the TUC will be bypassed and the four or five biggest unions will deal directly with a Labour government. Mr Willis, having struggled for eight years as general secretary with a government hostile to the unions, will not go willingly. He has also just completed the first year of a four-year term as president of the European TUC. The TUC has the opportunity to restore some of its lost credibility in helping a Labour government to steer through a potentially ambitious programme of industrial relations changes. But as one TUC official said: 'The TUC has adapted much less well than many of the bigger unions to the culture changes of the past decade'. Industrial relations reforms will not be the top priority for a Labour government, especially one which has a small majority, and unions' expectations have not been raised high. But Labour party and union officials agree on what an ideal three-stage timetable might look like. The first stage would consist of symbolic gestures with few immediate practical consequences. These would include signing the Maastricht 'social chapter' and letting unions back into GCHQ, the government's secret communications centre. Immediate changes, not requiring primary legislation, could also be made to beef up employment protection. The two main pieces of primary legislation would be a recognition act and an act of positive rights for employees which would be named after Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman. The recognition act would allow unions incremental representational rights, depending on how many employees voted for such rights, culminating in full collective bargaining rights if more than 50 per cent of the workforce voted in favour. This act could be controversial, although it has the backing of Mr Jim Wallace, the Liberal Democrat employment spokesman, and might be pushed through early. The centrepiece of the Blair Act would be the establishment of works councils for employee consultation in all workplaces above a certain size. Labour has decided not to revive the idea put forward in the Bullock report of worker directors. But it is envisaged that the works council representatives, elected from the whole workforce and not from the unions, would have power of co-decision with employers in several areas including training, equal rights and work content. Much of the women's equality legislation, and equal rights for part-timers, to which Labour is committed, would be pushed through the European Community and the minimum wage would probably be the responsibility of Labour's Treasury team.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Labour sets out conditions for Maastricht vote LABOUR WARNED the govern-ment yesterday that it would back ratification of the Maastricht treaty only if Britain abandoned the waiver exempting it from provisions for a new social chapter of workplace rights. The move, intended to maximise the discomfiture of the government in the wake of the Danish referendum, came as Tory backbenchers met to plan a new broadly-based group to oppose any further progress on the Maastricht bill, now shelved until the autumn. Speaking at Commons' question time, Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, said the party would 'only support' a bill which included those parts of the treaty most of benefit to the British people 'and that specifically includes the social chapter'. His words were taken as giving notice that Labour would no longer abstain from voting but would instead side with Conservative opponents of the Maastricht agreement by voting against ratification of the treaty. The tactic puts further pressure on the government which is already coming under intense lobbying from its own backbenches to abandon the Maastricht agreement. Several rightwing members of the cabinet have also emerged as doggedly opposed to ratification of the treaty as it stands. While some may favour a dilution of the existing treaty terms, there is no prospect of the government dropping its opt-out from the treaty's social provisions. In reply to Mr Hattersley, Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons standing in for the prime minister, said it was now up to all 12 members states to look for ways forward following the Danish decision to oppose ratification. 'That is a sensible policy and for you to pretend there is some simple, neat and immediate answer is absurd,' he said. In Strasbourg, Mr John Smith, odds-on favourite for the Labour leadership, outlined the case for a general realignment of currencies within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. In a significant policy development for Labour, he argued that an upward alignment of the D-Mark against other currencies would trigger reductions in interest rates across the Community, reversing the 'deflationary bias currently operating in the ERM'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The police say a thorough investigation has produced  no evidence of an alleged plot between German neo-Nazis and  South Africa ultra right-wingers to assassinate President Nelson  Mandela during his inauguration in Pretoria last month.  According to a newspaper report the extremists had planned a  mortar attack on the Union Buildings from a nearby hill. The  police said they had followed all leads, including German  neo-Nazi activity in South Africa. German right-wingers have  been arrested after a gun battle with police near Pretoria, but  there has been no evidence of assassination plans.</p>

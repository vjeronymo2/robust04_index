			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report TIN came under heavy selling pressure on the London Metal Exchange. The market slumped to five-month lows at the close and further declines seem likely. Persistent liquidation, and merchant and Chinese selling meant there were very few buyers, dealers said. Available supplies are more than adequate to meet current depressed demand, and physical market premiums have contracted recently. Charts are weak and the next major objective is Dollars 5,800 a tonne for three-month metal. NICKEL was also in retreat, dropping to new 32-month lows. Dealers said lack of significant production cuts and plentiful supplies of Russian metal in Europe continued to weigh on the market. COPPER closed above earlier lows, but showed little inclination to rally, given sluggish fundamentals and expectations of further stock rises. ALUMINIUM edged away from earlier lows in late trading on some option-linked buying, although the market remained easier as consumers were unwilling to chase three-month metal up to Dollars 1,200 a tonne.

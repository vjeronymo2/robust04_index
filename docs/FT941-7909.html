			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Volga car sell-off reveals Dollars 30m abuse Russian authorities have been seriously embarrassed by the director of a car plant who used Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.5m) in tax credits earmarked for investment to build a controlling stake in the company. The government commission dealing with the case said Mr Boris Vedyaev, director of the GAZ plant which makes the Volga cars favoured by Russian officials and taxi-drivers, spent Rbs46.5bn, or half the tax credit he was given to produce a new type of truck, on buying privatisation vouchers. Mr Vedyaev made agreements with 15 proxy companies to buy shares at public auctions. Mr Vedyaev now controls, directly or indirectly, 30 per cent of GAZ, including the 5 per cent he was allowed to acquire as the plant's manager. The affair will test the authorities' ability to check abuses by directors in the government's mass privatisation programme, as well as pinpointing widespread waste of state funds designed to promote economic recovery. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister who tried to impose financial discipline on officials bound to special interests, cited the GAZ case as an example of how 'industrial lobbies extract subsidies, benefits, deferrals but spend the money god knows how'. At stake too is the prestige of Mr Boris Nemtsov, progressive governor of the Nizhny-Novgorod region, regarded as a laboratory for reforms, who has vowed to have the director removed. 'All the directors in the region will eat him alive if Vedyaev is allowed to get away with this,' said one of Mr Nemtsov's colleagues. However, Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister attached to the commission investigating the case, said he believed Russia's antiquated legislation contained no criminal penalty for the violations committed by the GAZ director. The government's only recourse was to have him sacked at a shareholders' meeting. But in the month before such a meeting could be convened, said Mr Alexashenko, the GAZ director could strip the company of assets. The state still controls a majority of voting shares, which account for 35 per cent of the company's capital. The liberal Nevazisimya newspaper said the case was being watched as a 'precedent by all thieving directors who survive on state funds'.</p>

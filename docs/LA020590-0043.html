			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECTER OF DEATH HAUNTS A ONCE-LIVELY PARK;  </P> <P> AZERBAIJAN: 'GRAVEYARD OF MARTYRS' ECHOES TO THE STIFLED SOBS AND THE SHUFFLING  FEET OF THOUSANDS OF MOURNERS.  </P> <P> Kirov Park here in the capital of Azerbaijan used to be a happy place, a  combination amusement park and hilltop lookout point with the city's best view  of the Caspian seaside below. It was full of music and young people, laughing  and courting.  </P> <P> Now it is a place of death.  </P> <P> The carnival rides were under wraps Sunday, the trees festooned with mourning  banners. Instead of laughter, there were stifled sobs, the funeral wail of a  mullah, the sounds of thousands of shuffling feet.  </P> <P> Ironically, death has brought far more visitors to the park than recreation  ever did -- several hundred thousand daily, according to a commission that has  supervised the site ever since it was transformed two weeks ago into the  "graveyard of martyrs."  </P> <P> Eighty-seven people have been buried in the park so far, all in a long row  punctuated at the end by a hand-lettered sign stuck into a pile of building  stones.  </P> <P> "This is the result of the Russian imperialist genocide against the Azerbaijani  people," the sign reads in Azeri, the Azerbaijani language.  </P> <P> The dead are all victims of the gunfire of army and Interior Ministry troops  that began Jan. 20 when troops broke out of their blockaded barracks to impose  a state of emergency on an aroused population that believed itself to be immune  from being shot down in its own streets.  </P> <P> "Even now, people who died in hospital from wounds received then are being  brought here," said Nariman Aliev, an architect and member of the 11-man  funeral commission that has helped turn this hilltop into a powerful symbol of  national resistance.  </P> <P> Authorities say the repressive action was necessary to restore order after  three days of bloody anti-Armenian pogroms in the city. They blame the  bloodshed on armed "extremists" intent on an anti-Communist coup d'etat.  </P> <P> But most Azerbaijanis seem to be convinced that this was just an excuse. What  Moscow really wants is to strangle their nascent Popular Front movement before  it humiliates the party with genuine democratic elections, they say.  </P> <P> Either way, the scene at Kirov Park suggests that a threshold has been crossed  and that there can never be a return to the days when the Communist leadership  in the Kremlin held unquestioned sway over this island of Islam in the Soviet  Transcaucasus.  </P> <P> "I too stood before the tanks," a weeping Dr. Solmas Orudjeva, 50, shouted to a  reporter Sunday. "Am I an extremist?" the woman, a physician, asked  sarcastically.  </P> <P> "Now, those who remained alive are called extremists. But our only guilt is  that we stayed alive when the tanks came in. Vandals!" she raged against the  Soviet troops. "Fascists!"  </P> <P> There was more sullenness than shouting at the park Sunday, however. By early  afternoon, the line to file past the graves extended the length of the park and  into a square opposite.  </P> <P> "You can't enter without flowers," a dark-haired Azerbaijani advised as he  steered a newcomer toward a stand where other men were handing out bundles of  red carnations free of charge. "Carry them like this," the guide said, placing  the flowers, their petals directed downward, in the visitor's hand.  </P> <P> Carnations placed side by side on the ground extended the entire quarter-mile  length of the park, and in that portion of the park where the victims are  buried, they were piled in such numbers that they formed a thick floral fence  for about 200 yards.  </P> <P> Mourners filed past a black booth from which a Muslim cleric chanted prayers  over a loudspeaker system. Azerbaijanis are considered perhaps the most secular  of all of the Soviet Union's millions of Muslims, but many Islamic traditions  survive.  </P> <P> There was a photograph at the head of the grave of almost every victim. A young  couple pictured on their wedding day, a teen-age girl in her graduating best, a  small boy, a policeman.  </P> <P> "Of course, the victims of that day are far more numerous -- maybe by 10 times  -- than the number of graves here," said the funeral commission's Aliev, now a  former Communist. He and several other members of the commission quit the party  in protest, accusing it of ultimate responsibility for what happened here.  </P> <P> Some of the victims were buried elsewhere in family plots, but Aliev and nearly  everyone else here swears that hundreds of other bodies were destroyed, taken  secretly away or simply dumped into the sea to conceal the real death toll.  </P> <P> Baku is under martial law, and the deputy military commander, Maj. Gen. Anatoly  Kirilyuk, said in an interview Sunday that 138 people died as a result of last  month's battle in the city, 106 of them civilians and the rest soldiers,  internal security troops and policemen.  </P> <P> "Our visitors include many nationalities -- Jews, Russians, Tatars," Aliev  noted. "It is not just Azerbaijanis, although of course they predominate."  </P> <P> Do any Armenians come?  </P> <P> The architect smiled in surprise at the question before answering: "Nyet."  </P></p>

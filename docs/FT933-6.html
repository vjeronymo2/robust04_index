			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (41): Soviet collapse leaves a gap - Cash constraints are hurting the armed forces THESE are lean times for India's armed forces. In the current climate of government belt-tightening, defence spending has declined in real terms while the cost of procuring new equipment has risen following the collapse of the Soviet Union, formerly India's biggest source of defence equipment. India desperately wants to upgrade and modernise its defence force. However, the combination of less spending money and the loss of its most important supplier will force India to concentrate on indigenous production of equipment wherever possible over the next few years. Whatever India cannot develop itself in terms of technology and know-how, it will have to import from abroad or obtain by forging joint-venture and co-operation agreements with foreign partners. With its armed forces of about 1.3m, India has one of the world's largest volunteer corps to defend against various external and internal security threats. Its chief concern is the threat posed by Pakistan: the two countries have been at war three times since 1947 and Pakistan, like India, has been developing nuclear capabilities as well as conventional arms. Meanwhile, relations with China, which defeated India in a brief war in 1962, have improved steadily since the late 1980s. China is no longer seen as a hostile neighbour, so India has been able to reduce its troops along that border. India has various internal security problems, of which the most important is Kashmir. Increasingly, the army is being called upon to help control domestic unrest such as the religious riots and disturbances that occurred after Hindu militants destroyed the Ayodhya mosque - primarily because the police, with a reputation for corruption and inefficiency, have proved unable to tackle these problems successfully themselves. However, much to the annoyance of the hawks in India's armed forces, the government has curbed defence spending as part of a wider effort to control public expenditure. The defence budget has continued to rise in nominal terms each year but, in real terms defence spending has actually declined over the last five years. Added to which, defence spending as a percentage of India's GDP has seen a rapid fall in recent years: it peaked at 4.06 per cent of GDP in 1987-88, and fell to 2.75 per cent of GDP in 1992-93. Mr Jasjit Singh, director of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in New Delhi, predicts that defence spending will represent just 2.44 per cent of GDP in 1993-94. 'India has enough money to run its defence forces, but not to modernise it,' says Mr Singh. Defence experts claim India is already cutting back on the support side and limiting training exercises in order to save money and preserve its diminishing stock of spare parts. As for new defence projects, the future looks bleak, even though the airforce needs to upgrade a lot of its equipment. 'There's not much money around so you won't see much investment in new defence projects,' warns Mr K. Subrahmanyam, a defence writer and analyst. 'No one is going to put out the welcome mat for arms sellers.' The only substantial defence order to emerge from India in the near future is likely to be for new advanced jet trainers (AJTs), which are a high priority for the air force. The government is reported to have earmarked about Dollars 1.1bn for the acquisition of 80 AJTs and has shortlisted the Hawk trainer, made by British Aerospace, and the Alpha Jet, its Franco-German rival. 'The final decision on the AJT will be based on many factors including money, and how we can develop the Indian defence industry - in other words, whether there would be production in India,' warns Mr Singh. As for its other defence needs, India already has several projects under way, although there is some concern over whether these will reach fruition given the present financial constraints. Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), the state-owned defence group, is developing India's Advanced Light Helicopter and hopes to launch production next year. HAL is also working on the development of a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), and says the first prototype will fly in mid-1996. The army has already started testing the locally-produced Arjun battle tank, though problems were reported in the press about its ability to operate in difficult desert conditions where the high temperatures affect its performance. India also has a major missile programme. This includes the 'Prithvi', a medium range, surface-to-surface missile which was successfully test-fired earlier this year, and the 'Agni' medium range ballistic missile technology demonstrator, which is not as far advanced in its development as Prithvi. In addition, India is developing surface-to-air missiles and a new generation of anti-tank missiles. 'India has a huge indigenous capability, but it needs to acknowledge that some countries are further ahead in certain fields. Instead of continuing to re-invent the wheel, India should try to buy what it needs to push its defence projects forward,' says a defence expert, who argues that it might have made more sense for India to buy foreign tanks rather than waste years developing its own. The problem for India, however, is that it can no longer obtain foreign equipment at the bargain basement prices it paid in the past. Its key supplier of defence equipment was the Soviet Union, and India benefited from rouble-rupee trade, soft credits and long-term repayment schedules. 'Some 75-80 per cent of Indian defence equipment is of Soviet origin, and 95 per cent of that was manufactured in India,' says Mr Singh. However, after the break-up of the Soviet Union, India found the newly-independent states wanted payment in hard currency instead. On top of that it has proved difficult to obtain spares from the individual suppliers which are based in various former Soviet republics. Consequently, defence experts point out that where India cannot afford to buy the latest equipment, it may find it more beneficial to establish joint ventures or close co-operation agreements with Western manufacturers in order to obtain the necessary technology and systems while providing any foreign partner with a cheap production base for potential exports in the Asian region. 'Over the next three or four years, India is unlikely to buy much from foreign companies unless they actually set up production here,' says Mr Subrahmanyam. HAL already has joint venture and co-operation agreements with foreign partners. Mr Singh believes that India would benefit by establishing joint collaboration in components and sub-systems, ranging from wiring, switches, connectors, and sonar systems. But while in theory such a route may be attractive for both sides, in practice such ventures could take a while to get off the ground. 'Don't forget, with such a joint venture, outside companies would have to deal with the government, and that's not easy because of the bureaucracy,' says a defence expert.</p>

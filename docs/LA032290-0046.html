			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PETITION ON CONDO STANDARDS IS FILED  </P> <P> A group of Lawndale residents this week filed a petition that seeks to place on  the ballot the less-strict condominium standards passed last month by the City  Council.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the group said the petition contained 1,081 signatures, or 140  more than the 941 needed to let voters decide whether to affirm the condominium  standards.  </P> <P> An official with the county registrar of voters said it will take no more than  30 days to verify the signatures. There are 9,405 registered voters in  Lawndale.  </P> <P> The standards, adopted by the council Feb. 15 on a 3-2 vote, would permit  condominiums on lots previously zoned only for apartments or single-family  homes. The standards eliminate the 10,000-square-foot minimum lot requirement  for condominiums. They have been replaced with requirements for setbacks, open  space and parking that are somewhat stricter than those for apartments.  </P> <P> Assistant City Atty. Robert Owen said the new condominium standards  automatically were suspended Monday when the petition was accepted at City  Hall. If county officials do not verify at least 975 signatures, the standards  would be reinstated.  </P> <P> If there are sufficient signatures, the council would have to revoke the  standards or place them before the voters. That could not come before the  November balloting, unless the council sets a special election.  </P></p>

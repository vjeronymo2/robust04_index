			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Arts: Ann-Christine Goransson - Purcell Room This 25-year-old Swedish 'soprano' won the 1991 BP Peter Pears Award, and her recital on Tuesday made it perfectly clear why. She wields her voice with entrancing ease and naturalness; it is warm, true, unaffected and communicative, an unalloyed pleasure to hear. Obviously she has a promising future, but precisely which remains to be discovered. This small-hall recital hinted continually at a broader scale which she was careful not to unleash. It might well be opera - or even musical comedy: her generous personality could be hugely successful in the latter. Since she had changed her announced programme, replacing Wolf and Mahler with Schumann's 'Mignon' songs after Goethe and lighter stuff by Poulenc, Walton, Grieg and Ture Rangstrom, we could only guess at her full dramatic range. It was noticeable that in the higher soprano register she touched her notes in at a sweet, precise mezza voce, whereas her ample mid-voice revelled in expansive character. To me she sounded like a distinctive mezzo-in-the-making, with the bonus of a fine upper extension. In Mozart's aria 'Al desio' (K. 577, composed as a substitute for Susanna's 'Deh vieni' in Figaro) neither she nor her bright young accompanist Mikael Kjellgren was quite convincing: Kjellgren was inadvertently strident - victim to the Purcell Room acoustic, which wrong-foots many a new pianist - and Miss Goransson too modern-colloquial for this poised rondo. She was appealing in her Schumann set, but preferred to capture the general moods (very well) instead of lighting them up word-by-word as they deserve. Barber's wry, shapely Hermit Songs struck much nearer to the bone. Though Miss Goransson's English may still be a tad foreign, she palpably thinks in it, whereas she left Schumann's Goethe lyrics over-smooth and under-articulated. Her Poulenc and Duparc carried richer conviction, as did her partner's contribution. For Walton's three Sitwell numbers (the latter two adapted from Facade) she found exactly the right teasing, playful address, even without the benefit of native diction, and in her Scandinavian songs she was buoyantly at home. By then nobody could have doubted that hers is a voice to fill much larger halls, as surely it will do: heartwarmingly candid and direct, faithfully musical. One day soon somebody will find Miss Goransson a slot where she can expand to her best, and she will make a lot more music-lovers very happy.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTCLAIR PREP STAR DEREK SPARKS LEAVES SCHOOL, RETURNING TO TEXAS  </P> <P> Running back Derek Sparks, considered one of the Southland's top high school  football players, left Montclair Prep High School in Van Nuys Wednesday and  will return to his native Texas, according to Jerome Sparks, his uncle and  legal guardian.  </P> <P> The departure ended a stormy relationship between the CIF Southern Section  private school and Jerome Sparks.  </P> <P> The move was triggered last week when George Giannini, Montclair Prep football  coach, told Leland Sparks, Derek's cousin and teammate, that the Southern  Section denied his request for a fifth year of eligibility.  </P> <P> Leland Sparks and two other players who were denied an extra year of  eligibility each repeated a year for academic reasons while attending Montclair  Prep.  </P> <P> Leland Sparks also will return to Texas.  </P> <P> Neither player attended school this week, and Derek did not practice with the  team, which lost its opener to Farrington of Hawaii, 28-7, last Thursday night  in Honolulu.  </P> <P> Derek, 6 feet 1 and 208 pounds, transferred from Wharton High in southeast  Texas to Wilmington Banning in 1988 and was named sophomore state player of the  year by Cal-Hi Sports. He enrolled at Montclair Prep for the spring semester in  1989 and was named The Times' Valley back of the year after he rushed for 1,944  yards for the Mounties last fall.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry to see them go and sorry to see the boys go through this," Giannini  said, "but I told Jerome that if this is causing that many family problems,  they should go to another school."

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: HSBC's good deal The Federal Reserve's decision to tighten monetary policy three weeks ago raised two worries about HSBC Holdings. First, it was a reminder that its customers in Hong Kong would not enjoy indefinitely such a benign combination of low real interest rates and rapid economic growth. Indeed the risk is that the Hong Kong authorities may be forced to raise interest rates just as the regional economic cycle turns down. Second, the bond market weakness unleashed by the Fed's action must have caused anxious moments for a bank with a Pounds 26bn portfolio of debt securities and which has become used to making large profits from playing the yield curve. Yesterday's annual results suggest the latter may remain the bigger worry. Provisions against lending in Hong Kong fell last year to a meagre Pounds 81m from Pounds 126m. They would certainly rise if the economy turned. But it would take a fierce reversal of the interest rate trend for large-scale loan losses to occur. If the rise in rates remains modest, as still seems possible, the bank could even benefit. It would earn more on its interest-free liabilities. By contrast, securities markets look unlikely to maintain the buoyancy which HSBC needs to sustain its dealing profits. At Pounds 1.1bn these are nearly a third of group operating profit. Some Pounds 700m comes from securities dealing rather than foreign exchange. That is more than the entire increase in operating profit which HSBC would have reported had Midland been a subsidiary for the whole of 1992. It is no surprise that HSBC shares have started to under-perform the sector, especially since the Pounds 160m aviation leasing provision shows it is still not immune from accident.</p>

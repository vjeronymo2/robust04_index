			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Observer: Never knowingly Dash, there goes another clever marketing gimmick. Sir Bryan Carsberg, Office of Fair Trading supremo, has just ticked off Connell Residential, Scottish Widows's chain of estate agents in southern England, for erecting 'SOLD' signs outside houses which had not been sold and indeed were not for sale. Sir Bryan said that he was concerned that the boards might mislead consumers. That seems to be one of the OFT's understatements of the year.</p>

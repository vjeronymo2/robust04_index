			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Spain to reap benefits of strict budget Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's economy minister, will today tell his cabinet colleagues that this year's public deficit is on target at 6.7 per cent of GDP. This is not what the Madrid government, accustomed to budget overruns, normally hears from its economic team, and it augurs well for market perceptions of Mr Solbes' priorities as he puts the finishing touches to his second budget. Promoted from the agriculture ministry after last year's general election, Mr Solbes inherited a 7.3 per cent deficit, an overshoot double that planned by his predecessor, Mr Carlos Solchaga. Already he can claim two achievements: he has restored the credibility of domestic finances and, in a low growth year, he has succeeded in reducing the deficit. Determined that this year's hard-won credibility will remain in place, Mr Solbes intends to reduce the deficit to 5.9 per cent of GDP in his 1995 budget and to 3.4 per cent in 1996. But analysts say he has taken only a first step towards righting the structural imbalances which lie at the root of domestic deficits. Mindful of such pressures, Mr Solbes has responded quickly to an August price rebound and to an accompanying promise by the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, that Spain's 7m pensioners will be fully compensated for a year-end inflation that will now be above the forecast figure of 3.5 per cent. In a last-minute revision of his budget, Mr Solbes has cut the government's 1995 spending by 1 per cent. The government will use the savings to fund a pensions bill that is expected to rise by Pta150bn (Pounds 742m) because of the inflation increase. The minority Catalan nationalist coalition, CiU, which was last night meeting Mr Solbes' team, is expected to ensure the budget's safe passage through parliament. Politically centre right, CiU backed Mr Solbes' first budget last year after the general election left the ruling Socialist party short of a parliamentary majority. As before, Catalan support has been obtained at a price. The government has agreed to regional demands, spearheaded by the Catalans, that they share in the distribution of the EU's cohesion funds. It has also promised to increase funding for regional health services. Reflecting the interests of CiU's middle class electorate, the 1995 budget will reduce the social security contributions made by employers and make up for the lost revenue with a 1 per cent increase in value added tax. With a forecast growth in GDP of 2.8 per cent next year - the economy grew by 1.6 per cent in the first half of this year - the chief market criticism is that Mr Solbes should use such expansion to cut back the structural deficit more severely. 'A 5.9 per cent deficit next year is way too high and nothing to be proud about,' said Mr Jaime de Pinies, a senior economist at the Banco Santander group. Mr Solbes' department argues that several initiatives next year will meet such criticisms. These include the liberalisation of telecommunications, an overhaul of restrictive legislation on land use and reform of a state pension scheme. The problem is that such regulatory changes, together with deficit control, could run foul of the left wing of the ruling party which favours a dash for growth led by the public sector. Mr Solbes, however, needs to give quick signals on liberalisation. His budgets are necessarily market sensitive because the stock of government debt, as a result of the ballooning deficits he inherited, is forecast to rise from 55.8 per cent of GDP last year to more than 65 per cent in 1996.</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PITINO UNDECIDED ABOUT LEAVING KNICKS FOR KY.  </P> <P> Rick Pitino told reporters today that he is not committed to leaving the New  York Knicks to take the head coaching job at Kentucky.  </P> <P> "I'm not leaning to take this job," he said. "You've got a lot of problems  here, and I've got very few problems in New York."  </P> <P> Kentucky was slapped by the NCAA last Friday with a three-year probation,  including two seasons without postseason play and one without live television  coverage.  </P> <P> "You have a dilemma here at Kentucky, a big dilemma," he said in a news  conference in Wildcat Lodge. "This program is about as rich in tradition as  there is in all college basketball. You've been brought to your knees with a  tremendous scandal and then sanctions came about.  </P> <P> "But you now have C. M. Newton as your athletic director and you have a  president (David P. Roselle) with a tremendous amount of integrity."  </P> <P> Pitino said he hopes to find a position where he can provide a long-lasting and  stable environment for his family.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Hong Kong Newspaper Carries False </F> Report on Deng Xiaoping; Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman  Makes Clarification"]    [Text] Beijing, 23 Jun (TA KUNG PAO) -- Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said that the front-page news in  today's Hong Kong WEN WEI PO about Deng Xiaoping's recent visit  to Shandong in the company of Central Military Commission Vice  Chairman Liu Huaqing was not true. There was no such a thing.    At today's foreign ministry press briefing a Taiwan  reporter,  who was the first to raise a question, asked Wu Jianmin to  confirm the aforementioned news. Instead of evading, Wu Jianmin  replied straightforwardly: "This question should not have been  answered by the Foreign Ministry but, since you have raised it,  I would like to tell you that the news is untrue, it is not  correct. There is no such a thing."    Following that, a Hong Kong reporter made a further inquiry:  "Where, then, is Deng now?" Wu Jianmin replied with laughter:  "Mr. Deng is wherever he is."    When it was time for the last question, a REUTER reporter  asked: If the news is incorrect, why did WEN WEI PO front-page  it?    Wu Jianmin replied: I am the spokesman for the foreign  ministry and not for WEN WEI PO. You had better ask WEN WEI PO  that question.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 28 (BTA) -- Parliament passed the  1994 national budget bill after five-day debates. The MP's  voted for 100,167 million leva in revenues, 133,836.6 million  leva in expenditures, and a deficit amounting to 33,699.6  million leva. Revenues are up some 30 million leva,  expenditures nearly 35 million leva and the deficit 6 million  leva from last year. To pass the budget by the end of February,  the MP's worked through the week-end and held a 12-hour  extraordinary sitting today.    They voted to raise the revenue figure to 100,167 million  leva, up 280 million leva from the cabinet-sponsored one. The  margin will be covered by revenues from special extrabudgetary  accounts.    The expenditure figure has been raised to 133,836.6 million  leva, up 300 million leva from the first reading. More money  will be allocated to research institutions, the Bulgarian State  Railways (the national railway carrier), to extrabudgetary  funds, etc., yet most figures were not changed. A total of  18,859.1 million leva have been voted for defence and security.  Some 6,350 million leva have been budgeted to subsidize  money-losing producers, the import of coal for domestic users,  etc.    The legislators voted for a social security budget of  58,151.7 million leva, including 52,804 million leva from social  security tax and a government transfer of 5,347.4 million leva.  The increase from last year amounts to some 20 million leva.    Government departments get 42,411.9 million leva.  Parliament, the President's Office and the cabinet will take  cuts of 35 million leva, 5 million leva and 15 million leva from  the original draft figures. 40 million leva of that money will  be reoriented to health, 10 million leva to the Unions of War  Veterans and the Blind, and 5 million leva to the Agency for  Bulgarians Abroad. The Defence Ministry budget is set at 11,600  million leva, the Interior Ministry budget at 5,600 million leva  and the National Intelligence Service budget at 131.6 million.  A total of 3,900 million leva is allocated for the needs of  health care and another 7,500 million for education.    The subsidies to be extended to the municipalities amount to  18,243,596,000 leva.    The report on the utilization of the 1992 national budget,  which figured in the bill, was not put to the vote after the  MP's backed Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's proposal to exclude it  from the debates.    "This is the most constricted budget for the past four years  and it will have a lot of adverse effects," Parliamentary Budget  Committee Chairman Ventsislav Dimitrov said on the behalf of the  Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS) parliamentary group. He  stressed the disparity between the SDS stand on the state  financial policy and the views of the parliamentary majority on  this matter. According to MP's of the SDS, the unfeasible  macro-economic framework is most likely to fail the budget  within mid-1994. The SDS cannot assume the political  responsibility for the budget, Mr. Dimitrov also said.    Speaking on the behalf of his parliamentary group, Mr.  Nikolay Koychev MP of the Bulgarian Socialist Party hailed the  passage of the 1994 national budget in the last day of February.  Last year it (the budget) was passed in June, Mr. Koychev  recalled. According to the BSP parliamentary group, this is the  only budget this country could have.    The MP's of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) and  the New Union for Democracy (NSD), too, backed most of the texts  in the 1994 national budget bill. The NSD, however, denounced  the procedure on the passage of the budget and said it should  come only after a wholesale national policy on the economic  reforms has been considered.    "I hope that the Cabinet will disprove the pessimistic  predictions about the 1994 budget," Finance Minister Stoyan  Aleksandrov said after the passage of the 1994 budget bill.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM, KRIM-TASS correspondent Viktor Kovalenko] </F>   [Text] Kiev, 7 May--A session of the national coordination  council for the fight against drug addiction under the Cabinet  of Ministers of Ukraine was held on 6 May, chaired by Deputy  Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov. It discussed the problems of  fighting illegal drug trafficking in Ukraine.    The acutely urgent issue of controlling illegal production,  transportation, sale, and use of narcotic substances in Ukraine,  as well as problems relating to providing the relevant bodies  fighting this type of crime with the necessary equipment and  financing, were discussed with representatives from the  Ministries of Health, Finances, Internal Affairs, Environmental  Protection, Education, and other state institutions.    It was pointed out at the session, inter alia, that a  shortage of funds allocated to the law enforcement bodies is  weakening their actions to seize consignments of narcotics and  arrest the persons carrying them. It was decided to submit for  the consideration of the Cabinet of Ministers a proposal to  allocate, in a separate paragraph in Ukraine's state budget,  funds to fight the spread of narcotics and drug addiction.    Those taking part in the session agreed on the necessity to  start developing, in conjunction with the Academy of Science of  Ukraine and the relevant government departments, Ukrainian-built  equipment to detect narcotic substances during customs  inspections, and also anesthetizing medical preparations that do  not induce narcotic dependence.</p>

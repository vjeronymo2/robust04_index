			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Arts: She Stoops to Conquer - Theatre Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer entered the first division of English comedy when it was originally performed in 1773 and has stayed there ever since. In its new outing, directed by Sir Peter Hall at The Queen's, it is playing at the very top, along with the best productions you can remember of (say) The Importance of Being Earnest or A Midsummer Night's Dream. The subtitle is The Mistakes of a Night which must have been picked up from Shakespeare, and Wilde plainly learned from it. The play's strengths are its dialogue, its characters, and to some extent even its plot: in short, everything that you could ask for. Scarcely a word is wasted and it is remarkable how many of its lines remain colloquial to this day: 'This is Liberty Hall', for example. Goldsmith also had a wonderful way with names: not only Tony Lumpkin, the young bumpkin of a squire, but also Diggory, the man taken in from the barn to serve in the house. In Hall's production there are at least three characters who are outstandingly drawn. Joint top are quite exceptional performances by Tom Beard as Marlowe and Emily Morgan as Kate Hardcastle. Marlowe is the well-bred man who has a way with women provided they come from beneath the stairs, but lapses into a Feydeau-like stammer when confronted by a girl of his own class. Beard plays him as if he is the star of the show, which perhaps he is. Even Beard, however, would not be so good without Ms Morgan beside him. Her Kate is the reverse of Marlowe; she can't win him as her real self, so pretends to be the maid. Scenes of mistaken identity are frequent, hilarious, and exquisitely timed. It may seem odd to concentrate on that pair when Donald Sinden is also in the cast, yet he seems happy enough to take a slightly secondary role in such company. As Hardcastle, the genial father of Kate, he has a little trouble with his wig; in the second act it fell off. But it is a pleasure to hear his plummy voice again and to watch his magnificent stage presence. 'I love everything that's old,' he says, 'old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wine.' And, in this performance, that's the way it is. There is a special delight towards the end when the late entrant, Sir Charles Marlowe, is played by Donald's brother, Leon. Watch them looking out from behind the screen together. Every theatrical device is there. Queen's Theatre, (071) 494 5040</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / When beans mean less profitability: Maggie Urry reports that the food manufacturing sector is worried by squeezed margins in staple products Since the first signs that times were getting tougher for companies reliant on consumer spending, the food manufacturing sector has appeared immune. Even in recessions people have to eat, the argument ran. But now the defensive qualities of the sector are being questioned as, day after day, news of downgraded profit forecasts have been hitting shares of leading companies in the sector. Hillsdown, United Biscuits, Northern Foods, Ranks Hovis McDougall, and many others have seen their shares drop after brokers have become gloomier in their projections. With many companies reporting interim results over the next few weeks, the market is in for a run of bad news. There are even fears of dividend cuts for some of the high-yielding shares in the sector. Consumers have shown that they do not have to eat - at least not in the same quantities, at the same prices and at the same quality. Falling volumes and prices have cut manufacturers margins. As one food industry chief says: 'The customer is looking for a cheaper product and if you don't make it someone else will.' Sales volumes of baked beans - one of the most basic of products - have fallen by around 5 per cent, according to industry estimates. The price of Heinz beans, the market leader, has been cut from 29p to 25p a tin. The cost to Heinz is rumoured to be staggering. But when the leader cuts its price to that degree, the price of other brands and own-label tins have to be reduced as well. And, one industry chairman reveals, there are some cheap baked beans being imported from Italy selling for 19p a tin. The baked bean story illustrates many facets of the industry's problems: falling volumes, falling prices, increasing competition, more imports. The head of another food company says that consumers used to buy four or five tins of beans at once, putting them in the cupboard and using them when convenient. But now consumers are destocking. Food sales volumes have been weakening, and since June, have been decidedly poor. The same chairman says that consumers are also trading down to cheaper products which may not taste as good, so stocks at home last longer. 'It may sound ridiculous, but it's quite important.' With volumes sluggish, the supermarkets are putting even more pressure than usual on manufacturers to cut prices, adding to factors such as a glut of fresh produce, to bring food deflation. Manufacturers suffering volume falls cannot be baled out by rising prices. There is also a problem of overcapacity in many parts of the industry. The good times of the 1980s, when food manufacturers were increasing their margins, steadily led to new entrants and more investment. Mr David Lang, food manufacturing analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, says 'the problems in the industry are where there is a competitive imbalance'. Where there is fragmentation among the suppliers up against the powerful retailers or where there is too big a price gap between own-label and branded goods, the result is 'mayhem', Mr Lang says. Overcapacity in the milling and baking sector has been a matter of concern for some years, but with no sign of anyone cutting capacity the difficulties look set to continue. Although there are two large players  - RHM and Associated British Foods - independents have come into the industry and most superstores now have their own bakeries. In sugar, by contrast, ABF, which now owns British Sugar, and Tate &amp; Lyle have the market almost to themselves and there is a competitive balance between the manufacturers and the retailers. Imports are also a worry. Mr John Major, the prime minister, addressed a meeting of food manufacturers last autumn exhorting them to reverse the worsening balance of payments trend in food. 'Now everyone is doing worse,' says one manufacturer who was there. Chickens are one example. Severe overcapacity in the UK is being tackled, mainly since Hillsdown bought Unigate's poultry business early this year. But now retailers are increasingly importing chickens from France. Feathers - and accusations - are flying. Imported chickens may not have been raised under the stringent health regulations imposed in the UK after the salmonella scare. These health regulations have increased the price of British chickens, allowing imported chickens to undercut them. Some British producers are even relocating in France to counter the problem. Added to the difficulties at home, many food groups are also suffering in their international activities. United Biscuits, for example, makes nearly half of its sales outside the UK. Its Keebler biscuit business in the US is suffering from similar market conditions as in the UK, while the dollar exchange rate is making the situation look even worse when translated to sterling. In addition, Grand Metropolitan's trading statement yesterday made reference to a softening of continental European markets. It is hard to see an end to the gloom until the consumer is ready to spend more freely again. Industry heads are looking for the usual Christmas boost, but it will be November or even December before that shows in sales, too late to give chairmen reporting results in September an excuse to be optimistic.</p>

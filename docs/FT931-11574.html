			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: UK export effort in danger Sir, Trade Indemnity's paper on the reinsurance of export credits ('Warning over lack of cover for exporters', January 26) highlights a major concern. Recent publicity about the portfolio management system and the problems of obtaining medium-term support from the government has overshadowed a potentially far more serious problem for the majority of UK exporters. We estimate that if political risk capacity cannot be found either from the government or the private sector Pounds 4bn of UK exports could be left unprotected. Most UK companies could not take these risks themselves and would have to withdraw from the markets involved. This would be a disaster. We therefore hope the government will take these proposals for a partnership with the private reinsurance market seriously and give all assurance to UK exporters that they will continue to top up NCM Credit Insurance's existing reinsurance arrangements as long as this is necessary.

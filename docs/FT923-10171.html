			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Compulsory metering of water backed by minister for first time PROPOSALS for compulsory metering of household water won vigorous support yesterday from Mr Michael Howard, secretary of state for the environment - the first time a minister has given formal backing to such a move. He noted the cost of installing household meters in England and Wales, estimated at up to Pounds 3bn, 'would ultimately have to be borne by the consumer' but said that this 'would be spread over many years'. Metering would probably lead to lower water bills than at present for small households, while large households would see their bills rise, according to the Department of the Environment's consultation paper on the efficient use of water, published yesterday. Mr Howard added that the impact of metering 'on poor families clearly needs attention'. The DoE paper attracted sharp criticism from Mr Chris Smith, opposition spokesman for environmental protection. He said that under pilot schemes in areas such as Blackburn, 'metering has nearly doubled water bills for large families with children'. The DoE paper sees an urgent need - particularly after four dry winters in the south east - to curb growth in demand for water which is running at about 1 per cent a year. The report says households in England and Wales, accounting for 54 per cent of water use, are key to reducing demand. It says trials show household metering leads to a 13 per cent fall in water use overall and a 20 per cent cut at peak times. Very few houses have meters - most water bills still being calculated on the rateable value of each house. However, water companies have been told to find other ways of charging their customers by the end of the century. Water companies have the power to insist on fitting meters, but have done so on only a small number of new buildings. The DoE suggests that Ofwat, the regulatory authority, should be given powers to approve water companies' choice of charging method. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, welcomed that suggestion, adding: 'I am pleased to see that the paper supports the case for metering.' The report says measures to reduce demand should include a close look at possible water recycling by industrial companies, which use a quarter of the country's water. A further quarter of the country's water is lost through leakage between the water mains and the customer, according to the DoE, which wants water companies to investigate the cost of finding and plugging these leaks. Water companies are committed to spending Pounds 28bn by the end of the decade on improving the quality and volume of water supplies.</p>

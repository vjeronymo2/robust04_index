			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Delayed documentation puts UAL deal in doubt The future of the Dollars 5bn employee-led buy-out of UAL was in put in doubt yesterday after the US airline announced it had been unable to reach a definitive agreement with its employee unions. When UAL and the pilots and machinists unions first agreed to the buy-out last December, a deadline of March 15 was set for completion of the documentation. Pilots and ground crew unions, but not the flight attendants union, had agreed to wage, benefit and work-rule concessions in return for a 53 per cent stake in the company. Yesterday, UAL revealed that the deadline had not been met, and said that there could be no assurance that the transaction would be completed. In the documents, which must be sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission, UAL has to provide details of the transaction and a plan for how it intends to run the airline after the buy-out. Neither UAL nor the unions would comment on the delay, although yesterday afternoon a representative of the pilots union said its leader was still in talks with Mr Stephen Wolf, the airline's chairman, and an official from the ground crew union. The confirmation that the three sides were still talking helped reassure investors, who earlier had been concerned about a possible collapse of the buy-out. UAL's shares, which had fallen Dollars 2 in early trading, recovered during an afternoon rally in transportation stocks to end up Dollars 2 3/8 , at Dollars 131 3/8 . Although the failure of management and unions to complete the documentation could yet scuttle the billion-dollar buy-out, analysts doubt that the delay will kill the plan. Mr Michael Derchin, airlines analyst at NatWest Securities in New York, speculated that the delay was caused by UAL's failure to put together a new management team in time for the documentation deadline. He said: 'You can't go out with proxy material on this kind of a transaction without stating who's going to run the company.' But Mr Derchin believed a new management team would soon be appointed.

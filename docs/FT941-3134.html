			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Independent Insurance at Pounds 15.9m A turnround in underwriting results in the UK pulled Independent Insurance, the small general insurance company floated on the stock market last year, firmly back into the black in 1993. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 3.72m) including realised gains of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 3.7m). Underwriting profits of Pounds 2m compared with losses of Pounds 7m in 1992. Further losses on stop loss policies underwritten for Lloyd's Names in 1989 and 1990 amounted to Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 8.5m) and held back what would have been even stronger profit growth. Overall gross written premiums increased by 52 per cent to Pounds 215.7m (Pounds 141.8m). Investment income increased to Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 7m). Its share of profits of associated undertakings was Pounds 16,000, against losses of Pounds 19,000. Earnings per share improved to 35.2p (10.9p) and, as forecast, a final dividend of 4.75p is proposed, making a total of 8.25p (7p), an increase of 18 per cent. COMMENT The markets responded positively to yesterday's result, marking the shares up 5p to 295p. Independent's focused underwriting approach means it is well placed to continue profit growth this year, despite indications of a return of some rate competition in the UK market. The group's premiums from personal motor - where price pressure will be strongest - amounts to only about 17 per cent of its total premium income. Moreover, Independent has begun to specialise in non-standard risks such as 'classic' cars, which should be less affected by competition. Its emphasis on risk control and surveying allows it to record better results on commercial business than the market average and it appears that the worst of the Lloyd's stop loss problems, which have dampened profitability in the last two years, are over. 1994 profits of about Pounds 20m (before capital gains) look well within reach, putting the shares on an attractive multiple going forward of about 9. Investors should bear in mind, however, that the shares are now trading at a premium to net asset value of more than 40 per cent while the historic yield of 3.5 is at a substantial discount to the rest of the sector.</p>

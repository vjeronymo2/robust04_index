			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Frolov article ``Lateral Move: Generals Come and </F> Go, Chemical Weapons Remain'']    [Text] General Anatoliy Kuntsevich, chairman of the  Committee for Convention-Related Problems of Chemical and  Bacteriological Weapons, has suffered a defeat. His dismissal  by an edict of the president of the Russian Federation was  arranged according to the new Russian traditions: The press  knew about it before Kuntsevich's co-workers did. The  formulation was also mysterious: ``for a single gross violation  of his labor responsibilities.'' Isn't the president giving us  to understand that Mr. Kuntsevich all but unleashed chemical  war? One way or another, the general, who at first ran the  military-chemical complex but then took upon himself the  responsibility for its destruction, turned out to be unsuitable.    Apparently, it is considered that the incident is thus  closd.  Vil Mirzayanov, who let the city and the world know about the  existence of Russian binary weapons, can now relax: Lefortovo  [prison] no longer threatens him. The moral victory of the  ``military-chemical dissident'' is plain to see. As for whether  the problem itself has been solved--that is still unclear: 40  thousand tonnes of chemical weapons [CW]--which is just what has  been officially declared--as before have nowhere to go outside  Russia, and must all the same be destroyed. Besides which, no  fundamental decisions have been made about the use of more or  less safe technologies for destruction of CW in Russia. One can  hardly expect that just a few personnel shifts will help.</p>

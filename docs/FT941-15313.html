			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: UK funds catch the marketmakers by surprise - Market Report The UK fund managers took hold of the London stock market yesterday and, with the US sellers content to back away, share prices bounced ahead strongly. The FT-SE 100 Share Index gained 40.6 to close at 3,400.6, while the FT-SE Mid 250 Index put on 33.6 for a new closing peak of 3,915.7. Although several reasons were advanced for the sudden recovery in share prices as the two week trading account closed, traders admitted that 'it caught us all on the hop'. Trading volume was very heavy, both in stock index futures and equities. The strong gains in Far Eastern markets overnight, a slight easing in sterling, and favourable comments on interest rate prospects from the president of the Bundesbank, all helped UK equities. With trading houses still struggling to find stock in spite of the market downturn earlier in the week, prices were squeezed higher when the buyers appeared. Wall Street, having given ground overnight, started the new session in good form, adding 22 Dow points as London closed down for the day. The clinching factor for marketmakers was the sudden withdrawal of the US sellers who had been very active in stock index futures on Thursday. This left the market open to the UK institutions, which have become wary lest overseas buyers repeat the spree that drove London to record levels in the first few sessions of this month. US pension funds, increasing their holdings of non-US stocks, played a important role in driving the UK market ahead at the end of last year, and shares have been hit hard this week by US profit-taking. The presence of the domestic institutions put the spotlight on some of the smaller UK stocks that tend to be overlooked by the overseas funds. Activity in these smaller stocks lifted the non-Footsie share of the day's business to around 66 per cent. Total Seaq business just topped the 1bn share mark, compared with 899m on Thursday when retail value was again high at Pounds 1.94bn. After its substantial recovery yesterday, the FT-SE Index showed a fall of only 17.8 points over the two-week equity account. But the index has lost 45.4 points this week as the record performances in the new year have been challenged by US selling of the London market. The strength of equities contrasted with British government bonds, which tumbled sharply yesterday as the sector braced itself for the auction of gilts that the Bank of England said yesterday would be held on January 26 and would comprise conventional gilts maturing from 2008 to 2012. Short dated gilts shed  5/32 yesterday as base rate hopes remained on the back burner, while longer dates fell by up to half a point. Index-linked, however, edged forward. The recovery in share prices yesterday reflected the generally very favourable tone of investment comment on the London market from both domestic and international securities houses. Nervousness has focused around perceptions that base rate cuts might be withheld and also that equity valuations are too high. But BZW, the London based investment bank, commented that 'the key evidence (of a market peak) is still missing'. It believes that debt and unemployment levels in the UK are still too high to allow any significant tightening of monetary policy in the absence of clear inflationary pressures.</p>

The Islamic Group has launched more  than nine bomb attacks against Egyptian and foreign banks.    In a statement issued today, it warned people who frequent  banks of similar attacks. The statement added that yesterday's  explosion in front of a building housing the Misr-America  International Bank had come in revenge for the execution of two  [Army] officers on Thursday on charges of attempting to  assassinate Egyptian President Husni Mubarak during a visit to  the Sidi Barrani base at the Egyptian-Libyan border in November.</p>

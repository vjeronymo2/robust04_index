			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India may export wheat INDIA MAY resume wheat exports this year following a rich harvest of 180.3m tonnes of foodgrains last year, leading to a record procurement of wheat and rice by government agencies, and the excellent progress so far of this year's south-west monsoon Last year the country imported 3m tonnes of wheat from the US, Canada and Australia for distribution through ration shops. While the food ministry is campaigning for the resumption of wheat exports, the federal government wants to watch the situation for a little longer before taking a decision. In the meantime, India will be exporting wheat products like flour. There is no doubt, however, that India will be making attempts to step up exports of basmati, a fine long grain variety of rice, and of non-basmati rice. The minimum export price for basmati rice is Dollars 555 a tonne and for non-basmati Dollars 275 a tonne. India's rice production is expected to go up to 78m tonnes in 1993-94 from 71.9m tonnes last year, creating adequate surplus for export. According to one estimate, Indian rice exports can rise to Rs15bn this year from about Rs10bn last year. A boost will also be given to the export of pulses, the minimum price for which is Dollars 400 a tonne.</p>

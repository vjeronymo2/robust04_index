			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" program] </F>   [Text] The 116th Izmail Riverine Brigade of the Black Sea  Fleet is one of the formations, which, in keeping with the  decree of Vitaliy Radestskyy, Ukrainian minister of defense, is  to be reshaped and replaced under the command of that country's  Navy.    Reacting to that step, the Ukrainian military commanders,  the  officers in the brigade, resolutely disagree with any unilateral  actions aimed at changing the status of the formation. In a  statement adopted at a general meeting, the officers and warrant  officers demanded that a political decision should be adopted as  soon as possible on the future of the Black Sea Fleet, on the  basis of which the fate of each of them could be determined. At  the same time they warned that, until such a decision is  adopted, they will stop any attempts to unlawfully seize the  ships or other facilities belonging to the brigade.</p>

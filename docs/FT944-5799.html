			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (12): The fear of a failure is daunting - Financing a bid / Peter Carty looks at the cost of professional fees Fear of the consequences of a failed bid might discourage many managements from trying to buy their company. If the buy-out goes ahead Newco - the new company formed by a deal - pays all the professional fees. But what if there is no Newco? In this event, losing homes or life savings to fund the professional fees run up in an abortive bid is unlikely. Although no two buy-outs are the same, most bids can be examined in a couple of stages: before and after the exclusivity deal in which management becomes the preferred bidder. 'Exclusivities are still very much the norm,' says 3i director Gordon Maclean. Management's first task is to find a corporate finance adviser, usually a corporate finance boutique, accountants or, rarely, a merchant bank. The adviser is likely to ask the vendor to underwrite management's initial professional fees in the event of the bid not progressing. Vendors often agree to this. A buy-out bid is a useful benchmark against which to assess other bids, since the management has an inside track on what the business is worth. Otherwise, most or all of the preliminary advisory work is likely to be carried out on a contingency basis. Advisers readily admit that they take a gamble when agreeing to act for managements. 'For every three serious approaches, only one is backed,' estimates Chris Beresford, KPMG Peat Marwick's buy-out head. Advisers are well aware that while companies can afford substantial fees, managers normally cannot. The exception is where a bid is driven by a wealthy entrepreneur. Having said this, advisers may retain the option of recovering some fees in the event of an unsuccessful bid. A typical sum is Pounds 10,000. 'We might want a commitment of that sort,' says Mr Beresford. He rarely invoices management even if a bid fails There are two sets of circumstances in which it does happen: where managements benefit from negotiating a trade sale, perhaps by getting a percentage of the consideration; and where managements pull out without a satisfactory reason. Partly because collection after abortive deals is at the adviser's discretion, attitudes vary. Some boutiques and smaller firms of accountants appear to take a harder line, but again the issue is normally only whether they collect a nominal commitment rather than whether they bankrupt the management team. Others side-step the collection issue. First Independent Corporate Finance asks for a consideration in advance: 'A few hundred or thousand up front,' according to managing director John Beattie. Managements may not use an independent corporate finance adviser at all. They frequently go direct to a venture capitalist or, in the era of the IBO (institutional buy-out), institutions approach them. According to research by Coopers &amp; Lybrand on completed MBOs for the year to September 30, managements were not reported as having received independent financial advice in more than half of the deals surveyed. In such cases all the professional advice management receives is likely to be arranged through the equity provider, normally on a contingent basis. The professional fees meter only starts really running after the exclusivity hurdle is cleared and management becomes the preferred bidder. At this point an outline deal with a completion date is normally agreed. Most of the due diligence and legal work is then carried out. Sometimes it is done in-house by venture capitalists. If not, particularly for larger deals, firms of lawyers and accountants are used. Marketing consultants are likely to be brought in to report on the business's prospects and other advisers assess the bid's pensions implications. Environmental impact reports are also increasingly required. If the bid falls after clearing the exclusivity hurdle, the management team is still unlikely to be liable for any of these fees. The venture capitalist or vendor is most likely to be billed. 'If you walk away you pay, if the vendor walks away then it pays,' says 3i's Gordon Maclean. Many of the professionals and institutions involved are accustomed to receiving lower fees for abortive bids. 'The management team in my experience are rarely on the hook for anything,' he says. However, in exceptional cases, as well as a small sum to the corporate finance advisers the management team may also have to compensate the solicitors. 'As lawyers we ask for a commitment,'' says Mark Vickers, a partner in city solicitors Alsop Wilkinson. But he stresses that this is not onerous. 'You have to be realistic.' He says that most of the time his firm does not collect from managements on abortive deals. If they do, the sums are typically no more than Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 4,000 per manager. Any potential liability for corporate finance or legal fees will be set out in terms of engagement. But many management teams should be able to negotiate away any downside liability, even for initial advisory fees. Key factors to dangle in front of institutions and advisers are the size of the deal and its likelihood of success, and the calibre and commitment of the management. Often it is a foregone conclusion. 'They offered before I asked,'' says Bob Littledale. He mounted a buy-out for his company, Oxford-based CSE Aviation Ltd, in 1990. The company went to a trade buyer instead. Mr Littledale incurred no liabilities and subsequently participated in a successful bimbo (a buy-in/buy-out). 'I've failed twice in a buy-out,' admits Stewart Swinden, managing director of Energy Facilities Management Ltd, based near Manchester. Both bids foundered through no fault of the management teams and Mr Swinden did not pay any fees. He was then backed by 3i in a successful buy-in bid for his present company in 1989. Mr Swinden advises other managers to request that all fees are on a contingency basis: 'Don't be afraid to ask.' So, managements are most unlikely to lose their shirts over a failed bid. Of course, it is different if the bid succeeds but Newco later founders. Then family homes really can be lost.  ---------------------------------------------------- LEADING ACCOUNTANTS  ---------------------------------------------------- 1 January 1990 - 30 September 1994                        Number of Deals  ---------------------------------------------------- KPMG Peat Marwick                  95 Coopers &amp; Lybrand                  85 Price Waterhouse                   70 Touche Ross                        40 Ernst &amp; Young                      38 Arthur Andersen                    35 Others                             52 None/Not Known/(Duplication)     (146)  ---------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                             269  ---------------------------------------------------- Qualification: acted in Pounds 10 million plus deals Source: KPMG Corporate Finance, October 1, 1994  ----------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LEADING SOLICITORS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 January 1990 - 30 September 1994                        Number of Deals  Number of Deals  Total Number                             Acting For       Acting for      of Deals                     Equity/Debt Leader          Manager  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Clifford Chance                     52                9            61 Ashurst Morris Crisp                32                6            38 3i Legal                            36                0            36 Lovell White Durrant                28                5            33 Allen &amp; Overy                       25                5            30 Macfarlanes                         24                5            29 Alsop Wilkinson                     17               10            27 Wilde Sapte                         24                2            26 Dickson Minto                       17                6            23 S J Berwin                          10               11            21 Eversheds                            4               14            18 Dibb Lupton Broomhead                9                8            17 Cameron Markby Hewitt                7                5            12 Edge &amp; Ellinson                      6                6            12 Turner Kenneth Brown                 8                4            12 Wragge &amp; Co                          5                7            12 Herbert Smith                        9                1            10 Osborne Clark                        4                6            10 Addleshaw                            4                5             9 Hammond Suddards                     7                2             9 Nabarro Nathanson                    8                1             9 McKenna                              3                5             8 Pinsent                              3                5             8 Booth &amp; Co                           6                1             7 Halliwell Landau                     2                5             7 Norton Rose                          6                1             7 Maclay Murray Spens                  2                4             6 Richards Butler                      5                1             6 Simmons &amp; Simmons                    4                2             6 Simpson Curtis                       1                5             6 Travers Smith Braithwaite            5                1             6 McGrigor Donald                      3                2             5 Slaughter &amp; May                      1                4             5 Bird Semple                          3                1             4 Freshfields                          4                0             4 Titmuss Sainer &amp; Webb                0                4             4 Other                               52              100           152 None/Not Known/(Duplication)      (167)              10          (157)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                              269              269           538  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Qualification: Pounds 10 million plus deals, acted in four or more Source: KPMG Corporate Finance, October 1, 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

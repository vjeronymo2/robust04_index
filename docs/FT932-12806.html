			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Damage insurer assesses itself BOTTLES OF Evian water, briefcases, jackets and nine worried executives were cluttering up the office of Mr Guy Belcher, managing director of Richard Sparrow, a London firm of reinsurance brokers yesterday. Mr Belcher himself was sitting outside with his secretaries and other colleagues as the directors of Macey Williams, a Lloyd's insurance broker that had been bombed out, scoured the City for somewhere to do their business for the next six months. Among other parts of the business, Macey Williams provides insurance cover for bomb damage to property companies. This time it found itself on the receiving end. It is based in St Helen's Place close to the heart of Saturday's City bomb blast. Mr Roger Macey, the managing director, began drawing up emergency plans on Saturday evening but it wasn't until yesterday that someone managed to inspect the damage. He said the company had been offered one office at Pounds 75 per sq ft which he said was 'far too high'. Other rentals were close to Pounds 20 per sq ft not far from the Pounds 18 which the company had been paying. Directors came in and out throughout the afternoon to report on possibilities. One site seemed ideal at 3,000 sq ft but had no telephone points. 'We'll keep trying until we find somewhere, but we will,' said Mr Macey. Mr Belcher said: 'If they don't get anywhere then they'll have my office again tomorrow. That's how the Lloyd's community helps each other.' Other executives were visiting the bombed premises, getting past police barriers by wearing white hard hats and using side entrances. The company, Mr Macey said, needed to get its files, fax machines and other equipment out but he did not know at that stage whether a removal lorry would be granted access. He said the company had been unable to write much business but had still managed to take two orders. 'We shall need our Macey Williams paper slips to go to Lloyd's so that will mean another sortie tomorrow,' he said.</p>

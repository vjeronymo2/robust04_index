			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Arts: This Shakespeare travels well - Andrew St George enjoys the Oxford Stage Company's 'Pericles' and 'Comedy of Errors' The Oxford Stage Company is now on the middle leg of an improbable tour which began in Surrey and arrives in Oxford via Gdansk en route to Osaka and Tokyo before concluding at Harlow in December. The two improbable plays, Pericles and The Comedy of Errors suit themselves well to travel, since each stretches geography as well as credibility. But this makes fine, honest, travelling Shakespeare, well performed and meticulously directed. Shakespeare wrote Pericles (1607-8) with a little help from his friends, the novelists George Wilkins and Laurence Twine. Dr Johnson ignored it, and Ben Jonson called it 'a mouldy tale' albeit in one of his own freshest plays. The play looks like a dry run, or rather a wet run given the engulfing sea images, for The Tempest or The Winter's Tale. As Pericles sails the eastern Mediterranean, the play becomes another Odyssey, full of shipwrecks, chance encounters, fatal meetings and warm reunions. John Retallack directs with great tact and intelligence. He has sensibly cut the text. He draws out the play's mysteriousness and recognises Shakespeare's debt to music as an agency for the supernatural. It comes over as magic realism theatre, compered by the ghostly figure of John Gower (played by Leader Hawkins), called up to arrange the action and introduce each scene. However, the set detracts from the illusion created by the words. It runs round three sides of the stage, the bottom half a covered walkway backed by ropes hanging like drying fettucini, but the top half unused and redundant. The lighting (Raymond Cross) is so apt and sensitive that the set becomes superfluous, the more so because it never contributes dramatically and because a narrator is on hand to massage the imagination. The overall effect, however, is beguiling. The sea storms are excellent, with two sets of parallel poles representing the wave crests, bearing up and spewing out the swimmers, and the music (Karl James) an unobtrusive delight. But the costumes could be better: the women in Pentapolis look to be wearing curtains suspended from their elbows and wrists. Most of the cast negotiate Shakespeare's difficult late verse. The scene in which Pericles recognises his lost daughter Marina forms a wonderful, tender moment, as she sings the old king out of madness and back into the world. This gathers Lear and Leontes in an instant: 'Oh you gods. Your present kindness makes my past miseries sports.' As Pericles, Philip Bowen ages gracefully and mirrors the challenges he meets, whether in the assertive Cleon (Colin Mace) at Tharsus, or the elegant Simonides (Del Henney), father of Pericles' wife Thaisa (Ginny Holder). Pericles finishes his journey at Ephesus, where The Comedy of Errors, the second touring production, begins. Shakespeare wrote it 400 years ago to outfarce the farceurs and fashion a comedy based not on one but two sets of identical and identically named twins. It is another improbable romp, a day out in Ephesus amongst a 'rabble of vile confederates', and it is immensely enjoyable. The production opens somberly, the cast circling in plain, dark costumes. It begins a beautiful unravelling of this tangled farce. Just as an actor playing a drunk must do everything possible to strive for sobriety, so good farce should tether itself to seriousness. Like many pleasures, farce involves anticipation and delay; the end of the play should be the end of satisfaction, as it is here. Retallack develops an intelligent approach which has outgrown the motley and red-nose school of slapstick Errors. Each individual makes the best of what is available, and treats every instance of mistaken identity not as a mistake but as the world as it is. The serious approach also allows the characters to step into soliloquy, as Antipholus of Syracuse, newly arrived in Ephesus to find his twin brother, muses on his state: 'I to the world am like a drop of water / That in the ocean seeks another drop.' The aside which Dromio indulges on the charms of the cook also fits into place as a piece of whimsy in a serious situation: 'She's the kitchen wench and all grease . . . if she lives till doomsday, she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.' The fine judgment falters in only one dreadful scene, where a quack comes to cure Antipholus of Ephesus and wastes the scene by camping around with bells and whistles. A few illegible doctor's notes would have been much funnier. Again, the set seems incidental to the action; the costumes here are fine enough and the acting strong enough to sustain something more minimal and risky. The acting fizzes and bubbles. The two Antipholuses (Grant Parsons and Philip Bowen are uniformly alike each other, even to the extent of beating their twin servants, the two Dromios Anthony Howes and Clive Duncan). This bemused quartet is battered around the stage by Adriana, the termagant wife to Antipholus of Ephesus, played with gattling-gun speed by Susan Colverd. She sends insults, blows or pleasantries with equal vigour and is well supported by the other women, Luciana her willowy sister (Catherine Prendergast, whose mantilla resembles an extended vegetable steamer) and the local courtesan slinkily played by Ginny Holder. The productions tour to: Arundel (Aug 31-Sept 4), Bury St Edmunds (Sept 13-18), Bracknell (Sept 20-15), Crawley (Sept 29-Oct 2); Osaka (Oct 6-11), Tokyo (Oct 13-17), Stirling (Oct 26-30), Taunton (Nov 2-6), Watford (Nov 9-13), Swindon (Nov 16-20), Winchester (Nov23-27), and Harlow (Nov 3-Dec 4)</p>

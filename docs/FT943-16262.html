			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big copper deficit estimated Copper's recent price rise followed a substantial deficit in supply during the first quarter of this year. Nickel and tin supplies were also outpaced by demand in the quarter, according to the UK-based World Bureau of Metal Statistics. However, the aluminium market continued to be plagued by a supply surplus, as did the lead and zinc markets. In its latest quarterly review, the WBMS said a big increase in demand for copper plus a fall in western production and net imports from the former eastern bloc countries, helped copper to a first-quarter supply deficit of 264,000 tonnes. The bureau estimated that copper demand rose by 7.5 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same months of 1993 to 2.42m tonnes. Meanwhile, refined copper production slipped by 3.3 per cent to 2.15m tonnes and net eastern bloc imports dropped from 43,000 to 12,000 tonnes. Nickel producers helped themselves by cutting production substantially in the early months of this year because of the low prices at that time. Refined nickel output dropped by 10 per cent to 124,000 tonnes in the first quarter. There was also a sharp fall in net eastern bloc imports, down from 20,000 to 8,000 tonnes. A near-2 per cent rise in consumption, from 162,000 to 165,000 tonnes left the market with a supply deficit increased from 4,000 to 33,000 tonnes. Tin's deficit slipped slightly in the quarter, from 9,000 to 8,000 tonnes reflecting a 3 per cent rise in output to 34,000 tonnes and static consumption at 42,000 tonnes. Consumption of aluminium in the quarter was shown 5.7 per cent ahead at 3.8m tonnes, while production eased by more than 2 per cent to 3.66m tonnes. The aluminium market was still left with a surplus of 157,000 tonnes, but that was down from 457,000 tonnes in the same quater last year. The WBMS estimated that net eastern bloc aluminium imports in the quarter were still high by past standards, but they slipped from 318,000 to 302,000 tonnes. Zinc's supply surplus in the quarter also fell back - from 79,000 to 59,000 tonnes. Slab zinc output was down by 0.8 per cent, from 1.38m to 1.37m tonnes, net eastern bloc imports were down from 47,000 to 29,000 tonnes while consumption was down by 0.7 per cent at 1.34m tonnes. The surplus of lead supplies in the quarter increased from 79,000 to 89,000 tonnes, boosted by in net eastern bloc imports - nil in the first quarter of 1993 - to 9,000 tonnes. Lead's prospects were helped by producer cuts at the mines. According to the WBMS western world refined lead output and consumption both edged up by 0.6 per cent, to 1.15m tonnes and 1.068m tonnes respectively.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------         Western World Supply and Consumption (thousand tonnes)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                   1994        1993                  1994         1993              Jan-March   Jan-March             Jan-March    Jan-March  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium                             Nickel Supply           3,962       4,056    Supply         132          158 Consumption      3,805       3,599    Consumption    165          162 Copper                                Tin Supply           2,158       2,262    Supply          34           33 Consumption      2,422       2,253    Consumption     42           42 Lead                                  Zinc Supply           1,157       1,141    Supply       1,401        1,430 Consumption      1,068       1,062    Consumption  1,342        1,351  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bureau of Metal Statistics.

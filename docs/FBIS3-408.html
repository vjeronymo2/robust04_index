			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N Patterton] </F>   [Text] Pretoria March 7 SAPA--Neither the police nor  Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] spokesman Stephen  Maninger could confirm reports on Monday [7 March] of a plot to  assassinate AVF Chairman Gen Constand Viljoen.    The threat reportedly emanates from the right-wing's  militant  factions which oppose AVF leaders' initiatives to participate in  the elections and to continue negotiations for a "volkstaat"  [homeland].    A report in a morning newspaper, THE CITIZEN, said AVF  transitional president Ferdi Hartzenberg was shocked by news of  the plot, and that hitherto slack security for Gen Viljoen would  be improved.    The AVF's transitional representative assembly on Saturday  took a majority decision to reject an option to participate in  the elections, secured by Gen Viljoen when he registered a  Freedom Front party for such purposes. AVF Gen Tienie  Groenewald said on Monday the debate on possible participation  would continue as long as it was possible to keep alive Gen  Viljoen's provisional registration of the party.    Pointing to the considerable "no" vote in the elections,  observers said the right wing could count on enough electoral  support to secure a number of parliamentary seats.    Serving Conservative Party MPs and liberal AVF elements may  argue that those seats should be filled by AVF members -- even  as a "tactical breakaway" grouping from the AVF -- rather than  to let them fall to the National Party or Democratic Party.    In Mmabatho on Monday, President Lucas Mangope's cabinet  will  decide whether to participate in the April elections.    Speaking on Radio 702 on Monday, the Freedom Alliance  Chairman and Bophuthatswana Minister of State Rowan Cronje  declined to be drawn on the outcome of the cabinet meeting, or  on what effect labour unrest in Bophuthatswana had had on the  homeland government's thinking.</p>

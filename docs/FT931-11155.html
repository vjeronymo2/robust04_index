			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Leaders tackle US campaign spending spree DEMOCRATIC congressional leaders met President Bill Clinton at the White House yesterday to discuss how to reform the financing of US political campaigns. Spending limits for congressional campaigns, curbs on contributions from political action committees (PACs) representing lobbyists, and greater disclosure requirements for lobbyists were all expected to be on the agenda. The issue stirs fierce popular emotions among US voters convinced that most of their elected representatives are in the pockets of lobbying groups that contribute to their campaigns, but a solution will not be easy to achieve. Leaders in the House of Representatives have revived a reform bill, vetoed last year by President George Bush, which would have imposed voluntary spending limits on candidates in exchange for partial government funding. The bill would also have limited 'soft money' donations through political parties, but done little to curb the influence of PACs, which many reformers see as the root of the problem. Most Republicans object in principal both to spending limits and to public financing of campaigns, but Democrats, too, fear that the proposed measures could cost them seats in the 1994 congressional elections by limiting the advantage in fund-raising enjoyed by incumbents. A main obstacle to campaign finance reform is a Supreme Court ruling that mandatory limits on spending infringe the constitutional right to free speech. That means that any attempt to limit spending  - House and Senate races last year are estimated to have cost a total of Dollars 504m (Pounds 333.7m)  - must be voluntary. The carrot of public finance, which already exists for presidential campaigns, is therefore virtually inescapable. US voters, however much they want candidates to stop taking money from lobbyists, appear reluctant for the government to pick up the bill. This leaves the way open for the very wealthy, such as Mr Ross Perot, the independent who financed most of his presidential campaign last year out of his own deep pocket, or Mr Michael Huffington, a Californian Republican who broke the congressional record by spending Dollars 5.4m, mostly his own money, to win a House seat last year.</p>

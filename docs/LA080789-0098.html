			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW CHILDREN'S PROGRAM;  </P> <P> LAGUNA YOUTH THEATER CITED AS BEST IN U.S.  </P> <P> The Laguna Playhouse Youth Theater has been named the country's best new  children's program by a national organization of educators and theater  professionals.  </P> <P> The American Alliance for Theater and Education is expected to announce this  morning at its annual convention in New York that the Youth Theater is the  winner of the Outstanding New Children's Theater Company Award.  </P> <P> The prestigious award is bestowed by the 700-member organization on theatrical  programs between 2 and 5 years old. The Youth Theater recently concluded its  third season at the Moulton Theatre in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Scott Davidson, artistic director of the children's troupe, said from New York  through a Laguna Playhouse spokesman that he was "thrilled by this kind of  national recognition." He said it affirmed his belief that "children are  entitled to the best of all the arts."  </P> <P> Brian Krall, whose work has been performed by the Youth Theater, is also to be  named the winner of the alliance's Charlotte Chorpenning Playwright Award,  Laguna spokesman Brian Murphy added. The award goes to a nationally known  writer of outstanding plays for children.  </P> <P> Krall's "Special Class," a drama about handicapped children, was staged at the  Moulton two seasons ago. Another of his works, "Draw Fire," will be offered  during the Youth Theater's 1989-90 season.  </P> <P> The subscription audience for the children's troupe has increased nearly  fivefold since it began operating in 1986, Murphy said. There were 240 season  ticket holders that year and more than 1,100 this year. The program has also  doubled its theater-arts class enrollment during each successive season. There  were 160 students this year.  </P> <P> The task of "preparing audiences of the future can often be unsung," Douglas  Rowe, artistic director of the Laguna Playhouse, said in a prepared statement.  "We hope this award will further serve to bring into focus the importance of  the work being done by Scott, his staff and our diligent company of players and  volunteers."  </P> <P> The playhouse is currently raising money for the purchase of the General  Telephone building in downtown Laguna Beach to expand operations beyond the  Moulton Theatre, both for classrooms and performance space for the children's  troupe as well as for a professional company.  </P> <P> The Youth Theater produced five plays during its 1988-89 season at the Moulton,  including "The Nightingale," "Barnum" and "I Never Saw Another Butterfly."  </P> <P> Next season it will also offer five plays, beginning with "Alice in  Wonderland," to be staged as an environmental theater work at Anneliese's  Willowbrook School (Sept. 30-Oct. 22).  </P> <P> That will be followed at the Moulton by "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever" (Dec.  15 to 23); "The Code Breaker" (Feb. 3 to 11); "Draw Fire" (March 31 to April 8)  and "The Bluebird" (June 8 to 17).  </P></p>

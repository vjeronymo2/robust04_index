			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Julio Riquelme report: "Gonzalez Avoids Linking His Future </F> to 12 June Outcome"]    [Text] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez yesterday  opened the election campaign for 12 June with an appearance on  the Antena 3 television channel. On several occasions, Gonzalez  was at pains to dissociate his political future and that of his  government from the results of the dual European and Andalusian  elections, acknowledging only that "if there is a catastrophe,"  there is a possibility of reconsidering the current situation.    In the opinion of Gonzalez, each election's results should  be  confined to its own sphere, even though some political forces --  which he did not name -- wish to turn 12 June into a primary  election. Continuing this line of argument, Gonzalez denied that  bad results could cause his resignation.    Previously, when asked about his state of mind with respect  to the successive corruption cases, the prime minister asserted  that "I have been in power for many years, and I know that my  responsibility is to carry through our blueprint for the  country, tackling both the corruption cases and the economic  crisis."    Nevertheless, Gonzalez stated that "in the political sphere,  my most difficult moment was the NATO referendum, and in the  personal sphere, it has been these days with the corruption  scandals." "I have no limits," he asserted, "in combating  corruption, except those characteristic of a rule-of-law state,  which it is very difficult to blackmail," referring to Luis  Roldan.  <H5>  Trust Betrayed </H5>   After asserting, referring to the Roldan and Rubio cases,  that "institutions stand above individuals," praising the work  performed by both the Civil Guard and the Bank of Spain,  Gonzalez reiterated that personal trust had been betrayed  because of a lack of democratic controls, entailing political  responsibilities which have been discharged -- referring to the  resignations of Asuncion, Corcuera, and Solchaga. "It has been  difficult for me to accept the betrayal, and I have had a very  bad time," he asserted. "We resign," he said, in a clear  reference to the People's Party: "Others do not resign."    Gonzalez said that it is very difficult to foresee the  emergence of new scandals, although he pointed out that as prime  minister "I have approved over 1,000 appointments of senior  officials, and only two or three have disappointed me." The  prime minister did not rule out the possibility that somebody is  directing "a trickle of news" connected with corruption, stating  that "some people do not even like the democratic system."    He showed himself opposed to the proposal made yesterday by  Democratic Union of Catalonia leader Duran Lleida, for making a  "fresh start" in the matter of party funding, since he deems it  necessary for all citizens to know the origin of the parties'  funds, and to create legal arrangements to ensure their  transparency, involving an austerity which he deems necessary,  plus increased powers for the National Audit Office.  <H5>  Disenchantment </H5>   The prime minister said he realizes that both the economic  crisis and corruption, as well as the "lengthy period" of  Socialist government, have caused disenchantment among many  citizens, and so "it will be necessary to appeal to people's  consciences to vote 12 June."    Felipe Gonzalez asserted that over the past few days,  "rather  than a political crisis, there has been political confusion,  uncertainty, and anxiety. But it is very strange that this is  being said by the People's Party, who are the only people to  deny the country's recovery." Gonzalez said stability is needed  for this recovery, and so in a further reference to the People's  Party he described it as "crass" for them to say "the opposite  of what even bodies and institutions very distant politically  from the Spanish Socialist Workers Party are stating."    In the purely economic sphere, the prime minister asserted  that the worst of the crisis is now over; "we will lose no jobs  in 1994, and 1995 will be a good year." He used this argument  to launch another attack on the People's Party for refusing to  acknowledge the good figures and for increasing confusion by  even asserting "that there will be a general election this year,  when not even 12 months have passed since the last general  election."    "We will win well in Andalusia," Gonzalez asserted, "because  the Andalusians have no inclination to vote for the right." He  denied the existence of a Rural Employment Plan captive vote,  acknowledging that "patronage would be another form of  corruption."    In a final personal reference, Gonzalez asserted that "for a  long time several European leaders have been urging me to leave  the Spanish Government and become the European Commission  president. Now they are no longer urging me," he concluded,  because "I have decided to remain in charge of my  responsibilities as prime minister."</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEEJAYS IN TV, FILMS  </P> <P> Thank you, Calendar, for adding one more reason to my list of why I haven't  been able to get my own television show. I already knew it's because I'm a  straight, talented WASP who is not a stand-up comic, not an ex-professional  athlete, not the son of a celebrity. Now I know it's because I'm also not a  disc jockey.  </P> <P> ROBERT BRISCOE EVANS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Roots of CalArts  </P></p>

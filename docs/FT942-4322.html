			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / People: Change of hard hat for Tony Allen Tony Allen, former chief executive of Berkshire county council, is to become the new chief executive of the National House-Building Council, the self-regulatory body of the house-building industry. He will succeed Basil Bean who retires at the end of September. Allen, 54, has been a consultant on market-testing and the management of change in the public sector since leaving Berkshire at the end of November. During his tenure, the council pioneered contracting-out of services to the private sector, putting even core activities such as planning and financial services out to tender. Since April, he has been special adviser to Michael Heseltine, Trade and Industry secretary, working on contracting-out and the privatisation of the DTI's agencies. A solicitor by training, Allen has spent most of his working life in local government. His career included spells with Coventry, Lewisham and Southwark and he was chief executive at the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham before moving to Berkshire. Between 1979 and 1986 he was responsible for the organisation and development of the London Youth Games and remains a director of London Youth Games Limited. He chaired the local authorities' disaster working party for the Department of Health and is a member of the British Standards Institution.</p>

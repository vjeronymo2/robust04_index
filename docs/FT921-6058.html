			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Calm session as results flow slackens STOCK market traders rested on their oars yesterday as the pace of company reporting slowed down at the end of a week which has been dominated by trading statements from the heavyweights of British finance and industry. With the latest UK opinion polls expected to report at the weekend, investors continued to focus on the re-election prospects of Mr John Major's Conservative government, which are believed to be closely linked to the contents of the budget speech to be delivered a week on Tuesday. Government bonds eased by  3/8 or so in continued reaction to the poor UK trade figures disclosed on Thursday. Share prices fluctuated even more narrowly than earlier this week before closing with little change. The final reading of 2,562.1 showed the FT-SE Index a mere 0.1 up. Earlier, the Index was down 10.4 when market attendance was hindered by commuter travel problems prompted by a security alert throughout central London following a bomb explosion at a main-line railway station. Also holding stocks back was a narrowing in the premium on the FT-SE March futures contract, which has often provided a lead for the market over the past week. Share prices soon rallied in the absence of significant selling and although London paid little heed to an early gain of 10 Dow points when Wall Street opened for the new session, the final picture was stable. Trading volume, as measured through the Seaq network, which takes in both retail and intra-market business, dwindled somewhat as the corporate reporting load lightened; yesterday's 449.7m shares compared with 606.2m on Thursday when Midland Bank, ICI and British Gas all reported profits. Retail, or customer-originated, business in equities totalled Pounds 1.2bn on Thursday, among the highest daily totals for the year so far. The banking sector, which generally satisfied the market this week with its dividend and profits announcements, improved yesterday. The exception, however, was Barclays whose trading statement had disclosed payment from reserves to help meet the cost of the dividend. Last night's closing levels left the FT-SE Index with a gain of 19.8 over the first week of the two week equity trading account. The gain has reflected optimism for a relatively generous budget, hopefully accompanied closely by the widely-expected reduction in UK base rates. However, the market still has to face trading statements from across the range of British industry. Retail volume in equities has remained volatile but has increased as the market has responded favourably to the flow of company results.</p>

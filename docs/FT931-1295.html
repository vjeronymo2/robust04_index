			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Leading Article: The Bank's role BACK TO basics has been the slogan of countless companies after the conglomerate excesses of the past three decades. The idea appears now to have penetrated the rarefied world of central banking. Yesterday Mr Brian Quinn, an executive director of the Bank of England, warned that there was a growing mismatch between the ever-wider range of services provided by commercial banks, and the allocation of responsibilities among watchdogs. Consumer protection in the wider financial services area was not, he argued, the right role for a central bank; and he added, in a characteristic piece of central bankerly understatement, that there was 'a question whether the current arrangements may not, at some point, have to be considered'. A clear re-statement of the Bank's role in prudential supervision is undoubtedly welcome, after the debacle of Bank of Credit and Commerce International. But whether the narrowness with which the Bank defines its remit can be reconciled with market reality is a moot point. Mr Quinn chooses to make a distinction between supervision, which is one of the means by which central bankers head off risks to the banking system as a whole, and regulation, which he sees as being about rules covering activities, products and services available to investors and policyholders. Yet in practice, the distinction is often blurred. After the implementation of monetary policy, the chief role of the Bank is the protection of depositors in the interests of the stability of the system. Mr Quinn puts a traditional case for the activity of prudential supervision being tied to the central bank acting as a lender of last resort to individual institutions. And, without being specific to the point of raising questions of moral hazard, he sets out unexceptionable criteria for such last resort lending operations. The difficulty arises over the erosion of boundaries between different financial products. Savings products such Tessas are both a deposit and an investment. Even where banking products are not closely related to deposits, any loss of confidence in them could still lead to cross-infection, as Mr Quinn himself acknowledges. The fact is that convergence in financial services is very different from conglomeration in industry. It is rooted in market logic and, in some cases, genuine product synergy. As commercial banks have lost their corporate clients to the investment bankers, a purist definition of the lender-of-last-resort function which confines itself to commercial banking also becomes unrealistic, as the stock market crash of 1987 demonstrated. In order to restrain the moral hazard implicit in deposit insurance and last-resort lending, there is a powerful case for creating a separate category of heavily insured low-risk, low-return deposit taking institutions. But even then, uninsured institutions could still pose systemic threats. One suspects that the Bank of England, regardless of its formal responsibilities, would still end up taking the flak.</p>

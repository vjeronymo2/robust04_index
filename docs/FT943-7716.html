			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Lib Dems propose tough controls on broadcasting Tough controls to maintain the quality of television and radio broadcasting will be proposed today by the Liberal Democrats. Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat media spokesman, will also call for a widening of the restrictions on monopoly satellite television coverage of prominent sporting events such as the FA Cup final, Wimbledon and the Grand National. The proposals would remove regulatory supervision of broadcasting from the government for the first time since the BBC was established in 1927. Regulation of the BBC, ITV and independent radio would be transferred to an Office of Broadcasting appointed by a two-thirds majority of the Commons. The plans, contained in a paper for the Liberal Democrat conference in September, are intended to reinforce diversity and quality in broadcasting. The paper says that popular-journalism standards have fallen steadily for 20 years because of tough competition in a shrinking market, leading to 'ruthless' sensationalism. 'A similar development could occur in British television unless the BBC is reinforced . . . and unless the broadcasting regulator is encouraged to be tough with any erring ITV franchise holder,' it says. The paper says the BBC should continue to be funded through the licence fee, but should make more effort to sell its programmes to raise extra funds. It also suggests that the BBC should directly challenge BSkyB, the satellite TV broadcaster in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. The paper says the BBC should set up satellite channels to concentrate on its traditional strengths such as news, comedy, and natural history. It adds that greater competition is the key to maintaining the quality of satellite services, rather than direct regulation. The paper says that Mr Rupert Murdoch should not have been allowed to establish control of BSkyB in addition to more than a third of daily and Sunday newspaper circulation.</p>

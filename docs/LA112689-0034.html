			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN AMERICAN STAGE  </P> <P> It was with sadness and more than a bit of anger that I read Dan Sullivan's  Nov. 19 article on the supposed lack of classical American actors ("Into the  Breach With Branagh").  </P> <P> As an actor who has done most of her work in the classics and has been  fortunate enough to work with world-class American actors and directors on the  classics, I was appalled by Sullivan's uniformed and chauvinistically  anglophile observations.  </P> <P> First, to say that Taper executive Gordon Davidson's decision to bring over a  British company to do Shakespeare is "gutsy" is both offensive and ridiculous.  What would be gutsy would be to use classical American actors who are well  versed in the language plays, not just personality actors whose last brush with  Shakespeare may have been their high school English class. (I recognize the  need for box-office draw, but I believe the American public would respond as  well to quality as to TV-Q.)  </P> <P> Come, Mr. Sullivan, in this day of foreign interests buying up our country  right and left, don't sell out our actors too!  </P> <P> HOPE ALEXANDER-WILLIS  </P> <P> Los AngelesSex and IQ  </P></p>

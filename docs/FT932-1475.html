			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign demand helps Nikkei recoup losses PUBLIC fund and arbitrage related buying supported share prices and the Nikkei average recouped a part of Monday's fall, as an expected rush of selling by investors failed to materialise, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei, which lost 3 per cent on Monday on political uncertainty, recovered 325.87, or 1.7 per cent, to 19,538.30. It weakened to the day's low of 19,141.05 at the beginning of the session, but rose steadily during the rest of the session, hitting a high of 19,619.52 some 15 minutes before the close. Volume remained almost flat, at 350m shares against 351.1m. Advances led falls by 787 to 237, with 108 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose for the first time in seven trading days, gaining 24.10 at 1,555.38. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.97 firmer at 1,193.91. Traders said investors had recovered from the initial shock of the split within the ruling Liberal Democratic party. 'It is an uncertainty, but not a threat to the market,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. Foreigners were seen buying stock futures on the Singapore market, triggering arbitrage related buying. However, Baring Securities said activity was not expected to pick up substantially ahead of the parliamentary elections on July 18. Meanwhile, the yen continued to weaken against the dollar. Bond yields rose by 0.06 percentage points to 4.465 per cent, as the fall in the Japanese currency undermined hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate. Stocks which lost ground on Monday on margin related selling recovered. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rallied Y24,000 to Y855,000 and NEC rose Y24 to Y931. Semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers gained ground on hopes, prompted by newspaper forecasts, of an earnings recovery. Nikon advanced Y35 to Y948 and Tokyo Electron Y60 to Y2,700. Large-capital issues were higher on short-covering. Nippon Steel put on Y4 at Y366 while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rose Y20 to Y648. The real estate sector posted the strongest performance, climbing 4.3 per cent on reports of a 78.7 per cent rise in individual applications for Housing Loan Corporation loans for May. Mitsui Fudosan added Y50 at Y1,230 and Mitsubishi Estate Y52 at Y1,040. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 341.69 ahead at 21,509.23 in volume of 30.6m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets turned in mixed performances. HONG KONG benefited from better than expected results of a government land auction and improved perceptions of talks at the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. The Hang Seng index advanced 43.15 to 7,046.73. Hong Kong Worsted Mills, target of a takeover bid by a state-owned Chinese company, jumped HKDollars 5.60, or 59 per cent, to HKDollars 15.10 as trade resumed after its suspension on June 17. Miramar, the hotel group, was unchanged at HKDollars 16.20. Cheung Kong, which has joined Citic Pacific in a bid for Miramar, fell 30 cents to HKDollars 26.50, while Citic was up 10 cents to HKDollars 16.90. SINGAPORE fell across the board on institutional selling and the Straits Times Industrial index dipped 31.81, or 1.75 per cent, to 1,787.68. AUSTRALIA saw profit-taking in blue chips, which left the All Ordinaries index 9.9 lower at 1,716.7 in lacklustre trading ahead of the end of the financial year on June 30. BHP fell 20 cents to ADollars 13.90 and dragged the market lower, following reports that it plans to expand its mineral division. KUALA LUMPUR lost part of an early gain on profit-taking, with investors cautious about the market's direction after last week's downward correction. The composite index ended a net 10.29 higher at 724.96. TAIWAN reversed small early advances to close easier as turnover sank to its lowest level since January. The weighted index, which was up about 14 points in early trade, finished 11.88 down at 4,062.49. SEOUL saw demand by individual investors for large capitalisation shares and the composite index moved forward 4.56 to 770.62. Market rumours of a scrip issue helped Daewoo Heavy Industries to gain Won700 but an immediate denial by the company pared the advance to Won300 and the shares closed at Won18,400. BANGKOK found demand from individual and institutional investors, which took the SET index 15.59, or 1.76 per cent, higher to 903.53, its first close above the 900 level for two months. COLOMBO continued to rise, the CSE all-share index adding 4.25 at 619.14 in turnover which swelled to Rp135.7m from Monday's Rp68.2m. KARACHI finished higher on heavy foreign buying of financials, polyesters and chemicals, and the KSE index rose 9.45 to 1,235.51.</p>

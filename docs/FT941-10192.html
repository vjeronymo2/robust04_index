			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Charges push Aetna into red Aetna, the US multiline insurer, racked up an after-tax loss of Dollars 366m last year (Dollars 593m before accounting changes) as a result of substantial one-off charges announced recently. The charges, amounting to Dollars 1.28bn after tax, followed a decision by the company to stop offering unprofitable guaranteed investment and annuity products, and to cut 4,000 jobs in an attempt to lift its lacklustre performance. Without the one-off items, Aetna showed an improvement in operating profits last year, to Dollars 610m from Dollars 192m in 1992. The improvement came against a fall in premium income, from Dollars 10.8bn to Dollars 10.6bn, and was helped by a 7 per cent decline in operating expenses during the year, though Aetna's overheads still remain higher than most of its competitors. For the final quarter of the year, before charges, the company reported earnings of Dollars 143m, compared with less than Dollars 1m the year before. Earnings improvements were seen in all operating areas during the year. Net income in health and life insurance (before charges) rose to Dollars 344m from Dollars 315m, though fourth quarter results stayed flat at Dollars 91m. Commercial property/casualty insurance operations reported a profit of Dollars 139m for the year (a loss of Dollars 125m in 1992) while the personal property/casualty business had earnings of Dollars 8m (a loss of Dollars 18m). Mr Ronald Compton, chairman, said Aetna's actions to cut the drag on its earnings from the unprofitable investment products, to reduce costs and to cut the size of its property portfolio would enable it to improve returns in future.</p>

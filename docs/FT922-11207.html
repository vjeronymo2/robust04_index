			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Local authorities head for first clash with Howard LOCAL AUTHORITIES are heading for their first clash with Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, over a government decision which they say will cost councils at least Pounds 60m in the current financial year, and Pounds 100m in 1993-94. Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, has written to Mr Howard seeking an urgent meeting about plans to pay councils a lump sum for certain loan charges from the start of October, instead of continuing with specific grants. The Department of the Environment has consistently assured local authorities that the commutation of the specific loan charge grants for some housing and urban-programme spending into a lump sum would be financially neutral overall. Councils, however, argue that because the distribution of the grant is not based on the debt charges actually faced, there are significant differences between the amounts of grant some authorities will lose, and the charges they will continue to face. For Manchester, for example, the change is expected to mean an extra budgetary requirement of more than Pounds 1m in 1992-93. They are also concerned that the method of interest-rate calculation disadvantages many councils. Councillors warn that in the current year the sums might almost certainly be found only by cuts in areas such as education and social services. To try to avoid service cuts, the AMA will urge the government to relax the 'minium revenue provision' rules, which ensure that councils set aside a certain amount each year for debt repayment, in order to bridge the gap between the amount of grant lost and the loan charges they will face. Local government officials were incensed that while councils are acutely conscious of government limits on their budgets, civil servants played down the issue at one meeting, saying it added only another couple of pounds to poll-tax levels.</p>

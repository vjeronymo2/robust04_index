			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (8): Economics and the Irish Question - Economic History THE IRISH ECONOMY: RESULTS AND PROSPECTS by Ronnie Munck Pluto Press Pounds 10.95 177 pages THE POLITICIANS have not done too well in trying to end the troubles in Northern Ireland, and Ronnie Munck's The Irish Economy: Results and Prospects makes a stab at some alternative scenarios. Could economic logic ultimately drive the two parts of Ireland into some modus vivendi, in the context of the Single European Market? Possibly yes; but then other putative solutions have been singularly unsuccessful over the past 20 years. Munck is a sociologist at the University of Ulster and he writes from a radical perspective, yet he floats notions rather than dogmatic assertions, leaving the impression that he is planting seeds and not surveying the final harvest. Books abound on the economic history of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. This effort endeavours to trace and quantify their economic development in parallel, to identify similarities and some differences, and to hint that an economic coming together might be for the common good. The trouble is that there is no accepted definition of the common good in an Irish context; there is a Unionist good, a Nationalist good, a Republican good, even an Anglo-Irish good, but they seldom meet, except perhaps at Dublin's Lansdowne Road rugby ground where both sides of the troubled border support the lads in green. Otherwise it is noisy shouting across the community divide, at least in the North, and tragically it is very often much more deadly. Yet both parts of Ireland face common economic problems, each traditionally over-dependent on Britain, although gradually less so for the Republic over recent years. Dublin's campaign to attract multinationals to locate manufacturing operations in the South has had impressive success, aided by generous grants and attractive fiscal concessions. But there have been costs. Repatriation of profits by foreign investors is estimated to exceed 10 per cent of GDP, and when taxation holidays run out some multinationals look for even cheaper manufacturing bases elsewhere. All the while there has been inadequate development and strengthening of indigenous industry. The universities continue to attract more students, the emigrant ships and aircraft more graduates. The historically richer north of Ireland has done little better in recent times; on some criteria even worse. There too incentives were offered to foreign multinationals, but bombs and bullets mean more than cash in corporate decision-making, and the North's economy there would surely collapse were it not for the huge subsidies the province receives from Britain. Northern Ireland's dependence on British subsidies and the earlier abortive De Valera drive in the South for economic self-sufficiency through protectionism - which sparked off the so-called Economic War with Britain - are both lessons in internal economic failure. Ireland's membership of the European Economic Community (EC) has helped the country open up new markets and reduce its dependence on the UK, but as the recent crisis in the ERM amply demonstrated, the trade patterns and currencies of the two countries are still closely related. In the North the economic and political crisis often seems terminal; in the South things appear better. In both parts of the country EC funds have helped somewhat, both directly through the Common Agricultural Policy, and through infrastructural projects assisted by the Regional Development Fund. But Ireland North and South remains a fragile economy on the periphery of Europe, high in unemployment and over-dependent on external forces. Could the sum of the parts improve the whole? Munck - assisted by a colleague, Douglas Hamilton - address this question in a final chapter. The canvas is drawn widely to include five scenarios: continuation of the status quo; some form of devolved government in Northern Ireland - or, at the extreme, complete independence and separation; positions around the concept of economic harmonisation (much closer North-South economic links in a European context); the reunification of Ireland within a capitalist framework; and, finally, reunification within a radical democratic framework. A preferred choice does not shine through: Munck is open-minded, concerned above all to set out the basic facts about how the economies of the two parts of Ireland have developed since the partition. But there is just a hint. He quotes from a 1933 lecture given in Dublin by John Maynard Keynes (De Valera had just come to government and was offering his philosophy of economic self-sufficiency): 'Let goods be homespun wherever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and above all, let finance be primarily national.' Munck thinks these Keynesian principles retain their relevance for Ireland.</p>

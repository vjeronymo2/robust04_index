			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Norway Expels Iranian Consul"] </F>   [Text] Consul Mohammad Movahed of the Iranian Embassy has  been given 10 days to leave Norway.    Yesterday the Foreign Ministry summoned the Iranian  ambassador to inform him that Movahed is not welcome in Norway  because of activities that are incompatible with his diplomatic  status.    "The expulsion has nothing to do with the Nygaard [Salman  Rushdie's Norwegian publisher, recent target of a murder  attempt] affair. I cannot comment on what lies behind this  reaction," Foreign Ministry press spokesman Ingvar Havnen said.    Hans Olav Ostgaard, the head of the surveillance police, had  only this to say: "The surveillance police does not comment on  matters like this." Yesterday no one at the Iranian Embassy in  Oslo was willing to comment to NORSK TELEGRAMBYRA.    As far as Ingvar Havnen is aware this is the first time that  an Iranian diplomat has been expelled from Norway. It is true  that there have been diplomatic difficulties between Norway and  Iran in the past, but these have never gotten as far as  expulsion. Havnen said that he sees no reason for Iran to expel  Norwegian diplomats at the embassy in Tehran by way of reprisal.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE COVER  </P> <P> Over the course of five years, the hard-boiled NBC police series "Hunter" has  softened its rough edges and steadily risen in the Nielsen ratings.  </P> <P> Last season "Hunter" often landed among Nielsen's Top 15 shows. When the series  returns for a new season in September, its fans can expect to see further  fine-tuning. That's when Fred Dryer, who portrays homicide detective Rick  Hunter, and his partner Lawrence Kubik will become executive producers.  </P> <P> Dryer, whose co-star Stepfanie Kramer plays Sgt. Dee Dee McCall, plans to  reduce the number of car chases and fights in favor of more character  development and stories that will focus on the "human condition."  </P> <P> No changes in the supporting cast or time slot, however. Charles Hallahan will  be back as police captain Charles Devane, with Garrett Morris serving as  Hunter's informant Sporty James each Saturday at 10 p.m.  </P></p>

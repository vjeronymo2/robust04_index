			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS CLAIM BAHR ON FINAL DAY OF SIGNING UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENTS  </P> <P> The last day of the signing period for unrestricted free agents claimed the  Raider kicker for this decade as Chris Bahr signed with the San Diego Chargers.  </P> <P> Bahr, 36, leaves as the No. 2 scorer in Raider history, (817 points to George  Blanda's 863), and was virtually automatic inside the 30.  </P> <P> However, he struggled on longer kicks in the last three seasons (he was 10 for  21 outside the 30 last season), and the club began giving harder looks to  outsiders. John Lee was brought in during the last training camp, cut and then  invited back when Bahr got off to a slow start. The 44-yarder Bahr kicked at  the end of regulation of the Raiders' overtime victory at Denver was thought to  have saved his job.  </P> <P> The Raiders have already reportedly signed another kicker, free agent Jeff  Jaeger from the Cleveland Browns, although the club hasn't made any  announcement.  </P> <P> The Chargers, run by former Raider official Steve Ortmayer, also signed Raider  tight end Andy Parker over the weekend.

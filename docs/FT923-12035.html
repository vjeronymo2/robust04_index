			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Marine Midland turnround raises earnings to Dollars 41m MARINE Midland, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's US subsidiary, yesterday reported a turnround to net earnings in the second quarter of Dollars 41m (Pounds 21m) from losses of Dollars 37m for the same period of 1991. The result takes half-year profits to Dollars 43.6m against first-half losses in 1991 of Dollars 109.3m. Mr John Bond, president and chief executive officer, said: 'We are encouraged by the continuing improvements in credit quality and operating margins.' The bank's earnings were improved by non-recurring loan recoveries and sales of foreclosed property. Marine Midland was acquired by Hongkong Bank during the 1980s. On two occasions since, the bank was forced to make capital injections totalling Dollars 500m into its US subsidiary to shore up its balance sheet. Marine was one of New York's main money centre banks, but it was hit badly by its exposure to less developed country (LDC) debt in the early 1980s and by its exposure to the US property market in the last half of the 1980s. It has now given up its aim of being a money centre bank and has repositioned itself as a provider of retail banking services and finance to small and medium-sized companies. Signs of improvement in Marine Midland's performance - the result of cost cutting and a contraction in its balance sheet - began to show through last year when losses were pared to Dollars 23.8m in 1991 from Dollars 164.3m in 1990. In the first quarter of this year it made a profit of Dollars 2.6m. The bank said that during the second quarter it achieved improvements in net interest margins and further reductions in expenses. Net interest income was Dollars 178.9m, compared with Dollars 168.3m in the first quarter. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and credit-related costs, were Dollars 173.8m against Dollars 179.7m in the first quarter. Observer, Page 15</p>

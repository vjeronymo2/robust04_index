			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Record low Japanese money growth JAPAN'S money supply growth remained at record low levels in August, with the broad money supply expanding at an annual rate of just 0.3 per cent, according to figures published yesterday by the Bank of Japan. Bank officials said the slight increase in the growth of M2 and certificates of deposit from the record low of 0.2 per cent in July did not mark the start of an upturn in the money supply. The bank recently cast doubt on the usefulness of the broad money supply as a measure of credit conditions. August's low growth suggests, however, that July's half-point cut in interest rates to 3.25 per cent has barely stimulated bank lending. Officials expect M2 growth of less than 1 per cent in the third quarter as a whole, which implies growth of less than 0.5 per cent in September. Broad liquidity, another closely-watched broad monetary indicator, which includes deposits in the postal savings system, grew at a record low of 3.3 per cent in August, down from 3.5 per cent the month before. The slow growth of money supply, which was growing at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in August last year, will fuel speculation that the bank may have to cut interest rates further to stimulate the economy. The economy's depressed state was confirmed by the steel industry, which yesterday became the first industry to apply officially for government assistance to help pay for the transfer or retraining of laid-off surplus workers.</p>

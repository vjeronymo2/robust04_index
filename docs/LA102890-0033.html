			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLENTY OF WAYS TO SCARE UP SOME FUN FOR HALLOWEEN  </P> <P> Looking for something different this Halloween? You can probably find it on the  Westside.  </P> <P> For instance, dog owners have a chance today to take the pooch out on the town  and show him (or her) off in the Rude Dog Halloween Contest at Odyssey Video in  Venice. Those rude dogs bold enough to enter will be judged on personality,  costume and tricks.  </P> <P> "Rude is an attitude," said Kim Sakaguchi of Odyssey Video, explaining what  judges will be looking for. "A Rude Dog means it's cool, radical and totally  awesome."  </P> <P> Sakaguchi said judges for the Rude Dog costume contest will include actors who  provide voices for characters on the "Rude Dog" TV cartoon show. The  first-place prize will be a large, stuffed Rude Dog, with hats and cups among a  host of other prizes. A $5 entry fee is required for the contest, which will  take place from 1 to 4 p.m.  </P> <P> For those looking for something for the whole family, a pumpkin-carving session  and reading of scary stories will take place at the Westside Arts Center from  3:30 to 6 p.m. today. Professional storyteller Kathleen Zundell will use  puppets and musical instruments to tell children ages 3-6 some slightly scary  stories. She will then entertain the older crowd with a few really scary tales.  </P> <P> The center has 250 pumpkins to share and is hoping for a big turnout.  </P> <P> "It's a free-for-all," said Jane Greenberg, assistant program director. "There  is no prize because we're not into the competitive side of creating art, but  older kids should like it."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, those sophisticated mavericks searching for an  out-of-the-ordinary Halloween experience can find the "Phantom" of the Marina  Market Place filling the night air with organ music. The mysterious Phantom  will perform haunting classical melodies by Bach from 5 to 9 p.m.  </P> <P> Across the street at the Villa Marina Center, Elvira, Jason and Freddy Kreuger  look-alikes will be be handing out Halloween bags of goodies along with safety  tips and coloring books from 3 to 6 p.m.  </P> <P> The Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza will celebrate its second annual Safe  Halloween Party from 5 to 8 p.m. in the Bradley Court. Other events on  Wednesday include a host of carnivals at various recreation centers.  </P> <P> Penmar Recreation Center will have a haunted house and carnival from 6 to 9  p.m. Prizes will be awarded for a costume contest for children ages 5-8.  Various games also will be offered.  </P> <P> Oakwood Recreation Center hosts a carnival and costume contest from 4 to 7 p.m.  for ages 6-12. Food and prizes will be available. And for children 14 and  under, there is a carnival from 5:30 to 9 p.m. at Santa Monica Airport in the  Barker Hangar. The Santa Monica Cultural and Recreation Services Department  will sponsor game booths, prizes, food and a costume contest.

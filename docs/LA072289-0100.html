			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TYSON, WILLIAMS: FIRST TIME WAS DIFFERENT  </P> <P> They met six years ago in a neighborhood gym in White Plains, N.Y., Mike Tyson,  then a 16-year-old amateur boxer being nurtured by the late Cus D'Amato, and  Carl (The Truth) Williams, 23, a promising professional heavyweight.  </P> <P> They would test each other's strength and courage three straight days, but now,  not surprisingly, each remembers these learning experiences quite differently.  </P> <P> "That first day, he came at me like I'd cursed his mother," said Williams, who  challenges Tyson for his undisputed heavyweight title at the Convention Center  on Friday night.  </P> <P> "We'd been told by D'Amato not to try to hurt his kid. That he was just a baby,  getting his feet wet. But he tried to tear my head off and bloodied my nose.  </P> <P> "I went home raging mad, and all I could think about was getting even,"  Williams added. "The next two days, I kicked some butt and D'Amato wouldn't let  us near him again."  </P> <P> Tyson, on the other hand, remembers getting all the best of it and sending his  older, more-seasoned rival into hiding. For public consumption, the champion,  turned 23 and a granite-like 219 1/4 pounds, says, "They were real good  workouts, but that was then, and this is now."  </P> <P> Indeed. While Tyson made a meteoric rise through the heavyweight ranks and  solidified the title while stretching his unblemished record to 36-0, including  32 knockouts, Williams (22-2, 17 K0s) has been on a treadmill since May 1985,  when, as a decided underdog, came close to dethroning then-heavyweight champion  Larry Holmes.  </P> <P> The prohibitive 12-1 odds indicate Williams is given even less of a chance than  Tyson's last four title challengers -- Holmes, Tony Tubbs, Michael Spinks and  Frank Bruno -- who lasted a combined 12 rounds.  </P> <P> But Williams and his handlers insist that he will not be like these previous  victims.  </P> <P> "We've all heard it before," said Williams' trainer, Carmen Graziano. "A lot of  guys have said that they were going to beat Tyson and then let him walk all  over them.  </P> <P> "I've been associated with four champions, and Williams has a better jab than  any of them. You only see it on the way back. You don't expect a guy 6-4 and  218 pounds to be this fast. Tyson is quick, but my guy is quicker.  </P></p>

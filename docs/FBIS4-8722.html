			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 16 (TANJUG) -- Zagreb is ready to use  force if necessary by the end of the year to bring the republic  of Serb Krajina (RSK) into Croatia, a Croat official has stated.    Slavko Degoricija, who headed a Croatian delegation to talks  with the RSK on normalization of mutual relations, told the  Czech news agency CTK late on Friday [15 April] that force would  be used only if the reintegration process were not completed  within six months.    Degoricija said the position of Russia, the European Union  and the U.N. Security Council was the same -- Krajina's  reintegration into Croatia must be completed within six months,  i.e. before the expiry of the U.N. peacekeepers' mandate. The  reintegration would be carried out in three stages, with the  first stage focusing on a truce, the second on the economy and  the third on political issues, he explained.    In case the Serb side should not agree, we shall inform the  Security Council and take adequate steps for the reintegration  of Krajina, the Croatian official said.    The first round of RSK-Croatia talks at the Russian Embassy  in Zagreb in March was completed successfully. The agreement on  the cessation of hostilities and troop disengagement which was  reached on the occasion is being fully honoured.    In preparation for the second stage of the talks on  normalization of relations, RSK officials have insisted with  international mediators that this should in no way prejudge a  political solution, especially as the two sides hold  diametrically opposed views about the political settlement.    RSK president Milan Martic ruled out any possibility of  Krajina forming part of Croatia.    The only way to peace is to keep the RSK and Croatia  (?apart)  because living toghther is absolutely out of the question,  Martic told the CTK.    He said the RSK was ready to make a compromise, not by  accepting autonomy within Croatia but by restoring economic and  other ties. "The basic (?condition) for this is equality between  the RSK and croatia (?as) two independent states," he was  categorical. [passage indistinct]</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / UK Gilts: Economic indicators point to long-end gains THE long end of the gilt market made further gains last week, due to more settled news on inflation and a slight easing of fears about the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR). Gilt investors were cheered by news of yet a further slowing in the year-on-year rate of increase in average earnings. This came down to 4.75 per cent in December, from 5 per cent in November, and represents the smallest rise in 25 years. There was also some optimism that a higher-than-expected Pounds 3.83bn surplus in government finances in January might indicate a slight easing in the pressures on the PSBR. While long-dated gilts slipped in yield by about 20 basis points over the week, prices at the short end stayed virtually the same, with little to suggest any immediate cut in bank base rates. Friday's first report by the Treasury's panel of outside economic advisers provided a tonic for the gilt market in one respect, in its espousal of the abandonment of the full-funding rule for financing the PSBR. Such a step - which is being examined by the Treasury before the March 16 budget - would mean purchases of gilts by banks and building societies would count towards financing the deficit, expected to be about Pounds 37bn this financial year and nearly Pounds 50bn in 1993-1994. The move has been advocated for months by many gilt specialists on the grounds that the action would reduce the amount of issues required over the next few years. As a result it might pull down long-dated gilt yields. The report from the seven-strong panel was generally gloomy about the UK's short-term economic outlook, putting likely growth this year at just over 1 per cent. It said there was uncertainty about whether a significant recovery would take place, while underlying inflation this year is likely to stay within the 1 to 4 per cent target range set by the Treasury. Further good news on inflation came from labour market data which underlined the firm downward pressure on wage settlements. The year-on-year rise in the index of underlying earnings across the economy has now come down in every month since June when it was 6.25 per cent. With all the signs being that the government will probably stick to its target of keeping rises in public sector wages at 1.5 per cent or less, the prospect of further falls in wage inflation in the months ahead look reasonably good. Even so, this may not necessarily feed into the headline inflation rate. According to the Treasury's economic advisory panel, inflation as measured by the year-on-year increase in the retail prices index will rise from 1.7 per cent last month to 2.6 per cent by the end of this year and 3.6 per cent by the end of 1994. Few analysts, however, are getting too excited about any build-up of cost pressures which may be in the pipeline. Most economic statistics continue to indicate fairly stagnant demand. The latest retail sales data did show a better than expected 1.6 per cent rise in sales volumes in January compared with December. But much of this was a rebound from a poor Christmas period. In the three months to the end of January, sales volumes were up a modest 0.2 per cent compared with the previous three months, significantly less than the quarterly rises in the middle of last year. On the PSBR, the large surplus in January - the first for a year - is likely to be countered by big deficits this month and in March as technical changes related to the collection of tax revenues work their way into the figures. However, the publication of the January number diverted many gilt practitioners from the extremely large forecasts for the PSBR for the 1992-1993 financial year which have been published by some in the City in recent weeks. On the back of the January number, Mr Chris Anthony, an economist at the normally extremely bearish UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, says he thinks the PSBR for the year will come out at Pounds 35bn, Pounds 2bn less than the prediction made by the Treasury last November.</p>

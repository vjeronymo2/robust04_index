			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu said Wednesday that imposing sanctions  against North Korea was not desirable even if it had transferred  nuclear matter for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.    Arriving here after completing a visit to Canada, Han said,  "Since our purpose related to the North Korean nuclear problem  is to see to it that North Korea does not develop or own a  nuclear weapon, even if it had diverted nuclear matter it is not  desirable to impose sanctions unconditionally on Pyongyang for  its past behavior. Instead, we should receive a guarantee from  North Korea that it will not divert nuclear matter any more and  make Pyongyang dismantle its nuclear weapons if it has already  made one or more."    Han expected that it would take at least four to five more  years for North Korea to reach the point where it can actually  use nuclear weapons even if it makes them without any outside  checks.    "We need to adopt a prudent attitude in taking measures  risking a war in case North Korea turned out to have already  used nuclear matter (for making weapons)," he said.    Concerning North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections,  he judged that the dispute has passed one critical point, but  that many more critical points must be surmounted in the future.    "As far as I know, the IAEA's [International Atomic Energy  Agency] inspection team will be sent to North Korea early next  week," he added. He predicted that Pyongyang would agree to  resuming inter-Korean dialogue.    "Of course, it is up to North Korea. But since it wants to  hold a third round of high-level talks with the United States, I  think it will agree to resumption of inter-Korean dialogue," he  said.    He added that deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea  would be decided according to strategic and tactical military  needs, apart from the North Korean nuclear problem.    The U.S. Congress and press have often taken a hard line  against North Korea, but the Clinton administration's policies  can be judged to have maintained consistency, according to Han.    "The recent controversy over sanctions in the United States  is only part of the picture as far as consistency. The South  Korean and U.S. Governments share the recognition that they  should try to solve the nuclear problem through dialogue as long  as the continuity of nuclear safeguards is maintained."    But if North Korea refuses to accept special inspections by  the IAEA and the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level  talks is not held, the process that was employed last year will  not be followed, he said.    "Then it is quite possible that a resolution seeking  sanctions against North Korea would be passed at the United  Nations Security Council," he said.    Meanwhile, a scheduled visit to Pyongyang by Rep. Ronald  Dellums, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, was  canceled because North Korea agreed to inspections by the IAEA,  Han said.</p>

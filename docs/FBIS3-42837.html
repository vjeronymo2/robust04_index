			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with V. Semenyuk, Minister of Power Engineering </F> and Electrification, Ukraine, by L. Brovchenko: "Paradoxical  Situation: Industry Must Struggle to Reduce Its Income"]    [Text] Everyone is concerned about the energy situation,  and everyone feels the energy crunch. Even television broadcasts  had to be curtailed, resulting in a dearth of information in  addition to low building temperatures and other forms of  distress. These facts formed the topic of our conversation with  V. Semenyuk, Minister of Energy and Electrification of Ukraine.    [Semenyuk] The situation is very complicated. Our current  receipts of fuel--coal, heavy oil, and gas--are running 20  percent below last year's. In other words, we are short 40  billion kilowatt-hours (bKw-h) because of inadequate fuel  supplies. Problems with heavy oil and gas--which we get from  abroad--are particularly grave. Coal deliveries by the Ukrainian  coal miners are more-or-less normal at 100-115 thousand tons a  day, but we burn 150-160 thousand tons every day. The difference  comes from our reserves, which in better years amounted to ten  to 11 million tons. Last year we managed to save eight million  tons of coal. At this rate of consumption our reserves of coal  will last for another month or so.    [Brovchenko] But the winter will last longer than that ...    [Semenyuk] There's more! Some power stations have already  run  out of coal or have only one or two day's supply. Stations that  produce heat in addition to electricity have first claim on  coal. In short, if the coal industry will produce at the present  level, then we can last until February. As far as coal goes, we  are optimistic since its used to produced 27-28 percent of our  electricity. Since one third of the electricity comes from  nuclear power plants, it helps that the parliament lifted the  moratorium on the Chernobyl plant which supplies 1.2 to 1.3  bKw-h per month. So far this winter it has produced 8 bKw-h of  electricity, which otherwise would have required four million  tons of coal.    In addition, gas deliveries fell by six billion cubic meters  this year. The year before last by December we had consumed  80-82 million cubic meters, and a year ago 56-56.5 million cubic  meters.    But the worst scenario pertains to heavy oil deliveries  which  are 15-20 percent below normal. We have only emergency reserves  left, leaving unused some 40 percent of the equipment at thermal  power stations. The situation is particularly bad at the  Burshtyn, Ladyzhan, Trypillya, and Vuhlehirsk plants, followed  by Prydniprovsk and Kryvyy Rih stations.    [Brovchenko] People are using electric heaters and gas  stoves  at home and at work for heat, which defeats the entire purpose  of conserving our energy resources. What's to be done?    [Semenyuk] True. As a result of the overload some one  thousand transformer substations have been damaged in November.  We haven't been able to repair them yet because of electricity  is so cheap--cheaper than energy derived from coal and gas.  Everywhere else household electricity costs 1.5 to twice as much  as that made available for industrial use and people are less  inclined to waste it. Currently, we have established a rate of  90 karbovantsi (krb) for 75 KW-h of electricity for household  use. Using any more will cost you 180 krb at cost-recovery  rates. With 16 million households, it is impossible to monitor  everybody's use, and everything depends on a sense of  responsibility and integrity of the consumers.    [Brovchenko] That's somewhat utopian. We just got through  building a communist society which was to be based on a high  sense of responsibility of the citizens and found out that it  doesn't work.    [Semenyuk] True. We should provide assistance for the poorer  segments of the population and charge the wealthier elements a  higher rate in order to control energy use. However, a proposal  in this vein was not supported by the Council of Ministers.    [Brovchenko] So, your industry is short about 20 percent of  the fuel it needs to meet the demand for electricity. Will some  limits be placed on the use of electricity by consumers?    [Semenyuk] We will try to avoid this. We will also try to  exclude the fuel industry, community and agricultural  facilities, as well as processing, baking, meat and the dairy  industries.    Machine engineering, chemical and metallurgical industries  may be cut back by 40-50 percent.    [Brovchenko] What will altering the work schedules give you?    [Semenyuk] Reduce peak demands for electricity, although  overall consumption will remain the same.    [Brovchenko] And what about television stations?    [Semenyuk] Curtailing their use saves 3.6 million Kw-h per  day, or almost 80 million Kw-h per month, which is equivalent to  40 thousand tons of coal a month. If had enough fuel  broadcasting hours would not have been curtailed.    [Brovchenko] Its a paradoxical situation. Your profits  increase with increased usage of electricity and yet you have to  advocate less consumption.    [Semenyuk] Unfortunately, that's the case. We cannot  stockpile what we produce and production and consumption have to  balance. That's why we count so much on a sense of  responsibility of the population because of our problems with  fuel supplies.    We could buy fuel from commercial suppliers, but that  requires money. Our consumers owe us three billion karbovantsi.    [Brovchenko] How much electricity is produced by hydropower  stations?    [Semenyuk] The output of Ukrainian hydropower stations is  4.7  million kW-h per year; gas-powered stations produce 4-5 percent  of our electricity. A third is produced by nuclear power  stations and 66 percent by thermal plants.    [Brovchenko] Still, do you lean to optimism or pessimism?    [Semenyuk] I think we'll survive the winter.</p>

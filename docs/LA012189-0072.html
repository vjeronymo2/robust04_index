			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STREAM IN FROM 22 STATES, 3 FOREIGN COUNTRIES FOR GALA;  </P> <P> 250 BUSH RELATIVES MAKE PRESENCE FELT  </P> <P> One of George Bush's first acts as President was to pick up his 2-year-old  granddaughter, Marshall, and give her a hug as he entered the inaugural parade  reviewing stand Friday.  </P> <P> Marshall, shoeless in white tights, a dark blue dress with white lace collar  and a white bow in her blond hair, promptly planted a kiss on the cheek of  "Gampy," which is what 10 grandchildren call the new leader of the Free World.  </P> <P> The scene was typical of the easy-going affection that marks the huge Bush  family, whose presence has dominated inaugural activities this week. About 250  children, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, cousins, nieces,  nephews and in-laws streamed in from 22 states and three foreign countries for  the big celebration. They filled up both a local hotel and every guest room in  the White House Friday night.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Comparisons to Reagans  </P> <P> Bush, like his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, has taken the political posture of a  champion of family values, and he highlighted them in his inaugural address.  But unlike the Reagans -- who were estranged from their daughter, Patti Davis,  and seldom saw Michael, or his children -- the Bushes exuberantly surround  themselves with their family. Michael is Reagan's son from his first marriage.  </P> <P> And it is going to stay that way, Barbara Bush said in a CBS-TV interview on  the eve of the inauguration of her husband.  </P> <P> "We will have our children and their friends over and our friends and their  children over," she said. "We've done that every Sunday of our married life and  we're not going to change on that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mother on Hand  </P> <P> Bush's 87-year-old mother, Dorothy, the widow of Sen. Prescott Bush of  Connecticut, was on hand for the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol, along  with the new President's four sons, daughter and other kin.  </P> <P> As he walked onto the inaugural platform, Bush leaned over and kissed his  mother, who has been suffering from a bad back and calcium deterioration in her  bones. She said after her son took the oath that she felt "very exhilarated."  </P> <P> "I loved his remarks," she said.  </P> <P> In his speech, Bush spoke of the need to care for homeless people who are "lost  and roaming," and for children "who have nothing, no love, no normalcy." He  also said that there are "young women to be helped who are about to become  mothers of children they can't care for and might not love." He added that  "they need our care, our guidance and education, though we bless them for  choosing life."  </P> <P> As a clan, the Bushes tend to express their emotions freely, and shortly before  the inauguration, Bush's son, George Jr., said in an NBC-TV interview that he  expected it would "hit hard" when "I see my dad have his hand on the Bible and  his right hand up, with mother holding it, looking out over the mall . . . .  All of us will be restraining ourselves."  </P> <P> Son Neil added, with a laugh, that "we've had a history of teary-eyed"  experiences.  </P> <P> Before moving into the White House, about two dozen members of the immediate  family stayed at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters across  Pennsylvania Avenue.  </P> <P> President Bush said that the family had turned parts of Blair House into a  playpen.  </P> <P> With grandchildren running around, "I wonder that some flying missile will  clean out some plates over there," he said, jokingly.  </P> <P> Amid toys strewn everywhere, Barbara Bush was observed by reporters Thursday  playing "Simon Says" with the grandchildren.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Draws Parallel to Mrs. Truman  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Mrs. Bush said in the CBS interview that she has two goals as First  Lady: "I'd like to make George happy, and I'd like to do my own thing." In that  respect, she said that she would follow the example of Bess Truman, President  Harry S. Truman's wife.  </P> <P> George Jr., Neil and Jeb all have expressed interest in running for office.  </P> <P> George Jr., 42, an oilman from Midland, Tex., ran unsuccessfully for Congress  in 1978 and said that he may run for governor in 1990.  </P> <P> Jeb, 35, resigned his position as secretary of commerce in Florida to work on  his father's presidential campaign. Now he is a real estate developer in Miami.  </P> <P> Neil, 33, is in the oil business in Denver, and Marvin, 32, is an investment  counselor in Alexandria, Va.  </P> <P> The Bushes' only daughter, Dorothy, 29, lives in Maine with her husband,  William LeBlond, and their two children.  </P></p>

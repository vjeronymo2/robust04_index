			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Zheng Guolian (6774 0948 5114), Central </F> People's Broadcast Station reporter Huang Qunwen (7806 5028  2429), and JIEFANGJUN BAO reporter He Delai (0149 1795 0171)]    [Text] At the forefront of flood resistance and disaster  relief in Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong; the central party,  government, and Army joint task force members spoke highly of  the People's Liberation Army [PLA] which has "played a key role  at a crucial time of flood resistance and disaster relief."    Zou Jiahua, member of the CPC Central Committee's Political  Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, led members of the  central party, government, and Army joint task force to inspect  some disaster areas in Guangxi and specially conveyed regards to  officers and men of the PLA, who were fighting floods and  providing disaster relief. He told them: You, soldiers  stationed in Guangxi, are doing your best to actively  participate in flood resistance and disaster relief without  fearing sacrifice. The local government and people appreciate  your efforts very much. Without you soldiers, we would not  possibly make such great achievements in the anti-flood struggle.    Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee's  Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat, led members of  the central party, government, and Army joint task force to  Changsha. After hearing the Hunan Provincial party committee and  government's reports on provincial flood resistance and disaster  relief efforts, Wen Jiabao said: Officers and men of the PLA  and armed police officers and men carry forward the fine  tradition of devoting themselves to the people and appear at  flood-stricken places as soon as possible. The PLA are worthy  of being called the people's own Army.    State Councillor Chen Junsheng led members of the central  party, government, and Army joint task force to visit officers  and men of a certain unit, who have assisted emergencies for  more than 10 days at the Bei Jiang Dike. He said: The PLA  played a key role at a crucial time. The hidden hole on the Bei  Jiang Dike presented an imminent danger. If the PLA had not  come in time to fix it, the consequences would be very serious.    Since serious flooding hit Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan on  8  June, soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in  flood areas have been called out immediately to spare no effort  in fighting floods and offering disaster relief. Leaders at all  levels led their men from the front, made careful arrangements,  and were in command at the forefront of flood resistance and  disaster relief. As a huge flood peak hit the Bei Jiang Dike,  General Li Xilin, commander of the Guanzhou Military Region led  thousands of officers and soldiers in rushing into the danger  zone. They plugged holes in the dike in time and secured the  Bei Jiang Dike that is so vital to the safety of the entire Zhu  Jiang Delta. After Jinman village in Guangxi's Duan county was  submerged by floodwater, engineering corps of the Guangxi  Military District got the order to rescue victims there. They  made a rapid 120 km march to hurry to Jinman village in time and  evacuated more than 3,000 Jinman residents. The 100-meter  Xiangjiang Dike in Changsha's Longwang Lane collapsed on the  morning of 18 June and floodwater seriously threatened the lives  of more than 40,000 residents. Deng Hanmin, political commissar  of the Hunan Military District, led more than 260 soldiers in  quickly fixing the dike by reinforcing it with more than 40,000  sandbags. They finally headed off disaster. With the weather  poor and communication difficult, an Air Force unit took  emergency measures to speedily deliver food to Wuzhou by plane.  Flood victims hailed them excitedly: Long live the PLA!    Carrying forward our Army's spirit in being brave and tough,  fearing no sacrifice, and fighting tenaciously, officers and men  participating in flood resistance and disaster relief have been  fighting floods for 15 days and nights. Their high morale did  not sink a bit. To rescue 460 people besieged by floodwater,  officers and men of a engineering regiment jumped into the water  to safely evacuate them. After having rescued people in several  flooded areas, more than 600 officers and men of a tank brigade  received an order to assist in an emergency in Qingyuan city.  They hurried to the collapsed Huilangzhen Dam and worked  all-out to achieve a heroic deed -- fighting all day to plug the  hole on the third dike and rescuing more than 40,000 people and  their property.    As the masses of cadres and soldiers have been highly  disciplined in their rescue missions, and not encroached on the  interests of the people in the slightest, they have won praise  and support from the people. People of Shijiao town, where the  Bei Jiang Dike is located, hurriedly left their homes when huge  floods approached. As the rescuing troops entered the town,  they found that the doors of many shops and houses were still  open. Cadres and soldiers did not take anything from the open  houses. Quite the opposite, they organized patrol teams to  guard property in the shops and houses day and night. When the  floods receded, people returned and found their homes the same  as before they left and nothing was missing. They were touched  and said: The PLA is the people's good troop!</p>

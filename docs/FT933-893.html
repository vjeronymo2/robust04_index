			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Science schools win funds MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, will publish plans today to channel extra funds to secondary schools specialising in technology, mathematics and science. The 'technology college' prospectus will confirm proposals made in July. Under the scheme, schools which can find sponsors for converting to technology colleges will receive additional funding from the government. Mr Patten's proposals are likely to provoke more disagreements with teachers' unions, although the scheme marks a shift away from the City Technology College initiative in which companies were asked to finance the building of new colleges. A report published today by Dr Richard Margrave of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers says that the 15 CTCs so far built cost the British taxpayer 'an average of Pounds 7,997 per pupil in capital costs alone in the period 1987-93'. Capital spending on the colleges has reached Pounds 150m. Dr Margrave's research also shows that only Pounds 30m, or 20 per cent of the total, was raised from industry. The government had hoped the private sector would account for 'all or a substantial part of the capital costs'. Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the ATL, said today's announcement mark 'the final passing of the old system of incredibly expensive CTC schools'. He added: 'Any new scheme has to address the issue ofimproving science and technology facilities in all schools, not just the chosen few.'</p>

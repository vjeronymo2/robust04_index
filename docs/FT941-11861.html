			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Green space in the Tunisian desert - British Gas was obliged to ensure minimum pollution from new projects in Sfax Tourists seeking a sleepy or swinging Mediterranean resort would be disappointed if they tookthe turning into the southern Tunisian town of Sfax. A stinging smog bathes the industrial city, the result of a steady pall of smoke coming from a nearby phosphate plant. A mountain of gypsum, the waste product from the process, dominates the skyline. It is also the source of pollutants which have leached their way through to the nearby sea to kill much of the local marine life. The casual visitor might think that a new oil derrick or two sticking up above thesprawling town and its hundreds of small metal and furniture workshops and car repair yards would do little to spoil the scenery. Yet local environmental concerns have been one of the strongest influences on British Gas's approach to its second-largest foreign project to date. The need to persuade sceptical Tunisian officials that British Gas's operations in and around Sfax would not create a new source of pollution to rival the phosphate plant was a constant theme during years of negotiations, according to Jack Barnes, the British engineer who oversaw the company's growing involvement in Tunisia from 1989 until his recent retirement. British Gas's presence in Tunisia stems from its purchase in 1988 of the international oil and gas assets of Tenneco, the US company. In 1991,it discovered the Rhemoura oil field which underlies Sfax. Offshore oil finds were made in 1992. The company began development work on the Pounds 500m offshore Miskar gas field south of Sfax late last year, and expects the first Miskar gas to flow in 1995. The company's Pounds 40m investment in oil production in the area is much smaller than the Miskar project, which includes a large land-based processing plant. But the company knew that the way in which it ran its oil operations would indicate to sceptical local officials how it might handle the much larger and more politically sensitive gas field development. Producing oil in urban areas has long been a practice in the US, where 'nodding donkey' pumpingunits can be seen in settings as varied as supermarket car parks and behind false building facades in Hollywood. British Gas engineers studied sites in Texas and Florida to help ensure that the operations in Sfax caused a minimum of disruption. In Sfax, as elsewhere, public concerns centred around possible inconvenience and safety. British Gas held a series of town meetings to explain its proposals. Gaining the support of the regional governor was also a priority, according to Barnes, especially as one of the first exploratory wells was drilled ina field next to his official residence. The long wires needed for seismic testing were laid along streets and alleyways at night and had to be picked upbefore dawn to avoid people who were going to work. 'It was a tedious and cumbersome process,' according to William Lehmann, general manager of oil operations. 'We had to be particularly careful when doing the thumping' that sends the seismic waves into the ground. The complex geologic structure of the latest exploration well now being drilled in Sfax required the use of oil-based mudto lubricate drill bits and to carry rock cuttings back to the surface. There was no local hazardous waste disposal site, so British Gas had to seek itsown solution. The contaminated cuttings are taken to a bio-remediation site the company built south of Sfax, where Joe Frank Dean, a former rodeo cowboy from New Mexico, herds millions of bacteria which eat their way through the toxicparticles. The clean cuttings and nutrient wastes are then tilled into nearby farm land. The process of convincing the Tunisians that British Gas intended to follow the best environmental practices in all its activities extended to arranging visits by leading Tunisian officials to similar British Gas facilities in the UK. The company even looked at ways in which the mountain of gypsum could be used, going so far as to find a second-hand plant in the US which could be shipped over to convert the waste into road aggregate. But a shortage of cash in Tunisia put paid to the scheme. Company officials were determined that no comparisons could be made between the much maligned phosphate plant and its own gas processing facility. A helicopter search of the coast produced a site that promised to be as inconspicuous as possible. The plant, hidden from themain coastal road by a small hill and a belt of olive trees, will occupy only 15 ha of the 69 ha site. It is at the Hannibal processing site, however, that British Gas's environmental strategy came unstuck, although ironically in a way which is unlikely to raise many local concerns. The 'sour' gas fromthe Miskar field contains large amounts of sulphur, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and liquid condensates which require lengthy processing to remove. The extracted sulphur and condensates will be sold separately from the clean gas. But B ritish Gas engineers were stumped when they looked for economic ways in which to dispose of the carbon dioxide, a suspected greenhouse gas. Re-injection of thegas was considered, but there were serious doubts about the technology involvedand worries that the cost would make an already marginal project uneconomic, according to Richard Hart, operations manager. The result is that 1.10m cu m of carbon dioxide - a 'fair amount' concedes Hart - will be released into the atmosphere each day.</p>

He is innocent until proven guilty.  </P> <P> Or isn't he allowed to be sick now and then like the rest of us?  </P> <P> I don't blame him for not talking to you people. You sound more like you are  rooting for him to have a relapse than to stay clean, and I suppose some people  would see a relapse as a "better" story.  </P> <P> MAXINE POPE  </P> <P> Paso Robles  </P></p>

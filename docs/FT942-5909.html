			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Focal point for energy efficiency Sir, As independent directors, we should like to correct two of the points made in your editorial, 'The cost of saving energy' (May 25), on the objectives and organisation of the Energy Saving Trust. You state that the trust is intended to subsidise household improvements such as low-energy light bulbs, efficient boilers and loft and wall insulation. While the trust does plan schemes that involve these measures, our objective is to nurture and stimulate embryonic markets to sustainability so that resultant products and services can replace their more inefficient counterparts. The success of our gas condensing boiler scheme illustrates this principle, with nearly 10,000 applications for a Pounds 200 rebate on the cost of installing this type of boiler received during the scheme's one year pilot. Resulting competition and volume production have already led to a 10 per cent reduction in the average price of such boilers, with several new producers and suppliers entering the market. As with all of our schemes, the level of rebate provided will be reduced progressively as the price differential decreases over time. You also comment that 'the trust lacks the administration to disburse Pounds 300m a year in parcels of several hundred pounds, let alone to identify which households should benefit'. As we explain in our strategic plan, the trust does not intend directly to manage any schemes itself. Instead, it will determine the most effective method of delivering each scheme and then select the appropriate delivery mechanism. Some will operate at a national level, others will be implemented regionally within a national framework, while some will be best run independently and locally. Project implementation will be carried out by the most appropriate external body, either through a contractual agreement with the trust or under the trust's monitoring and evaluation procedures. The trust wishes to be a focal point for energy efficiency work in the UK but has no wish to duplicate expertise already developed over many years. Instead, our intention is to remain a small organisation, dedicated to catalysing new ideas into practical schemes.

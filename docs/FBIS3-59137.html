On a tour of the Gioia del Colle Air Base in the southern  Puglia region, where the Tornado Air Defense Variants will be  based, Fabri said the decision to lease the warplanes from  Britain was "the most logical and economical, the most correct  and advantageous" move to round out Italy's air defense system.    With reference to the Eurofighter 2000, to be built by a  European consortium, Fabri stated, "we absolutely have not  renounced" participation in this program.    Air Force Chief of Staff General Adelchi Pillinini, who  accompanied the defense chief here, along with the commanding  officer of the Third Air Region, General Vincenzo Manca,  discussed the "compatibility" between the Air Force  modernization program and keeping F104 ASA interceptors in  service. "I have no doubt about the possibility of using" the  F104s now flying out of the Gioia del Colle Base "for another 15  years," said the general and affirmed that these warplanes still  have 260,000 flying hours of life left in them. "Around 2010 we  can replace them with the Eurofighter," he added.    Pillinini reported that also under study are the G222  transport planes, still considered fully efficient by the Air  Force, and the Hercules C130s, scheduled for overhauls after 20  years in service in line with a European modernization program.    The defense minister said the reason for the tour here was  to  "check out the conditions of efficiency of this air base with  the view to training for the use of the new interceptors," the  Tornado ADVs.    Now sharing the Gioia del Colle base are the F104s of the  12th squadron and the 156th squadron of Tornado fighter-bombers.</p>

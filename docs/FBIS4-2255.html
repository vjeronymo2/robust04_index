			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News and Press Review" program] </F>   [Text] The 10th anniversary of the promulgation of China's  Patent Law was marked on 1 April. Recently, station reporter  (Song Jian) interviewed Gao Lulin, director of the State Patent  Office, in connection with the success China has achieved since  implementation of the Patent Law nine years ago. Gao Lulin said:    [Begin Gao recording] In 1985 when the Patent Law was first  implemented, the Chinese government accepted approximately  17,000 patent applications. The number of applications  increased every year. In 1993, the Chinese government accepted  over 77,000 patent applications. Some 20 to 25 percent of all  the 300,000 or so patent applications accepted have been  exploited; some exploited patents have yielded very good  economic results. The establishment of the patent (?system) and  the popularization of the patent [word indistinct] have  inevitably given rise to certain disputes over patent  infringement. But China's people's courts and patent offices  have effectively handled these disputes. According to  incomplete statistics, by the end of last year, people's courts  and patent offices had respectively handled 2,000 cases of  patent disputes. Following the revision of the Patent Law and  China's access to and coordination with the international patent  systems, we can say provisions for patent protection as  prescribed in China's Patent Law have basically met the  requirements set by the World Organization for the Protection of  Intellectual Rights as well as by GATT.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Sun Ying (1327 3841) and Correspondent Yang </F> Xianping (2799 7359 1627): "Population Growth Should Be  Controlled To Achieve a Fairly Comfortable Life Ahead of  Schedule"]    [Excerpts] The Beijing Municipal Population and Family  Planning Leading Group held its first meeting following  reshuffles on 19 February. Mayor Li Qiyan serves as the leader,  and Vice Mayors He Luli and Duan Qiang deputy leaders. In his  speech, Li Qiyan emphasized the need to have a full  understanding of the important significance of family planning,  a basic national policy, and the need for the entire party and  entire society to make concerted efforts to strengthen overall  management and win greater achievements.    In carrying out the family planning work in 1993, Beijing  made persistent efforts to emancipate the mind, seek truth from  facts, and pioneer the way forward and fulfilled the annual  population plan and family planning tasks fairly successfully.  Compared with 1992, improvement was achieved in leading  persons' efforts to attach importance to family planning, in all  the family planning cadres' quality and law-enforcement level,  and in the masses' awareness in practicing family planning; and  propaganda and education, grass- roots management, management  according to law, and comprehensive improvement were  strengthened. According to the 1993 statistics of various  districts and counties, among Beijing's permanent residents, the  birth rate declined by 3.43 percent from 1992, and the multiple  birth rate declined by 8.2 percent; and their family planning  rate was 99.76 percent, one-child rate 94.24 percent, and late  childbirth rate 90.42 percent, up 0.01, 0.84, and 0.18  percentage points, respectively.    Li Qiyan pointed out in his speech that Beijing's hard-won  great achievements in family planning last year should be  attributed to the great support provided by central organs and  the army units stationed in Beijing, the great efforts of all  levels and all departments in the municipality, and the hard  work of the comrades in charge of family planning. He said:  Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out that practicing family planning  will help develop socialist productive forces, enhance overall  national strength, and improve living standards. We should  fully understand the important significance of population growth  control in accelerating socialist modernization and achieving a  fairly comfortable life ahead of schedule. While developing the  economy, we should bring population growth under strict control.  Otherwise, the endeavor of achieving a fairly comfortable life  ahead of schedule will be affected. Leaders and the masses have  gained an ever-deeper understanding of this, but they  nevertheless should enhance understanding. Judging from the  current situation, family planning work is still difficult, and  some people still have confused and erroneous ideas. Top party  and government leaders should regard family planning, a basic  national policy, as a major task, intensify investigation and  study, strengthen propaganda, conduct ideological education to  counter problems, clarify confused ideas, and remove the  ideological obstacles to family planning. [passage omitted]    Li Qiyan emphasized the need to achieve success in managing  the family planning of transients and the people with permanent  residence registered in Beijing who work in other localities.  He pointed out: This work is the weak link. We should  strengthen management and never turn Beijing into the base area  for "multiple birth guerrilla forces." He urged: All family  planning departments should report family planning work and  problems to major party and government leaders on a regular  basis. The municipal family planning commission should  summarize the situation continuously and give reports to the  municipal party committee and government. All departments  should conscientiously implement the responsibility system and  make sure that arrangements for family planning are made, work  is divided and inspected, rewards and punishments are meted out,  and criticisms and commendation conducted.

With more than 20 percent of ballots counted from  Monday's [28 March] votes for a new assembly, government  ministers had good backing and Museveni supporters fared  particularly well in south and southwest. President Museveni  did not stand for any of the 214 seats in a new Constituent  Assembly.    The commissioner of elections, Mr. Stephen Akabwai, said  voting was continuing yesterday in Iganga and Kabarole  Districts, the only ones which failed to complete polling on  Monday out of 39 across the country. He said there were no  major problems in the other areas and voting went on safely,  adding that he expected results for more than half of the  country to be compiled by yesterday evening and a complete list  by today.    Nominators said President Museveni's supporters did  unexpectedly well in the east, traditionally a stronghold of the  opposition.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Steelmakers angered as EU approves state aid Europe's big steelmakers reacted angrily last night when the European Union cleared the way for restructuring its ailing steel industry after more than a year of often bitter wrangling over state subsidies. Industry ministers unanimously approved a series of state aids for public sector steel producers in eastern Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal worth nearly Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.33bn) and involving more than 5m tonnes of capacity reductions. The deal is the most far-reaching attempt by the Union to resolve the deep-seated problems of Europe's steel industry since the restructuring carried out under the Davignon plan of the early 1980s. Without agreement on state subsidies, the entire industry faced sliding into further heavy losses next year. The European Commission and the Belgian presidency of the EU said it was now up to non-aided steel producers to carry out their side of the bargain and cut production by almost 25m tonnes, easing problems of overcapacity. But the deal was immediately criticised by these unsubsidised private sector producers, raising the possibility that they will be reluctant to offer their own capacity cuts. 'This is a compromise, driven by political expedience,' said British Steel. Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German Steel Federation, called it 'pure window dressing for the gullible' and predicted dire consequences for Germany's private steelmakers. The ministers issued a strong political declaration renouncing further state subsidies for the companies involved. Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, said: 'The importance of today's agreement is exactly that it is a road without a return.' Mr Savona had been accused by the Commission and the Belgian presidency of blocking an overall deal on state subsidies at the November meeting of industry ministers. But the agreement on restructuring Ilva, the state-owned Italian producer, was reached without detailed discussion yesterday. Mr Tim Sainsbury, British industry minister, also had to abandon UK resistance to the restructuring of Ekostahl, the east German producer. But Britain and Denmark won commitments that Riva, the private Italian company planning to buy Ekostahl, would limit new capacity to 900,000 tonnes over the next five years, and 'significantly below 2m tonnes' up to 2004. Mr Sainsbury also stressed that most of the restructuring packages would involve an element of privatisation which, he said, would lead to 'much fairer trading for steel in the Community'. Yesterday's agreement is subject to formal parliamentary scrutiny in Denmark and Britain. The Commission has already won agreement from ministers for other elements of its rescue plan: Ecu240m of financial support to ease the pain of more than 50,000 redundancies; monitoring of the steel market; and safeguards to limit cheap imports of steel from central and eastern Europe.

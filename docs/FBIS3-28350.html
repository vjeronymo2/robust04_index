			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Three top Japanese  contractors have pledged to the Construction Ministry that they  will not engage in illegal bid-rigging for public works  contracts, construction industry sources said Thursday [3  February].    The presidents of Kajima Corp., Taisei Corp. and Shimizu  Corp. gave the pledge to the ministry by the end of January, the  sources said.    The three leading contractors have also started personnel  changes as part of their efforts to prove their commitment to  the pledge, the sources said.    A series of recent bribery scandals involving the nation's  construction industry has led to the arrest of a number of  senior executives of building firms, including former Kajima  Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama.    Kiyoyama, who was indicted on charges of giving a 20 million  yen bribe to former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi, was reportedly  at the center of collusive bidding involving major contractors.    On January 25, Taisei decided at a meeting of its executive  board to transfer Kanji Hayama from the post of sales manager to  a position in charge of technology. The sources said Taisei's  sales manager was previously often involved in dealing with  other companies about price-fixing arrangements.    Shimizu, meanwhile, decided on January 28 on large-scale  personnel changes and organizational reform for strengthening  its inspection system, while Kajima is expected to decide  personnel changes by the middle of this month, the sources said.    The moves come as the Construction Ministry plans to  introduce a new open bidding system for public works projects in  April.</p>

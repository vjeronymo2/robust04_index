			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Getting to know all about you: President Clinton outlines his views on trade, world growth, unemployment and the US budget deficit to Jurek Martin All the usual cliches could apply to Bill Clinton's raid on Tokyo next week with the intent of breathing a little life into the 19th summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations. But this president of the US is not world weary. Uncrossing his long legs and leaning forward in his arm chair in the Oval Office yesterday morning, he makes, as a less fortunate previous president used to, some things perfectly clear. 'The tone, the atmosphere, the ideas that are discussed may be far more important than what comes out of the communique,' he says. There can and will be no question of a lack of US leadership. 'Our job is to lead,' he announced with perfect conviction. 'I think it is difficult to do this when you've got problems of your own, but there's a tidal wave of global change going on. 'Look at the resources we have. We have innovative workforces; we have great bases of technology; we have an understanding of how the world works economically. I think we have within our power the means to move forward and break out of this problem we're in. But only if you have the courage to keep changing it. 'If nothing else, if we can agree to take an expansive view of our future and to take account of our strengths', then the G7 process will continue to serve a purpose. He was responding to a series of questions from journalists from each of the other G7 nations, of which the FT was the UK newspaper representative. Most of them reflected the general prognostications that the auguries for Tokyo and the US role are, at best, mixed. It will be his first summit 'test of leadership', only his second foreign foray, after the Vancouver session with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia early in April. Cuts in German interest rates, a Japanese stimulus package and progress in reducing the US budget deficit may be beneficial to world growth, but the overall economic prospect, especially for unemployment, remains gloomy. For the fourth consecutive annual conclave, political agreement on the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations seems yet again elusive, with this week's French steel-targeted Exocet making Balladur the new seriously dirty word in the upper echelons of the US administration. Grand American plans for Russian privatisation have been scaled back by other G7 reservations before being presented to Mr Yeltsin on Friday. Bosnia remains a source of deep division and heartache, while Japan, in effect without a government pending elections, is currently less amenable to a new approach to bilateral frictions. Another debacle like last year's summit in Munich could, perhaps even should, mean the end of the G7 process as currently practised. Still, as the corny joke doing the rounds in Washington goes, 'at least Bill Clinton is going to be the only head of government in Tokyo with a popularity rating higher than the prime rate.' This may be unfair to Kim Campbell, the new Canadian prime minister, and it disguises the fact that Mr Clinton himself still has, last weekend's raid on Baghdad notwithstanding, the lowest popular approval of any president at this stage of a first term. But greater expectations still attach to him in Tokyo than to the tired or weak veterans, Messrs Mitterrand, Kohl and Major. As Bob Hormats, the first US 'sherpa' put it this week, summits are all about 'the US will to lead', and never more than this one. At 10.45 yesterday morning, in the Oval Office, Mr Clinton seemed unfazed by all this. He was, naturally, running on Clinton Standard Time - an hour late  -but he had warmed up earlier by giving a press conference on US military base closures at home and overseas. Earlier in the week this notorious night person had noted that though he rose each morning at 6.00 he could take no responsibility for anything that came out of his mouth before 9.15. His face was ruddy, his suit was grey, his shirt white and he was wearing a cheerful, colourful tie from the Save the Children Fund. There were no aides around to correct him or for reference. This was Mr Clinton at his most eclectic and missionary, with more than a touch of diplomacy. Yes, it was important that the G7 leaders give a decisive push to completion of the Uruguay round of trade negotiations, but he would not be drawn into speculation about the consequences of failure. The G7, he said, was obviously pivotal on the trade front but there were lots of other nations with a huge stake in the outcome. He implied that the optimal result, from his vantage point, was that the summit should 'increase the chances' that the Uruguay round be successfully completed by the end of the year. He was proud that the US was finally doing its bit to contribute to global growth by cutting its own budget deficit, as, he noted, 'every other nation has been demanding of us at every summit for years'. But the important recognition was that 'we are a global economy'. 'The US deficit causes imbalance in the global economy. By bringing down the deficit, and with interest rates coming down, I can get a little bit of growth here by what we do. But in the end this will only work if Japan has growth, if Europe recovers, and if what we do in the G7 is complementary. This is why the G7 can make a difference.' The main problem, he said dismissively, is that 'we're hung up on getting every little word right in the communique'. Policy 'wonk' that he is known to be, he expressed genuine enthusiasm for getting stuck into the micro-economic and structural problems afflicting all nations, especially over unemployment, citing both Japan's and France's current but different difficulties in creating new jobs. He wanted all this to be studied 'informally' in Tokyo and 'thoroughly' thereafter. 'There should be enough time for serious discussion among the leaders without a lot of bureaucratic rules and regulations.' Though he was far too diplomatic to say so in the presence of a senior Japanese journalist who had flown in from Tokyo for the occasion, other members of his administration, remembering Munich, have said openly that there should be a minimum of photo opportunities and a maximum of talk. Mr Clinton did, however, express interest, his secret service permitting, in sneaking off for a quiet meal in some modest Japanese restaurant. That other capital of gastronomy, France, has profoundly irritated the US this week on the trade front. Pressed on this, Mr Clinton drew some careful and diplomatic distinctions. 'If the US was wrong in fact' on the steel-dumping case this was a proper subject for discussion. But there was no question that US law was 'clearly Gatt-consistent', contrary to the allegations of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. Gatt rules, he noted, 'say that every country - including France - can act in its own interest if the international trading system breaks down'. 'If France wants to propose stronger multilateral (enforcement) mechanisms than in the Gatt, I would be happy to consider them.' Mr Clinton was also emollient towards Japan, at least in the general sense. He viewed - and he hoped the Japanese people shared his view - that the current turmoil in Japanese politics should be seen 'with excitement and interest, not with tenuous concern. It is a positive thing for a great democracy.' He ventured no speculation as to who would emerge next on top of the Tokyo political heap, but was confident that it posed no threat to ties with the US. 'In many, many ways, it is our most significant bilateral relationship and the key to what happens between the US and Asia.' Europe, equally, was to be reassured about the US commitment. Disagreements over Bosnia, Mr Clinton said, had indeed been a headache. Germany agreed with the US on the arming of the Bosnians, but Britain, France and Russia did not. He remained convinced that his approach was right. But this divergence constituted 'no reason for the US to give up on Nato or the Atlantic alliance'. The president even carefully avoided an opportunity to criticise the Bundesbank for being too slow in cutting interest rates, though he did praise the latest reduction. 'I recognise that all nations which have independent central banks are very sensitive to internal political criticism  -and even more so to external political criticism.' He merely said the US needed an economically healthy Europe, not least as a market for US goods, and that, as a result, 'the condition of the German economy is very critical for all Americans'. He also preferred to cast the cause of aiding Russia more as an example of US leadership than as evidence of disagreement among the leading industrialised powers. 'The major crisis of democracy in Russia,' he said, 'is the big issue we are facing and we have done it very well', through US programmes and now new loans from the International Monetary Fund, approved this week. Similar confidence was applied to another grand project which, though not on the G7 agenda, found itself in renewed trouble this week, the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. He described Wednesday's legal ruling requiring the US to come up with an environmental impact statement before presenting the agreement for congressional ratification as 'narrow'. He believed 'we can win the appeal within the time limit' (mid-December) and might even be able to address specific environmental concerns within the next few months. Without Nafta, 'it is not easy to articulate the jobs argument', making attacks on it by the likes of Ross Perot 'superficially' appealing. But he had no doubt that the economic benefits to both the US and Mexico would soon become apparent and it would pass Congress, even though he conceded that in the House, but not the Senate, 'the voters are not there today'. He added, 'we must tell Congress the consequences of not passing Nafta - it means more illegal immigration, fewer jobs here, and a much poorer Mexican economy'. As he warmed to his task throughout the interview, you could see why Mr Clinton often runs late. Each question received careful attention and a lengthy considered reply, a harbinger for what is going to take place in Tokyo next week. Only once did he even half-acknowledge that the G7 might be experiencing a leadership crisis and for that, too, he had an answer. 'I've only been president five months and there are new governments in France, Canada and Italy. A lot of us folks, we don't all know each other.'</p>

As for the numerical  targets, the policy proposal criticized it as "something that  promotes government-led managed trade." The policy proposal  warned that if Japan accepts numerical targets, it would bring  economic and political losses to Japan.    The policy proposal pointed out that "if the Japanese  Government leads efforts to increase Japan's imports, Japan  would face unreasonable trade demands from the United States. If  Japan failed to meet the numerical targets, it would run into  U.S. sanctions." The policy proposal also pointed out: "If Japan  rejects the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets, it would  be highly praised for protecting free trade, an asset of the  entire world."    Meanwhile, the policy proposal stressed that the Japanese  Government should expand opportunities for foreign access to the  Japanese market, and address price differentials between Japan  and other nations by relaxing bureaucratic regulations and  rigorously enforcing the Antimonopoly Law. The policy proposal  also urged the Japanese Government to work out plans for their  promotion and announce the plans at home and abroad.</p>

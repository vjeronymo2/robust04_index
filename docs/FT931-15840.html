			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Speculative effects of Anglo-American capitalism AN EMERGING US recovery, alongside deepening difficulties in Germany and Japan, does not make this a particularly good time to trumpet the merits of German or Japanese-style co-operative capitalism over the more deal-hungry Anglo-Saxon variant. But the relatively dismal performances of the US and UK economies over the last decade should prevent policymakers in these countries from feeling smug simply because business cycles are currently out of line. The commonly cited criticism of Anglo-Saxon economic practices is financial short-termism. US and UK companies, the conventional wisdom goes, are hampered by banks who have no stake in their long-term success and will not lend other than for short-term projects. But differences in financial practices tend to reflect deeper variations in the structure of corporate ownership and control across countries, according to Mr Colin Mayer, now at Warwick University, and Mr Julian Franks of the London Business School. Franks and Mayer describe two models of corporate governance. In the outsider system the takeover threat is the main discipline on incumbent managers. The insider system relies, instead, on internal, committee-style supervision of management decisions. The outsider system is characterised by a large number of listed companies, whose shares are frequently traded in a liquid stock market and in which there are few intercorporate equity holdings. The insider system, by contrast, has fewer companies which are vulnerable to takeovers, and a web of cross-shareholdings, so that incumbent managers tend to have considerable discretion. Japan, Germany and France fit the insider model. Relative to the US and UK, they all have a strikingly small number of companies whose equity is publicly quoted and traded on the stock exchange and thus vulnerable to takeover. The UK had a little under three times as many quoted companies as Germany in 1991 and twice as many takeovers in the 1980s. Within the listed companies, there is much greater concentration of ownership in the insider economies. Of Germany's listed companies, 85 per cent had a single shareholder who controlled more than 25 per cent of the stock in 1990 compared with only 16 per cent of the top 200 listed UK companies. Of these same UK companies, 77 per cent had a largest shareholder with no more than 10 per cent of the total equity. Company shareholder profiles in the insider economies are also markedly different from the Anglo-Saxon economies, as the chart illustrates. German companies held 42 per cent of the total equity of quoted Germany companies in 1990, while banks accounted for a relatively modest 6 per cent. In the UK, companies held only 10 per cent of total equity while the majority of shares were held by non-bank financial institutions and private individuals. The Anglo-American outsider system, Franks and Mayer argue rather charitably, is best suited to corporate activities which involve subjective assessments of future prospects and in which takeovers are motivated by disagreements over corporate strategy. True, studies tend to find little or no relationship between past company performance and hostile takeovers. But nearly 80 per cent of executive directors either resign or are dismissed within two years of a successful hostile bid. The continental insider system, by contrast, may be better suited to activities in which there is a direct need to control quality of product, management and employees. Performance tends to be monitored by a committee or supervisory board including workers, bankers and experts from related companies who have a direct stake in the company's future. So while Anglo-American companies dominate speculative fields such as oil exploration, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, in manufacturing it is Japanese and Germany companies that still lead the world.

Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA. Retail sales volume: data from national government sources except Japan and Italy (value series deflated by OECD using CPI). Refers to total retail sales except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department stores only). Industrial production: data from national government sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US - help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies. Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series, cyclical fluctuations in which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in general economic activity.</p>

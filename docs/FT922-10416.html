			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Hammond posted to East Midlands John Hammond, sales director of The Post Office, is taking time off from selling parcels to promote the 'unsung' merits of the East Midlands. Hammond, 54, is taking two years' secondment to become the chief executive of East Midlands Enterprise and of its governing body, the East Midlands Investment Campaign. East Midlands Enterprise (EME) has been launched by the East Midlands Confederation of British Industry and local authorities in the area to encourage inward investment. Hammond, who will leave behind his chauffeur-driven car, has a sound track record in selling; 25 years in sales and marketing with Unilever and SmithKline Beecham before joining The Post Office as sales director in 1984. He says the technique for selling soap powder, toothpaste and the Post Office are the same; 'You have to communicate with people.' He admits he was frustrated in the public sector for a number of reasons, including the slowness of decision-making. Keen to demonstrate his entrepreneurial skills, he says he already has a clear business plan for the region and a 'unique and creative promotional plan'. Recent inward investors to the region include Toyota, the Japanese car manufacturer.</p>

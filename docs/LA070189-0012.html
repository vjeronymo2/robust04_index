			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER POLICE KILLING OF MAN MISTAKEN FOR SUSPECT  </P> <P> It's very disturbing to me that a sheriff's deputy is back on patrol after  killing an innocent man ("Victim's Family Blasts Sheriff's Probe of Killing,"  Metro, June 18). Deputy Patrick Maxwell was cleared of wrongdoing because he  believed his life was in danger. Marcus Donel (the victim) made a fatal  suspicious move. Maybe Donel thought his life was in danger, which now turns  out to be true.  </P> <P> Police officers jump to the defense of Maxwell saying he is now the victim.  Maxwell will have to live with his mistake for the rest of his life. However,  Marcus Donel will not be able to live with Maxwell's mistake, and what, if  anything, is going to be done about that?  </P> <P> JOHN BEAUCHAMP  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

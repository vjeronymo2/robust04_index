			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Investment bonds Could you clarify the following points about single premium investment bonds? 1. In calculating the gain referred-to in section 547(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, can the cost of a bond be increased in accordance with the retail prices index (ie, in the way that the cost of an asset subject to capital gains tax may be increased)? 2. Is the tax due subject to 'top-slicing' relief and is what I say in (a) and (b) below correct? For example, suppose that in 1992-93 John Smith cashed a bond he had held for 17 policy years and realised a profit of Pounds 17,000. Apart from this Pounds 17,000, he had taxable income of Pounds 15,000. (a) With top-slicing relief, his taxable income would be increased by Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 16,000; thus, he would pay no tax on the profit of Pounds 17,000. (b) Without top-slicing relief, his taxable income would be increased to Pounds 32,000. He would then pay tax at 15 per cent on Pounds 8,300 of this (viz, Pounds 1,245). 3. What precisely is meant by indexation losses? 1. No. 2. Yes, for the purpose of giving relief from the 15 per cent surcharge for potential higher-rate taxpayers, but not for relief from the 12 1/2 per cent age surcharge for basic-rate taxpayers over 64 (at the beginning of the tax year); and, yes, your example is right. 3. If an asset within the scope of CGT (and not specifically denied the benefit of indexation relief) was sold before Budget day for the same amount as it cost originally (after April 5 1982), there will be an allowable loss equal to indexation relief on the cost for the period of ownership: such an allowable loss is generally called an indexation loss (ie, a loss which simply represents indexation relief). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

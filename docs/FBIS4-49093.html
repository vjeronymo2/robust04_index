			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 26 (CNS) -- Statistics collected  from economic and trade departments in China show that  investment made by Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas groups and  companies in the Mainland has tended to increase with a rise in  foreign investment in the country during the first quarter of  this year.    Tianjin Municipality saw foreign investment valued at US$120  million in place in the first quarter of this year or 120  percent up over the same period last year while Guangzhou  Municipality registered foreign capital valued at US$489 million  or 80.8 percent. Foreign investment in Beijing, Shanghai and  Fuzhou showed various gains.    Foreign investment tended to have an increasing share in  newly approved joint-ventured enterprises and items while some  consortia and leading companies tried to have a  more-than-50-percent share in their investment in enterprises  and items in a bid to grab the decision-making or dominant power.    Solely foreign-funded enterprises, meanwhile, are increasing  with 85 out of 194 foreign-funded enterprises newly registered  last month in Shenzhen being of such kind.    There were 637 foreign-funded enterprises newly approved  between last January and March in Beijing and 554 such  enterprises in Tianjin, with each city having pledged foreign  investment of over US$1 billion. The utilization of contracted  foreign capital indicated a gain with US$1.945 billion in  Shanghai and US$3.384 billion in Guangzhou.    Tertiary industry has become a popular sector for foreign  investment with a rebound in investment in real estate. There  were 161 items of tertiary industry invested by foreign  businessmen in Shanghai during the first quarter of this year.  The pledged foreign capital introduced for these items was put  at over US$1 billion, making up 60 percent of the gross foreign  capital.    Tianjin saw 35 foreign-related real estate items signed  during the first quarter with pledged investment valued at  US$170 million. Some overseas groups including the Hong Kong Lai  Sun Group entered the real estate market in Shanghai while the  Beijing branch of L &amp; D Limited was very busy with real  estate  items.    As small- and medium-sized items tended to integrate into  one  another, the number of main consortia, items invested and the  value involved in investment were both on the rise. Some 11  internationally known companies including the McDonald's  Restaurants of the United States and Sony of Japan made  investment in Shanghai while some 30 multinational companies  such as General Motors of U.S., the ABC company of Switzerland  and Siemens Ag. of Germany are now holding negotiations on items  for investment or on the establishment of headquarters in China.    In Guangzhou there are consortia and companies from 19  countries and regions competing with one another for investment.  Contracted foreign investment signed with seven countries and  regions including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao and the United States  was valued at over US$20 million on average. By the end of last  March, ten out of 42 top wealthy ethnic Chinese figures around  the world who have invested in Fuzhou, Shanghai, Hong Kong and  Russia joined forces recently to set up a military-turned-civil  high technology industry base in Pudong New Zone.    There are to date some 5,000 branches of Hong Kong, Taiwan  and overseas companies and groups set up in Beijing and high  grade office buildings are in great demand for foreign  investors. Branches of Hong Kong companies running in Guangzhou  no longer dominate the municipality while the United States and  Japan and Germany are setting up branches there at a rapid pace.    Foreign investors tended to make use of their profits for  reinvestment into their invested items while some of them have  even increased their investment to a great extent. Tianjin saw  26 foreign-funded enterprises have their investment rise by  US$77.05 million during the first quarter of this year.    Medium- and long-term investment is growing with an eye on  long- term economic results instead of short-term investment.    Siemens, AG. is scheduled to set up 20 to 30 joint-ventured  enterprises in the Mainland in the coming two years with total  investment valued at US$500 million. Yaohan of Japan plans to  open 1,000 supermarkets by the year 2010 while New World of Hong  Kong will make investment totalling HK$30 billion in the  Mainland. A projection said that 1994 would be a boom year when  foreign investment in the Mainland would grow more and more.</p>

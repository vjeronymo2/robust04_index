			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source in the Yemeni Reform Grouping  has expressed denunciation and condemnation of the grotesque  crimes perpetrated by the secessionists in the Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP] and their use of internationally banned missiles  which they directed at heavily populated residential areas  inhabited by unarmed citizens. The latest of these missile is  the one fired at Sanaa area on Wednesday which killed 23 martyrs  and injured 30 others.    The source added that this heinous crime demonstrates the  sick minds of the YSP secessionists, the continuing bloody  policy by which they have been known throughout their rule, and  the oppression of our brothers in the southern and eastern  governorates. This suicidal action demonstrates the level of  despair of the YSP secessionists and their state of collapse.    Concluding its statement, the source said that such criminal  acts, which are not justified by any religious, conventional, or  moral standard, cannot pass unpunished. We appeal to all  citizens to keep calm and not to worry as a result of these  actions, despite their ugliness. We ask citizens to make these  actions a motive for further cohesion and unity among all. We  pray to God to steer the country and Yemeni people everywhere  away from harm and afflictions and to have mercy on the souls of  the martyrs and speed the recovery of the injured.    God is our supporter.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 16 Apr (INA) -- AL-'IRAQ has stressed that  after the shooting down of two of its own helicopters in  northern Iraq, the United States has begun to reap the fruits of  its erroneous policy and flagrant and rejected interference in  Iraq's domestic affairs in cooperation with its allies.    In an article published today, the newspaper says that this  incident in northern Iraq, where foreign troops are deployed in  an illegitimate and illegal manner without any logical or legal  justification, means that the situation prevailing in that area  is one of confusion, lawlessness, and disorder, especially in  light of the absence of a central authority capable of halting  the security deterioration or curbing the dangerous phenomena  there.    The paper adds that if wrong premises lead to wrong  conclusions, then any fair analyst must now be aware of the size  of the crime that the United States has committed against our  people in the autonomous region when it embraced the gangs and  highway robbers there and sponsored their subversive activities  against innocent citizens, thus depriving them of any sense of  security, stability, and dignity.    AL-'IRAQ explains that in light of the unstable situation in  the northern areas where foreign troops are deployed or  controlled by agents and mercenaries, it is important to  emphasize that circumstances of this kind must lead to many  mistakes of the kind which led to the downing of two U.S.  helicopters by U.S. warplanes.    Concluding its article, the paper says that the U.S.  attempts  to exploit the situation in the autonomous region to implement  both overt and covert schemes against our homeland and  people--both Arabs and Kurds--through employing agents and  mercenaries to use them as pawns in its conspiratorial game will  lead to other woes, for as you sow, so will you reap.</p>

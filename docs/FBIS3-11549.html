Despite the results, "is it a step forward in the  consolidation of democracy. The political participation of  those who were in the mountains is an example for the world,"  the chief of state added.    "The mere fact that they held elections without a war is a  great step forward," the president told reporters at the  presidential palace.    Alfonso Cabrera, secretary general of Guatemalan Christian  Democracy [DCG], told ACAN that the elections represent one  achievement of current President Alfredo Cristiani in the  triumph of democracy.    "Now it is the political parties' responsibility to ensure  the welfare of the people and to consolidate democracy," the  political leader said. Cabrera believes ARENA will win if there  is a runoff election.    Sidney Shaw, leader of the Union of the National Center,  told  ACAN that his party is pleased that 50 percent of the people  voted and that this is a sure path toward peace.    "The sad thing is that we are still at war in Guatemala, but  hopefully in the next elections (1995) we will have the  guerrillas registered as a political party," he stated.    Shaw said that if there is a runoff election in El Salvador,  there is a possibility that the leftist coalition headed by the  Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) may win,  because the DCG could offer to support it.    He noted, however, that ARENA is strong and might obtain  favorable results.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of Locating in North America (2): Investment is easier - Canada CANADIANS are more receptive to foreign investors now than they have been for many years. With the economy in the doldrums, any company offering new jobs, especially in manufacturing, can expect a warm welcome. Most curbs on foreign investment have been relaxed, except for a handful of politically sensitive areas, such as cultural industries and airlines. Only a small proportion of acquisitions and greenfields projects still requires screening by Investment Canada, the government's foreign-investment watchdog. Energy, financial services and pharmaceuticals are among the sectors where access for foreign companies is easier now than it has been at any time in the past two decades. Furthermore, federal and provincial incentives are plentiful, ranging from outright grants and interest-free loans, to worker-training assistance. These carrots are not proving juicy enough, however. Ironically, while many Canadians have been warming to foreign business, the view of Canada among investors has grown distinctly chilly. Ms Maureen Farrow, chief economist at Coopers &amp; Lybrand's office in Toronto, observes that 'we're not the natural for investment which we used to be, and we're not really making it easy for ourselves'. Ms Farrow groups the complaints in two main categories: the cost of doing business in Canada, and the public policy environment. High taxes are a particular concern. According to a recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report, the proportion of taxes to GDP in Canada has climbed from 34.5 per cent in 1989 to 37.1 per cent in 1990 and 39.4 per cent last year. By contrast, the US has a tax burden of just under 30 per cent. With governments at all levels facing a severe budget squeeze, there is little scope to bring down taxes and other levies until the economy improves. The business community is also upset with the policies of social-democratic governments in Ontario and British Columbia, two of Canada's most industrialised provinces. As Ms Farrow puts it, politicians in Ontario 'are not completely anti-business, but there's a perception in the marketplace that they're working to increase the costs of doing business here, rather than to decrease it'. For example, business people point to stricter environmental reviews (and thus longer delays in getting new projects off the ground), and the widening scope of 'employment equity' rules, which require employers to pay greater attention to the needs of visible-minority and disabled employees. Employers in Ontario are currently waging a vociferous campaign against a proposed new labour law which would, among other things, severely limit the ability of strikebound companies to hire replacement workers. On the other hand, Quebec is aggressively wooing investors with an industrial strategy focused on 13 'clusters' in which the francophone province believes it has the best chance of being competitive in world markets. Five sectors - aerospace, pharmaceuticals, information technology products, power generating equipment and metal processing - are already well established there. Rolls-Royce, the UK engine-maker, recently unveiled a CDollars 140m (Dollars 113.80m) venture to produce an industrial version of its Trent 800 turbofan aero engine near Montreal. The company has been helped by a CDollars 17m interest-free loan from the federal and provincial governments and by investment tax credits. Rolls-Royce's decision is evidence that, for many companies, the present drawbacks of locating in Canada are still outweighed by advantages. Besides government assistance, investors continue to be drawn by Canada's rich natural resources, its highly-educated and reliable workforce, the high disposable income of consumers, and by the pleasant lifestyle for expatriate managers. Pharmaceutical companies such as Glaxo and Merck Frosst have substantially expanded their research and development facilities in Canada, as the federal government has improved patent protection for brand-name medicines. Canada has always touted its proximity to the big US market as a drawcard for investors. The 1989 free trade pact with the US and the recently-negotiated North American free trade agreement with Mexico have added an important new dimension to this argument. Lower trade barriers mean that investors thinking of locating in Canada would be foolish not to look beyond the domestic market. As the Conference Board of Canada noted in a recent study, US subsidiaries can no longer justify their presence in Canada simply on the basis of domestic sales. The Canadian offshoots must now 'carve out and justify their existence as an integral component of the company,' the Conference Board said. The 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement, coupled with the recent recession, have already exerted strong pressure on business, workers and government to improve Canada's competitiveness - and thus its attraction to foreign investors. Canada now has the lowest inflation rate - just above 1 per cent - among leading industrial countries. Wage increases have slowed dramatically in the past two years, and companies are becoming increasingly outspoken in their criticism of unhelpful government policies. Policymakers are gradually coming to grips with some of the thorniest issues affecting the long-term business climate. These include increasingly close scrutiny of the much-maligned education and unemployment insurance systems, and of hard-pressed workmen's compensation and health care services. But it is still too early to tell whether, when and to what extent business's concerns will be addressed through tangible reforms.</p>

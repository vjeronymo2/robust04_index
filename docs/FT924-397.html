			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Letter From Tokyo: 'Tis the season to be thrifty - In Japan, extravagance is a ghost of Christmas past A Japanese Christmas, not constrained by a Christian spiritual tradition, lends itself to an annual redesign in much the same way as a car fender or a skirt hem. What was fashionable last year now seems gawky and out-of-place, and what is fashionable this year may have a shelf life of just one season. Last year, Christmas Eve was supposed to be spent with that special person in a four-star hotel on the fringe of Yokohama harbour. The couple had already dined Italian, hired a karaoke room and gently sung Jingle Bells to each other, while he had temporarily secured the relationship by presenting her with a Tiffany pendant. It was good, solid consumerism of the kind that justified the immense corporate expense of turning Christmas Eve into the Most Romantic Night of the year. But it was also the last hurrah of the 'bubble' era, when stock prices defied gravity as easily as Santa's sleigh, and even the average office worker had the financial confidence to insist on a suite at a mountainside chalet in the quest for a white Christmas. This year, chalets are definitely out. For those who insist on mountains, tonight should be spent in a tent. Instead of desperate young men climbing over each other to buy a Tiffany pendant, the US company's outlet in the Ginza is now as sedate as jewellery stores in other countries. The emphasis is on economy; there are few takers for the Y530,000 (Pounds 2,804) diamond-encrusted platinum heart - as an idle sales assistant explained: 'The bubble has burst.' Japanese youth magazines, quick to spot and dump a trend, have dubbed this the 'hand-made' or 'have at home' Christmas. The truly romantic man will have decked his small hall with tinsel, hidden his more lurid comic books, and prepared a hearty stew which will be shared with the special friend. Making Noel noodles by hand is 'in', as is a budget-priced box of Belgian chocolates. Having developed Christmas as a consumer festival in addition to the country's traditional new year rites, Japanese and international companies have discovered that this year's 'no-name', 'few frills' theme is inflicting serious damage on meticulously cultivated images. Much of that damage is blamed on the thriving discount shops which are doing the unthinkable - they are discounting famous brands. A whopping 35 per cent off Prada of Milan handbags, 20 per cent off Ralph Lauren accessories, and 15 per cent and more off Chanel products. Discounting during the new year sales season would have been frowned on, but this is heavy discounting during the rush period. Rolex watches that were Y2.35m can be bought for Y1.4m at Minax, a Tokyo bargain house, while the price of a Versace windcheater has been reduced by 72 per cent - but only during Christmas. In the past, Japanese shoppers had to travel to Hong Kong to buy such brands at such prices, but the opening of new supply routes and a glut of famous brand goods during a recession have changed all that. Brand-consciousness may be permanently altered. Thankfully, Santa Claus is emerging from this commercial fray with his image untarnished. There are a few Santas in Japanese stores, and they are generally employed to sell things. But they are still venerable figures, and regarded more as a source of wisdom than as a receptacle for children's wish-lists. Mr Munehiro Soshi, trained as a tax accountant, is such a Santa. Mr Soshi, 24 and a modest 78kg, sells gourmet ice-cream at a Yokohama department store and, along with other prestige products, his sales have suffered. But he knows that being Santa is more than just selling ice-cream, and he answers questions from curious parents and children about the correct way to conduct Christmas. What colour is a real Christmas cake? What language does Santa speak? 'Some people tell me that Santa Claus is supposed to answer in English, but then I can't speak English and I'm not sure if they would understand,' he explained. Along with most Japanese, Mr Soshi will be working on Christmas Day, which imposes its own time limit on Christmas Eve festivities. It means that workers will have to take down that mountainside tent early tomorrow morning if they intend to be in the office by 10am. Even a Christmas at home poses problems for the flat-dwelling Tokyo reveller determined to follow the advice of magazine columnists by inviting a few friends over for a fancy dress party. To ensure a fun-filled evening, the magazines describe the sometimes complex rules of party games which force the most inhibited guests to mix. They also provide long menus of post-bubble Christmas cuisine. What the magazines don't provide is the space in which to have a party - in Japan, a Christmas knees-up means somebody else's knee in your bowl of noodles.</p>

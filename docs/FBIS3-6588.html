			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Chong-yon: </F> "U.S. View on North Korea"]    [Text] Since the working-level contact between the North  and South Korea held in Panmunjom on 19 March for the exchange  of special envoys was ruptured due to the North Korean side's  rejection of negotiations, the call for hardline measures  against North Korea which prevailed within the United States  after the nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] has become more fierce. Since the assessment was  put forward last week noting that the result of the IAEA's  nuclear inspection of North Korea is not satisfactory, an  alarming [simsangchi anta] and heated atmosphere began to take  place within the United States.    In particular, as the IAEA notified the United States that  it  is going to convene a special meeting of its Board of Governors  on 21 March to deal with the inspection of North Korean nuclear  facilities by its inspection team, the United States, through a  statement by the Department of State, revealed the possibility  of the postponement or cancellation of the third round of North  Korea-U.S. high-level talks slated for 21 March.    The U.S. Department of Defense also announced that it will  discuss the issue of immediately resuming the ROK-U.S. joint  military exercise by pointing out that the preconditions for the  suspension of Team Spirit are the nuclear inspection and  North-South high-level talks.    Realizing the seriousness of the situation, the White House  reportedly plans to hold an emergency high-level meeting soon  with participation by secretaries of state and defense, as well  as assistants for security affairs. Meanwhile, President  Clinton said that if North Korea does not accept complete  nuclear inspection promptly, resumption of the ROK-U.S. joint  military exercise and deployment of Patriot missiles to U.S.  Forces Korea would be the means of choice.    Thus, a hardline trend against North Korea has been created  within the United States since it was confirmed that the  inspection activities of the IAEA inspection team were  restricted by the North Korean authorities.    In particular, an unprecedentedly strong hardline air  regarding North Korean problems is prevailing in the U.S.  Congress. At present, the hawk faction regarding policy toward  North Korea constitutes the main force both in the U.S. House of  Representatives and the Senate.    It is a reality that the hardline stance against North Korea  is becoming more fierce not only within the U.S. Congress but  also in the Department of Defense whose hardline conservative  nature has been traditionally strong.    In addition, the U.S. CIA is supplying various hawk faction  members with intelligence materials that serve as the basis of  the hardline stance against North Korea.    As a result of a hardline stance becoming superior, the  position of the U.S. Department of State, which is the only  organization within the Clinton administration calling for a  solution of problems pertaining to North Korea through dialogue,  has been weakened to a considerable extent. Up until 18 March,  U.S. Secretary of State Christopher stressed that "nothing has  been decided regarding the resumption of the Team Spirit  exercise and a channel should be open for dialogue with North  Korea even while working out measures for sanctions against it."    However, under the present situation in which the  much-expected exchange of special envoys between the North and  the South has clearly gone across the river, such an allegation  for diplomatic solution by the State Department is being melted  away [pichul ilta]. Therefore, it can be said that the North  Korean nuclear issue is at a turning point from the U.S.  argument between hardline and moderate factions into the phase  of international sanctions.</p>

It was launched this month with  the support of six member states (UK, Netherlands, Spain,  Germany, France and Greece) and with the financial aid of the  Energy Directorate of the European Commission. Its first  chairman is Ton van der Does, director of the Dutch CHP office.  Cogen Europe, with its main office in London, will have the  task of:    (a) identifying the regulatory and institutional barriers to  cogeneration development in Europe and acting to reduce them at  the policy level;    (b) collaborating on relevant issues with other key European  energy associations and industries;    (c) quantifying the potential for cogeneration in Europe.    Speaking at the launch, Mr. van der Does said that the  association will work toward better cooperation between key  actors in the European energy scene in order to "establish a  clear and positive policy framework for cogeneration." "The  Brussels institutions now have a professional and focused  organization with which they can work to resolve the many  challenges facing cogeneration in the 1990s," he continued. The  creation of this association, he feels, reflects the absence of  clear recognition by EU and many national policy makers of the  significant benefits of cogeneration schemes, whether  industrial, small-scale or city- wide. While conventional power  generation is often only 35 percent efficient (up to 65 percent  of the energy potential being released as waste heat),  cogeneration technology stops this by using the heat for  industry, commerce and home heating. Cogeneration therefore  increases the overall efficiency of energy use - up to 85  percent and beyond - giving primary energy savings of about one  third.</p>

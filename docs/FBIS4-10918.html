			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 19 Apr (DPA) -- Honduran Foreign  Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar today said that Palmerola, the U.S.  base in central Honduras, makes no sense. The Honduran foreign  minister also expressed his support for a review of the military  treaty that Honduras and the United States signed in 1954.    Paz Aguilar said it is necessary to review this treaty,  adding that in the specific case of the U.S. Palmerola Air Force  Base, it makes no sense for it to be used as a military platform  when it should be used as a center to fight drug trafficking.    "Central America and the Caribbean will continue to be areas  of interest to the United States, and we must take as much  advantage as we can of this fact," the foreign minister said.  Paz Aguilar said many agree that conditions are appropriate for  Honduras to begin a new relationship with the United States. The  foreign minister added that U.S. aid to Honduras can be used to  combat drug trafficking and the smuggling of illegal aliens.    Foreign Minister Paz Aguilar said Honduras, through its  authorities, will ask the Honduran Congress to review the  treaty. The Honduran Armed Forces today said Honduras should  break the military treaty with the United States because the  treaty is obsolete and yields no benefits to Honduras.</p>

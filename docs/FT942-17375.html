			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / UK Company News: Resort Hotels faces delisting Resort Hotels is set to be delisted following its failure to put forward restructuring proposals before a March 31 deadline set by the Stock Exchange. Resort's shares were suspended on July 16 after it had exceeded its banking facilities, and imposed significant management changes. The group has since revealed pre-tax losses of Pounds 71m for the year to April 1993, a net negative valuation, and a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the activities of its previous management. The Stock Exchange said it was left with no choice in delisting the company, if Resort did not put forward 'something that looks feasible within a realistic time frame', before midnight last Thursday. Mr Roland Lewis, managing director, said Resort was keen to maintain a listing in the longer term, but it was not yet in a position to submit detailed proposals. He said the financial implications of delisting were limited, since the level of documentation required to gain Stock Exchange approval for restructuring, would be similar to those for a new listing. Resort's future remains in the hands of its bankers, primarily National Westminster Bank and Midland Bank, since the group has net debt of Pounds 53m. It is examining a number of potential solutions, and it is understood that one option is the sale of the company to private hotel group Jarvis Hotels. Meanwhile, Resort has withdrawn from the management of 14 hotels which will therefore 'no longer require any financial support from Resort.' As part of a rationalisation it is attempting to cease unprofitable management deals, and develop a hotel marketing role. Its banks have indicated continued support, and the management remains confident it has a long-term future.</p>

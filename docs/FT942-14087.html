			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Japanese banks plan merger Three Japanese regional banks are to merge in January 1995. The move comes as Japanese financial authorities are trying to encourage mergers among smaller regional banks to streamline operations and achieve economies of scale in the face of rising costs and growing problem loans. Tokuyo City Bank, Kita-Nippon Bank and Shokusan Bank, three second-tier regional banks based in northern Japan, will become Heisei Bank, the fifth-biggest second-tier regional bank in terms of assets, with deposits of Y2,190bn (Dollars 21bn). Ten shares of the merged bank will be exchanged for 10 shares of Shokusan, or 10 shares of Kita-Nippon, or eight shares of Tokuyo City. They currently offer banking services in three prefectures through a total of 225 branches. The merged bank will have separate headquarters in each of the three prefectures. The three banks have combined outstanding deposits of Y2,270bn with combined outstanding loans totalling Y1,710bn yen, they said. The move is the latest in a string of mergers among regional banks. In 1991, San-in Godo Bank in western Japan merged with another regional bank, while Kumamoto Bank merged with Higo Family Bank based in Kyushu, southern Japan. Last year, Hokuto Bank in Akita, in north-east Japan, was created by a merger of two regional banks. Most of Japan's regional banks remain relatively healthy catering to businesses in the provinces, but many among the smaller second-tier regional banks have been troubled in the wake of the burst of the economic bubble due to imprudent lending in the 1980s. The regional banks are also facing increasing competition from the larger commercial banks, which are looking for business opportunities in the provinces. Tokuyo City posted a Y7.6bn pre-tax loss for the year ending March 1992 and a Y1bn pre-tax loss for the business year to March last year due to unrealised losses on stock holdings. The Bank of Japan and ministry of finance are trying to resolve the situation by merging healthier regional banks with those with deteriorating balance sheets. The finance ministry yesterday welcomed the move as 'forward looking', adding that it hoped the merger will would improve customer service and contribute to the regional economy. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, said that more such cases were likely to emerge in the future.</p>

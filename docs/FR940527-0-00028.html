Love Field, AZ, Alameda NAS (Nimitz Field), CA, Bakersfield, Meadows Field, CA, Lancaster, Gen. William J. Fox Airfield, CA, Sacramento Executive Airport, CA, Salinas Municipal Airport, CA, Barbers Point NAS, HI, Fallon NAS (Van Voorhis Field), NV, Point Mugu NAWS, CA, and El Centro NAF, CA, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action also established Class E airspace at these area when the associated control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with these airport traffic control towers is required and to provide Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures when these control towers are closed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Effective date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 0901 UTC, August 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before August 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send comments on the rule in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Attn: Manager, Air Traffic Division, AWP-500, Docket No. 94&hyph;AWP&hyph;13, P.O. Box 92007, Worldway Postal Center, Los Angeles, California 90009. The official docket may be examined in the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Western-Pacific Region, Federal Aviation Administration, room 6007, 15000 Aviation Boulevard, Lawndale, California. An informal docket may also be examined during normal business hours at the Office of the Manager, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division at the above address. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Gene Enstad, Airspace Specialist, System Management Branch, AWP-350, Air Traffic Division, Western-Pacific Region, Federal Aviation Administration, 15000 Aviation Boulevard, Lawndale, California, 90261, telephone (310) 297&hyph;0010. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Request for Comments on the Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the DATES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section. However, after the review of any comments, and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or amend the regulation. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of the rule. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace at Prescott, Ernest A. Love Field, AZ, Alameda NAS (Nimitz Field), CA, Bakersfield, Meadows Field, CA, Lancaster, Gen. William J. Fox Airfield, CA, Sacramento Executive Airport, CA, Salinas Municipal Airport, CA, Barbers Point NAS, HI, Fallon NAS (Van Voorhis Field), NV, Point Mugu NAWS, CA, and El Centro NAF, CA, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace at these areas when the associated control tower is closed. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at these airports. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the airport traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace during the hours the control tower is closed. The intended effect of the action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with these airport traffic control towers is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures when these control towers are closed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to modify these Class D and establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Danube hydro plan talks get nowhere HUNGARY yesterday attacked a Slovak plan to divert the Danube river, accusing it of breaking international law, after talks about the controversial hydro-electric project broke up in disagreement, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Slovakia appeared determined to continue with the Bos-Nagymaros project, despite Hungary's opposition. Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovakian Prime Minister, even made a veiled threat to complete construction within Slovakia's own territory, according to Hungarian officials. 'It would infringe the integrity of Hungarian territory,' an official said of a Slovak scheme to divert the Danube. Mr Meciar refused to rule it out as one way of circumventing Hungarian opposition. 'Slovakia will not give up its intention to continue construction,' he said. Digging a new channel was one of nine possibilities being considered. Hungarian public opinion is so concerned about the environmental consequences of Bos-Nagymaros that the issue was at the centre of opposition to the country's former Communist regime. Slovakia, on the other hand, has done 90 per cent of the work on its side of the river.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall as supply fears dominate sentiment SUPPLY concerns remained the dominant influence on US bond market sentiment yesterday, and prices fell across the board amid nervous trading ahead of next week's quarterly refunding announcement. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/32 at 102 13/32 , yielding 7.784 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down 3/32 at 99 13/32 , yielding 5.175 per cent. After Wednesday's big losses, the market opened in a subdued mood. Even a bigger-than-expected 5 per cent decline in December durable goods orders and a 24,000 rise in weekly unemployment insurance claims failed to buoy investors' spirits. In the wake of the State of the Union speech and the new Budget, which forecast a higher deficit for 1992 than had been anticipated, market participants are worried about how badly the extra supply of new securities will depress prices, and what the mix will be along the maturity range. DEMAND for long-dated German government bonds helped to wipe out early losses in the market, with the result that the bund futures market closed almost unchanged yesterday. The fall in the US Treasury bond market overnight pulled German government bond prices down yesterday morning. However, dealers reported plenty of extension trades, whereby market participants sell short-dated issues and switch into long-dated paper. The move out of the short end of the market reflects worries that German interest rates are likely to remain high for some time, traders said. Yesterday, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank directorate member, warned that high inflation levels in Germany preclude any easing in the Bundesbank's monetary policy. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.20 and traded at around 88.21 by late afternoon, down on Wednesday's close of 88.37. Elsewhere in Europe, the Dutch government bond market ended slightly firmer, buoyed by overseas demand for 10-year and 15-year bonds. UK government bonds barely moved in dull trading yesterday. The Liffe gilt futures contract, which opened at 97.14, inched up to 97.16 by late afternoon, while the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 slipped from 115 15/16 to 115 29/32 . JAPANESE government bond prices slipped following the fall in the US Treasury bond market overnight and the weakening of the yen against the dollar. Traders said that sentiment in the Tokyo market was bearish following the decline in US bond prices on Wednesday. The US market fell after comments by the US Federal Reserve's chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, dashed hopes of a further cut in US interest rates. The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.26 per cent and closed at 5.265 per cent in Tokyo after trading in a range of 5.25 to 5.275 per cent.</p>

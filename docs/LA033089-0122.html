			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: EL MONTE;  </P> <P> HISTORIC HOUSE MOVE OKD  </P> <P> The City Council voted Tuesday to provide $53,500 to move a home built in the  1890s to the new Santa Fe Trail Historic Park.  </P> <P> The three-bedroom Osmond Ranch House, which the owner is donating to the El  Monte Historical Society, will be moved from South El Monte to the park within  a month, society President Helen Huffines said.  </P> <P> Although some historians disagree, city officials say the site on Santa Anita  Avenue marks the end of the pioneer trail taken by settlers from the Midwest.  The park -- which also features El Monte's first jail, built in 1880 -- was  declared a historical landmark by the state in 1987 and will open in June.  </P> <P> Huffines, who is also curator of the El Monte Historical Museum, said only a  dozen other homes from the late 19th Century remain in El Monte and South El  Monte.  </P> <P> Michael Osmond, a builder and farmer from Norway, constructed the 1 1/2-story  house with redwood and square nails in 1892, Huffines said. An old water tower  he built nearby will also be moved to the park.  </P> <P> The society will restore the interior of the house, and the city Parks and  Recreation Department will provide landscaping and maintain the exterior.  </P></p>

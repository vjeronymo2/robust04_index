			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kok: For the Time Being, the </F> `Purple' Coalition Will Not Modify Entitlement to Allowance"]    [Text] A "purple" coalition [comprising the Labor Party  (PvdA), the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), and  Democrats 66 (D66]) will not modify the WAO [Occupational  Disability Insurance] benefits right away. The recently  implemented legislation on stricter inspections of incapacitated  persons, must first demonstrate its use in practice. According  to PvdA leader Kok, an agreement was reached with VVD leader  Bolkestein, and D66 leader Van Mierlo on this subject.    Kok does not rule out additional measures during the new  cabinet legislature. Whether or not this will happen, depends  on a criterion to be established in social security. The three  parties still have to come to terms on this criterion. There  are rumors about a standard for the number of persons entitled  to an allowance, or for the overall amount of money involved in  social security.    Last Tuesday night [21 June] after the "purple" coalition  talks, it also turned out that the three negotiators still  disagree on the steps to be taken at that moment.    The "purple" negotiators (namely Kok, Bolkestein, and Van  Mierlo) are proposing a new package of policy measures to the  Central Planning Bureau (CPB), which should serve as a first  outline of a coalition agreement. On Tuesday morning, the  relevant parties' financial experts reached an agreement on a  different implementation of previously agreed savings, involving  a total of 20 billion guilders.    Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo requested calculations for  several policy measures. At the end of the week, when Kok will  be back from the European summit on Corfu, the final decision  will have to be taken. Depending on the results of the CPB  calculations in terms of employment and purchasing power, the  negotiators will then decide whether or not a "purple" cabinet  is feasible. However, additional adjustments are not ruled out  at that stage. Kok expects the knots to be cut "next weekend or  immediately after that."    An important reference point for the negotiators, is an  increase of employment by at least 100,000 jobs. In addition,  PvdA and D66 made their political approval subject to an  unchanged distribution of incomes.    A previous calculation by the CPB, had stranded at upwards  of  70,000 jobs. When including the effects of new policy plans  (such as in the police force), between 74,000 and 75,000  additional jobs would be created. For all three parties, these  figures are largely insufficient. The lowest incomes would  suffer a 2 percent loss in purchasing power, while the average  income would remain practically the same. This is unacceptable  to PvdA.    Another complication is that the consequences of certain  measures fall outside the CPB model's scope.</p>

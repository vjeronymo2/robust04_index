But actually, according to a Defense Ministry estimate 6.5  trillion were transferred by the Ministry of Finance in 1993. If  we consider that the minimum amount needed by the Ministry of  Defense was over R10 trillion, the Defense Ministry's needs for  1993 were only 65 percent satisfied.    IN 1993 THE RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY ACCOUNTS were credited  with monetary resources from the sale of freed military property  (besides arms and ammunition): In the domestic market--R6.5  billion; in the foreign market--$6.4 million U.S.    One thousand six hundred apartments were acquired in 1993 on  these proceeds.    THE RF LAW "ON THE STATUS OF SERVICEMEN", which foresees a  number of benefits, guarantees and advantages for servicemen and  for citizens discharged from military services and for their  families, was enacted as of January 1993. However, some of the  benefits and advantages foreseen by the legislation have not  been enacted because the mechanism of their implementation has  not yet been found at the government level.    They include:     -  supplementary transportation benefits;    -  payment of monetary  compensation when going on leave;    -  property insurance for  servicemen;    -  preferential loans for housing construction;    -  sale of  apartments and individual dwellings to servicemen on  advantageous terms;    -  discounts in paying for installation and use  of apartment telephones, and other benefits.       MONEY WAS NOT ALLOCATED PROMPTLY, or in full volume, to  finance capital and housing construction. The Russian Finance  Ministry's debt was carried over from one month to the next. In  January 1993 it was R8.3 billion. By the end of the year the  Ministry of Finance was R147 billion behind in transferring the  amount foreseen in the federal budget for capital construction  by the RF Ministry of Defense. And when real growth of prices of  construction materials is accounted for, the figure reaches R290  billion.    Of the 61,700 apartments to be placed into operation with  funds from the federal budget in 1993, only 50,000 apartments,  or 81 percent of the plan, were made available.    Allocation of R658 billion to housing construction and to  the  purchase of apartments was planned in 1993 (this is not counting  outlays on construction of cultural and personal service  facilities). That would have been 63 percent of the total  allocations for housing construction by the Ministry of Defense  in 1993. The actual amount transferred was R565 billion.    ACCORDING TO DEFENSE MINISTER P. GRACHEV the overall  numerical strength of the RF Army as of 1 December 1993 was  2,341,000 persons.

Prepared by R. Bykov      THE MINIMUM PAY (1994) of contracting servicemen (privates,  first rate classification) is over R110,000, the lowest  classification (a ship petty officer aboard a submarine receives  five times more). There are also a large number of significant  benefits and extra payments, such that the total expenditures  for contracting servicemen will exceed the figures presented in  the tables by three or four times -- several trillion per year.    LAST YEAR THE PAY AND ALLOWANCES of servicemen were indexed  three times -- as of January, April and September. This year  they were indexed as of 1 January. Because of the complex  economic situation in the country the RF Government decided on  several occasions to index the pay and allowances of servicemen  1-2 months late. This brought on complaints by many servicemen  to different levels of authority regarding violation of Article  12 of the RF Law "On the Status of Servicemen."    Thus, the minimum wage was increased by 1.81 times as of 1  July 1993, while the pay and allowances of servicemen were not  indexed until 1 September 1993 -- that is, 2 months later.    The present minimum wage -- R14,620 per month as opposed to  R7,740 (a 1.9-time increase) -- was established as of 1 December  by a presidential edict dated 5 December 1993, while pay and  allowances of servicemen were indexed only as of 1 January of  this year; that is, a month later.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: Blythe spirits - Jazz THE FIERY saxophone partnership of US tenorist Chico Freeman and altoist Arthur Blythe has has been at Ronnie Scott's all week. They have been joined by their regular rhythm section, the raffish Idris Mohammed on drums and Curtis Lundy on upright bass, plus the young British pianist Julian Joseph to make up a quintet. Freeman and Blythe create an eccentric but compelling sound together. Where Freeman's tenor technique is impetuous but also sensitive, his stout partner ploughs a straighter furrow, making sense of the leader's flights of fancy. Opening by throwing blue shapes at one another, Freeman moves quickly into sinewy abstraction in the upper register and blurting punctuation in the bottom. Blythe, who has more firmly anchored ideas, drives out a gritty alto sound spiced with blue inflection. Joseph, an instinctive player presumably working with the minimum of rehearsal, provides a colourful backdrop for the reeds, his tidal, repeated motifs set off against sparkling runs. Mohammed is reliable as ever, the stripped down almost martial rhythm driving rock steady behind the ensemble. The main attraction is Freeman, however, flamboyant and moorish in appearance with his black flowing shirt, earring and custom black horn. Worrying around the edges of a ballad with moist breathing or exploring every crevice of the instrument with gale force blowing, his technique is both difficult and convincing. It is not a quintet for everyone's taste and the tense reed mayhem which closed this first set did leave some bewildered faces in the club. But for fans of high voltage Freeman driven by the Blythe spirit, it is highly recommended.</p>

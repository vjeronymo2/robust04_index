			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Nafta vote hailed as boost for Gatt: 'A long step in the right direction,' says Clinton TRADE officials said yesterday that US congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement should be used to secure a successful completion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, praised President Bill Clinton's success, but was quick to note that the vote in the House of Representatives on Wednesday night, by 234 to 200, was 'just half of the battle won'. He said: 'Half the battle because Nafta and similar enterprises - no less the European Union - cannot themselves thrive in isolation. They are not economically self-sustainable and must be part of a broader world trading system under the aegis of the Gatt. 'The other half of the battle, making the Nafta a genuine positive force in the world economy, must be the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.' Trade negotiators in Geneva have set a December 15 deadline for completion of the round. The Nafta vote had cast a shadow over Gatt talks for several weeks, tying US negotiators' hands when the time remaining for completing the round has been perilously short. Amid rising optimism that long-elusive trade-liberalising measures are finally within negotiators' grasp, expectations have run high that the success of the Nafta vote would allow top US and EU trade negotiators meeting in Washington early next week to provide long-awaited impetus. Mr Clinton, before flying to his Asian summit in Seattle, said the House approval of Nafta was 'a long step in the right direction' of more open markets and more vigorous international competition. The vote gave the US 'the economic, political and moral standing' to make its case with the Asian leaders and in the final push to conclude the Uruguay Round. The measure was passed by a far more comfortable margin than had appeared likely even as the House debated the agreement. Mr Sutherland's comments came during a Geneva briefing intended to underline trade liberalising moves that have already been provisionally agreed, and to focus on what is at risk if the few outstanding differences result in failure. 'What is in the bank is still capable of being lost,' he said. 'The overall picture is heartening, but there are still significant difficulties in bringing the round to a conclusion. 'There is a lot there that should stimulate the participants with the knowledge of how much they stand to lose.' In Brussels, Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, also warmly welcomed the House vote, saying it would remove a big distraction for the Clinton administration and allow a final drive for agreement in the Gatt talks. However, Sir Leon sounded one note of caution, telling reporters that he needed to look at the 'small print' to see what the White House may have offered members of Congress to get their vote and how it might affect Gatt. With only four weeks remaining to deadline for a Gatt deal, Sir Leon is due to hold talks with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in Washington next week. A measure of concern exists that so much remains to be negotiated in the Gatt talks, with so little time remaining. 'You have a feeling that each side has spent half of its time calculating how to blame the other in the event of a failure,' one Commission official said.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Guangzhou  authorities in south China's Guangdong Province have revoked the  licences of 113 overseas-funded enterprises because they refused  to honor their contracts with the Chinese side.    They make up two percent of all the overseas-funded  enterprises in the city, said the city's Industry and Commerce  Bureau (ICB) and Foreign Economic and Trade Commission (FETC).    The closed enterprises had failed to observe the contracts  to  put enough or any capital into their ventures in the city after  they obtained business licences, the officials said.    Some had even suspended operations for long periods for lack  of funds, and others did not fade out of the enterprises after  the terms of joint operation with local businesses were ended,  they said.    However, "most of the overseas investors in the city have  been following national and local laws and regulations and made  considerable contributions to the city's economic development,"  and "their legal rights and interests have also been protected  by the governments at all levels," the Guangzhou ICB and FETC  said.    The closed enterprises include: the Guangzhou Flower Garden  Exhibition Center, the Guangzhou Kangbao Beverage Co. Ltd, and  Nanguo Hotel.</p>

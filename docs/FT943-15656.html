			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Caricom shrugs off US concerns over Cuba Cuba's inclusion in the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), a regional trading bloc formed this week, will not become a controversial and divisive issue despite US concerns, the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) said yesterday. Caricom added that all prospective members had agreed the island should be a member and Cuba met all the criteria for joining the economic co-operation grouping. The Caricom leaders, at their annual summit in Barbados, approved a draft agreement establishing the ACS, which will include all the Community's members, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Suriname, the Central American states, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela. The 25 members will offer associate membership to 15 dependent territories in the region. The agreement is to be signed in Colombia on July 25, creating what officials say will be one of the world's largest trade blocs. Caricom officials say that the community's members have been informed of Washington's objections regarding Cuba's inclusion. 'We gather that the United States feels that Cuba should first make political reforms and improve human rights before it is allowed into the ACS,' a Caricom official said. 'But again we say that the United States has not put these concerns to Canada and Mexico, which have been Cuba's main trading partners in the hemisphere. There is no basis on which Cuba can be excluded.' Mr Jorge Bolanos, Cuba's deputy foreign minister, said the government was unperturbed by US concerns, as these were expected. 'We knew from very early that this would not go down well in Washington,' said Mr Patterson Thompson, executive director of the Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce. 'But we agreed unanimously on having Cuba in the ACS, and the government has already initialled the draft agreement.' 'The US has nothing to do with this,' he said. The ACS is the largest economic grouping in which Cuba has been involved since the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main trading partner, and the dismantling of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon.) In another move to strengthen economic ties with its Latin American neighbours, Caricom has agreed the terms of a free trade pact with Colombia. The agreement will be signed at the end of this month, and will be effective in January next year. It will allow specified categories of Caricom products preferential entry to the Colombian market, with the community reciprocating on a phased basis.</p>

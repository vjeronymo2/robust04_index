			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / UBS seeks employee support in strategy battle Union Bank of Switzerland is again urging its 22,000 Swiss employees to vote their shares in support of the directors in their proxy fight with Zurich broker-fund manager Mr Martin Ebner over the bank's strategy. At the moment the battle centres on the proposal by the UBS board to convert the bank's registered shares into bearer shares, drastically reducing their voting power. It has called an extraordinary general meeting for November 22 to vote on the proposal. In a second letter to employees on the issue, Mr Nikolaus Senn, chairman, and Mr Robert Studer, chief executive, have pleaded with employees to give the directors an unconditional general proxy for voting their shares. 'Unfortunately, a large number of employees have not sent in a proxy form for general meetings,' the letter says. 'In our view, this should be made out unconditionally, not only for the approaching general meeting, but also for the future.' Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, president of BK Vision, the Ebner controlled investment fund that is UBS's largest shareholder, said he regretted the letter. 'In a good bank, the staff should be left to make their own decision.' UBS denied there was any pressure. 'Naturally, the bank wants to convince its personnel' it said, and pointed out that an independent proxy holder had been engaged for shareholders who wanted their vote to be private. The registered shares now have a par value only one-fifth of that of the bearer shares, but equal voting weight. UBS says BK Vision, which has an 18 per cent holding in them, seeks excessive influence over the bank on the cheap. BK Vision is trying to rally a majority of votes in favour of substantial changes in the UBS board at next April's annual meeting when the terms of 10 of the 23 directors expire. UBS employees, who can buy registered shares on very favourable terms, now hold about 12 per cent of them, carrying 6.1 per cent of all votes. The registered shares have lost more than half of the effective 40 per cent premium they carried over the bearer shares since UBS revealed its proposal, causing dismay among holders.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SEEKS SYRIA'S HELP IN MIDEAST  </P> <P> One hundred thousand refugees in Jordan without water and food is a situation  that should be completely unacceptable to the Arab world.  </P> <P> I hope that either Kuwait or Saudi Arabia will offer to pay the bill to fly  those people out.  </P> <P> The Saudis stand to gain tens of millions of dollars in additional revenue each  day because of oil price increases, and Kuwait has the same level of income  each day from its assets in the West. It would be a wonderful gesture of  goodwill for them to want to take care of their own problems.  </P> <P> JACK F. MILLER  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART FUNDING CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Your editorial missed the point. Supporters of the exhibits causing the  congressional actions and your editorial use an argument based on "free  speech." A lady representing the museum used the same thesis in a recent debate  on KCET on this subject. The congressman in that debate properly defended  Congress with the statement that Congress controls the expenditures for the  program and has the right to make the rules. The right of members of Congress  to grant the funds also gives them the right to make and enforce the rules to  be followed by the recipient(s) of those funds.  </P> <P> Artists who are entitled to freedom of expression and who don't want to be told  that government funds do not support their particular expressions and works of  a certain nature are not being denied the freedom of expression -- they are  only being denied government funds for work that is not approved by the  government. They still have the right of free expression to sell their work to  some other buyer with private funds. In other words, go sell your work  elsewhere.  </P> <P> Don't confuse the issues -- this is not an issue of the rights of artists to  produce their conceptions of their feelings -- this is a case of wanting the  government to give them money with no strings attached.  </P> <P> GEORGE DARLING  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

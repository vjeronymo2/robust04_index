			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: British Rail At last, British Rail has chugged into the modern world of accounts by ascribing a balance sheet value to its track and signalling infrastructure and depreciating it over its economic life. InterCity grumbles this rather spoils its figures but the change only brings BR into line with standard practice elsewhere. It is necessary to put a commercial valuation on BR's assets even if the government's plan is for piecemeal privatisation. Only then will would-be buyers be able to see what individual parts are really worth. BR clearly could not become a viable private sector business as it stands. An operating margin of 0.4 per cent on a turnover of Pounds 3.1bn before revenue grants is unlikely to attract any investors. In the government's scheme, BR will be fragmented into some 50 pieces and the best bits pointed towards the private sector. Here, crude cash calculations will be the most critical factor. BR's accounting changes give the appearance of fattening up profits. Paradoxically, though, the less profitable that individual operating units are, the greater their attractions may be. Providing the government concedes large, continuing subsidies to such franchises, a higher level of fixed income would accrue to their owners. By cutting costs, private sector operators might then be able to generate a reasonable return.</p>

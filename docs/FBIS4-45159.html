Perez Balladares traveled to Costa Rica with Foreign  Minister-designate Gabriel Lewis Galindo on an invitation by  fellow Social Democrat Jose Maria Figueres, with whom he met for  about one and one-half hours.    In a news conference at the Costa Rican Presidential Palace,  Figueres and Perez Balladares said they talked about four  specific issues: bilateral trade, social investments at the  common border, creation of a mixed-bilateral commercial  association, and the struggle against drug trafficking.    Both presidents agreed the sovereignty of their respective  nations is violated when they are used by drug traffickers for  their illicit trade.    "We agreed to carry out efforts, in a decisive and  definitive  manner, to control drug smuggling as a mutual responsibility,"  Figueres stated.    Meanwhile, Perez Balladares said the issue of drug  trafficking is fundamental. He affirmed that the struggle  against drug trafficking may result in the creation of liaison  and joint cooperation offices, not only with the United States,  but also with all countries that feel the need to cooperate in  this matter.    Figueres' National Liberation Party and Perez Balladares'  PRD  [Democratic Revolutionary Party] assisted each other during the  elections in their respective nations. Both presidents were  classmates at the University of Notre Dame in the United States.    The presidents expressed their interest in building a  permanent commission formed by the two countries' governments  and private enterprise to promote economic, social, and  commercial development along the Costa Rican-Panamanian border.</p>

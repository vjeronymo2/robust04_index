			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- A group of experts led by Walter  Hohlefelder, chief of the Department on Reactor Safety in the  Federal Environment Ministry, left for Ukraine on 30 May to  prepare steps for closing down the Chernobyl nuclear reactor.  Two reactor blocs of the power plant are currently still in  operation, while the third one was closed down following a fire.    The experts are primarily developing a concept for gradually  closing down the whole reactor, setting up a second  "sarcophagus" for the defective reactor, and ensuring an  adequate power supply by completing reactor blocs under  construction at three other sites in Ukraine.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Smith wins 'democracy' vote: Narrow victory for one-member-one-vote after unity plea from Prescott MR JOHN SMITH stamped his authority on the Labour party last night with a narrow but critical victory in his battle to inject greater democracy into links with trade unions. After a day of drama and intrigue at the party's Brighton conference, the Labour leader declared that the decision in favour of a one-member-one-vote (Omov) system to select parliamentary candidates marked 'a great day for the Labour party'. Earlier he had gambled his leadership on the outcome, arguing that without a willingness to inject democracy into its own decision-making, Labour could not win the trust of the electorate at a general election. In a nail-biting conclusion, Mr Smith secured the 47.5 per cent to 44.3 per cent margin for his plan only after a last-minute switch by the MSF technical union and a powerful plea for unity from Mr John Prescott, the party's transport spokesman. But the Labour leader won comfortable majorities for a series of other constitutional changes that will reduce trade unions' influence at party conference and in the election of the leader. The infamous 'block vote' at the annual conference will be replaced by a system of individual voting by unions, although they will still wield 70 per cent of the total votes. Mr Smith said that by drawing a line under the year-long dispute over internal democracy, the party could move forward 'to advance our agenda for full employment and social justice'. He added: 'This is an important step towards victory at the next general election.' The victory over opposition led by the party's biggest paymasters - the TGWU and GMB general unions - was not without confusion. Although the delegates passed the vital change in party rules sought by Mr Smith, it also supported a conflicting motion proposed by the TGWU. Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU general secretary, indicated that his union would continue its battle against Omov. That stance, however, was brushed aside by Mr Smith, who insisted that the change was irreversible. Mr John Edmonds of the GMB indicated that he would accept the outcome, saying the party leadership and the unions could unite behind Mr Smith's policies for the economy and welfare state. Mr Edmonds added, however, a warning that any further attempts to diminish the role of the unions would provoke another damaging battle. The excruciatingly narrow victory followed a day of arm-twisting, pleading and cajoling to secure enough votes for Mr Smith. Mr Neil Kinnock, the former party leader who began the process of reform, emerged as a pivotal figure in winning over waverers to his successor. Among the extraordinary tactics employed to persuade smaller trade unions - and crucially to assure the neutrality of the MSF - was a warning from Mr Smith that a defeat would wreck separate plans to promote the role of women in the party. The other critical point was a passionate address to the conference by Mr Prescott, a leading figure on the left and a much-trusted figure among unions. Mr Prescott's unequivocal backing for the proposals contrasted sharply with attempts by Mrs Margaret Beckett, Mr Smith's deputy, to distance herself from the plans. That in turn raised strong speculation - openly encouraged by some members of the shadow cabinet - that Mr Prescott will face pressure to challenge Mrs Beckett for the deputy leadership next year. Leading 'modernisers' in the senior ranks of the party said Labour could resume the process of dumping the 'ideological baggage' that had cost it four election defeats. But Mr Smith's declared aim of strengthening rather than weakening the party's links with the unions were taken as evidence by many on the left - including Mr Prescott - that he would not risk another confrontation. Mr John Major last night accused Mr Smith of surrendering to the unions over his party's reforms. 'It's policy that people care about and as far as policy is concerned the unions are still calling the tune and John Smith is receiving the message on his knees,' he said.

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Corporate borrowers tap into dollar sector TWO corporate borrowers yesterday took advantage of the latest decline in US bond yields to lock in cheaper fixed-rate funding in the dollar sector of the Eurobond market. Allied Lyons, the UK food and drinks group, launched a Dollars 150m five-year deal via Credit Suisse First Boston, while Philip Morris, the US cigarette, food and beer manufacturer, brought a Dollars 200m seven-year offering via UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Growing confidence that the dollar is likely to bounce soon has boosted European demand for Eurodollar bonds. As a result, costs for borrowers in the Eurobond market are becoming increasingly competitive with the US market. Very little corporate paper has been issued in the Eurobond market recently, but the fall in rates is likely to encourage more companies to raise funds. In addition, dealers said there are signs that some institutional investors are relaxing restrictions on bonds rated less than double-A, partly in an effort to pick up extra yield as US interest rates fall to historic lows. The Philip Morris deal, aggressively priced at 62 basis points above the comparable US Treasury yield, was targetted at Swiss retail investors, traditionally enthusiastic buyers of the name. Dealers, however, said the issue appeared very expensive next to the Allied Lyons offering, which carries the same debt rating of A2 by Moody's and A by Standard &amp; Poor's. The Allied Lyons deal, priced at 95 basis points above the five-year US Treasury yield, was aimed at a broader investor base, including continental European fund managers and retail investors. 'Good single-A-rated UK companies sell well at spreads of 90-100 basis points over Treasuries,' said one syndicate manager. The deal was bid at 99.77, slightly above its fixed reoffer level of 99.72. Two more offerings of subordinated floating-rate notes (FRNs) by banks, with minimum and maximum coupon levels, were launched yesterday, although dealers said that demand is starting to ebb. Internationale Nederlanden Bank, formerly NMB Postbank, launched a Dollars 100m offering and Germany's DG Bank a Dollars 75m issue of 10-year subordinated floating-rate notes. Also in the FRN market, the World Bank launched a Dollars 400m issue of 10-year notes, paying interest of 80 basis points below the three-month London interbank offered rate, via Goldman Sachs. The deal was targetted sole-ly at Italian investors, who do not pay withholding tax on World Bank paper. However, without the Italian angle, the World Bank would have had to pay about 20 basis points under Libor, dealers said. Some underwriters said the paper was proving quite difficult to place, but lead manager Goldman Sachs said most of the deal had been sold by the end of the day. In the Euroyen market, the Central Japan Railway Company launched a Y20bn 10-year deal via Nomura International, placed in the Far East.</p>

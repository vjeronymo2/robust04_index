			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUNIPERO SERRA HIGH TO ADMIT GIRLS IN FALL  </P> <P> In a major break from tradition, Junipero Serra High School in Gardena is  planning to add pink tiles to one of its locker rooms, romance novels to its  library and, most important, girls to its all-male student body.  </P> <P> The 40-year-old Roman Catholic school will go coeducational in the fall of  1991, administrators announced.  </P> <P> Principal James Crowell, a 1970 Serra graduate, began pursuing coeducation  about two years ago when enrollment began declining significantly as it lost  potential students to coeducational parochial schools in Torrance and Playa del  Rey. From 1986 to this school year, Serra's enrollment dropped from 520 to an  all-time low of 266.  </P> <P> "An all-boy school is really a holdover from the past," said Crowell, who spent  14 years at Serra as a teacher and dean before becoming principal last year.  </P> <P> "The guys are in favor of it," said student body President Kenny Davis.  </P></p>

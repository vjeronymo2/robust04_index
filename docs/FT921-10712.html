			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Government accused of shirking 'green test' THE GOVERNMENT was criticised yesterday for its reluctance to accept proposals that its policies - including agriculture, energy and transport - should be subjected to a 'green test' of their impact on the environment. The proposal is in the initial stages of discussion in the European Commission but no early decision is expected. It would entail governments of member states carrying out environmental impact assessments on their national policies. At present such assessments apply only to big construction schemes. A political row was sparked off when an early Commission draft, which was circulating round Whitehall, was shown to members of the opposition parties. The Department of the Environment said the proposals were too convoluted, not flexible enough and would need big resources to put into effect. It emphasised that Britain did not want to be obstructive and was prepared to try to improve the draft. Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman, said it was proof that the Conservatives had abandoned the 'green' agenda. 'The environment is not safe in the grey hands of Mr Major,' he said. Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said it showed the government's environment policy as a 'spurious sham'.</p>

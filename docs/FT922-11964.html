			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Quarterly results put focus on banks Wall Street SHARE prices moved in a narrow range yesterday as first-quarter corporate earnings dominated sentiment in a market unsure about which direction to take next, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up a modest 6.94 at 3,343.25, having spent the session only a few points either side of opening values. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained just 0.10 at 410.26, while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks eased 2.15 to 575.05. Turnover on the New York SE was 214.5m shares but falls exceeded rises by 927 to 773. Monday's declines had been triggered by a sharp rise in bond yields and concern that the previous week's big gains (the Dow rose more than 100 points in five days), spurred by positive corporate earnings, might have been overdone. With bond yields holding their own yesterday, and no fresh economic news, trading was therefore relatively subdued throughout the session. The banks sector was the feature of the day as a host of banking groups reported first-quarter earnings. Citicorp led the way, climbing Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 18 1/4 in turnover of 6.7m shares after reporting profits of Dollars 183m for the first three months of the year, almost double those made a year ago. Banc One put on Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 on news of record profits of Dollars 179m, compared to Dollars 130m a year earlier. Mellon Bank added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 41 1/4 on revealing a 26 per cent improvement in first-quarter profits to Dollars 86m. The best performer in the sector was Wells Fargo, the West Coast banking group, which jumped Dollars 9 7/8 to Dollars 76 1/8 on announcing profits of Dollars 2.09 a share for the quarter, well above analysts' estimates. The results included loan-loss provisions of Dollars 215m. Time Warner rose initially but slipped back to end down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 102 5/8 after the media and entertainment group reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 3m, against a sizeable loss incurred at the same stage a year ago. Tenneco fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 40 in active trading after the oil and mining group paid out Dollars 50m to settle a shareholder lawsuit. Storage Technology plummeted Dollars 11 1/4 to Dollars 45 in turnover of 3.76m shares on disappointing first-quarter profits of 30 cents a share, down from the 36 cents recorded a year earlier. On the over-the-counter market, Seagate Technology moved ahead Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 15 1/4 on news of fiscal third-quarter profits of 59 cents a share, up from 38 cents a year ago. MIPS Computer plunged Dollars 2 1/8 , or 20 per cent, to Dollars 8 3/8 as it recorded a first-quarter loss of 51 cents a share, compared with a modest profit at the same stage a year earlier. Synopsys weakened Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 27 1/4 after reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings of 11 cents a share, above the results of a year ago but below market expectations. Canada TORONTO closed lower after moderate trading as declines among banking and real estate issues more than outweighed a jump by gold shares. The composite index slipped 18.1 to 3,380.7, while falls led advances by 317 to 230 after volume of 21.7m shares. Financial services dropped 2.5 per cent as several banks fell amid continued concern over the future of debt-ridden real estate giant Olympia &amp; York. The gold group index climbed 3.9 per cent as New York spot gold gained USDollars 3.90 to USDollars 340.65 an ounce.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (4): Sale of the century ends - Quentin Peel on the successes and failures of mass privatisation Karl-Heinz Rusberg looks like a cross between a frantic factory manager and a slightly dotty professor, with a rumpled suit, laughing eyes, a shock of white hair, and the passion of a true believer. He is probably the most successful single salesman in East Germany's 'sale of the century', the wholesale disposal of the entire assets of the former communist state by the Treuhand privatisation agency. It is a process which has aroused furious passions both in favour and against it, and a truly extraordinary exercise which will leave the achievements of the Treuhand the subject of agonised debate for years to come. On the one hand, the agency has presided over the restructuring of a hopelessly uncompetitive communist economy, involving the break-up and reorganisation of vast industrial empires and agricultural estates. It has sold almost 13,500 separate companies in rather less than four years, for net proceeds of around DM30bn. By the end of 1994, when it is formally wound up, all but 100 will be in private hands. It will have successfully raised some DM230bn in loans on the national and international capital markets to finance the process, with another DM45bn needed to pay for its remaining obligations. On the other, the Treuhand has seen the numbers employed by its enterprises slashed by hundreds of thousands, and the industrial structure of east Germany transformed from the showpiece of the communist world to a rump of struggling enterprises, whose future in the cold capitalist market is still not assured. Instead of realising a positive balance for the German exchequer from the sale - once casually estimated by Mr Detlef Karsten Rohwedder, the first Treuhand president, at 'around DM600bn' - it will leave a debt burden to the federal government of at least DM275bn. Mr Rusberg remains convinced that the exercise has been overwhelmingly positive and successful, in spite of inevitable mistakes. He is a believer. 'You cannot succeed in this job unless you work as a man possessed,' he says, as he rakes through his files for the prospectuses of the last few companies still on his books. 'Perhaps there is a certain nostalgia now, as our job is coming to an end. But we can be happy to have been involved in this unique work.' Then he reels off statistics of his successes and failures, of the remarkable products which east German companies are still capable of producing, the quality of the workforce, and some of the mistakes which have been made along the way of seeking to transform a totalitarian socialist economy into a capitalist one. Mr Rusberg is regional manager for the Treuhand in Halle, an historic but grimy centre of east Germany's chemical industry, and he is not there by chance. It is the last regional office still in operation, and Mr Rusberg has been sent to clean up a disastrous, incompetent and corrupt privatisation process in the area. Two of the main purchasers of Treuhand enterprises - one who bought 29 businesses. and the other who took over 10 - are sitting in jail awaiting trial on various charges of falsification and fraud. The former privatisation director has just been arrested in Texas (for speeding in a Rolls Royce), and is now the subject of extradition proceedings. As for the 800-odd enterprises and properties sold off in the area, the entire lot has had to be reconsidered, and contracts renegotiated, to make sure the investors are sound and the legal details correct. It is a nightmare for all concerned - not least the workers in the privatised companies, whose jobs are once more in doubt - but it was probably an inevitable consequence of the sheer scale and speed of the privatisation process. 'With the best will in the world, mistakes can be made,' says Mr Rusberg, who came to the agency as an entrepreneur who had run a joint venture in Romania for MAN-GHH. 'The performance of the Treuhand in such a short time was fantastic. I simply would not have believed in 1990 that so much could be done in such a short time.' The detractors of the Treuhand charge that the agency has presided over the de-industrialisation of east Germany, leaving the region condemned to remain a backwater of the west. They say that far more should have been done to restructure the enterprises before they were sold, rather than rush into privatisation at all costs. Mrs Birgit Breuel, the no-nonsense former Christian Democrat economics minister from the state of Lower Saxony who has been president of the Treuhand since the 1991 assassination of Mr Rohwedder, quietly but firmly rejects such charges. 'It has not been de-industrialisation,' she says. 'It has been a return to small (industrial) cores. I am convinced that is positive. 'Every part we have sold will be fully modernised (by the year 2000). They will be lean - and striving for cost advantages. Then I believe we will have extremely attractive investment locations here. 'Of course, if everything was in a green field, we might have done things differently. But we were not beginning in a green field. We were dealing with hundreds of thousands of people.' To the charge that the Treuhand put jobs second in the rush for privatisation, she says: 'We always say we are not just selling firms, we are also buying something for them. We are buying management, we are buying technology, we are buying capital, and probably most important, we are buying a market share. 'We had to take the legal framework, and try to give the enterprises a real chance within it. We had to slim them down so they had a chance to be competitive. Of course that was gruelling work, and it meant a loss of jobs. But it was unavoidable.' There was no structural concept when the Treuhand began work, not least because there was no time to develop one. 'We were overwhelmed by the need to take decisions, immediately,' she said. 'With economic and monetary union (on July 1, 1990), most of the companies were in desperate straits. We had no structure, and only 150 workers at the start. 'When I arrived in September, I had no office, no assistant, and no concept: just sacks full of letters.' But nor did the Treuhand's leadership believe there should be a 'structural concept', says Mr Wolf Schode, the agency spokesman. 'Our philosophy was to give every individual enterprise an individual chance to survive and develop itself,' he said. 'It was a bottom-up strategy. Others wanted us to design a sectoral plan, industry by industry. But if we had done that, we would have been no better than a successor to the old east German planning commission. 'We are the last centralised institution of the old centralised DDR, and we are deliberately destroying ourselves - because in the pluralist, federal system of the new Germany, you don't need such a centralised structure.'</p>

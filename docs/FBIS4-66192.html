			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zou Yunhua (6760 0061 5478), Associate Fellow, </F> National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry Commission:  "Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Inevitable in the Developing  Circumstances -- Written on the Eve of Talks on a `Comprehensive  Nuclear Test Ban Treaty'"]    [Excerpts] Nuclear testing is a unique yardstick for  measuring the level and speed of nuclear weapons development.  Non-nuclear nations have long stressed the urgency and the  necessity for a comprehensive nuclear test ban. They firmly  maintain that a comprehensive test ban is an important step in  nuclear disarmament, and that it is the key to halting the  nuclear arms race, particularly to preventing qualitative  improvement of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons proliferation.    International society has made many efforts to ban and limit  nuclear testing during the past more than 40 years, and some  advances have been made in negotiations to ban nuclear tests.    At the beginning of 1994, negotiation of a "Comprehensive  Nuclear Test Ban Treaty" will begin at the Geneva Disarmament  Negotiations Conference. There are two possible prospects for  these negotiations: 1) Negotiation of a comprehensive test ban  treaty will proceed rapidly, or 2) treaty negotiations will go  through a tortuous and complex process because of numerous  imponderables. [passage omitted]    C. Nuclear Test Ban Situation After 1990    During the summer session of the Geneva Disarmament  Negotiations Conference in July 1990, a special committee on  banning nuclear testing was founded after a seven-year hiatus.  This was no doubt closely related to the international  situation, particularly new changes in the international  disarmament situation. First of all, on the nuclear disarmament  question, the United States and the USSR prepared for a  strategic arms reduction treaty (START) as a follow-on to the  signing of a U.S.-Soviet "intermediate range ballistic missile  treaty," and continuation of talks on the further reduction of  nuclear weapons. Second, the United States and Western  countries, which were anxious to respond to the needs of the  fourth deliberative meeting (held in August 1990) on a "Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty," had to adopt a flexible attitude. At  that time, France still maintained its rigid position, affirming  anew that it would not take part in the work of the special  nuclear test ban committee. China participated in the work of  the special committee. It expressed willingness to understand  the demand of non-nuclear nations for a ban on nuclear weapons,  and it desired to take an active part in the special committee's  work.    However, from 1990 until 1922, serious differences existed  among the parties to the disarmament talks, particularly on the  issue of whether the special committee should have negotiating  authority. A group of 21 unaligned nations called for immediate  negotiation of a comprehensive test ban treaty, strongly  asserting that they could not permit a situation to continue in  which a serious priority matter was only discussed but not  negotiated. The United States and the United Kingdom were  stubbornly opposed. Subsequently, the special committee  conducted only a general discussion of the nuclear test ban  issue. On 26 May 1992, France declared at a full meeting of the  disarmament negotiations conference that it would participate in  the work of the special nuclear test ban committee.    1993 was an unusual year. On 10 August, the Geneva  Disarmament Conference passed a decision (Document Number: CD  1212), granting negotiating authority to the nuclear test ban  committee, and in early 1994, negotiation of a treaty formally  began. At the 1993 disarmament conference, both the unaligned  nations and non-nuclear western nations were extremely active in  an effort to obtain complete test ban treaty negotiating rights.  They did not want the treaty to be like "partial test ban  treaties," the nuclear powers concocting a treaty only to use a  disarmament talks conference as an alibi, insisting that  discussions could be conducted only at a disarmament conference.  <H5>  III. Nuclear Test Ban Is an Inevitability in the Developing </H5> and Changing International Situation    The reality facing the world during the 1980s was a constant  escalation of the nuclear arms race between the United States  and the Soviet Union for more than 40 years. However, they were  never able to break the balance of power between their strategic  forces. Peace was substantially maintained in the world for 40  years. Maintenance and updating of such super inflationary  nuclear weapons during this protracted period of peace was an  extremely heavy burden, particularly for the USSR. Changes in  the world situation forced both the United States and the USSR  to consider readjustment of their nuclear arms policy. The  strategic defense initiative (SDI) that the Reagan  administration proposed in 1983 was an effort to replace an  offensive strategy with a defensive strategy. In March 1983,  after Mikhail Gorbachev took office, the USSR changed from  pursuit of great military power status to development of its  domestic economy and enhancement of its overall national  strength. Beginning in 1985, this readjustment of the nuclear  arms policies of the United States and the Soviet Union brought  about the most relaxed atmosphere in the nuclear arms field  since the advent of nuclear weapons. Both the United States and  the USSR began to dismantle and destroy their global  intermediate range and intermediate short range missiles.  Following discussions in mid-September 1987, the foreign  ministers of the two countries issued a joint statement stating  that "both parties unanimously agreed to begin comprehensive,  phased" negotiations "before 1 December," the two nations first  "agreeing on effective nuclear inspection measures." Next, they  would "conduct negotiations in the intermediate stage on the  issue of further limiting testing," and "the final goal is a  complete ban on nuclear testing." Both the United States and the  USSR also sent experts to examine each other's nuclear test  ranges, and they conducted joint tests.    At the same time, the United States Government came under  increasingly strong pressure from forces in the country opposed  to the continuation of nuclear testing. In March 1986, 58  members of the House of Representatives, led by the House  majority leader, and five senators wrote a joint letter urging  Reagan to accept the USSR's proposal for a halt to nuclear  testing. In August of the same year, the United States House of  Representatives again passed a resolution calling upon the  United States Government and the USSR to negotiate the banning  of all nuclear protests. Outside the Congress, public  anti-nuclear demonstrations increased in intensity. During  demonstrations and gatherings opposing nuclear testing that were  held year after year, some demonstrators even marched on the  Nevada test range in an effort to block nuclear testing. Faced  with such tremendous pressure, the Reagan administration could  only adopt a tough opposition policy.    Developments since the mid-1980s foretold the possibility  that a new turning point period might occur on the nuclear test  ban issue.    As the world entered the 1990s, the international situation  changed greatly. East-west relations underwent enormous changes,  notably the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact and the dramatic  dissolution of the USSR. No longer did they pose a serious  threat to the United States and West Europe. The nuclear  strategy of the United States and its allies was commensurately  adjusted. The United States lost its erstwhile worthy adversary,  and the western nations headed by the United States began to  shift their imaginary enemy to third world countries. More and  more, the western countries emphasized that prevention of  weapons of mass destruction, particularly the proliferation of  nuclear weapons, was the most prominent problem in disarmament  and arms control in the world today. They made prevention of  proliferation the foremost strategic task, holding that such  proliferation posed the greatest global threat to international  security following the cold war. They also maintained that early  conclusion of a complete test ban treaty could effectively and  promptly prevent nuclear threshold countries (also termed  near-nuclear countries) from crossing the nuclear threshold,  thereby eliminating a hidden danger. This was because, generally  speaking, near-nuclear countries had to do only a certain amount  of nuclear testing in order to qualify to join the ranks of  countries having nuclear weapons of value in actual warfare.    On the other hand, the great tide of international  relaxation  stimulated further demands that the United States and Russia  make more nuclear arms cuts and ban nuclear testing. Great  advances were also won in the international disarmament field.  In July 1991, the United States and Russia signed the "Strategic  Nuclear Arms Reduction Treaty" (START). On 16 June 1992,  American President George Bush and Russian President Boris  Yeltsin signed the "Strategic Arms Reduction Agreement of  Understanding." According to the provisions of this treaty, the  nuclear warheads on the nearly 10,000 strategic weapons that  each side had deployed would be reduced by two-thirds, i.e., by  2003, the number of nuclear warheads on strategic weapons that  each side had deployed would be no more than between 3,000 and  3,500.    As a super power, with the easing of the confrontation  between the USSR and the United States, and the beginning of new  changes in the European strategic pattern, the United States  made a step-by-step readjustment of its nuclear strategy to meet  the post-cold war international situation. After the Clinton  administration took office, readjustment of America's national  security strategy became increasingly evident.    Following the dissolution of the USSR, the United States  unilaterally adopted various measures to prevent loss of control  over and proliferation of the former Soviet Union's nuclear  weapons. The United States readjusted its own nuclear force  structure and nuclear weapons development plans. In 1992, the  United States stopped production of new model nuclear warheads.  On 2 July 1992, Bush announced the return to the United States  from abroad of all land-based and sea-based tactical nuclear  weapons that were slated for withdrawal. On 13 July, President  Bush announced a halt to the production of weapons-grade  plutonium and highly enriched uranium used to manufacture  nuclear warheads. Inevitably, the United States also gradually  readjusted its nuclear test ban policy as well. In July 1992,  President Bush stated in his nuclear test ban policy proposal  that in order to ensure the dependability of a U.S. nuclear  deterrent force, appropriate and effective nuclear testing was  necessary. However, the clamor and pressure inside the United  States for a complete test ban was extremely strong. The United  States Congress passed a bill on 24 September 1992 that provided  for no further nuclear tests after 30 September 1996 unless  other countries conduct such tests. It also provided that prior  to 1996, the total number of underground nuclear tests could not  exceed 15, and it required the United States to temporarily halt  nuclear testing for nine months.    On 3 July 1993, the Clinton administration's new nuclear  test  ban policy was inaugurated. It approved earliest initiation of  multilateral talks, and early conclusion of a comprehensive test  ban treaty. It emphasized that the United States might conclude  a test ban treaty in advance of the already stated 1996 date. It  declared that the United States' temporary halt to testing would  extend until September 1994 unless another country conducted  tests. Actually, earliest initiation of negotiations on a  comprehensive test ban had been jointly agreed earlier in  discussions between the American and Russian heads of state in  Vancouver.    The Clinton administration's establishment of a new nuclear  test ban stemmed mostly from political necessity, Clinton's own  campaign promise, and the U.S. "nonproliferation" policy.  However, the inauguration of this new policy had a direct and  major influence on "Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty"  negotiations. Opening of the curtain on this treaty's  negotiation benefitted from it.    Naturally, not only has readjustment of America's nuclear  test ban policy played a major role in bringing about the  nuclear test ban treaty negotiations, but there have also been  other reasons as well.    1. With the approach of the 1995 meeting to discuss a  "Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty," loud cries from third world  countries for a comprehensive test ban are reaching a crescendo.  They have taken the opportunity to redouble pressures on nuclear  nations to force them to political promises and to negotiate at  once the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty. Western  nonnuclear nations are also actively promoting early  negotiations.    2. Other nuclear countries have agreed or have been forced  to  agree to take part in negotiations for a comprehensive test ban  treaty. Russia has consistently supported a comprehensive test  ban. Not only does Russia gain political advantage from this  position, but of greater importance today is preservation of its  nuclear power position, and its economic predicament. Although  it still has a need to conduct nuclear tests, the United Kingdom  relies on America's test ranges and joint testing with the  United States. It has no choice but to do as the United States  says. France was virtually forced to agree to take part in the  negotiations as a result of domestic and foreign political  pressure. China supports early negotiations to conclude a  "Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty," and emphasis that all  nuclear nations should simultaneously negotiate and conclude an  unconditional international treaty of no first use of nuclear  weapons, and not using or threatening to use nuclear weapons on  non-nuclear nations and non-nuclear territories.    3. Some nuclear countries announcements of a temporary halt  to nuclear tests will certainly promote progress in negotiations  for a comprehensive test ban treaty. Mostly in response to  international or domestic pressures, Russia, the United States,  and France announced a temporary halt to nuclear testing. In  October 1991, Russia announced a one-year temporary halt to  testing, which it later extended for one year. In 1992 and 1993,  the United States announced a temporary halt to testing. On 8  April 1992, France also announced a temporary halt to nuclear  testing for that year (France's action was purely a cheap  political decision). In response, third world nations repeatedly  called loudly for these temporary halts to testing by some  nuclear countries to become a permanent halt to testing by all  nuclear nations.  <H5>  IV. Prospects for Negotiation of a "Comprehensive Nuclear </H5> Test Ban Treaty"    In early 1994, talks on the "Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban  Treaty" will begin in the only multilateral disarmament  organization -- the Geneva Disarmament Negotiations Conference.  Theer are two possible prospects for these talks.    A. Negotiations on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Will  Be Conducted Swiftly    1. On the basis of the resolution that the Geneva  Disarmament  Negotiations Conference passed on 10 August 1993, negotiations  on a comprehensive test ban treaty will formally begin in  January 1994. The First Committee of the United Nations General  Assembly (the UN First Committee) discussed and unanimously  approved a resolution on a "Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban  Treaty" on 19 November 1993. This resolution urged the Geneva  Disarmament Conference's 1994 session to regard a "Comprehensive  Nuclear Test Ban Treaty" as a priority task and accelerate  negotiations in order to reach a universal international  agreement that provides for effective international nuclear  inspections. A total of 156 nations jointly sponsored this  resolution, an unprecedented number, which shows the high degree  of attention that international society pays to the  comprehensive test ban issue, and also suggests that the talks  will be conducted with great fanfare.    2. Since it is limited by Congress' nuclear test ban law,  the  United States is anxious to complete negotiations for a  comprehensive test ban treaty by 1996; it will apply pressure on  other nuclear states. Russia has always advocated early  conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty, so naturally it  is actively pushing for it. To a very large extent, the attitude  of the United Kingdom will follow that of the United States.    Technologically speaking, after more than nearly a half  century of high speed development, America's and Russia's  nuclear weapons long ago passed their peak period. No  earth-shaking advances have been made for the past nearly 20  years, so the need to continue nuclear testing has greatly  decreased. Furthermore, several nuclear weapons research  institutes in the United States have explored various approaches  in recent years in a search for methods that can replace or  partially replace nuclear tests, and they have made some  progress. Without doubt, other nuclear power have conducted or  are in process of conducting similar research. Pioneering in  this field of technology in order to continue to maintain  nuclear weapons security and reliability following a  comprehensive test ban, and even being able to continue to open  new approaches to the development of nuclear weapons, will  provide the technical guarantees needed for the realization of a  comprehensive test ban.    4. Pressures from non-nuclear states for the early  conclusion  of a "comprehensive nuclear test ban" treaty will increase  steadily. Some third world countries have already demanded that  such a treaty be concluded before 1994, and that it be linked to  extension of the "Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty." Without  doubt, this will also be a major motivation for conclusion of  the treaty. The international anti-nuclear movement is gathering  strength. Continuation of nuclear testing in a nuclear test ban  atmosphere has become fraught with difficulties.    Sweden proposed a "Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty":  in  1991, and it 1992, it proposed new amendments. Many disarmament  talks nations have expressed support for this draft, and they  have suggested making it the basis for treaty talks. Even the  United States said that the Swedish text might serve as an  important basis for talks. The text of the Swedish treaty draft  creates favorable conditions for the formal initiation of  disarmament talks and for accelerating treaty negotiation.    B. Many Imponderables Remain in the Negotiation of a  Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; Treaty Negotiations Will Go  Through a Tortuous and Complex Process    1. As with any complex project, a comprehensive test ban  treaty cannot be negotiated in a day. The provisions of a future  treaty will have wide ramifications, and negotiations will  involve numerous specifics such as the scope of the ban, the  definition of a nuclear explosion, the laboratory simulated  nuclear explosion issue, conditions under which the treaty takes  effect, and the duration of the treaty, etc. The talks  intensify, problems will become increasingly complex. Presumably  negotiations will take some time.    2. The treaty's nuclear testing issue will be the key  component of talks. Comprehensive test ban nuclear inspection  techniques are numerous. They include mostly the following:  seismological monitoring (used for long distance monitoring of  underground explosions in violation of the treaty), satellite  monitoring (used in monitoring preparations for nuclear testing  and for atmospheric nuclear testing), on-site inspections (used  for further inspection following discovery of suspicious things  that violate the treaty), etc. Discussion of the treaty's  nuclear inspection provisions involves numerous questions such  as technical issues and costs, reasonableness, and how to  organize execution. Once talks begin, there will be a multitude  of matters.    3. The unaligned nations and the nuclear nations do not  agree  with each other on the starting point and the goals for  conducting a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. The  unaligned nations want to limit the nuclear nations' further  development of nuclear weapons. They are anxious to conclude a  treaty. However, most of the nuclear nations feel that the sole  goal in concluding a comprehensive test ban treaty is the  prevention of nuclear proliferation. Britain and France insist  that any future treaty must be one that permits genuine nuclear  inspections universally, and that no final deadline should be  set for its conclusions. Predictably, there are major  differences among all parties about the timetable for concluding  treaty negotiations.    Among the nuclear states, France will protract the  negotiating time because it still wants to conduct nuclear  tests. France has long adopted an extremely hard line attitude  about the nuclear test ban issue. It was not until 1992 that  France agreed to take part in the work of the Geneva disarmament  conference's special nuclear test ban committee. Although France  began to reduce outlays for nuclear weapons development plans in  1992 in response to changes in the international situation and  to save money, it still wants to conduct a certain amount of  nuclear testing. For example, it wants to use nuclear tests to  continue to authenticate the warheads on the missiles to be  installed on the new Le Triomphant class ballistic missile  nuclear submarines. On 7 October 1993, the French minister of  national defense openly stated that France would not sign a  comprehensive test ban treaty before mastering simulated nuclear  testing, and that France would require between 6 to 8 years to  master this technology. This also suggests that France will play  a role in comprehensive test ban treaty negotiations.    Concluding Remarks    Conclusion of a "Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty" has  been the fervent hope of international society for several  decades. Third world countries have termed it "something that is  extremely desirable yet most difficult to attain." Finally there  is hope that this day will come. However, treaty negotiations  will positively not be easy. People will have to wait and see  what steps the Geneva Disarmament Talks Conference will take to  advance to the final point in concluding a treaty.</p>

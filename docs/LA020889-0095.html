			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 19 KILLED, 22 HURT IN PLUNGE OF ENSENADA BUS  </P> <P> A city bus plunged over the side of a 60-foot cliff, leaving 19 people dead and  22 injured, authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The driver, Enrique Hernandez de Jesus, was among those killed in the accident  Monday, which occurred on the outskirts of this Baja California town as the bus  traveled a winding and steep stretch of road.  </P> <P> Hernandez and 13 passengers died at the scene. Five more passengers died at  hospitals on Monday and Tuesday, Ensenada Fire Department spokesman Jose Luis  Chavez said.  </P> <P> Of the 22 injured being treated at local hospitals, several were said to be in  critical condition, said Miroslava Cuellar, a spokeswoman for the city of  Ensenada.  </P> <P> The bus, owned by Transportes Rojo y Blanco (Red and White bus line), had not  had a mechanical inspection in five years and had no insurance as required by  state law, Cuellar said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Clear There Is Corruption'  </P> <P> "It is well-known that there is corruption between the transport companies and  state transit officials," she said. "Considering that these vehicles are  allowed to operate without inspections and without insurance and that drivers  are paid not a salary but by the number of passengers they can cram into their  buses, it is clear there is corruption."  </P> <P> Chavez said he hoped that the tragedy would bring an investigation of bus  transit practices in Ensenada.  </P></p>

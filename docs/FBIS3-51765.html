In an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA, Juan Contino,  the first secretary of the national UJC said there are new paths  toward knowledge opening up for the world's younger generations,  especially young people in Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe,  and the socialist countries (China, Vietnam, and North Korea).    The youth leader welcomed the international demonstrations  of  solidarity and support received from all corners of the world,  particularly those from people speaking out against the U.S.  blockade of the island at public forums, even within the United  States itself.    He said that many young friends of Cuba are launching an  offensive to disseminate information all over the world  regarding the democratic system on the island and its respect  for human rights in an effort to counter the smear campaigns  promoted by the enemies of the revolution.    He noted there has been a recent increase in examples of  solidarity toward the Caribbean country's people in the form of  events, demonstrations, and other means of dissemination, as  well as in the form of assorted donations, particularly to  contribute to the education effort.    Contino, who is also a member of the Central Committee,  highlighted the fact that 334 youngsters belonging to 15  international labor brigades visited the island in 1993. These  individuals paid their own way and worked in the fields at the  Paraiso Youth Camp in Havana Province, just outside this capital  city.    Contino said activities similar to those carried out on the  island to commemorate and support the Cuban sociopolitical  system are currently being organized in 15 nations on the  occasion of the 35th anniversary of the triumph of the  revolution headed by Fidel Castro. These activities have been  blessed "by Cuba forever."    He said that groups of youth leaders are going to various  parts of the world and will participate in festivities in  countries such as Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Spain, France,  Italy, Portugal, and Vietnam, among others.    The 33-year-old economist, who has seven years of experience  as a youth leader, expressed his gratitude to youth and student  organizations, associations, and entities from throughout the  world for making it possible for the UJC to expand its contacts  and exchange programs abroad during the current difficult  situation.    Contino said the 550,000 UJC militants who represent Cuba's  3.1 million young people are making efforts to deserve the  esteem of friends from other countries and are giving foremost  attention to their work in the edification of the Cuban  socialist system.    The UJC is a selective organization that embodies the  vanguard of the Cuban youth sector and has affiliates in all  sectors of the island's social and economic life. The roots of  this organization are in the country's secondary schools and  universities.    The UJC was founded on 4 April 1961. Hundreds of thousands  of Cubans have been members of it -- in particular, many current  leaders of the Communist Party of Cuba. According to Contino,  the UJC views itself as the party's best quarry for talent --  one that shapes people who continue the tradition.</p>

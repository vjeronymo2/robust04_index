			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARCHING THROUGH THE CANYON TO PROTEST LAGUNA LAUREL PLAN  </P> <P> In regard to the Nov. 12 picture and article covering the Laguna Canyon Walk,  The Times has done another disservice to to Laguna Beach residents. The picture  with the "class war" placard dead-center is totally misleading in describing  the canyon walk.  </P> <P> The article was more accurate in describing the event, but your readers will  look at the picture and think: There go those lunatics again.  </P> <P> I am a gray-haired member of the establishment who joined other senior  citizens, young parents, babies in strollers and bicyclists to make the  statement that at some point we had had enough of scraped hills with thousands  of look-alike houses. We want something left in its natural state without man's  engineering it.  </P> <P> I live on a street bordering the greenbelt. Whereas we used to see deer  regularly, raccoon, skunk and an occasional fox, it is now almost a  neighborhood celebration to see one roadrunner.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. does have a right to develop its land, but it also has an  obligation to preserve the balance of nature. Rearranging hills, producing  run-off that alters ground water levels are real threats to be considered. Who  really knows what happens when millions of gallons of water from thousands of  developed acres percolates through the soil down to the coast? Ultimately  tinkering with nature produces long-term, far-reaching effects.  </P> <P> This concern plus all those others that have been addressed in regard to  pollution, congestion, etc., prompted this writer to say to (developer) Donald  Bren on Saturday: "Please reassess your plans for Laguna Laurel."  </P> <P> BONNIE CHANGSTRON-SIMON  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / New Paris fashions survive on old money THE WORLD'S most expensive fashion collections will be unveiled in Paris this weekend with the start of the autumn haute couture fashion shows. Logic suggests that couture - very pricey at Pounds 10,000 for a hand-made suit or Pounds 30,000 for an evening dress - should be one of the most vulnerable areas of the depressed luxury goods industry. And sales did indeed fall at the onset of the world recession, but recently the market has shown surprising resilience. The turnover of the Paris couture houses remained stable at Pounds 32m last year, according to the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. This compares with an overall decline of 10 per cent in sales of French designer fashion during 1991. The nouveau riche customers who treated themselves to couture in the mid-1980s - on the back of success in the stock and property markets - stopped spending when those markets collapsed in the late 1980s. But the Paris houses have been left with a small, solid base of loyal customers armed with old money. Despite this resilience, couture is still a loss-making venture, governed by arcane rules. The Chambre Syndicale regulates the number of styles each house must show and the seamstresses they should employ under rules dating back to the late 1940s. The Paris houses continue with their loss-making couture businesses because of the publicity they attract for the perfume, sunglasses and cheaper fashion lines with which they really make money. There will be 750 journalists and 400 photographers covering the current couture collections. Such an enormous media presence has encouraged other designers, who do not show under the auspices of the Chambre Syndicale, to stage events in Paris at the same time as the official collections. The first couture show this weekend will be that of Gianni Versace, the flamboyant Milan designer who is not a Chambre Syndicale member. Such unofficial events, combined with the financial problems of some smaller couture houses, have prompted the French government to review the Chambre Syndicale's rules. The review should be completed by the end of this year. Suited to the high life, Weekend FT</p>

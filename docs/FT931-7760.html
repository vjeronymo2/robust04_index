			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major agrees to meet Rushdie MR JOHN MAJOR has agreed in principle to hold a meeting with Mr Salman Rushdie, the British author who has spent four years under threat of death from Iran for his book The Satanic Verses, Alison Smith writes. At the weekend, Mr Rushdie appeared on television to appeal for a meeting with Mr Major to strengthen his efforts to have the fatwa removed. The prime minister has not yet, however, decided whether the meeting should be private or whether to be photographed with Mr Rushdie as a clear message to Iran that the threat must be lifted.</p>

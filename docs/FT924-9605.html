			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Major lives on to fight another day - Philip Stephens reports that last night's vote may prove to be a turning point for the government IT WAS as nerve-racking as it was dangerous. But Mr John Major lives to fight another day. Last night's vote on the Maastricht treaty was his first political success since sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism threw his government into crisis on September 16. It marked a step along the road to rehabilitation. Even so, there are plenty of obstacles still to be cleared. The prime minister's confidence, drained by the collapse of his economic policy on Black Wednesday and by a succession of political miscalculations subsequently, has received a significant boost. He gambled his political future on Europe. He won, albeit by a hair's breadth. His performance in yesterday's debate was one of his strongest since the general election. He nodded frequently in the direction of the soft Euro-sceptics - offering reassurances that there would be no single currency, no common defence policy, no cession of control over immigration. But his strongest and most important message was the one central to the debate: Britain has a choice whether to remain at the centre of events in Europe or slink away to the fringes. What Mr Major is inclined to describe as a struggle for the soul of the Tory party has not been settled conclusively. The Euro-sceptics are a resilient bunch. But enough in his party realised as they trooped through the Commons division lobbies at 10pm last night that there was nothing to be gained from destroying the prime minister. His premiership has lost the brief magic that accompanied his April general election victory. For the moment, though, his party has decided it has nowhere else to go. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, is a serious loser. He judged that to hold his party together he had to lead them into the lobbies against the government. But Labour's Europeanism has been tarnished. Attacks on the Liberal Democrats for their support for Mr Major will not soothe the his own party's obvious discomfort. If Mr Major heeds the advice of elder statesmen such as Lord Whitelaw he will now tread carefully, seeking to rebuild his authority on the Tory back benches with calm self-confidence rather than with unnecessary confrontations. In the metaphor of one experienced backbench Tory, his government must stop putting padlocks on fire exits and then throwing away the key. Flexibility is occasionally a sign of strength. Mr Major has won the point on Europe. With Labour unlikely to oppose the legislation in the substantive debates that will follow, the Euro-sceptics have lost their best chance to wreck the ratification process. So the prime minister can go to next month's Edinburgh summit with tangible evidence that he is true to his word. His European partners will have seen his political problems, but if they still hold hopes for Maastricht it will be in their interest to help rather than hinder him. His priority now must be the economy. The disgruntlement on his back benches reflects more than anything else the government's failure to deliver economic recovery. The reality rather than the empty promise of an end to the recession could transform the political landscape. The prime minister must convince his own supporters - and the country at large - that he can construct an economic policy which will deliver that recovery. It will not be easy. The cabinet bargaining on the share-out of the Pounds 244.5bn public-spending cake for next year has been less than edifying. The limited resources in the Treasury's contingency reserve have been more than absorbed by higher spending on unemployment-related benefits, on EC farm spending, on the expansion of tertiary education and on a sharp increase in legal aid. Everyone else is facing a sharp reduction in previously agreed budgets. They are warning of dire consequences inside and outside Westminster. The council tax bills that will land on doormats in the south of England next spring threaten a political explosion comparable to that over the government's ill-fated coal closures plan. In spite of the promise of some creative accounting, the final decisions across all Whitehall programmes will be harsher than expected. It will take considerable sleight of hand to dress up a freeze or sharp restriction on public-sector pay, large job losses in defence-related industries, and a squeeze on state benefits as an Autumn Statement for recovery. So the accompanying package of measures will have to be convincing. An interest rate cut is regarded on the Conservative backbenches as a sine qua non. But there will have to be other measures of substance - to boost the construction industry, to steady consumer confidence - if the government's supporters are to be convinced the spending cuts are a price worth paying. Last night Mr Major could raise his head and smile for the first time in nearly two months. It might prove a turning point for a government that has looked hell-bent on self-destruction. But the House of Commons did not write the prime minister a blank cheque. For now, all he can claim is a line of credit.</p>

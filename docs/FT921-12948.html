			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Germany presses for IMF block over Soviet debts FORMER Soviet republics like Ukraine, which have yet to sign the western-inspired memorandum of understanding on repaying the debts of the former Soviet Union, could be refused membership of the International Monetary Fund. Germany will press the Group of Seven to block membership for those not prepared to honour Soviet debts, not with the aim of excluding them, but rather to force them into line. Ukraine is by far the most important of the four which have so far refused to accept responsibility. The others are Azerbaijan, Georgia and Uzbekistan. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940, have rejected responsibility for a share of the Soviet debt apart from that related to projects in the Baltic states. Germany, the largest creditor of the former Soviet Union, is determined that 'a country cannot become a member of the IMF without accepting its responsibility for its debts,' according to officials in Bonn. That means in effect that they will be compelled to sign the memorandum of understanding. At the same time Germany is hoping for the speediest possible incorporation of the ex-Soviet republics into the IMF, in order to give them access both to credits and expertise. Officials in Bonn believe that a letter of intent on a Fund programme for Russia could be agreed by the end of February, submitted to the IMF board in March, and full membership of the Fund could follow in April, clearing the way for IMF credits. The most difficult problem is that of quotas for the former Soviet republics within the fund: the debate ranges from a lower limit of 3 per cent, to an upper limit of 6 per cent. The difference concerns whether intra-republican trade is taken into account: if the former Soviet Union had joined as a single unit, such trade would not have been considered. However given current fragmentation, intra-republican links have become external trade. The issue will be a key point on the agenda of the finance ministers' meeting of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in New York tomorrow. In Bonn, the attitude is that the quota is not fundamental, although given their huge economic problems, the greater access the republics have to IMF funds, underpinned by strict conditions, the better. Eight ex-Soviet republics - Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Kazakhstan, plus the three Baltic republics, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - have now applied to join the fund.</p>

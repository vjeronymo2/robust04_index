"Romania  has an important contribution to make, you have good relations  with the countries from the area. I think now is the proper  moment for Romania's influence on this conflict to be felt, "  mentioned the co-president for the European Community of the  International Conference on Former Yugoslavia. He added that  the true dimension of the losses suffered in consequence of the  enforcement of the embargo are known, and so are the disbalances  that have appeared among compensations for the neighbors of  former Yugoslavia. The European Union is in charge of giving  compensations to Romania, but it has not done enough in this  respect, said Owen who gave assurances that the efforts of the  Romanian Government would be given due response.    As for the continuation of the peace process, the mediator  said that the plan of action drafted by the European Union was  being examined by the three parties in conflict.    As for the intention of a number of Muslim leaders, that is  of troops to be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina under the aegis of  the United Nations, Lord Owen mentioned that the Muslim  countries had had access from the very start and Egypt had even  sent troops to Sarajevo. Malaysia and Pakistan announced their  readiness to participate in the UN actions in that area. What  will follow, that will be decided by the UN Secretariat-General.  The strategy used as a rule is not to involve the countries in  the proximity of the conflict, and in this case the strategy  also refers to the non-involvement of Muslim countries in the  conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina."</p>

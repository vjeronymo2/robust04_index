			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Why Monday to Friday off is not an easy life: Diane Summers reads between the lines of the Post Office's short week deal FOR at least one group of workers in British industry, the much-heralded Leisure Age has finally arrived. Post Office maintenance engineers have signed an historic deal that will enable them to enjoy a 22-hour working week for a full week's money. Naturally, the arrangement is not as idyllic for the workers as it might initially sound. The 22 hours will be concentrated into the weekend, starting at 3.30pm on Friday afternoon and ending at 7am on Monday morning. The short hours will only be available for part of the year - probably April to July - and will depend on the workloads rather than be guaranteed each week. Nevertheless, there must have been many employees in other sectors who read of the deal yesterday and wondered when it would be their turn. If the price of getting Monday to Friday off work is having to work two shifts of up to 12 hours over the weekend, then many would consider it worth paying. So is the Post Office agreement the first glimmer of the dawn of the Leisure Age? In the 1960s it was thought that labour-saving devices, the rapid development of technology and medical advances prolonging life, would lead to such an excess of leisure time that disposing of it would be the question. Employment continues to be unevenly distributed, with part of the population suffering stress-related illnesses because of working too many hours, while the unemployed endure the opposite situation. Unions have tended to reinforce the pattern because of short-term fears that their members would lose overtime payments. According to government figures, more than 1m members of the 25m workforce are 'double-jobbers' who hold down two jobs. Surprisingly, even during the recession, substantial amounts of overtime have continued to be worked: in February, seasonally adjusted figures showed more than 10m hours of overtime being worked each week in manufacturing. That compared with a peak of more than 16m hours in April 1979 and a low of 8.5m hours in March 1981 during the last recession. With the overtime, British men continue to work longer hours than men anywhere else in the European Community. Some reductions have been made, principally after a campaign by engineering unions that resulted in a cut from 39 hours to 37 hours for hundreds of thousands of workers. A further push to a 35-hour week, common among white-collar workers, is being delayed by unions until after the recession. Rather than being driven by Leisure Age considerations, the Post Office deal is an indication of quite another trend, according to Mr Alastair Hatchett from Incomes Data Services, the pay and conditions research group. Employers are, for reasons of economy, increasingly seeking to eliminate premium payments for overtime and integrate unsocial hours working into the normal working week. There are a number of ways of doing so, including the move to annualised hours which means employees contract to work a total number of hours over the year, rather than on a week-by-week basis. That system is particularly effective in allowing employers to deal with peaks and troughs in demand. Manual workers at Hotpoint factories in north Wales work variable hours depending on seasonal demand for domestic appliances. The National Communications Union, which has negotiated the Post Office 22-hour deal, is only too aware of another way employers commonly cope with those peaks and troughs - by hiring and firing staff in time with workloads. The Post Office's own construction and maintenance operation now has to tender for work with outside contractors. Many of those contractors will not be burdened - as the Post Office itself has been - with having to pay workers when there is little to do during the week, while also shelling out for weekend overtime. According to Mr Bill Fry, NCU president, the Post Office agreement is a breakthrough that might provide an example of the way forward for unions and employers in other sectors. 'We are endeavouring to protect people's jobs - that's my retort when some members complain they could lose overtime,' he says.</p>

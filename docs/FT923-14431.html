			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Syria destroys Lebanese drug crop a prime source of funds for Hizbollah Islamic fundamentalists - has been wiped out by the Syrian army. The valley has long been one of the world's principal centres for growing illegal drugs but policing was non-existent during Lebanon's civil war. However, the subsequent large presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon and Syria's powerful influence in the country, with which Damascus signed broad 'co-operation' agreements last year, made the task of clearing the Bekaa feasible. The world's other main illegal opium production areas are in Afghanistan, Pakistan and south-east Asia. New fields have also been sown this year in the former Soviet Union, with traffickers taking advantage of current turmoil. The UN says the Bekaa crackdown is not going to stop trafficking, but it has disrupted European supplies. As a probable result, there have been shortages of cannabis on the illegal British market for several months. The Syrian crackdown started soon after talks between President Hafez al-Assad and Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, about the time of last year's Gulf War. Mr Baker is believed to have suggested that tackling Lebanon's role in supplying a significant part of the world illegal drugs market might be one way Syria could improve relations with the US and western Europe. The United Nations Drug Control Programme in Vienna carried out a snap inspection five weeks ago, when poppies should have been in bloom and cannabis plants growing strongly. Mr Bernard Frahi, a former police superintendent in France who led the inspection, said yesterday the crackdown has dealt a strong blow to illegal drug trafficking. 'The Syrian army just got on with it, beginning last year when they seem to have eradicated about 80 per cent of the crops. This year they finished the job,' Mr Frahi added. Some groups in Beirut claimed growing is still going on, but were unable to produce evidence to the UN's three-man team, which had free access to the valley. Photographs taken by the team show the Bekaa - about 75 miles long by eight miles wide - looking like a large ploughed field. Two years ago, photographs from similar positions show purple-white opium poppies as far as the eye can see. The team's unpublished report on the inspection says there has been an immediate effect on the drugs market. Raw opium for processing into morphine and heroin is now so short its price in Beirut has rocketed from Dollars 70 a tonne to more than Dollars 500. According to Syrian estimates, up to 12,500 acres in the Bekaa were planted with opium and up to 40,000 acres with cannabis, yielding 50 tonnes of opium and 1,000 tonnes of hashish. The opium would then be refined into about five tonnes of heroin. The Lebanese civil war allowed easy bulk shipment by sea, with profits helping to fund the fighting. With peace and tighter Syrian control, six 'controlled delivery' operations have been carried out from Lebanon this year, leading to drug seizures in Germany, the US, Britain and France. Mr Frahi said tighter policing was also preventing drug smuggling across Syria. Cultivation in the Bekaa was split between a large local family with 5,000 members, Hizbollah activists, smaller families and individual farmers. Many are now struggling to subsist by growing lettuce, tomatoes and potatoes, but are losing money because of the cost of seeds, fertiliser and irrigation. Illegal drugs are low-cost, low-maintenance crops, and farmers told the UN team they will revert to growing them if they get the chance. However, Syrian generals say there will be no let-up.</p>

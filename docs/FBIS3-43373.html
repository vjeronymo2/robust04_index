			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Cease-Fire Commission met in Maputo this  afternoon. Radio Mozambique learned that 600 Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo] soldiers abandoned two confinement centers  in Sofala Province. Faustino Igrejas reports:    It is true that 600 Renamo men today abandoned their  confinement centers in Chiramba and Magunde in Sofala Province,  alleging logistical problems. The Cease-Fire Commission met in  Maputo today and centered its discussions on the logistical  problems facing the confinement centers. Major Eduardo  Alexandre from the Cease-Fire Commission spoke to journalists  after the meeting.    [Begin recording] [Alexandre] We discussed mainly issues  connected with food logistics in confinement centers. It has  been observed that in certain confinement centers, Renamo troops  are deserting. I refer to Magunde and Chiramba in particular.  The meeting is therefore aimed at finding ways of halting these  desertions.    [Unidentified reporter] What was decided?    [Alexandre] It was decided that the government would support  its troops during the confinement period, providing them fresh  products.    [Reporter] Has Renamo already begun to withdraw from Dunda  and Salamanga?    [Alexandre] As a matter of fact, we shall discuss this  problem tomorrow, from the technical viewpoint. It is a  situation connected with distance. Renamo feels that it should  withdraw only 700 meters, while the (?government) feels that  they should withdraw further.    [Reporter] Tomorrow's meeting is therefore aimed at  discussing Renamo's withdrawal from Dunda and Salamanga?    [Alexandre] Tomorrow we shall hold the biggest tripartite  meeting to discuss the area Renamo should withdraw to from the  area it presently occupies. [end recording]    Radio Mozambique also asked Colonel (Sitela) from the UN  Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] if he would confirm that 600  Renamo men abandoned their confinement centers in Chiramba and  Magunde.    [Begin recording] [(Sitela)] Yes. I can confirm that from  the information we received.    [Unidentified reporter] Is it because of logistical  problems?    [(Sitela)] I do not know. We [words indistinct] the problem  to the Renamo representative [words indistinct]. It is possible  that it is because of logistical problems.    [Reporter] It seems that the Unomoz had a responsibility,  but  the government says it has no responsibility?    [(Sitela)] Well, I feel that we were able to coordinate  views  during the Cease-Fire Commission meeting that we have just held.  We defined the manner to provide logistical assistance.    [Reporter] What will be the manner?    [(Sitela)] The government will continue to supply fresh food  to its own troops in their confinement areas, including other  staples which are already being distributed to the two sides by  Unomoz. With regard to Renamo, Unomoz will have the duty of  supplying fresh food to Renamo personnel. Thus, the two sides  will (?be able to receive) a more favorable (?food supply).  Unomoz will be responsible for providing the transportation of  food for Renamo personnel, while the government will in  principle be responsible for providing transportation of food to  its men. If the government needs assistance in the process,  Unomoz will do all it can to help. [end recording]    An important thing is that the 600 men who abandoned their  confinement areas in Chiramba and Magunde in Sofala Province  today left without their weapons.</p>

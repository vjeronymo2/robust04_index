			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEPHONE WORKERS IN MIDWEST JOIN STRIKE  </P> <P> Telephone company workers in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin  joined the ranks of striking "Baby Bell" employees on both coasts as a walkout  against three companies entered its second week Monday.  </P> <P> No talks were scheduled between Ameritech and representatives for 35,000  unionized workers in the Midwest, who declared a strike early Sunday, said a  spokeswoman for Illinois Bell.  </P> <P> About 13,000 International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers settled last  month.  </P> <P> One company, Bell Atlantic, offered the Communications Workers of America a  revised offer regarding medical benefits at a bargaining session in Washington,  company spokesman Larry Plumb said, but he did not give details.  </P> <P> Bill Bickers, a spokesman for the CWA, said the union's 41,000 members remained  pessimistic. "We're at about the same place we were when we went on strike"  eight days ago, he said Monday.  </P> <P> As the strike continued from coast to coast, incidents of vandalism were  reported at several local telephone company sites.  </P> <P> In New York, a vehicle struck and injured a picket outside a New York Telephone  Co. facility in Valhalla.  </P> <P> At another New York phone company site in Elmont, police investigated a bomb  threat and a fire that officials said was deliberately set to a company car.  </P> <P> The CWA and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers unions struck  Aug. 6 against Pacific Telesis telephone companies in California and Nevada,  Bell Atlantic, and NYNEX in the Northeast and New England, idling more than  150,000 employees.  </P> <P> No new talks were scheduled with union representatives and Pacific Telesis,  NYNEX and at Michigan Bell, officials said.  </P></p>

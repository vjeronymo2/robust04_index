			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, March 31 (AFP) -- A total of 48 policemen  were wounded, seven hospitalised, and 300 people arrested as  marches Thursday [31 March] to celebrate victory over Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur ended in violence, police said.    Two of the policemen were stabbed, officials said.    More than 200 vehicles were damaged, a dozen fires started  as  several groups of marchers got out of control, smashing up to  sixty shop front windows and looting several shops, police said.    The rallies were called to celebrate a climbdown by Balladur  over a cut-price youth wage scheme. Police estimated the number  of Paris marchers at 26,000.    "Despite repeated appeals from the organisers and the  security forces for people to disperse, several hundred  individuals refused to leave," police said in a statement.    In Nantes in western France, up to a thousand youths were  continuing to confront police late Thursday after several hours  of head-on battles.    Earlier, around 20,000 people had marched through the town,  organizers said, though the police put the figure at 16,000.    One person had been arrested and several shop fronts had  been  smashed in the clashes, police sources said.    Police charged the demonstrators and scattered many of them  with tear gas cannisters and water cannon.</p>

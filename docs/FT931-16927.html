			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Stock markets slow down on road to convergence / A look at the impact of instability in Europe during the past year on equity investment WHEN investors no longer care where a company is based, Europe's stock markets will finally have converged. A year ago, that process looked well under way. Everything argued for convergence: the imminence of the EC's single market; the steady progress towards European monetary union, the increasing firmness of the exchange rate mechanism; the negotiations to create a European Economic Area linking Sweden, Switzerland and Austria to the 12. Big brokerage houses had reorganised their research departments to carry out pan-European sectoral analysis; equity strategists were wondering how to allocate pension fund assets under Emu. It seemed to be a question of when, not whether, European equity markets would converge. In the bond markets, many investors were already convinced. Arguing that Emu would lead to equalisation of interest rates at around the German level, convergence enthusiasts saw bargains in high-yielding European bond markets such as the UK, Spain and Italy. Equity markets would follow the same path, it seemed. True, doubts persisted about how long convergence would take. The institutional plumbing necessary for an integrated European stock market was lacking. Substantial national differences in accounting and tax practices remained. On the other hand, there was solid factual underpinning for stock market convergence, as the chart shows. In 1987, for example, all but two markets showed double-digit divergences from the European mean. Spain out-performed the European average by 35 per cent; Germany under-performed it by 27 per cent. By 1991, the markets were moving more closely together. Only one diverged by more than 10 per cent from the average - Italy, which under-performed by 13 per cent. The others were clustered closely together, rarely out- or under-performing by more than 5 per cent. Convergence seemed on its way. A year later, these hopes have been badly damaged. Currency stability has been undermined by devaluations by Britain, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, Finland and Norway. Equity markets have reacted to the devaluations by marking up shares sharply in most of those countries, leading to noticeable differences of performance. In 1992 as a whole, five out of eight big European equity markets diverged from the average by more than 10 per cent, the largest such group since 1987. The devaluations were not the only forces at work. Switzerland said 'No' to membership of the EEA; Denmark joined Britain in obtaining an escape route from Emu; the once-smooth road from an ever-harder ERM to full-scale monetary union looked strewn with obstacles. None the less, some powerful trends continue to push in the direction of convergence: Company earnings. Diversification and the single European market are likely to bring the earnings cycle among big European companies closer together. By buying into the US, German and French companies have reduced their heavy dependence on European markets. British companies have bought more heavily into continental Europe, reducing their past emphasis on English-speaking markets. The progressive reduction of barriers to trade within the EC and the wider EEA will also make European companies look more like each other. By managing production and pricing on a pan-European basis, big companies are likely to compete away each others' home market advantages. When every big business is Europe-wide, all are likely to show similar results. Valuation. European bourses are already starting to value those earnings flows in a consistent way. 'Roughly comparable companies tend to be valued pretty similarly,' says Mr Nick Stevenson, European equity strategies at Warburg Securities. 'For example, Italian companies seem to be valued roughly in line with northern European companies, and thus to look expensive compared with local interest rates.' Using valuation measures that minimise the differences between national accounting and tax policies - such as the ratio of a company's share price to its net cash flow - throws up striking similarities of valuation. Of the 30 European engineering companies covered by Warburg's analysts, for instance, the prices of most lie between 3.8 and 5.8 times cash flow. In the car industry, the big European makers are mostly valued at around 2.5 to 3 times cash flow. 'You can't actually say that certain markets value certain companies in different ways,' says Mr Stevenson. Investor attitudes. The growth of funded pensions schemes - until recently largely an Anglo-Dutch phenomenon but now an increasingly important factor in Switzerland and likely to prove so in France - is a powerful spur to institutional investor power. So is privatisation of state-owned financial institutions, already promised in Italy and possible in France if a non-socialist government comes into power in the spring elections. A debate on corporate govern- ance is also under way in Germany. Though the process will vary from country to country, fund managers are likely to press for a similar agenda: transparent accounting, equal treatment for all shareholders, proper takeover rules, a greater emphasis on shareholders' interests and attention to profits rather than size. Taken together, these forces will ensure that convergence continues despite 1992's setbacks. Mr Gordon Anderson, senior vice- president in charge of global equity trading at Commerzbank in Frankfurt argues that the process will take a long time, and it will probably not result, as some visionaries believed a year or so ago, in a focus on pan-European sectors to the exclusion of country or currency considerations. 'The country allocation comes first' for international investors, Mr Anderson says. 'But they are already very interested in comparing Barclays, for example, and Commerzbank.' In time, he says, the relative weight given to the two axes of analysis, country and sector, will shift - slowly, almost imperceptibly. But the country decision will remain important. Mr Reinhard Fischer - who covers German stocks from London for Paribas, the French bank - says that convergence will be made longer and more arduous by the effects of German re-unification. German managers will reverse their progress towards more transparent accounting by dumping the bad news brought about by re-unification into the 1992 financial year. Harmonising EC corporate taxation will be harder because the bill for re-unification makes cutting Germany's high corporate taxes much more difficult. Perhaps the most important effect of 1992's upsets, however, is that it will confirm investors in their habit of looking first at currencies and countries, and only secondly at sectors and companies. Commerzbank's Mr Anderson says: 'I've been in the business for 30 years  - and it's as true as it's always been that if you get the currency judgment right, you're likely to make money.' As long as investors profit from taking that view, Europe's equity markets will not truly have converged.</p>

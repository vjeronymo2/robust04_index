			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Bristol lobbies for EC cash aid A BID for much of the Bristol area to receive European Community regional aid to counter industrial decline was submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry yesterday. The designated area stretches from Filton in north Bristol, the home of a British Aerospace plant, to Hartcliffe, a deprived part of south Bristol. It has seen the loss of more than 6,500 industrial jobs because of the recession and cuts in defence and aerospace. The local unemployment rate is 19 per cent. Mr Graham Robertson, leader of Bristol City Council, said: 'The area's economic strength has been sapped to a degree that ought to make it a prime candidate for EC help.' The city council, with the county council, Northavon district council and Western Development Partnership, Avon's newly formed economic lobby group, are making the case for Objective 2 status, which gives access to EC funds for areas of industrial decline. The existing Objective 2 map is being redrawn and the DTI will forward its proposals for areas to be included to Brussels by the end of the month. Aided projects will have to have matching public or private finance. The UK's total allocation of Objective 2 funds for next year has yet to be decided by the EC. A joint bid for EC regional aid has been submitted to the DTI by the county councils in Staffordshire and Derbyshire in conjunction with the Peak Park Planning Board. The councils are seeking Objective 5b status to help modernise rural areas. Bristol Airport, owned by the city council, yesterday reported record pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.9m for the year to March 31, up 211 per cent on the previous year. Passenger traffic rose by nearly a third to 1.1m. People, Page 16</p>

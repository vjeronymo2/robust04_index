			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Collor written back into Brazil soap: Critics and reformers see ex-president's acquittal as setback The case of Mr Fernando Collor, jet setting Brazilian president who quit in 1992 amid corruption allegations, has often been likened to one of the country's novelas, or TV soap operas. With the Supreme Court's decision on Monday to throw out the charges, Mr Collor has been written back into the script. The court's decision greatly increases Mr Collor's chances of staging a political comeback and running again for public office. If successful, he would provide a reminder to Brazil's Congress and judicial systems of how much remains to be done for the country's political process to be modernised and corruption weeded out. Senator Dirceu Carneiro, who two years ago served notice on Mr Collor that impeachment proceedings were under way, said the court ruling was a serious setback in the country's attempts to tackle impunity: 'Brazil has always suffered from an inability to punish the powerful. After several years of progress, this ruling is very worrying.' Mr Collor resigned just before Congress completed the impeachment proceedings against him. He faced a single charge of 'passive corruption' which alleged he and his campaign treasurer Mr Paulo Cesar Farias had swapped political influence for financial gain. Although Mr Farias was given a seven years' prison sentence for setting up false bank accounts through which funds were channelled, the court decided there was insufficient evidence to link Mr Collor to Mr Farias' activities. Mr Collor has consistently claimed he was victim of a political plot. The court's decision will let him maintain the claim, even though most Brazilians remain convinced Mr Collor did use the president's office for personal gain. In an opinion poll conducted before the trial, 60 per cent of people asked said they thought he should go to jail for his actions, although nearly 90 per cent thought he would not have to. Mr Alexandre Barros, a political consultant, said: 'If you belong to the elites, like Mr Collor does, you get judged by your peers and get off, while people from outside the elites like PC Farias get punished.' Armed with the court's ruling Mr Collor may appeal against a separate Senate ban on his holding public office until the year 2000. Even If the appeal fails, Mr Collor would still be young enough to compete in the 2002 presidential and gubernatorial elections. According to rumours in the capital Braslia, Mr Collor plans to visit New York to meet his younger brother, Pedro, who first triggered the corruption scandal with a series of allegations in a magazine interview. The two brothers have not talked since, but Pedro is extremely ill with cancer. Fernando, who has always been an expert at political marketing, may want to use the reconciliation as part of a wider reconstruction of his image in the Brazilian media. 'The 70 per cent of the electorate who lack a decent education will love it, because it is straight out of a novela,' says Mr Luiz Pedone, a political scientist at Brasilia University. He adds that Mr Collor's current high unpopularity will fade. Although Brazil may never be ready to elect Mr Collor as president again, he could easily win the governorship or a senate seat in his home state, Alagoas. The biggest casualty of the court's decision is likely to be the confidence of those seeking to modernise Brazil's political system. Mr Collor's removal from office was seen as the most important example of progress, under way since the country's return to democracy in 1985. 'It now seems the optimism that we had started to tackle corruption was false,' according to says Mr Pedone. The tide of pessimism triggered by the ruling may hide an important lesson, that tackling corruption will take many years rather than one ousted president. Observers say that while Brazilian corruption is no worse than in many countries, what makes Brazil's version so corrosive is that the country's institutions, still maturing after the years of military rule, allow a sense of impunity to prevail.</p>

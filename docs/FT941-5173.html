			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Personal View: Special care for young companies - Does the UK need a stock market for entrepreneurs? Ronald Cohen offers his views In the next few months, the London Stock Exchange is due to decide whether a separate market is needed, alongside the main 'official list', to replace the Unlisted Securities Market, which the exchange plans to close. The debate can be reduced to a simple question: can one market cater for both large, stable companies and smaller, more innovative, faster growing, but less stable entrepreneurial ones? Experience in the US and UK suggests that the answer is no. Entrepreneurial growth companies can be defined in this context as greenfield ventures, and companies with a short trading record, management buy-outs or buy-ins and companies in high-growth and high-technology sectors. In the US, the Nasdaq exchange opened in 1971 in response to the burgeoning 'over the counter' market for unlisted shares. By the end of 1993, Nasdaq had 4,600 companies trading on it, double the number trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Traditionally the market has been for entrepreneurial companies, especially those focusing on growth sectors such as electronics and biotechnology. But 60 per cent of today's most actively traded stocks in the US are listed on Nasdaq. During the US recession, the number of 'initial public offerings' - the first time a company's stock is offered to the public - fell from 570 in 1986 to 135 in 1990. Since then it has risen rapidly to 520 in 1993, the third-highest number since the market's opening. Nasdaq clearly has a distinct identity which appeals to entrepreneurial companies. In contrast, the NYSE caters solely for larger, more stable companies. The average market capitalisation of the 2,331 companies traded on it at the end of 1993 was Dollars 457m, against Dollars 216m for Nasdaq. In the UK, the USM was established 10 years later than Nasdaq, also largely in response to a growing over-the-counter market. It was cheaper and easier to access than the Official List, and its companies were typically smaller, younger and more entrepreneurial than those on the Official List. The fall in the number of new issues during the recession, from 103 in 1988 to seven in 1992, was more extreme than Nasdaq, but the volume of shares traded almost doubled between 1992 and 1993 (despite only five new issues last year) as interest in smaller companies revived. The fall in new issues was exacerbated in 1990 by EC directives on the regulation of financial markets which eroded some of the differences between the regulations and costs of the USM and the Official List, and by the announcement of the USM's impending closure, due in early 1996. The stock exchange, instead of anticipating the EC directives and maintaining a gap with the Official List by eliminating the requirement for a trading record on the USM in line with Nasdaq, interpreted the drop in the number of companies wishing to float as evidence of insufficient demand for such a market. Two pieces of evidence are often used to justify the claim that the Official List caters effectively for all companies. First, the recent rush of new issues on the Official List - 180 during 1993, many of which were regarded as entrepreneurial companies which would in normal circumstances have gone to the USM. In fact this was partly because the market did not function as it should have in recession while, with a recovery in sight and a bull market, enthusiasm to invest in these companies has returned as investors know that they generally perform better than larger, more stable ones at this stage of the cycle. Second, the stock exchange's recent decision to relax its entry criteria for the Official List and allow access to healthcare companies with no trading record. But why should biotechnology companies be singled out? Will the rules also be relaxed for other sectors such as electronics, special materials or interactive media? In fact it is possible that the decision to relax the rules will be reversed as soon as some of these companies fail, as they inevitably will. The exchange may view such failures among entrepreneurial companies as a taint on its position as a leading market for the largest companies. Its board, drawn from those primarily interested in large companies, may seek to protect the image of the Official List by adding new restrictions. Already, by closing the USM, it has effectively raised the minimum trading record for companies seeking a listing from two to three years. It has also introduced rules for biotechnology companies which state that directors and promoters of these companies cannot sell shares for two years when the equivalent lock-up period imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US is six months. The risk is that, in the next recession, these companies will find that access to equity through the Official List is again restricted to large companies. So a specialist market for high-growth entrepreneurial companies is essential. A particular management and marketing focus is needed to run a market that directs attention to the activities of entrepreneurial companies and attracts entrepreneurs. Nasdaq has succeeded, not because of the trading system it employs nor its rule book, but because it is managed independently of the NYSE and the American Stock Exchange. It has a dedicated management team whose objectives are to sustain it through both the good and the bad times in the economy, to exploit opportunities and to defend it from external threats. Nasdaq has developed and sustained an image as the market for entrepreneurial growth companies, attracting new companies in new sectors as new technologies evolve. It is this focus which attracts specialist marketmakers, bankers, brokers and institutional and private investors, who are primarily interested in entrepreneurial companies. Their involvement strengthens the market's ability to finance companies in recession and recovery. This specialist market should be as highly regulated against fraud, as the Official List should cater for both institutional and private investors, and should be independently managed by a team with a specialist knowledge of entrepreneurial companies. In order to maximise liquidity, it should be seen as the first constituent of a pan-European market which would link national markets for entrepreneurial companies across the European Union. It is clear, in the light of US experience, that the stock exchange cannot cater for all types of companies through a single market. If it wishes to provide an effective marketplace for entrepreneurial companies, in bear and bull markets alike, it can only do so through a separate market, independently managed and enjoying a distinctive identity.

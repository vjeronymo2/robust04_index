			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: SFO admits it was warned of plans to escape THE SERIOUS Fraud Office admitted yesterday that it was tipped off about Mr Asil Nadir's plans to flee the UK two days before he jumped bail and left for northern Cyprus. But although police issued a standard warning to all major ports and airports, no individual surveillance operation was mounted on Mr Nadir or his Belgravia home. Mr Nadir was therefore still able to slip out of the country in a chartered private jet aircraft. The decision not to mount a surveillance operation on Mr Nadir followed a series of previous tip-offs that he might flee the country - all of which had proved false. It is understood that on at least two previous occasions following such warnings, police mounted extensive surveillance operations on Mr Nadir and his Eaton Square home where, as a condition of bail, he was required to spend his nights. In a highly unusual move to pre-empt possible criticism, the SFO yesterday issued a statement saying that following the last tip-off, the police had taken 'action appropriate to the circumstances'. It continued: 'Throughout the SFO investigation, information has been received on a number of occasions from a variety of sources suggesting that Mr Nadir might imminently abscond. All such information was followed up by the police and Nadir continued to comply with his bail conditions.' The anonymous tip came in the early hours of last Sunday morning from a man claiming to act on behalf of Mr Ramadan Guney, the Turkish businessman who put up a Pounds 1m surety for Mr Nadir's bail - a sum he now stands to loose. The SFO was yesterday given permission by an Old Bailey judge to issue a warrant for the re-arrest of Mr Nadir. During a short hearing, Detective Superintendent James Davis of the Metropolitan Police said Mr Nadir had reported to Savile Row police station on Monday evening according to his bail conditions. That evening was the last sighting of the Polly Peck chairman and the warrant will remain unenforceable unless Mr Nadir returns to Britain or is arrested in a country which has an extradition treaty with the UK. The SFO's main hope of bringing Mr Nadir to trial rests on informal diplomatic pressures on Turkey and northern Cyprus.</p>

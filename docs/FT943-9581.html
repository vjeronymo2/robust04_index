			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BPP advances 4% to Pounds 3.47m Shares in BPP Holdings rose 25p to 215p yesterday after the the education and training group announced increased profits and an improvement in the performance of Linguarama, its lossmaking language training subsidiary. Pre-tax profits rose 4 per cent to Pounds 3.47m (Pounds 3.34m) in the first half of 1994, helped by a strong performance from the professional training division. Turnover edged ahead from Pounds 24m to Pounds 24.7m. Linguarama, which plunged to a Pounds 728,000 loss last year, incurred an interim deficit of Pounds 30,000 (Pounds 40,000). However, it has broken even during the past three months, and management is optimistic of a profit for the second half. Linguarama suffered from the economic downturn in Europe, because it offers language services to businesses and has a strong presence on the Continent, particularly Germany. The language business has been restructured, with closures in Japan and Belgium, and although it has been forced to take on further price cuts, business volumes are finally recovering. The professional training division, which has focused recent expansion on building up its BPP Law school and bank training business, saw profits increase from Pounds 1.15m to Pounds 1.38m. Publishing was affected by the loss of a sizeable accountancy training client which has now turned competitor, and profits were down Pounds 127,000 at Pounds 1.27m. Markus Verbeek, the Dutch business training subsidiary, has seen further profits growth, but this will result in BPP having to pay about Pounds 5.5m when it buys out the 32.3 per cent minority shareholders in April. Academic education, which comprises the MPW sixth-form colleges, contributed Pounds 684,000 (Pounds 584,000). The most important time for the group's profits performance is during the next few months - the start of the academic year - when it achieves the bulk of sales for text books, distance learnings and A level courses. However, management is confident that improved economic conditions will result in further earnings recovery. The company recommended an interim dividend of 3.1p (3p), which tracked a 0.1p increase in earnings per share to 7.7p.</p>

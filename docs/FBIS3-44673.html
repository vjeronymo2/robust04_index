Gasanov arrived here this morning for a three-day official  visit as Qian's guest.    Qian said, as long ago as 2000 years, the famous "silk road"  built a friendship bridge between the two countries. After  Azerbaijan's independence and the setting up of China-Azerbaijan  diplomatic ties, the bilateral relations have entered a new  phase of development.    In the past two years the two sides have built up ties in  every field and on every level, and the bilateral relationship  has got a good beginning, he said.    Qian noted that China and Azerbaijan are both Asian  countries, and that they share common interests on many fronts.    China will try to develop long-term and steady relations  with  Azerbaijan on the basis of the five principles of co-existence,  Qian said.    The country will, with the help of Azerbaijan, enrich China-  Azerbaijan ties and expand the mutually beneficial co-operation  in economy, trade, technology and culture.    "We support Azerbaijan in its efforts to maintain its  independence and sovereignty, and in its efforts to develop its  economy," Qian said.    China is also willing to expand its co-operation with  Azerbaijan in world affairs, he said, adding that the country  supports all efforts aimed at bringing reasonable and peaceful  settlements to hot-spots the world over.    Gasanov expressed agreement with Qian's view. He said his  country attaches importance to its relations with China and that  it is willing to expand its friendly ties of co-operation with  China in every field.    During the meeting Gasanov briefed Qian on the latest  developments in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.    Qian expressed deep concern about the escalating conflict  and  the heavy casualties and material losses it has incurred.    China holds that country-to-country conflicts should be  settled through peaceful negotiations, Qian said. It sincerely  hopes the parties concerned will settle the conflict through  negotiations as soon as possible. This is not only in the  interests of the two peoples but conducive to the region's peace  and development.    "We are willing to promote, with the joint efforts of all  sides, the proper settlement of the conflict at an early date,"  Qian stressed.    Qian also briefed Gasanov on China's ties with other member  countries of the Commonwealth of Independence States.    After the meeting Qian and Gasanov signed four agreements on  behalf of their respective governments: An agreement on  consultations between the two foreign ministries, a consular  agreement, an agreement on visa exemption for public service  passport holders, and an agreement on visa exemption tourist  groups.</p>

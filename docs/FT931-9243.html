			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Complaints force banknote redesign THE Pounds 5, Pounds 10 and Pounds 20 banknotes are to be redesigned so that people can tell them apart more easily, the Bank of England said yesterday. The move follows a wave of complaints from people who find it hard to distinguish the new designs of notes because they are smaller and less colourful than earlier ones. The Bank disclosed plans to make the numerals more prominent following a suggestion in the House of Lords that taxi drivers have been given a new source of income by the ease with which passengers confuse the notes. The Bank will start by issuing a new version of the Pounds 5 note from March 1. The Pounds 5 symbol at the top left of the note will be changed to dark green from light blue to make it stand out against the pale pink background. Similar changes to Pounds 10 and Pounds 20 notes, which were introduced as part of the Bank's new Series E currency in 1991 and 1992, will follow this year. The Bank issues series of notes only once every 20 years, and tries to avoid interim changes. The Bank said yesterday it had received a growing number of complaints about the new notes. They were printed in paler colours in order to make forgery harder. The notes prompted a debate in the House of Lords at the end of last year, during which peers complained that cash transactions were being delayed because people now had to spend a long time examining their notes. The Bank said numerals had not been made very prominent because its research for the design of the new currency series had found that people generally identified banknotes by their size, shape and colour rather than currency symbols. The fact that it was hard to see the symbol on the Pounds 5 note did not attract much attention when it was issued in 1990, but the issue of the Pounds 10 and Pounds 20 notes added to confusion. The new Pounds 50 note will be adjusted before issue in 1994. The Bank said the 198m Pounds 5 notes now in circulation would gradually be withdrawn after March 1. The Bank originally considered making the notes in the series the same size, as well as less distinctively coloured. It changed its mind after representations from organisations for the blind, but nonetheless reduced the size of the notes. The smaller reduction in sizes combined with the paler colours meant people had to rely more on the currency symbols. An official said that the notes had been designed in paler 'washed-out' colour patterns because advances in photocopiers meant that brighter coloured notes would have been easier for forgers to copy using the latest high quality colour photocopiers.</p>

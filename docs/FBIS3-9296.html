			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zeman, director of the </F> Communications Section at the Ministry of Transport,  Communications, and Public Works, by Stefan Mesaros; place and  date not given: "Moments of Weakness and Influential Waves;  Wherein Lies the Problem of Radio Free Europe Broadcasts?"]    [Text] According to Engineer Vladimir Ondrovic, director  [general] of Slovak Telecommunications [ST], the one-day break  in Radio Free Europe [RFE] broadcasts in Slovakia on Wednesday  [16 March] was caused by the staff of the Ministry of Transport,  Communications, and Public Works. The "villain" who issued the  order supposedly was Engineer Vladimir Zeman, director of the  Communications Section at the Ministry of Transport,  Communications, and Public Works. How did he pull this off?  This is discussed by Eng. Zeman himself, who gave us an  interview.    [Mesaros] Are you really the person responsible for Eng.  Ondrovic's "moment of weakness," in which he signed the decree  on the abolition of RFE broadcasts in Slovakia?    [Zeman] I do not know who has moments of weakness or when,  but my opinion is that managers simply should not have them when  they sign important documents. I also consider unfair Eng.  Ondrovic's statement that I forced him to sign the document and,  subsequently, a copy of it. I think that he signed the document  quite voluntarily, of his own volition. As for the copy, why  would I need the same document again?    [Mesaros] Nevertheless, it seems strange that RFE broadcasts  were cut off at the time a new government was taking shape. Was  this not an act of defiance by the ministry's outgoing top  leadership?    [Zeman] Those who know the problems surrounding RFE  broadcasts know they have been dragging on for quite some time.  When someone tries to make the public believe that this issue  has only a political background, he is not telling the truth.  Some people may have the impression that politics, too, are  involved. Personally, I am interested only in the technical and  economic aspects of the matter. Apart from that, I ask myself  why, if these are supposed to be broadcasts for Slovakia, almost  80 percent of them are in Czech. Are we a sovereign state or  not? After all, the broadcasts for Poles are not in Russian but  in Polish! I stress, however, that these circumstances did not  determine the step that was taken.    [Mesaros] At the aforementioned news conference, Eng.  Ondrovic claimed that the RFE license, which entitles it to  broadcast in Slovakia, is in perfect order. If that is the  case, why were the broadcasts interrupted?    [Zeman] Apparently, he is not adequately informed. Had he  been adequately informed, he would have known that the  broadcasting license for RFE was issued by the former Federal  Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting. Besides the fact  that we have never renewed it, the issued license has a number  of formal shortcomings that make it virtually invalid. Far more  problems exist in the technical and economic spheres. In  January 1994, we proposed a solution to these problems with the  draft of a new contract. Had the RFE management approached this  matter more flexibly, the new contract, which is advantageous  for them as well as for us, could have been signed a long time  ago. Whereas at present they pay us $680,000 annually for the  transmission of the signal, under the new contract they would  pay $1.5 million, but for a signal of much better quality that  would cover a wider area. At the talks, they were also asked to  broadcast for ethnic minorities in the Slovak Republic, as well.    [Mesaros] Do your words imply that the new management of the  ministry, too, should reassess the terms under which RFE  broadcasts?    [Zeman] I subscribe to that view.    [Mesaros] As we have learned, Eng. Ondrovic, whom you  supposedly recalled [from the post of ST director general], has  been reinstated by the new minister. Are you still in your post?    [Zeman] First of all, I would like to say that I did not  have the authority to appoint or recall anyone to or from his  post. However, the fact that the new minister had to reappoint  Eng. Ondrovic bears out the fact that he had been recalled in a  legally valid way. Hence, when posing at his news conference on  Wednesday as ST director general, he was not right. As for me,  for the time being I am still in my previous post. In an  interview yesterday, the new minister said that he would be  assessing people according to their work performance. I had a  good impression from his words.</p>

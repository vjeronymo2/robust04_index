			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News (Results Preview): Bad tidings can expect no mercy - Profits are rising. But high share valuations imply companies can produce rapid earnings growth at a time of low inflation and slow economic growth. FT writers assess the prospects Bearing bad tidings is never an enviable role, but companies which reveal unexpectedly poor figures in this reporting season are likely to find the market in particularly unforgiving mood. Even bullish analysts and investment institutions are not immune to misgivings that some individual shares have been over-rated in the recent market surge. Companies which do disappoint are likely to find their fall from grace all the steeper as a result. Christian Salvesen, the distribution, specialist hire and food services group, got a foretaste of the market's mood last week when it announced a profits warning. The shares fell 16 per cent on the day and have subsequently drifted down to 25 per cent below their peak level in January. The Edinburgh-based group struck a downbeat note when announcing flat interim results in December, but analysts were still disappointed last week by the extent of competitive pressure on Aggreko, the group's specialist hire business, which had been a star performer in recent years. An important cause of the market's twitchiness was a greater wariness by companies towards contacts with analysts. This tightening up follows last year's censure by the Stock Exchange of LIG, the world's leading branded condom maker, for warning selected investors about a profits shortfall. While the authorities have made it clear they will jump on any attempt to 'drip-feed' bad news to the market, some companies have responded to this stricter reporting environment by issuing more regular trading statements. However, some groups, who might previously have tried to massage down expectations, may have baulked at issuing a full-scale profits warning. These restraints apply equally to the transmission of good news and some companies may indeed surprise the market with the quality of their results. However, the scope for upgrades is inevitably limited. At current market ratings, the immediate risk appears to be on the downside. Another important consideration is the performance of the sectors in which companies appear. Property groups and building and construction stocks have outperformed the market by nearly 50 per cent since the begining of last year, so there is room for short-term disappointment. By contrast, any cheer from food retailers, which have underperformed by 40 per cent over the same period, would be as welcome as it would be unexpected.</p>

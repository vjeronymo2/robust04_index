			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / The next cold war: Ice-cream makers are in dispute It is not yet high summer, but the temperature is nearing boiling point in Europe's ice-cream industry, where competition for the Pounds 6bn market has erupted into an acrimonious legal battle of the kind which keeps lawyers in Savile Row suits. The conflict has set Unilever, the big Anglo-Dutch consumer products group which dominates the business, against Mars, maker of chocolate bars, petfood and Uncle Ben's rice, which has shaken up the previously sedate world of ice cream since it stormed into the market three years ago. Invective is flying. Unilever executives describe Mars as a 'pirate', while managers of the private US company have shed their habitual secrecy to condemn Unilever as a greedy giant bent on freezing newcomers out of the market. At the heart of the dispute is control of distribution. This is a vital competitive weapon in every area of food manufacturing but is particularly important in ice cream, which must be kept refrigerated from factory to shop. Hostilities first broke out two years ago, when Unilever obtained a court injunction in Ireland preventing Mars ice cream from being stocked in retail freezer cabinets owned by Unilever. Mars appealed on the grounds that, by excluding rival products from its freezers, the Anglo-Dutch group was infringing EC competition rules. But two weeks ago the Irish High Court rejected the appeal. Meanwhile, Mars had opened up a second front by complaining to the European Commission about Unilever's freezer arrangements and about agreements used by Langnese-Iglo, a Unilever subsidiary, and Scholler, another big manufacturer, to exclude competitors from German retail outlets. In March, the Commission suspended until the end of the year the German retailer agreements, saying they would 'seriously and irreparably damage' Mars's business. It also promised to investigate the exclusive freezer arrangements which, it believed, restricted competition. Langnese and Scholler then appealed to the European Court of Justice, which last month lifted the Commission's suspension of the German retailer agreements while its learned members took time to acquaint themselves with the finer points of the ice-cream business. Yesterday, the court confirmed its suspension of the Commission order, but opened 18,000 German petrol stations to Mars freezers. As the peak ice-cream season gets under way - mid-June to mid-August - the main theatre of battle has shifted to the market. The summer trade depends heavily on 'impulse' sales, traditionally from small retail outlets, as opposed to 'take-home' purchases made in larger quantities at supermarkets. Mars has successfully penetrated the latter market, where exclusive freezer arrangements do not apply, but seeks future growth from impulse buys. Though these are less than half of ice-cream consumption by volume, they represent two-thirds of the value. That difference owes a lot to a recent shift towards higher-priced ice cream pioneered by Mars. Haagen-Dazs has recently taken the process a step further by creating a 'super-premium' market for even pricier ice cream. Mars's stroke of genius was to invent a market by developing ice-cream versions of its chocolate bars, which sell in the UK for about 60p. Their success has prompted traditional ice-cream makers, including Unilever, Scholler and Nestle, to launch rival products. Mars has built a Pounds 40m ice-cream factory near Strasbourg, eastern France, from which to supply the whole of Europe. But to be economic, the 50,000-tonne capacity plant needs large production volumes, which means big sales. Mars owns 14,000 non-exclusive retail freezer cabinets, mainly in the UK, and also has agreements to use freezers owned by rivals such as Clarke Foods in Britain. But Mars says it is costly to maintain its own freezers just to sell eight products. In any case, the company says, many small shops have room for only one freezer, which is often already supplied by Unilever. Simon Bullimore, UK managing director of Mars, argues that Unilever is unfairly weighting the odds against smaller rivals. 'It means only big competitors with a full range of products can enter the market,' he says. Unilever ripostes that such protestations sound hollow from a company with sales of more than Dollars 9bn a year. Furthermore, Unilever says its freezers are its property, in which it has invested large sums to buy and maintain. 'If Mars get a free ride in our freezers, the next thing they'll want is to use our factories,' snorts one executive. In any case, he says, the purpose of keeping cabinets exclusive is not to restrict competition but to ensure that products reach consumers in good condition and to simplify stock control. Predictably, Mars scoffs at such arguments. Each side says it will fight the legal battle to the end and insists it is confident of emerging victorious. Given that the wheels of Brussels bureaucracy and EC justice can turn exceedingly slowly, many more months are likely to pass before the ice-cream war is finally decided. But as Europe prepares to head for the beaches, Commission officials and European Court judges dealing with the case can at least look forward to the prospect of some enjoyable first-hand research.</p>

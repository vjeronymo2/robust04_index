			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Scientists strong on religion Sir, Professor John Postgate ('Religion: are we better off without it?' June 18/19) is mistaken in thinking that 'few scientists' are to be found holding 'religious beliefs'. Christians in Science is only one of a number of international organisations representing many thousands of Christians engaged in scientific research, a good number of them holding chairs of science in British universities. Considering the powerful impetus that the Christian world-view provided to the emergence of modern science in 17th century Europe, this substantial Christian presence within the scientific community is not surprising, since the two-way traffic of ideas between science and faith has continued unabated ever since. Prof Postgate's suggestion that 'scientists who are religious' have to 'close down' their critical faculty for religious work, is embarrassing in its inaccuracy. A steady stream of recent books by various scientists has illustrated the way in which research work has frequently pushed agnostics and atheists down the pathway to theism precisely because they have used their critical faculties. Science &amp; Christian Belief aims to explore the relationship between science and faith at an academic level. As editor I read all manuscripts submitted to this journal. At the same time, I referee a large number of articles submitted to scientific journals. I can find no basis for Prof Postgate's claim that different standards of critical academic assessment apply in these two spheres of science and religion. Prof Postgate's comments about religion and war reiterate tired arguments that miss important points. In light of the fact that more than 40 per cent of the scientific research and development budgets of most western nations are committed to developing ways of killing other people, his claim that the scientific community is living on some 'moral high ground' is surprising. Scientists have been notorious for contributing their skills to military enterprises, so the idea that the scientific community as a whole is 'above' such blood-thirsty activities is ridiculous. Yet scientists do not give up science because it is widely misused any more than people give up sex because of the existence of rape. Similarly, the appropriate response to misuse of religious belief is not to confront religion per se, but to oppose its misuse.

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Bakhtiar killer jailed for life Ali Vakili Rad was sentenced in Paris yesterday to life in prison for the 1991 assassination of Shapour Bakhtiar, the late Shah of Iran's last prime minister. A second Iranian, Massoud Hendi, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for complicity in the case, but Mr Zeynalabedine Sarhadi, a great-nephew of Iran's President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was acquitted and ordered freed by the court. Mr Sarhadi's acquittal was likely to be greeted with relief on the part of French diplomats because his presence in the dock had been the focus of high tension between Paris and Tehran during the month-long trial. Prosecutors had argued that the three men had acted on direct orders from Iran's revolutionary government, and Mr Sarhadi had been accused of being the key link between the Iranian intelligence services and the assassins. Mr Bakhtiar, overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution, and Mr Sorush Katibeh, his secretary, were found with their throats slit at their Paris home. Two other alleged killers are to be tried later in absentia along with four other alleged accomplices. Iran has always denied any involvement in the killing.</p>

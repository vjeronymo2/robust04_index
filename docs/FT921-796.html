			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sheffield Insulations slumps to Pounds 1.5m The severity of the continued decline in construction activity was reflected in the sharp drop in profits for the 1991 year at Sheffield Insulations Group. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 1.5m although turnover rose from Pounds 127m to Pounds 132m with price deflation also placing margins under pressure. The group supplies insulation products and services for energy conservation. It has increased its market share through acquisition and new business development but gross margins fell and costs rose mainly as a result of the integration and development of the acquisitions. Mr Norman Adsetts, chairman, said he did not believe that market demand would change significantly in 1992. Although not fully covered by earnings of 3.7p per share, compared with 15.6p, the dividend total is unchanged at 5.4p with a proposed final of 3.6p.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Rate cut signals tough Budget: Reduction of 1/2 point to 5.5% takes the City and industry by surprise Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday set the stage for a tough Budget next week with a half a percentage point cut in UK interest rates which took the City and industry by surprise. However, politicians and business leaders were divided on whether the timing and size of the cut to 5.5 per cent suggested a Budget with tax rises greater than the Pounds 3bn expected by many economists. In an announcement aimed at persuading the City that changes in interest rates will be influenced by economic events rather than political considerations, Mr Clarke said the Bank of England would in future decide the timing of shifts in borrowing rates. The cut brought bank base rates to their lowest level for 21 years. It was quickly followed by quarter-point reductions in mortgage rates by the Nationwide, Britain's second-largest building society, and National Westminster Bank. But the broad welcome by businesspeople and politicians for the first cut in UK interest rates since January was tempered by disappointment that Mr Clarke failed to adjust rates by a full point. The move was interpreted last night in the City and Westminster as a sweetener ahead of the Budget, when Mr Clarke had been expected to announce a fiscal tightening of up to Pounds 3bn to curb the Pounds 50bn public-sector borrowing requirement. Any changes announced in the Budget will come on top of the tax increases of Pounds 6.7bn already announced for next April. The rate cut was authorised by Mr Clarke last week, although he left the precise timing to Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. That practice will be followed in all future changes in interest rates as part of a government effort to convince financial markets about monetary policy. Sterling reacted positively, gaining 1 1/2 pfennigs on the D-Mark to close in London at DM2.5275, and firming slightly in New York. Against the dollar it put on more than 1 cent, finishing at Dollars 1.4855, with no change in New York. On the London stock market, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares came back from a 20-point loss prior to the rate cut announcement to close 1.3 points down at 3,069.3, below the day's highs and after a highly volatile session marked by investor worries about the Budget. Long-dated gilts gained a quarter of a point on theories that the rate cut would do little to trigger inflation. In a statement, Mr Clarke said the decision was justified by weak price pressures, together with recent cuts in interest rates in continental Europe. He said the change - signalled just before 10am - was consistent with Britain's 4 per cent target for underlying inflation. It also took 'full account' of the measures he will announce in his first Budget next Tuesday. In a BBC Radio interview, Mr George said he had decided on the timing of the cut against the background of the latest batch of economic statistics and what he knew of Mr Clarke's Budget plans. 'I couldn't see any particular reason why we should wait until after the Budget,' he said. Commenting on the changes in presentation, Mr George said they should remove the lingering suspicion in markets that rate changes were politically motivated. 'I think there has been quite often a perception in the market place that the only reason a change had been made had been for some kind of political reason. Actually that's very rarely if ever been true in my experience.' Officials last night stressed that the extent of changes in interest rates would remain the province of the chancellor. In future the governor would be allowed a period of 'between days and weeks' for putting these changes into effect. While the announcement was welcomed on the Tory backbenches, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the reduction was too little and too late. British business leaders generally applauded the move, but Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said a full 1-point cut had been needed.

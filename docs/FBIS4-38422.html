			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Russian Union of Journalists, the Committee for  Defending the Freedom of Speech and Journalists' Rights, and the  Fund for the Protection of Glasnost have made a statement today.  They regard the recreation of a parliamentary TV service as an  attempt to make it impossible for the electorate to form an  objective opinion of deputies' activities. The same tendency  can be observed in the attempts by other authorities to bend the  media to their will and make them a mouthpiece of their  time-serving interests. It is inadmissible that the  broadcasting time belonging to the whole society should be split  into departmental domains, or even worse, be monopolized, the  statement of the journalists' unions stresses.</p>

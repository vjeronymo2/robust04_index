			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Observer: Quick exit Terry Smith might be a hard act to follow, but you would have thought his successor would have lasted more than 10 days. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew must have been hoping things were settling down when it handed the ejected Smith's UK research desk to Peter Beck in addition to the continental European counterpart he was already running. But he too is off - to Paribas Capital Markets as head of the rather smaller equity research department. Smith was fired at the beginning of September after becoming embroiled in a legal dispute with his employers about the publication of his book Accounting for Growth. He and Beck had been sparring partners for a while, and colleagues say Beck had for some time been ogling the UK patch. UBS P&amp;D claims Beck is going for personal reasons, but his departure seems to have mystified senior management. Enter Hector Sants, vice-chairman and head of equities, who will 'for the time being' have the research department reporting directly to him. This leaves Bill Seward, who had been overall head of research, in charge of economics and equity markets strategy. Sants is still bravely claiming the Smith debacle 'has done us no damage as far as relationships with institutional clients go'. Until the bank acknowledges at least internally that there's a problem, this little saga looks set to run and run.</p>

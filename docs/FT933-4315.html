			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Unilever to make 20% of US ice cream UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, is set to become the largest US ice cream maker with the purchase of the ice cream business of Kraft General Foods, part of Philip Morris, the tobacco and food group. The Kraft business has annual sales of almost Dollars 500m (Pounds 324m). Added to Unilever's existing US ice cream sales of about Dollars 200m, it will give the Anglo-Dutch group nearly a fifth of a market worth more than Dollars 3bn a year. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Mr John Campbell, of stockbrokers NatWest Securities in London, estimated it was worth about Dollars 300m. Kraft said last month that it had received an approach from an unnamed company interested in the business, which sells ice creams and frozen yoghurts under brands including Breyers, Sealtest, Knudsen and Light N' Lively. Acquisition of the business will introduce Unilever into the US bulk ice cream sector, the largest part of the total market. Until now, Unilever has focused in the US entirely on 'impulse' ice creams, which are sold for immediate consumption. It has recently acquired popular US brands, including Gold Bond and Klondike. Though Breyers and Sealtest are among the best-known US brands, their market share and profitability have deteriorated sharply in recent years, and Unilever is likely to have to invest substantially to restore their position. Growth of supermarket sales of bulk ice creams have slowed to 2 per cent in the past year. But the value of KGF's ice cream sales fell slightly, while operating margins have narrowed to about 2 per cent. The weaker performance partly reflects increased competition which Breyers has faced from newer 'super-premium' ice creams, which sell at higher prices. Though KGF has launched its own super-premium line, results have been disappointing. Sealtest's sales have fallen 10 per cent to Dollars 63m in the past year and it has been forced to cut prices sharply. The KGF ice cream business employs about 2,000 people and has plants in six US states. Unilever is Europe's biggest ice cream producer, with about 40 per cent of a market worth Dollars 4bn a year.</p>

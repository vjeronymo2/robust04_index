			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Australian opposition takes big poll lead AUSTRALIA'S conservative opposition took a commanding lead over the ruling Labor party during the first week of campaigning for the federal election on March 13. According to a Newspoll opinion poll published yesterday in The Australian newspaper, support for the conservative Liberal/National party coalition increased during the week by 3 percentage points to 48 per cent. Support for the government fell by half a percentage point to 39.5 per cent, giving the coalition a lead of 8.5 points. A swing of 0.9 per cent is needed for a conservative win. Newspoll said the results suggested the conservative parties would win by 53.5 per cent to 46.5 per cent after the distribution of preferences under Australia's preferential voting system. This would give the conservatives a majority of around 30 seats in the 147-seat House of Representatives, and make the coalition the largest grouping in the Senate. Worryingly for the government, 50 per cent of voters said they expected the coalition to win, against 29 per cent who expected a Labor victory. Only 55 per cent of committed Labor supporters expected the government to win. The poll indicates a less emphatic conservative lead than a poll last week in The Age newspaper in Melbourne, which estimated the coalition lead at 12 points. However, Newspoll has a reputation as an accurate poll.</p>

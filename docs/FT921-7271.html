			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Romanian poll test for opposition ROMANIANS voted yesterday for mayors in most of the country's big cities in a second-round ballot testing opposition strength ahead of general elections this spring, AP reports from Bucharest. Polls took place in 1,611 participating municipalities. In the first round of local elections on February 9, which took place mainly in small towns and villages, the governing National Salvation Front beat the opposition Democratic Convention. The results, however, indicated a loss of support for the Front. The Front took power during the December 1989 anti-communist revolution and then won general elections overwhelmingly.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Arts: Goin' Local/The Foursome - Theatre Royal, Stratford East/Barons Court Theatre Two plays at opposite ends of London suggest, when compared, that English self-confidence is continuing to decline. Both have strongly regional backgrounds, but neither is entirely cut off from the national scene. The Foursome by Ted Whitehead was first performed at the Royal Court Upstairs in 1971. It was described at the time as 'dirty', a word that now sounds curiously archaic. Certainly it contains some overt-ish sex, including a male strip before such acts became a minor cult. For the rest, it is a sharply written tale of two boys picking up two girls and spending the Sunday with them on a Merseyside beach. That was when the Beatles were still going strong and there seemed scarcely a cloud on the horizon. No-one is out of a job, even if the work force is not highly motivated. At the end, the boys dump the girls to make their own way back to Liverpool. But there is no reason to think that the girls will be particularly aggrieved: they have given as good as they got, and it's on to the next weekend. Recognition of Merseyside's problems came later. Revived at the Barons Court Theatre in west London, with some of the old 1960s songs thrown in, the play now looks like a piece of nostalgia, though it was notable that a predominantly young audience took to it warmly, perhaps believing that nothing has changed. There is no such optimism in Tunde Ikoli's Goin' Local, which had its premiere at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East on Monday. Here is the home of the old, proud Cockney London that defied the blitz. It appears to have lost its spirit and to be succumbing to Docklands almost without a fight. The setting of Ikoli's play is a very good one: and old cab company running derelict cars with derelict drivers in a derelict area. The cabbies try their hardest to avoid inspection by social security, whose benefits they draw without declaring their earnings. Can such security last? The answer depends on whether there is such a species as Cockney yuppies. One would have thought that there always was: before the term 'yuppy' was invented, they were called spivs. In the Docklands era, however, they come sprouting modern business language, looking for the PBO (perfect business opportunity) and aware that in the late 1980s it was much easier to borrow from banks than rob them. The yuppies take over and introduce 'passenger-friendly' cars (ie Mercedes), although in the end they, too, might get their come-uppance for continuing to defraud social security, just like the simpler, nicer, older Cockneys before them. Not a bad plot: the weakness lies in the play's funereal slowness. These Cockneys don't make many jokes any more: they don't fight; they whinge. It is as if they know they are beaten and no longer bother to protest. One of their complaints is against the men who come down from the north, sleep in the open 'without overheads' and can afford to accept low wages. The production, directed by Philip Hedley, could improve considerably if it were speeded up. But Hedley is an experienced producer, so one can only assume that the slowness is deliberate. The Foursome at Barons Court is not like that at all. The direction by Maximillian Jacobson-Gonzales is as electrifying as some of the best of the Beatles' songs. So is the playing. It is a shining example of how to use the small space of a pub theatre: exploit every square inch you can. Goin' Local looks more like an exercise in how to fill up a stage while keeping the actors static. Nevertheless, both pieces tell you something about contemporary England.</p>

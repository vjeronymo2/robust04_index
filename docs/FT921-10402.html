			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): New York's overnight rise encourages the continent CONTINENTAL bourses were encouraged by Wall Street's record close overnight, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT majored on carmakers and retailers, but kept its interest in special situations. The DAX index closed 10.22 better at 1,686.62 after a rise of 3.43 to 687.16 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume rose from DM5bn to DM7bn. There was a transatlantic influence, too, in the car sector where improved US January car sales figures left BMW DM8 higher DM547, and Volkswagen up DM7.50 at DM342.50. The fact that a steel strike in Germany had been averted continued to lift sentiment. The inflationary aspect of the steel pay settlement was reflected in retailers where Douglas rose DM24 to DM657, Karstadt by DM13 to DM626 and Kaufhof DM12 to DM478. Dealers said that the 6.4 per cent rise for steelworkers was expected to result in significant rises in real income in other sectors. Asko, which raised its stake in fellow retailer Ava to a majority, put on DM25 to DM700, taking its gains to 10 per cent in just over a week. Lufthansa took its fall to over 10 per cent in two days, dropping another DM9.70 to DM162.80 after confirming this week that it would report a 1991 loss of around DM400m, its first deficit since 1973. The tyremaker Continental said it had no explanation for the recent strength in its shares, up another DM5 to DM235.50 yesterday. PARIS continued to focus on individual stocks. The CAC-40 index ended 9.31 higher at 1,865.79, helped by recoveries in Elf and Eurotunnel, after trading in a 15-point range. Volume rose to FFr2.1bn from FFr1.8bn. Shares in Pechiney, the aluminium and packaging company, went in opposite directions. Pechiney International rose FFr5.30 to FFr174 with 141,700 shares traded on rumours that it would sell its aluminium activities back to its parent and, therefore, become a purer packaging play. Pechiney CIs fell FFr13 or 4.1 per cent to FFr300 with 41,450 units traded. Another active share was Michelin which rose FFr4.80 or 3.2 per cent to FFr157 with 309,250 shares traded; but dealers could find few reasons for the move. Casino, the supermarkets group, rose FFr6.50 to FFr148.50 with 215,000 shares traded on better-than-expected 1991 results. Casino announced a 35.5 per cent rise to FFr530.0m in net attributable profit, beating the market consensus of a 20 per cent rise. MILAN held on to early gains. The Comit index rose 5.46 to 550.71 in turnover estimated at more than L106bn. The government's approval of Fiat's plan to put about 5,000 workers into an early-retirement programme boosted the shares by L96 or 1.9 per cent to L5,133. In the financial sector, Ambroveneto surged L172 or 4 per cent to L4,385 on speculation that a French bank was poised to raise its shareholding in the Italian bank. Olivetti continued to gain, adding L34 to L2,847 on persistent merger speculation and in spite of comments by the chairman, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, that the company was likely to break even or make a slight profit this year after a bigger-than-expected net loss of L380bn last year. The insurance sector outperformed the general index, ending up 1.2 per cent, as Generali closed up L350 at L30,900. AMSTERDAM slipped back after rising moderately in early trading. The CBS Tendency Index was down 0.3 to 122.4. Elsevier fell on profit taking. It closed Fl 2.2 or 2 per cent lower at Fl 106.20. Philips, taking a 25 per cent stake in a US communications company for Dollars 175m, drifted back Fl 0.20 to Fl 30.60. Heineken hit an all-time high boosted by bid rumours, gaining Fl 1.80 to Fl 173.30; but KLM, which is due to report its third quarter results today, fell Fl 1.50 to Fl 41.50. STOCKHOLM advanced in heavy trade in turnover of SKr420m after SKr587m as the Affarsvarlden General index closed 8.7 higher at 978.3. Relief at Tuesday's Electrolux decision to hold its dividend was reinforced by Wall Street and improved Swedish car sales figures. Electrolux B rose another SKr13 to SKr260 and Volvo B by SKr7 to SKr385. Ericsson B gained SKr3 to SKr122 ahead of its results next Tuesday. By sectors, forestry registered the session's biggest gain, up 2.1 per cent. Dealers said that the improvement stemmed from reports of higher pulp prices in coming months. OSLO edged higher, the all-share index up 1.99 to 442.47 in turnover of Nkr237.4m (NKr207.18m). Hafslund, the healthcare group, was active, accounting for 20 per cent of turnover: its A shares fell Nkr0.5 to NKr268. ISTANBUL plunged 4.2 per cent on heavy selling. The index fell 193.06 to 4,374.04, the lowest since January 3, in turnover of TL348.8bn, up from TL285.5bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1134.90  1135.92  1137.48  1138.71  1138.99  1138.88  1138.52  1138.71  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1139.42    Day's Low  1134.90  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 4     Feb 3     Jan 31    Jan 30    Jan 29 1132.79   1134.04   1137.97   1131.87   1132.85  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

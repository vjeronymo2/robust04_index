			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Brazil presidential candidate drops his running mate Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the leading left-wing candidate for Brazil's presidency, has replaced his running mate just over two months ahead of the poll, following corruption allegations. Mr da Silva's campaign has been virtually paralysed for the last three weeks because of media allegations against Senator Jose Paulo Bisol of the Brazilian Socialist party. Ironically, Mr Bisol was one of the leading inquisitors during a congressional corruption investigation held earlier this year. Mr Bisol will be replaced as vice presidential candidate by Mr Aloizio Mercadante, a leading congressman from Mr da Silva's Workers' party and a possible finance minister in a da Silva government. Mr Mercadante represents the centre ground of the Workers' party and is considered a skilful media debater. A meeting of Mr da Silva's coalition partners on Tuesday evening agreed to the change, which they hope will refire his campaign for the October 3 election. Mr da Silva's main opponent, former finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, has virtually drawn level in the polls this month after being 20 points behind. This recovery has largely been due to a sharp fall in inflation following the introduction of a new currency on July 1, which Mr Cardoso negotiated through Congress. Mr Bisol's position was undermined by allegations that he submitted amendments to the federal budget for overpriced public works projects benefiting property he owned. Mr Bisol denied the allegations but said he had acted naively and would withdraw the amendments. The allegations, although dismissed by the da Silva campaign as a media smear, were regarded as particularly damaging to Mr da Silva, who is supported by many Brazilians because of his commitment to clean government. Both Mr da Silva and Mr Cardoso have the support of about 30 per cent of voters, with other candidates on less than 10 per cent, according to a recent Gallup poll. After October's election the two are expected to meet in a run-off ballot on November 15.</p>

During the dinner, Clinton seemed worried  about the fact that he will have to testify again before the  special prosecutor in the Whitewater case. [Former] Judge David  Hale had said that through transactions Clinton provided some  $100,000 to the Whitewater company, through which Clinton and  his wife Hilary owned some properties when Clinton was governor  of Arkansas.</p>

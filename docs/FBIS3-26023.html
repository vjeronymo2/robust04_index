			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Yuan] </F>   [Text] The market in consumer goods has been fluctuating  since November, with the prices of some commodities rising  drastically. Some consumers have not fully understood the  implementation of tax reforms, and fear the new tax system will  further add to inflation.    Sales in major shopping malls in Beijing and Wuhan have been  rising with consumers' favourite commodities including grain,  oil, electric appliances and gold. Sales of television sets,  video cassette recorders, refrigerators and washing machines  went up by 100 to 200 percent.    However, the demand for less than nine percent of the  commodities outstripped supply, and it is not difficult to  stabilise the market. Consumers also only look for a small range  of commodities and the impact of price fluctuations on the  market has not proved particularly serious.    But market fluctuations show that consumers are still  expecting inflation will continue in the near future. They want  to buy goods because they believe that devaluation of money is  faster than that of commodities. They fear the introduction of  tax reforms and further liberalisation of price controls this  year will lead to a surge in prices.    Although consumers are flocking to stores, they are not  buying whatever commodities can be found on the market. They  are proving to be selective, and only want to buy goods with  brand names and of good quality. This might put additional  pressure on inflation as demand for imported products will go up.</p>

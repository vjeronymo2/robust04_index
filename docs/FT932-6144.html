			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan weakens ahead of results from Montedison ACTIVITY was moderate yesterday as markets wound down ahead of the long weekend, writes Our Market Staff. MILAN waited for the Montedison and Ferruzzi results, which were due out after the close of trading. However, with many analysts expecting substantial losses from the former - confirmed after the session had ended - the Consob suspended dealings in Montedison shares in after hours trading. The shares fixed L45 lower at L1,330. The Comit index closed off 1.36 at 539.45, 3.4 per cent lower on the week. In its latest survey of Italian equities Kleinwort Benson comments that with Mr Carlo Ciampi now installed as prime minister 'the government could well deliver what the market is asking for: a tough 1994 budget, a favourable wage agreement, a clear electoral reform and a successful kick-off to the long awaited privatisations'. After the close Ferruzzi announced that it would open up its capital to outside participants. Its shares fell L11 to L1,063. The nervousness in Fiat, which has hung over the shares all week, continued with investors expecting a cut in the dividend when it announces its results on Monday. The shares closed down L245 at L5,860 before gaining slightly on the kerb to L5,875. Among the day's gainers, Stet attracted interest with a rise of L55 to L3,076, improving to L3,113 after hours. PARIS lost ground in technical trading and some profit-taking ahead of the long weekend. The CAC-40 index lost 15.89 to 1,888.70, up 1.5 per cent on the week. Turnover of some FFr5bn was swollen by the expiry of futures and options. The automotive sector remained under pressure after further gloomy news on European car sales: Peugeot slipped FFr8 to FFr531 and Michelin FFr8.40 to FFr137.60. Elsewhere Elf Aquitaine lost FFr1.70 to FFr374.50 following a disappointing profits forecast on Thursday. MADRID lost the better part of this week's gains on profit-taking and futures related selling, the general index ending 3.81 lower at 258.77, up 1 per cent on the week, in turnover of Pta20bn. All sectors fell, Argentaria losing Pta160 to Pta4,605 in banks, and Repsol Pta50 to Pta3,245. AMSTERDAM subsided as recession fears increased, reflecting the lower dollar and a worse than expected fall in first quarter GDP. The CBS Tendency index fell 1.3 to 105.2, 0.7 per cent up on the week. ZURICH held its own against the lower dollar, the SMI index closing 2.6 higher at 2,270.7, 1.7 per cent higher on the week. The watchmaker, SMH, extended its gains, up another SFr40 at SFr1,990 on buying from Geneva. STOCKHOLM fell after the release of a larger than expected loss by Trelleborg, the mining group. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 1.2 to 1,097.0, up 0.45 per cent on the week. Trelleborg fell SKr3.00 to SKr51.50 after reporting a pre-tax loss of some SKr427m in four months to April. LISBON continued its upward career, the BTA index putting on 57.5 to a new 1993 high of 1.994.8 at 1 pm for a gain on the week of 7.4 per cent. Among the features was a 46 per cent gain in Lisnave, the world's largest ship repair company, which put restructuring proposals to the government yesterday. ISTANBUL soared 3.45 per cent to a new record high, the 75-share market index gaining 279.68 to 8,375.75. Turnover was TL800bn. Brokers said that a rally had been expected before next week's holiday as buyers could take advantage of a 10-day delay in settlements.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- May 28                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1162.60    1163.61    1163.35    1161.75 FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1162.01    1160.57    1161.17    1161.58  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1227.99    1230.05    1230.07    1227.58 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1227.58    1224.87    1225.22    1224.85  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        May 27    May 26    May 25    May 24    May 21  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1165.01   1162.51   1164.13   1156.98   1155.78 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1231.31   1226.76   1224.18   1217.42   1215.46  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1164.93; 200 - 1232.17 Low/day: 100 - 1159.74 200 - 1224.12.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

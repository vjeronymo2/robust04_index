			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Steady opening to the new account UK EQUITIES rallied well from a poor start in a thinly traded session yesterday, but weak trading volumes gave little cause for celebration as the FT-SE 100 Index struggled to hold on to the 3,000 mark on the first day of the new trading account. Technical factors, including the effects of ex-dividend adjustments to a large number of blue chip share prices, worth the equivalent of about 10 points on the Footsie, played a role in erratic movements in both the Footsie and the December contract on the index which took over the lead on the stock index futures sector yesterday. Uncertainty in government bond prices ahead of the announcement today of details of an impending auction of gilt-edged securities was no help to share prices, which have benefited strongly from falling yields in the bond market. The August M4 money supply data for the UK, showing slightly less annualised growth than predicted, had little effect on stock prices. The FT-SE 100 Index closed only a point down at 3,004.5, but had slipped to 2,987.5 early in the session as an initial burst of selling of stock index futures helped to upset a stock market already struggling with ex-dividend adjustments to share prices taking an estimated 10.3 off the Footsie. Index compilation was additionally complicated by activity in Glaxo after news, too late for the UK stock market on Friday night, of its legal victory over US patents for Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug responsible for nearly half the group's annual turnover. Equity prices rallied at midsession together with the December future on the Footsie, but trading volume, never on any great scale, died away as London waited to see if Wall Street would extend Friday's losses. In the event, New York made a somewhat uneventful start to the new session and the UK stock market managed an unconvincing rally. Nervousness in London over prospects for equities in New York has become a depressing factor for share prices. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, at 3,423,6, closed 2.1 down, following the blue chip market to end above the day's low. Non-Footsie business made up around 59 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 443.3m shares. On Friday, with share turnover boosted by the close of the equity trading account, Seaq volume was worth Pounds 1.68bn in genuine customer business, a return to the best daily levels recorded over the past year. Waning hopes for a cut in UK base rates following disappointing news last week on domestic inflation left the store and retail sector lacking strength. But banks and utilities, both traditionally beneficiaries from interest rate optimism, were firmer towards the end of the session. Predictions of a rate reduction to record lows today by the Bank of Japan appeared to help sentiment in London. But among the blue chips, the pharmaceuticals continued to show uncertainty, while oil issues remained depressed by bearish views on world crude prices. Investment opinions appeared to have moved towards caution over the weekend as UK analysts surveyed the progress of the company reporting season and the interest rate outlook. Mr Robin Aspinall of Panmure Gordon summed up the less confident view by urging that this 'is the time to sell UK equities'.</p>

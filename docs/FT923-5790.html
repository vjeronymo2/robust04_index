			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Enzymes will make food out of straw: British Association for the Advancement of Science SCIENTISTS will soon be able to turn straw into a health food, the British Association meeting in Southampton heard, giving a possible use for stubble, which farmers will not be allowed to burn from next year. Scientists in France, Sweden and Finland have unravelled the structure of natural enzymes that break down cellulose and hemicellulose, which humans are unable to digest. Dr Peter Goodenough, of the Institute of Food Science at Reading University, is forming a European research consortium to develop improved versions of the enzymes. 'The application of protein engineering opens up the possibility of amalgamating the activity of these enzymes into an industrial super-enzyme,' Dr Goodenough told the meeting. The consortium of 25 laboratories expects to receive Pounds 2m from the European Community. One aim is to convert wheat straw into a fibre-based food which would be a dietary supplement - like wheat bran but more palatable. Dr Goodenough said the western diet needed more fibre, which speeds up digestion. Fibre could help prevent diseases such as bowel cancer, diabetes, obesity and gallstones. The European project also aims to develop enzymes to convert waste straw into fuel for heating or transport. Professor Guy Dodson, of York University, is working with Novo-Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical group, to modify insulin, the protein that controls sugar levels in blood, the association was told. They are making a form of insulin that is absorbed more quickly than the natural material, and may therefore be more suitable for use by diabetics. Peat bogs are being destroyed by drainage and harvesting, the meeting heard. Conservationists said that the bogs enable scientists to trace environmental and archaeological changes over thousands of years because the acidic and oxygen-free conditions preserve organic materials. The meeting heard that harvesting particularly affected lowland raised bogs  -those which grow above the mineral water table.</p>

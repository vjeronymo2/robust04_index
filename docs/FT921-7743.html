			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard shares surge 14% HEWLETT-Packard yesterday reported stronger-than-expected earnings for its first fiscal quarter, hoisting the company's stock price by more than Dollars 9 or 14 per cent. The US computer and electronic instruments manufacturer attributed the result to a sharp increase in orders for its popular laser printers and strong demand for its computer workstations. Earnings for the quarter rose 49 per cent to Dollars 306m, or Dollars 1.21 per share. Wall Street analysts had been projecting earnings between 79 and 95 cents per share. Net earnings in the same period a year ago were Dollars 205m, or 83 cents. Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 3.9bn, up 13 per cent from Dollars 3.4bn last time. US sales totalled Dollars 1.7bn, up 13 per cent, while sales outside the US rose 14 per cent to Dollars 2.2bn. 'These results reflect the strong acceptance of HP's newer products and our on-going efforts to slow the growth of expenses,' said Mr John Young, HP president and chief executive. Although the November acquisition of Avantek, a semiconductor manufacturer, added about 1,800 employees, overall employment for the quarter increased by only 700 people to 89,700. For the first time, HP provided a breakdown of its computer sales revenues, which rose to Dollars 2.8bn in the quarter from Dollars 2.4bn last year. In the key computer workstation market, HP holds an estimated 16 per cent share, running second to Sun Microsystems. Last month HP launched a new Dollars 5,000 workstation twice as fast as Sun's lowest-priced model. In the maturing market for electronic instruments, HP's sales declined, from Dollars 568m in the first quarter of 1991 to Dollars 526m. Sales of medical electronic equipment, however, rose to Dollars 229m from Dollars 214m, while those for analytical instruments advanced to Dollars 169m from Dollars 154m. Electronic components sales rose sharply to Dollars 106m from Dollars 68m. Mr Young said the company 'remains cautious in our outlook because of continuing economic difficulties in the US and slower growth in some key markets outside the US'. He said the goal for the year was to sustain its improved financial performance.</p>

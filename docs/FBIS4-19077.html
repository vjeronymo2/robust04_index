			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that the UN  Secretariat General has significantly altered the first package,  which it claimed could not be changed, in favor of the Greek  Cypriots.    Denktas assessed the statement Joe Clark, UN special envoy  to  Cyprus, made to reporters in New York. Denktas said that the  benefits and rights promised to the Turkish Cypriot side in the  first package have not yet been fulfilled, adding that the  Turkish Cypriot side has been told that if it hands over Maras  [Varosha] some of these promises will be kept. He said: This  is most unreliable. Pointing out that the promises made to the  Turkish Cypriot side should be kept, Denktas added that the  changes made against the Turkish Cypriot side are not just  details but substantial issues. He further pointed out that the  promises made have been rescinded. Noting that the southern  entrance to Maras should be kept under Turkish Cypriot control,  Denktas said that this is an issue of vital importance for the  Turkish Cypriots. He added that the UN secretary general's  promise concerning this issue is not remembered by anyone but  the Turkish Cypriot side. Pointing out that promises made on  the Lefkosa [Nicosia] airport have also not been kept, Denktas  said that this disrupts the equality but that no one seems to  care.    Denktas reiterated that the Turkish Cypriot side is in favor  of continuing the proximity talks, adding that the talks have  been ended because of Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis. He said:  We are continuing our contacts with the UN officials. We will  see what will happen in four weeks.</p>

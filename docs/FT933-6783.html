			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney denies closure EURO Disney, the lossmaking leisure group, yesterday took the unusual step of issuing a formal statement denying that it was considering plans for the temporary closure of its troubled theme park during the winter. Analysts were perplexed by the company's decision to publish the statement, given that Euro Disney executives last week had verbally denied the temporary closure rumours. The statement also did nothing to help Euro Disney's shares, which ended the day unchanged at FFr56 despite the upward trend in Paris.</p>

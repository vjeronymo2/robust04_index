The IIPA has recommended that the USTR label China, Brazil  and India as priority foreign countries for negotiations on  unfair trade relations and retain South Korea, Japan and nine  other countries on the priority watch list.    By Friday, the USTR had received industrial opinions on  whether to invoke the Super 301 section of a 1988 trade law  empowering him to take retaliatory steps against countries that  fail to lower trade barriers against U.S. goods and will make  public the opinions around next Wednesday, the association said.</p>

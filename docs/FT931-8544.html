			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (6): In search of benefits - Jonathan S. Schwarz on the tax status of expatriate executives THE HIGHLY mobile executive is one of the key features of the increasing internationalisation of business. Citizens of EC states can work anywhere in the Community and this privilege is likely to be extended shortly to citizens of Efta countries. While immigration and work permit barriers may be falling, the tax impediments and cost of transferring senior employees from home may be significant. Executives expect at least to be no worse off financially if they work in other countries than if they stay at home. In many cases, they expect financial rewards for the disruption to their personal lives. Virtually all industrialised countries tax residents on their worldwide income. Ceasing to be resident in a country usually involves remaining physically outside the country and severing all ties for a significant period of time. It is therefore only feasible for medium and long term postings. In the case of executives required to spend parts of a year in a particular country, most double tax treaties following the OECD Model will absolve the executive from tax outside his home base if he or she spends less than 183 days a year in a country performing services and if the cost of employing the executive is not borne by a local company or permanent establishment. Separate rules are, however, provided for company directors which cause them to be taxed on directors' fees paid by local companies even if they are not resident where the company is situated. Special rules are also provided for those in the shipping and airline industries. Even such relatively straightforward situations give rise to problems as a result of anomalies between countries. For example, the UK excludes the day of arrival and departure in determining whether visitors are physically present in the UK. The US, on the other hand, includes the days of arrival and departure. Other issues which affect executives are differences in tax year ends as well as administrative costs in filing tax returns or claiming refunds where tax is withheld at source. Those may be expensive and time-consuming. Longer term moves by executives are accompanied by salary adjustments to take into account not only tax differentials but also other cost of living adjustments. The tax adjustments are most commonly effected by either tax equalisation or tax protection arrangements. Under tax equalisation, the employee pays no more income tax than if he or she had stayed home. The company meets any additional tax cost if the individual is posted to a higher tax country and the company may make savings if the posting is to a lower tax country. Tax protection involves the company agreeing to meet any additional costs of income tax if higher than the home country level. Any savings because of posting to a lower tax country are retained by the executive. A number of countries seek to attract international and regional headquarters operations with tax incentive packages designed to attract foreign executives on a temporary basis. The UK and Ireland, for example, tax resident but not domiciled individuals on local source income and gains. Foreign income and gains are taxed only when remitted. Belgium and the Netherlands also have attractive regimes for temporary foreign residents which exempt them from tax on foreign investment income and capital gains. In the Netherlands, such executives are also entitled to a 35 per cent tax deduction from salary subject to Dutch tax. Executive incentive packages also give rise to challenges in an international context. Most packages are designed with the tax rules of the executives' home base in mind, and are often difficult to duplicate with precision. An area of increasing importance in this regard is in relation to pension benefits and employee share plans. The tax treatment of pension provisions varies from country to country. The tax deductibility of pension contributions by the employee and the taxation of investment income by the pension fund itself depend in part on whether the fund and the executive are both resident in the same country. Where mobile executives retire outside their country of employment, additional issues arise as to the taxation of pension payments. These problems are graphically illustrated in the Bachmann case that was recently brought before the European Court of Justice. Mr Bachmann, a German national, had commenced payments on insurance policies agains sickness and disability as well as life insurance while resident in Germany. Having moved to Belgium to work, the Belgian tax authorities refused deductions of these premiums. The Belgian income tax code permits deduction of insurance premiums agains professional income in computing taxable income. However, they are only deductible if paid to mutual companies recognised in Belgium and no foreign companies have ever been recognised. In the case of retirement and death related insurance, premiums had to be paid in Belgium. The European Court recognised that the Belgian tax legislation contravened the Treaty of Rome rules dealing with freedom of movement of workers and freedom to provide services. Contrary to the opinion of the Advocate General, however, the Court concluded that the non-deductibility of the premium was necessary to compensate the state for nontaxability of the pension. In other cases, the foreign pension fund may not be recognised as a tax exempt savings vehicle and the employee may be taxed on income cumulated in the fund on amounts related to his or her contributions. Social security contributions constitute a significant cost and the mobile executive may suffer mismatches of contributions and benefits. The problems are eased by international agreement. For example, the UK/US social security agreement permits US employees to remain liable to US social security contributions only for assignments of up to five years and vice versa for UK executives in the US. Within the EC, the rules are complex. In general, social security contributions are applicable in the country where the person is employed, even if he lives in a different member state. Temporary transfers for periods up to one year normally enable employees to remain under the social security rules of the home state. However, the EC regulation on social security schemes recognises the application of bilateral agreements in several cases between member states, as well as recognising circumstances where individuals may be subject to social security payments in two members states simultaneously. The complexities and costs often lead companies to contrive base locations for some or all of their expatriate executives. Although the taxation of businesses has been identified as an area for harmonisation within the EC, the taxation commissioner, Mrs Christiane Scrivener, has made it clear that personal tax harmonisation is not on the Commission's agenda. Detailed planning of multinational remuneration packages will continue to be a requirement for many years to come.</p>

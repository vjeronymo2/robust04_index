Chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Sen.  Sam  Nunn and other congressmen told South Korean Foreign Minister  Han Sung-joo that they expect some progress be made in ongoing  negotiations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  (DPRK) as one side, and the United States and the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as another side.    They said that dialogue, at least for now, is the best way  for solving the nuclear problem.    The U.S. congressmen arrived here last week after visiting  Russia and Japan.    According to latest reports, the IAEA is expected to wind up  working-level negotiations with DPRK on inspections of the  DPRK's nuclear sites in a day or two, and dispatch a team of  inspectors to Pyongyang.    The DPRK, South Korea and the U.S. are expected to  simultaneously announce their positions on three issues when the  IAEA team arrives in Pyongyang.    The three issues are inter-Korean exchange of special  envoys,  suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint South Korea-U.S. military  exercise, and high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington.    Pyongyang is expected to announce that it will resume inter-  Korean talks, and is willing to open working-level contacts with  Seoul to discuss mutual nuclear inspections based on the  south-north non-nuclear declaration.    Seoul will announce that it is willing to suspend the "Team  Spirit" exercise, while Washington is to announce that it will  hold a third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang on  condition of the IAEA nuclear inspection and inter-Korean talks.</p>

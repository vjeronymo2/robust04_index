			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL CHAPTER BAN ON CAMPUS  </P> <P> As a new property owner in Mission Viejo, I would like to express my deep  disappointment that a very authoritarian approach is being taken to restrict  student-initiated educational endeavors. I am referring to an attempt to squash  the formation of an Amnesty International chapter among the students, despite  its widespread acceptance at high schools around the country.  </P> <P> I understand and support the exclusion of religious groups from the campus, as  it would violate the separation of church and state, but I see no righteous  reason to block a secular chapter of Amnesty International. I see far more  reasons to welcome such an endeavor of young citizens and future leaders. Not  only does it enhance leadership skills, it also teaches cultural and political  geography as it forces its members to learn more about the countries where the  political prisoners are located.  </P> <P> Frankly, I believe that the lack of support for AI by school district officials  is politically motivated and does not reflect the best interests of the  students. Unfortunately, today in our society organized sympathetic concern for  oppressed people is shunned as "liberal" and therefore bad.  </P> <P> As we live in a conservative region of the state (though recent surveys  conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates find Orange County residents to  be far less conservative when asked about specific issues), elected officials  fear the loss of their office if they appear to be supporting "liberalism".  </P> <P> By opposing AI on campus, however, they are discouraging curiosity and concern  among students, much needed traits in an age of apathy that many fear will  create mediocre leaders. What message will the district be giving to students  if it bans AI? How are young people today supposed to develop a strong moral  code and concern for their community if discouraged by the very adults to whom  they are supposed to look for guidance?  </P> <P> It is not enough to preach that young people ought to say "no" to drugs; they  must be able to say "yes" to those impulses which are good and constructive.  </P> <P> To deny students an AI chapter on the basis that there is a rule against  "non-academic" organizations on campus during school hours is to place the  importance of arbitrary rules above the needs of students. If there is no  better reason than the fact a rule exists, then maybe the rule should be  changed.  </P> <P> KAREN D. PYKE  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

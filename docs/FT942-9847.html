			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance Royal is not alone in having its climb back into UK profits spoiled by losses in the US. First-quarter figures from General Accident and Commercial Union this week also carried the scars of storms and earthquakes. The US insurance market as a whole has had its worst ever start to the year. Even when losses from severe weather and the Los Angeles earthquake are stripped out, though, Royal's US underwriting performance shows no improvement over last year. Since the company started to sacrifice market share in the interest of profits in 1989, that must be counted as a disappointment. Annual written premium has fallen by around 30 per cent since then as Royal retreated from the western states. The snag is that premiums have fallen faster than expenses, making Royal less competitive. Persuading insurance agents to pass on the best business has also proved difficult. One can only hope that another round of cost-cutting and an infusion of new management will have the desired effect. Royal certainly cannot count on help from others in the insurance market. Despite recent underwriting losses, there is no sign of a general increase in rates. Turmoil in the bond market might just spur US insurers into action. With a US fixed-interest portfolio of around Dollars 4bn, Royal cannot relish any further plunge in bonds. But investment losses are only a short-term worry. Until investors can scent a decent insurance return from the Pounds 1bn capital tied up in the US, Royal will continue to trade at a discount to net assets.</p>

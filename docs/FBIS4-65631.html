			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Paolo Cantore] </F>   [Text] [Announcer Mimo Liguoro] Telecommunications will be  the big money-maker of the year 2000. This sector is dominated  by sophisticated and up-to-the minute technology that will  generate thousands of billions of lire and that will change our  lives. In Italy, up until now, the sector has been run by a  number of state-controlled companies. These will now merge into  a new company called Telecom Italia. Paolo Cantore reports:    [Cantore] The Italian telecommunications colossus is about  to  be born. Telecom Italia--the new society created by the merger  of five companies that were formerly part of the IRI-STET  [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction-Telephone Finance  Company] group into SIP [state-owned telephone company] --will  be the sixth largest telecommunications operator in the world.  The new company will have 100,000 employees, an income of 27  trillion lire, and technological assets worth 52 trillion lire.    The merger was decided today by the boards of the five  companies, but the merger will become effective on 18  August--the date on which Telecom Italia's stock market listing  will replace that of SIP and Italcable.    Over 55 percent of Telecom shares will be in the hands of  STET, 25 percent of shares will be in the hands of foreign  investors, a little under three percent will belong to IRI, and  17 percent to Italian investors.    Telecom will be the challenge of Italian state-controlled  industry to the major world players on the telecommunications  stage --a sector that in the year 2000 will represent two-thirds  of the jobs in the industrial sector and whose interests will  range from the good old telephone to cellular networks, from  interactive television to multimedia markets.    [Liguoro] A short time ago, the Telecom Italia board was  appointed. It is made up of nine people who previously worked  for SIP, STET, IRI, and the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications. In a surprise move, Ernesto Pascale will  assume not only the role of company chairman, but also that of  managing director. Filippo Galliano will be the deputy  chairman, and the three general directors will be Vito  Gamberale, Francesco Chirichigno, and (Tommaso Tommasi Di  Vignano).</p>

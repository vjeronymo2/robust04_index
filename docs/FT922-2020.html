			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Venezuela trims growth projection VENEZUELA has reduced its economic growth projections this year to 4-5 per cent, from the 5-6 per cent or more forecast at the start of the year, Mr Pedro Rosas, finance minister, said. Due to lower than expected world oil prices, the central government and PDVSA, the national oil company, have both ordered big budget cuts, thus reducing projected economic growth from the record high expansion of 9.2 per cent in 1991. It is still uncertain what impact Venezuela's ongoing political crisis and the accompanying uncertainty will have on the economy. Last February, a group of army officers tried unsuccessfully to oust the government of President Carlos Andres Perez. Since then, the country has been afflicted by violent anti-government protests. The minister said the government was now expecting a general fiscal deficit of about 5 per cent of GDP for 1992. Of this, 3.5 percentage points would be caused by PDVSA's ongoing capital investment programme while 1.5 points would be due to the central government's fiscal shortfall. PDVSA will finance most of its deficit through international credits, the minister said. In April, Mr Gustavo Roosen, PDVSA president, said his company's external debt was Dollars 2.17bn and its obligations to Venezuelan banks the equivalent of Dollars 923m. The Venezuelan government registered surpluses in its consolidated budgets in both 1990 and 1991. The national oil company provides the government with most of its tax revenue, and officials now expect petroleum exports this year to total about Dollars 10.9bn - down from an earlier estimate of Dollars 13.5bn. Despite the political problems, foreign investment during the first four months of 1992 was considerably higher than for the equivalent period last year, Mr Rosas said.</p>

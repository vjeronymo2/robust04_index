			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Robert Templer] </F>   [Text] HANOI, May 20 (AFP) -- The leader of a dissident  Vietnamese Buddhist church has appealed for his followers to  step up their fight against what he termed Hanoi's repression of  religion, according to a statement seen here Friday.    In a message to mark Buddha's birthday, the Venerable Thich  Huyen Quang called on his followers to multiply "their efforts  in the struggle for religious freedom and human rights," said a  statement from the Paris-based International Buddhist  Information Bureau.    The appeal, sent clandestinely from central Vietnam, where  Quang is reportedly under house arrest, comes just days before  the first anniversary of clashes between Buddhists and police in  the central city of Hue after which three monks were sentenced  to prison terms for "disturbing public order."    Quang has not been recognised as head of the Unified  Buddhist  Church of Vietnam (UBVC), and is under house arrest, according  to Human Rights Watch/Asia. The government has denied the  charge.    The Buddhist leader appealed for the stepped up campaign for  the church's independence to be carried out "in the spirit of  conciliation and non-violence."    He dismissed attempts by Hanoi to present a more tolerant  face towards religion by allowing the restoration of pagodas and  the opening of some Buddhist schools.    "This does not signify that we have religious freedom,"  Quang  said. "A concrete proof of this is the fact that the authorities  ... continue to ban the UBCV and prohibit all its religious  activities."    In the face of demands for greater religious freedom, "the  authorities have stepped up their repression of the UBCV,  harassing and imprisoning Buddhist dignitaries and followers,"  Quang said.    Hanoi denies oppressing Buddhism, pointing to the renovation  of nearly all the country's more than 4,000 pagodas in the past  three years and the increase in the number of monks and nuns  from 17,000 to more than 20,000.    But to keep control over religion and a lid on potential  dissent, Hanoi insists that all churches belong to the  Fatherland Front, a communist party umbrella group for social  organisations.    The UBCV has resisted attempts to force it to join the  group,  which it says attempts to control all religious activities,  including the appointment of Buddhist leaders.    The church, which claims to be Vietnam's sole legitimate  Buddhist church and traces its tradition back 2,000 years, has a  history of resisting state control -- most famously during the  rule of South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem.    Around 70 percent of Vietnam's 70 million people are  Buddhists, with large numbers concentrated in the former  imperial capital of Hue, where protests last year aroused  intense anxiety in the government.    On May 24 last year, a group of Buddhist monks blocked  traffic for hours in Hue with a sit-down protest after Tich Tri  Tuu, the head of Linh Mu Pagoda, was taken away by municipal  authorities to discuss the self-immolation of a man at the  pagoda three days earlier.    Fearing Tich Tri Tuu was being taken to jail, protestors  attacked, overturned and burned a police vehicle that  authorities say was returning the monk to his pagoda after  discussion of the incident.    Earlier this week, a Foreign Ministry spokesman denied a  report from the Buddhist Information Bureau that the imprisoned  monks were on hunger strike at the Ba Sao reeducation camp south  of Hanoi.    But the government did not respond to an appeal by the group  to allow representatives of the United Nations and the  International Committee of the Red Cross to visit the monks.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Iraq probe may urge change in use of MI6 data A COMPREHENSIVE review of the way intelligence is handled in Whitehall will be one of the main outcomes of the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry, senior Foreign Office officials believe. Such a review would be the first since the reform of the Joint Intelligence Committee, the main Whitehall body responsible for security, after the Falklands War. It is likely to focus on the quality of intelligence data, its handling by the committee and other Whitehall departments, and the relationship between civil servants and ministers. Documents made available to Lord Justice Scott show that in spite of earlier reforms recommended by Lord Franks, lack of co-ordination and in some cases misuse of intelligence data for apparently political ends have continued throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s. Foreign Office officials blame officials and ministers in the Ministry of Defence and Department of Trade and Industry for not including intelligence data in their decision-making process. Both the MoD and the DTI were generally in favour of promoting arms exports to Iraq. Mr William Waldegrave, a Foreign Office minister between July 1988 and November 1990 and now public services minister, on Tuesday defended the secret services. In evidence to the inquiry he appeared to blame other members of the government, not necessarily his own officials, for not passing on intelligence which might have helped his efforts to block defence-related exports to Iraq. The views of intelligence officers are being heard in private by Lord Justice Scott. However, a senior source close to MI6 accepted this week that the machinery for intelligence-gathering within Whitehall was not necessarily efficient. He added that MI6 regularly produced longer and detailed reports on specific subjects which should be channelled through the Whitehall machinery and through regional departments to all the ministers concerned in the area. The intelligence on Iraq is expected to be shared by officials with responsibility for vetting arms exports to Iraq and formulating policy on the Middle East. Mr Waldegrave told the inquiry that a 14-page MI6 report from September 1989 detailing the involvement of companies in the Iraqi military procurement network was among the intelligence data not made available to him. Last night Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the Association of First Division Civil Servants, the union for middle- and high-ranking civil servants, defended her members. She said: 'I think Mr Waldegrave was not blaming Whitehall officials but government. What I understood by his statement to Scott was that there was intelligence information which was held by other ministers but which was not shared.' Joe Rogaly, Page 20</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THESE NAVAL OPERATIONS ARE COSMETIC -- AND FREE  </P> <P> Navy doctors are performing hundreds of free cosmetic surgeries at taxpayer  expense on Navy personnel and their families -- a benefit rarely provided by  private health insurance and specifically prohibited by Veterans Administration  hospitals.  </P> <P> In San Diego alone, 544 free cosmetic operations were performed during the past  two years. From 1986 to 1989, Navy doctors nationwide performed more than 1,800  breast augmentations, face lifts, nose jobs, liposuctions and hair transplants  -- operations that usually cost thousands of dollars apiece.  </P> <P> Navy officials say these surgical procedures allow doctors to hone their skills  and practice their craft in readiness for wartime.  </P> <P> But critics contend that taxpayers should not foot the bill for military  personnel to fine-tune their faces and physiques, especially when the  government is trying to reduce military spending. If the doctors need practice,  they say, they could help out the many indigent people who need but cannot  afford reconstructive surgery.  </P> <P> "It's inappropriate to spend taxpayers' dollars on medical operations that  essentially are designed to allow people to be more stylish rather than to  provide real substantive medical benefits," said Rep. Duncan Hunter  (R-Coronado). "The ability to do a tummy tuck or nose bob is of relatively  little medical benefit to a surgeon who really does intend to spend time  working on military-related cases and combat-related cases."  </P> <P> If Navy doctors need practice, Hunter said, they should operate on wounded  refugees from countries such as Afghanistan.  </P> <P> The surgery has been available to active-duty personnel, their spouses and  children as well as retired members of the military at San Diego's Naval  Hospital and three other facilities across the nation.  </P> <P> Donna Baden, a San Diego Navy dental assistant, had her jaw surgically moved  forward 6.5 millimeters. Still unhappy with her face, she underwent two nose  jobs. Finally, in February, 39-year-old Baden, who joined the Navy five years  ago, had her breasts enlarged. Soon after the last operation, Baden left the  Navy.  </P> <P> All of Baden's operations were performed at the Naval Hospital in Balboa Park  free of charge, except for the breast implants Baden had to provide for the  last surgery. Those cost $565, she said.  </P> <P> The nominal price was the main reason she had the work done, Baden said. "I'm  really pleased with the results. This just did something for my self-esteem.  </P> <P> "These doctors in the Navy need experience like any other doctor," she added.  "They appreciate the experience of having people to work on."  </P> <P> In San Diego, cosmetic surgeries represent 12% of all plastic surgeries  performed; they also represent almost 6% of all surgeries performed by the  hospital's ophthalmologists and ear, nose and throat doctors, according to  statistics obtained by The Times.  </P> <P> "The issue isn't whether or not we should be doing cosmetic surgery; my  position is how much is reasonable. I suggest that 6% is reasonable and 12% is  appropriate," said Rear Adm. Robert Halder, the commanding officer of the Navy  Hospital, which has no plastic surgery residency program but does have three  plastic surgeons.  </P> <P> The Air Force's eight and the Army's 22 plastic surgeons also do "aesthetic  operations." Air Force doctors performed more than 540 such operations in 1988  and more than 640 in 1989. Army doctors conducted more than 3,500 cosmetic  surgeries at about 50 Army hospitals around the world in 1988.  </P> <P> "Why in the world is an Army doctor doing a nose job? Because it's really  critical for skills -- an Army doctor can't just sit there and do nothing for  two years," said Virginia Stephanakis, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army surgeon  general. "They really have to keep their skills up."  </P> <P> In the civilian world, face lifts can cost as much as $6,000; hair replacements  and tummy tucks usually go for no more than $5,000, breast augmentation for  $2,500, according to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive  Surgeons.  </P> <P> Critics say taxpayers should not have to pay for these surgeries, performed  solely for vanity.  </P> <P> "I understand that the hospital and residents' programs want to give young  doctors experience, but it's absolutely unconscionable that I am paying for  it," said Dr. Merrel Olesen, a plastic surgeon with the La Jolla Cosmetic  Surgery Center.  </P> <P> Eleven plastic surgeons are assigned to Navy hospitals in Bethesda, Md.,  Portsmouth, Va., Oakland and San Diego. Three work in San Diego. In 1989, the  most recent year for which national figures are available, doctors at the four  facilities performed 173 breast augmentations, 217 face lifts, 187 liposuctions  and one hair transplant.  </P> <P> To help facilitate the Navy Hospital's fat-removing surgeries, the hospital  bought two liposuction machines, which cost $3,200 each. One was purchased in  1988, the other in 1986, said Halder, who added that the hospital would have  purchased the machines even if doctors did not perform cosmetic surgeries.  </P> <P> In about 98% of the operations, the liposuction machine is used for cosmetic  procedures, said Cmdr. Scott Barttelbort, chief of the plastic surgery division  at the Navy Hospital.  </P> <P> In San Diego, the plastic surgeons are deluged by about 100 requests monthly,  mostly from women who desire bigger breasts, wrinkle-free faces and smaller  noses -- in that order, Barttelbort said. About 12% of the 1,138 plastic  surgery procedures performed in two years beginning March, 1988, were performed  for aesthetic reasons, said Halder.  </P> <P> Two other departments at the Navy Hospital -- ophthalmology and the ear, nose,  throat -- also conduct some cosmetic surgeries. During the two years beginning  in March, 1988, ophthalmologists performed 189 operations to reduce wrinkles  around the eyes. In the same period, ear, nose and throat physicians performed  217 cosmetic surgeries, which make up about 5% of their total number of  operations.  </P> <P> The Department of Veterans Affairs has issued regulations prohibiting such  surgeries, which are considered elective and non-essential, spokesman Bob  Stevens said.  </P></p>

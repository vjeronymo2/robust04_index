			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> OWEN SKIPS JAZZ HERITAGE, BUT FANS LOVE HIM MADLY  </P> <P> Several months ago in San Diego, a high-profile panel discussion over the scope  and meaning of the word jazz nearly came to hockey-style confrontations over  use of the term to include a variety of formats that stand at odds to the  blues, ballad and bop traditions at the heart of mainstream jazz.  </P> <P> Saturday night at Saddleback College's McKinney Theater, that debate was still  alive. Sandy Owen, a pianist of considerable talent, played before a sold-out  audience deeply appreciative of his musical taste and skill. He was accompanied  by Paul Carman on soprano and tenor saxophones and by Donna Thomas on  percussion instruments.  </P> <P> Owen's concert explored 17 compositions, all but one written by him. The night  was divided among solo, duo and trio performances and shared its mellow outlook  for a generous 2 hours.  </P> <P> Owen showed himself to be an engaging conversationalist, with much of the charm  of the event derived from his laid-back monologue between numbers. In that  regard, he is a musician in the tradition of George Shearing; his playing, like  Shearing's, is an extension of a civilized give-and-take between a performer  and his listeners.  </P> <P> Perhaps at that point the comparison with Shearing and the jazz tradition  stops. On one hand, Owen deserves admiration for his determination, as a  composer, to establish his own vision and for his refusal (on this night,  anyway) to display interest in the Great Jazz Repertoire.  </P> <P> But fine as some of his pieces are -- such as "Reflections of a Detective, 3  A.M." -- to carry off 2 hours of personal musical vision would tax all but a  handful of compositional geniuses, the likes of Duke Ellington or Thelonious  Monk.  </P> <P> The most stunning moment of the night came in Owen's moving tribute to his  brother's former schoolteacher -- a young woman named Patty Pratt, killed in an  accident at 26, who wrote "He Belongs," a beautiful song in the mode of "You'll  Never Walk Alone." Her song received a probing philosophical solo that  suggested Owen's reflective musical sensitivity deserves more room than his own  compositions can give it.  </P> <P> Owen's success as a writer has clearly attracted a following. But the  liabilities of the restricted format he emphasizes -- despite ventures into  mid-range blues and boogie-woogie, and his appreciation for salsa and other  rhythmic cadences -- do full justice neither to his own interpretive talent nor  to the classic musical heritage known as jazz. That heritage gains too little  attention in a rock-drenched culture.  </P> <P> Paul Carman's work on soprano and tenor saxophones carried this night to its  sweetest moments. His exquisite reading of "Three A.M." carried a Stan  Getz-like clarity. Thomas' exuberance on several percussion instruments lent  affectionate energy to a sometimes-unvaried mood of unabashedly romantic  nostalgia.  </P> <P> At its most compelling, the evening approached the funky warmth of Vince  Guaraldi. Yet even a full-fledged devotee might hope to hear how Sandy Owen's  chops stand up to the songbooks of Billy Strayhorn, Johnny Mandel and Wayne  Shorter.  </P></p>

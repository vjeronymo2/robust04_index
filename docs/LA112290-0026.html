			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> APPROACHING THEIR MARKS;  </P> <P> SEVEN ARTISTS DRAW A RANGE OF RESULTS  </P> <P> The high-tension world portrayed in Robin Palanker's pastel drawings turns with  such forcefulness that the objects in it get all bent out of shape.  </P> <P> Dogs scrabbling around the globe race to stay in the same place ("Curvature of  the Earth"). Trees lining the long approach to a stately, pale-white building  are knotted with pent-up anticipation ("Monument"). A woman absorbed in a  riveting private vision pulls her room around her like a spectral cloak  ("Transport").  </P> <P> Palanker's are the most immediately riveting of the works by seven Los Angeles  artists in "The Mark," an exhibit at Security Pacific Gallery that is supposed  to show the "vast differences in appearance, execution and choice of subject  matter" -- to quote curator Mark Johnstone's brochure -- of works that can be  called "drawings."  </P> <P> In fact, the approaches to art-making in this show are so diverse that the  issue of whether they demonstrate different ways to make one's "mark" on paper  (or some other surface) seems irrelevant. More disappointingly, some of the  work seems indifferent in any context.  </P> <P> Still, there are some good moments. Hilary Baker's set of odd little gouaches  (opaque watercolors) offer spare, linear images of common objects, presented so  as to yield wry little notions of one sort or another.  </P> <P> In "People Will Talk," three small mauve-colored telephone poles in the center  of a painterly field of brown might suggest the inevitable consequences of  being unconventional. In "Queen for a Day," the wire undergirding of a hoop  skirt flies horizontally across a white field patterned with irregular blue  squares (perhaps a swatch of dress fabric). The fairy-tale unreality of the  scene mirrors the dreamlike aura surrounding the housewife's dream of becoming  TV royalty.  </P> <P> James Murray's untitled charcoal drawings are meticulously realized landscapes  with huge skies and panoramic views heightened with snippets of tiny detail. In  one nocturnal image, pinpoints of light -- from invisible tract homes, perhaps  -- speckle the land surrounding a parking lot or sports field. In a daytime  scene, great rolling clouds seem to press down on the flatlands below, where  the even spacing of supports on a small bridge provides a quiet rhythmic  refrain.  </P> <P> Eve Aschheim's huge abstract drawings -- made of various materials, layered,  scrubbed away and otherwise heavily worked over -- are investigations into the  interaction of stripped-down forms. Planes turn in space or intersect, arcs are  sent on carefully chaperoned journeys, lines are thickened to bold bars or  reduced to scratches. The work is serious and searching, maybe too  self-consciously so.  </P> <P> Dennis Keeley reworks color photographs with paint, pencil, dyes and metal  leaf. Some of the resulting effects are fleetingly attractive (a ghostly  Chinese-style landscape with a metallic border, suture-like scratches  demarcating fields of intensely saturated color), but in general there seems to  be little substance here, apart from watching colors and shapes at play.  </P> <P> What: "The Mark," drawings by seven artists.  </P> <P> When: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday.  </P> <P> Where: Security Pacific Gallery, 555 Anton Blvd., Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Whereabouts: Take the San Diego Freeway to the Bristol Street exit. Anton is  off Bristol between the freeway and Sunflower Avenue.  </P> <P> Wherewithal: Admission is free.  </P> <P> Where to call: (714) 433-6000.  </P></p>

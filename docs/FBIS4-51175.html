			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- China will bring  electricity supplies within six years to more than 120 million  farmers living in remote and poverty-stricken areas.    All China's counties will get electricity supplies and over  95 percent of farmers' households are then expected to be  supplied with electricity, officials said at a meeting here  today of the Rural Electrification Working Conference, jointly  sponsored by the State Planning Commission, the State Economic  and Trade Commission and the Ministry of Electricity Industry.    At the meeting, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua urged departments of  electricity and local governments to cooperate with each other  in supplying electricity to the farmers through self-reliance  and by exploiting local resources in the poverty-stricken areas  so that the local farmers can become prosperous as soon as  possible.    China's rural electrification process achieved remarkable  progress since the 1960s, sources at the meeting said. By the  end of 1993, 97 percent of townships, 93 percent of villages and  89 percent of farmers' households had been able to use  electricity.    Per capita annual electricity consumption for the rural  population reached 48 kilowatt-hours in 1993, 7.9 times the  figure for 1978.    Many large power stations are supplying electricity to the  rural areas. Thousands of small thermal or hydro-electric power  stations have been built, while wind and solar energy are also  being used.    However, there are still 28 counties that have virtually no  electricity supply. And about 120 million farmers in a dozen  provinces and autonomous regions, mostly in western China, are  waiting to get electricity.    Officials said that these areas, often sparsely populated,  are the most difficult to be electrified because they are far  from the large regional electricity network, their local  economic growth is slow and local finance tight.    According to a blueprint on the electrification of China's  rural areas in the 1990s which was presented to the meeting by  the Ministry of Electricity, most of China's poor villages will  be able to use electricity in the coming few years.</p>

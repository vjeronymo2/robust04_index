			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman will leave  for the United States today to discuss several commercial  matters in Guatemala's relation with that country, the peace  process, and other topics.    Vielman commented on this visit during an impromptu news  conference:    [Begin recording] [Vielman] I am going to discuss the travel  warning [previous two words in English], the progress of the SGT  [expansion unknown], and the so-called parity, which is the  temporary treatment the U.S. Government would give to Central  American imports to partially align them with the benefits that  NAFTA grants.    It is also important to present to the U.S. Government the  progress made in the peace process, especially because the  United States is one of the friendly countries that supports the  Guatemalan peace process.    I will also meet with the administrative personnel of  certain  congressmen who have visited Guatemala to assess the country's  situation; therefore, it is important that they hear, from the  Foreign Ministry, the government's position on various issues.  I also plan to grant interviews to the media, such as CNN and  others. The Guatemalan Embassy is in charge of that.    [Unidentified reporter] When will you travel?    [Vielman] Today.    [Reporter] How long will the visit last?    [Vielman] Three days. The Guatemalan Foreign Ministry can  give you the list of meetings I will attend. I have scheduled  meetings that will last 30 minutes or one hour each. I have a  busy schedule.    [Reporter] Who will accompany you?    [Vielman] Our ambassador to Washington, Fernando Suzen,  director of Multilateral Relations, and Foreign Ministry Adviser  Francisco Villagran De Leon.    [Reporter] Will anyone from the private sector go?    [Vielman] No, not on this occasion, but I am taking with me  a  copy of an Economy Ministry document on the meetings it held  with the private sector last month. We have already coordinated  everything so that the position of the government and the  private sector will be coherently presented in Washington. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent F. Tavrovskiy; from the </F> "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese foreign minister and  deputy prime minister, has arrived in Moscow on a three-day  visit. During meetings with the head of the Russian Foreign  Ministry and other leaders, Hata is going to discuss a wide  range of issues. Firstly, long-standing disputes over the Kuril  Islands, which cause great anxiety on the part of the Japanese  side in light of the recent statement by Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin, that there is no territorial problem between our  two countries. Hata also wants to discuss Russia' policy in the  former Yugoslavia in greater detail, economic cooperation  issues, and the possibility of Russia joining G7 -- the minister  is very reserved regarding the latter.    Before departure, Hata admitted frankly that he was going to  ask Russia's assistance in settling the situation on the Korean  Peninsula. To all appearances, Marshall Kim Il-song continues  to develop nuclear weapons, and the pressure exerted by South  Korea and the United States is evidently insufficient. All  these issues will be discussed tomorrow when the six-hour time  lag between Moscow and Tokyo will not be affecting the minister  so strongly. Today, Hata laid a wreath at the Grave of the  Unknown soldier and visited the Moscow State University and the  Morozov hospital.

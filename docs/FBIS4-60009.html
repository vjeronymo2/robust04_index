			<p>BFN     [Text] His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan,  United Arab Emirates [UAE] President, last night received a  phone call from 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the Yemeni  Presidential Council, within the framework of the ongoing  contacts and the intensive efforts his highness exerts with  respect to the Yemeni crisis.    Discussion during the telephone contact dealt with the  situation in the Yemeni arena. Shaykh Zayid reiterated the  UAE's pressing desire for a cease-fire, pointing out that it is  regrettable that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih still  insists on pursuing the fighting in spite of the recurrent  sincere calls his highness has addressed to his excellency since  the very first moment of the war of brothers. His highness  Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan further said during the  telephone contact: I have repeatedly appealed to the Yemeni  president. I have exerted all possible effort to immediately  stop firing. We have said we are ready to pursue mediation  efforts in Yemen with every means we have to sincerely and  loyally reconcile the brothers so Yemen remains stable and so  differences among them will be submitted to the fraternal Yemeni  people whom will decide on them and have their final say,  instead of this recourse to arms. The Yemeni people are a free  people like all others, and their fate does not belong to anyone.    He added: The Yemeni people know where their real interest  lies and their happiness and stability are the objectives that  all should seek.    From his part, the Yemeni vice president called on the head  of state in the telephone contact to pursue with his well-known  wisdom his persistent efforts with his brother Arab leaders to  stop the raging battles and the bloody war and to resort to  fraternal dialogue to reach a political solution to the crisis  out of concern for the safety of Yemeni citizens and to  safeguard national unity.    The Yemeni vice chairman added: Why this shedding of blood  and the fighting among the sons of the one people for one or two  persons? Has the aggression against the south come from an  enemy of the Yemeni people? It is inconceivable that a dialogue  be held between the two parties while the fighting continues.  No side can be attacked and remain idle and accept the  imposition of a solution on it. The language of force and the  military method in settling differences is rejected and portends  dire consequences. The homeland's interest should be given  priority over any other interest.</p>

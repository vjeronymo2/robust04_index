			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's Status </F> Determined"]    [Text] A contract has been concluded between the Russian  Federation Government and the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editorial  office. It was signed 10 March in the Russian Federation  Government House by V.P. Kvasov, Russian Federation minister and  leader of the Russian Federation Government Apparatus, and  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA Chief Editor N.I. Polezhayeva.    These documents define the rights and duties of the Russian  Federation Government as the newspaper's founder and editorial  office. Perhaps for the first time relations between an  official publication and its founder are built on a legal and  civilized basis. Previously, as we remember, the operational  administration of a newspaper right up to instructions over the  telephone was considered normal. The editorial office's new  charter and the above-mentioned contract unequivocally forbid  the founder to interfere in the activity of the editorial  office. And if we are speaking of control then the contract  envisages it only in relation to finances.    That is entirely natural inasmuch as the government will  assign funds to its newspaper. But not 100 percent of the  funds, as used to be the case, not to feed an expense mechanism,  but in fact for finished output -- for the preparation,  publication, and mass distribution of the state's official  documents.    But that does not mean that ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA can become a  departmental bulletin. According to the contract the Russian  Federation Government has the right to publish its own official  materials in the newspaper free of charge. Federal and regional  organs of executive power and the structural subdivisions of the  government apparatus build their relations with the editorial  office on a contract basis.    With the signing of the contract ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's status  has been definitively determined as an official state  publication.</p>

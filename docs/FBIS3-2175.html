In 1992, China and Japan marked the 20th anniversary of the  normalization of relations between the two countries. General  Secretary Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan and His Majesty the  Japanese Emperor and Her Majesty the Japanese Empress' visit to  China in the same year indicated that Sino-Japanese relations  have entered a new stage. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's current  visit to Japan is another major event in Sino-Japanese relations  since 1992. His visit attracted world wide media attention, was  completely successful, and will have a far-reaching effect on  future Sino-Japanese good neighborly and friendly relations,  especially on the development of economic and trade cooperation  between the two countries.  <H5>  Sino-Japanese Cooperation Is the Trend of the Times </H5>   Wherever they went, Vice Premier Zhu and his party were  warmly welcomed by personalities of the Japanese Government and  people from all circles. His visit created a series of climaxes  and many touching scenes.    During his visit, Vice Premier Zhu met with the Japanese  Emperor and held important talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa,  Foreign Minister Hata, and other major members of the Japanese  Cabinet. Their talks were conducted in a friendly and harmonious  atmosphere and the two sides had identical views on many  important issues. Vice Premier Zhu also had very wide contacts  with people from various circles of Japan, especially people  from Japan's economic circles. According to incomplete  statistics, during his more than 30 meetings in various forms  with people from Japan's economic circles, more than 260  well-known Japanese entrepreneurs and bankers directly conversed  with Vice Premier Zhu, and over 1,400 people from Japan's  economic circles attended his speech sessions. The heads of all  major economic organizations in Tokyo and the Kansai and Kyushyu  areas, including the major leaders of Japan's six largest  enterprise groups -- Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Sanwa,  and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Banking -- exchanged views and had  discussions with Vice Premier Zhu on the exchanges, cooperation,  and other issues between China and Japan. They expressed great  enthusiasm in further developing the economic, trade,  scientific, and technological cooperation between the two  countries.    From Vice Premier Zhu's current visit to Japan we can see  that the world, especially Japan, is trying to reunderstand  China -- a "Chinese fever" of being willing to broaden the scope  of cooperation with China has surfaced in Japan. The surfacing  of this fever is not an accident but a product of the  combination of the evolution of international relations after  the Cold War, the change in Japan's domestic situation, and  China's dynamic economic development. Following the end of the  Cold War, international relations, especially relations between  big countries, are undergoing an in-depth readjustment, and  giving priority to the economy has become an important factor  for guiding state to state relations. Since the world entered  the 1990's, the economies of the West have been widely in  recession and economic friction between the United States,  Japan, and Europe has intensified. The United States and Europe  have jointly applied pressure on Japan, demanding that Japan  open up its market, increase its domestic demand and imports,  and reduce its trade surplus. Over the decades after WWII,  based on the principle of "founding the nation on trade," Japan  has established an export-oriented economic structure. Its  foreign trade surplus exceeded $140 billion last year. The  situation facing Japan this year is: the increased external  pressure; the domestic economic decline, which has lasted 35  months; Japanese products have been less competitive in the  international market due to the appreciation of the Japanese yen  and therefore, readjusting its industrial structure has become a  pressing task. An increasing number of people of insight from  Japan's economic circles have realized that developing  Sino-Japanese economic, trade, scientific, and technological  cooperation, and undergoing industrial restructuring are one of  the important ways to free Japan from its economic predicament.    Explain Away the Doubts and Misgivings to Enhance  Confidence    While Japan's economic circles hold favorable views on  China's economy, some people have common doubts and misgivings  -- such as: what if China's inflation gets out of control,  resulting in social turbulences; what if reform encroaches on  foreign investors' interests in China; what if the system of  separating local tax revenues from those of the central  government intensiflies the contradictions between the central  authorities and local authorities; and can China's economy  continue to develop rapidly and in a sustained and healthy  manner. In one word, will China's reform succeed? Vice Premier  Zhu gave pointed and unequivocal answers to aforementioned  questions on various occasions.    Vice Premier Zhu said: Our reform was initiated based on  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics; under the direct leadership of  President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng; and after in-depth  deliberation and repeated discussions pooling the wisdom of the  whole party and nation and making use of the experiences of  developed countries, including Japan. China's major measures  for market economic reform have been instituted since 1 January  this year. It is unprecedented to institute comprehensive and  mutually supplemental financial, taxation, foreign exchange,  investment, and enterprise reforms in a country with a  population of nearly 1.2 billion; you can imagine the complexity  and arduousness of this work. In Japan, it took 10 years to  institute the consumption tax system alone; three Cabinets  changed hands during this period. However, in China, major  reform measures have been carried out smoothly in the past 50  days and more; there have not been any major problems -- the  market has been stable, social stability has been maintained,  and the public has been assured. The central government's  financial revenues and the country's foreign exchange reserve  have been on the increase. All these indicate the Chinese Party  and Government's prestige, courage, resourcefulness, and  ability. We are determined to carry through to the end the  reform of building a socialist market economic system. China's  reform will triumph!    While speaking on the current hot issue that has drawn  international attention -- China's inflation problem -- Vice  Premier Zhu said: Hong Kong's inflation is still at 9 percent.  Mainland China's inflation is not as serious as people have  thought. From 1990 to 1992, China's inflation had been  maintained at one digit, and it was 13 percent last year, which  was a little too high. The main reason was that the price  reform lifted the control over the prices of some capital goods  that were originally under planned economic control and whose  prices were too low. Excessive increase in the scale of capital  construction also contributed to the increase of capital goods  prices. We have taken measures to control the scale of the  capital construction and have appropriately controlled the  monetary supply. However, because more price reform measures  will be instituted this year, this year's inflation will still  be at about 10 percent. But we have the confidence to gradually  lower it to one digit next year. Chinese workers' income  increased 25 percent last year; taking the inflation into  account, people's living standards still continued to improve  and Chinese society is stable.    Vice Premier Zhu continued: This year is crucial to China's  economic reform. Major reform measures will be launched,  investigations and studies will be conducted in the course of  practice, and these measures will be adjusted and improved.  Next year the country will further adapt to the new situation  of reform, and the year after next, China's economy will begin  to enter the normal market economic course. He predicted that  China's economy will continue to develop rapidly and in a  sustained and healthy manner over a fairly long period ahead and  its annual economic growth will be maintained at 8-9 percent.    Vice Premier Zhu stressed on many occasions in Japan:  Success  in China's economic reform will create more favorable conditions  for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and will contribute to  both countries' economic rejuvenation and prosperity. In  carrying out its economic reform, China has always paid  attention to protecting the interests of foreign investors,  including Japanese investors, in China.    Vice Premier Zhu's candid, realistic, and convincing remarks  and answers have to a large extent removed Japan's economic  circles' doubts and misgivings about China and have enhanced  their confidence in China's economic reform. After meeting with  Vice Premier Zhu or after hearing his speeches, many people from  Japan's economic circles said they believed China's economic  reform definitely will succeed, adding that Japan's economic  circles can feel relieved and should not hesitate to develop  economic, trade, and technological cooperation with China.  Fumio Sakurauchi, former speaker of Japan's Lower House and  chairman of the Japan Trade Promotion Council, said the news  Vice Premier Zhu brought was encouraging and was being spread  around Japan.    There Is Much To Be Achieved if We Seize the  Opportunity    In conversations with people from the Japanese business  community, Vice Premier Zhu pointed out that the Chinese and  Japanese economies are mutually complementary and both sides can  make up each other's deficiencies. The evolving situation is  providing a historic opportunity for mutually beneficial  cooperation between the two countries. The fast growing Chinese  economy needs Japan's capital and technology while Japan, which  is undergoing the most profound post-war industrial  restructuring, needs China's market, low-cost, high-quality  labor forces, and abundant resources. Seizing the opportunity is  a major challenge of profound significance facing both China and  Japan.    Many people are aware of the opportunity; many in the  Japanese business community have one question or another on  whether and how they can utilize this opportunity. Some people  are worried that industrial readjustment and the shift of some  manufacturing to China will result in the "hollowing out" of  Japan, disrupting Japan's employment and stability. Vice  Premier Zhu hit the nail right on the head when he pointed out:  Japan is reaping a trade surplus of over $100 billion annually.  This situation cannot be sustained for long. High labor costs  have resulted in Japan's gradual loss of its competitiveness in  traditional products. Japan will lag behind and find itself in  trouble if it does not take timely action to readjust its  industrial structure. Some mass media in the United States have  criticized the "hollowing out" of Japan. As a matter of fact,  many large U.S. corporations have already readjusted their  production structure by shifting manufacturing to China and  Southeast Asia. They provided training to the surplus work force  and shifted them to industries that yield a higher added value.  The end result of this is increased international  competitiveness of U.S. products. This is also one of the  reasons the U.S. economy is recovering faster than others. Many  Japanese big corporations have adopted the same strategy with  striking results.    Some people are worried that technology transfers will help  make China a competitor to Japan. Vice Premier Zhu: It's not  true. Japan's principal way of transferring technology to China  is joint production under the joint-venture format. Under such  arrangements, China and Japan will become, instead of  competitors, partners of equal and mutually beneficial  cooperation working jointly in developing the international  market. Many farsighted Japanese businessmen have already  started doing so. Cooperation in the production of videotape  recorders between China and Matsushita Electric Industrial  Company serves as a model. Imports of Japan's technology  accounted for 28 percent of China's total technology imports in  1993. Kazuhira Seki, president of the well-known Isuzu Motors,  told Vice Premier Zhu that his company has seen an improvement  in economic returns by transferring technology and undertaking  joint production with China.    Certainly, in the process of deepening Sino-Japanese  cooperation, China and Japan will inevitably encounter some  problems. Vice Premier Zhu believed that there are problems on  the way to development. As China's reform moves forward with  success, and so long as the two sides will -- on an equal and  mutually beneficial footing -- display mutual understanding and  accommodation and consult each other in a friendly way, problems  can be solved without too much difficulty.    During his visit, Vice Premier Zhu emphasized on more than  one occasion: The respective characteristics of the Chinese and  Japanese economies and the favorable temporal, geographical,  human, political, economical, and other factors are closely  binding our two countries together. Sino-Japanese cooperation  is taking shape like an irresistible historical tide. There are  very bright prospects for cooperation between the two countries.  Trade between China and Japan in 1933 was worth $39 billion, a  record high. Vice Premier Zhu said: This is not a small  figure. However, when compared to the potential for  Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the figure is quite small.  A figure ten times that would be about right. The day that  this will be attained should not be far away and the two  countries should make common efforts. These comments by Vice  Premier Zhu were warmly received and struck a strong sympathetic  chord in Japan's business community. As many friends in the  Japanese business community told Vice Premier Zhu and his  entourage, the business communities of China and Japan should  join hands to seize the historic opportunity, utilize their  potential, and pool their efforts in pioneering undertakings to  jointly usher in a new era of Sino-Japanese relations centered  on economic cooperation.</p>

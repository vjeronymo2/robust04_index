			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Weak inflation spurs Treasury INFLATION expectations continued to fall last month, with headline and underlying retail price inflation subdued and labour costs and wage settlements at very low levels, the Treasury said yesterday. In its monthly monetary report, the Treasury remained bullish about prospects for growth, saying that recent figures pointed to 'very encouraging trends' even though some indicators weakened last month. On inflation, the report points out that world commodity prices are sluggish. Oil prices have fallen by 1 per cent since the last report while non-oil commodity prices have fallen by 1.9 per cent. However, the price of food worldwide has risen 15.7 per cent since last year, and in the UK food made the biggest contribution to the increase in the RPI in July. In that month prices rose by 1.4 per cent compared with a year ago. Seasonal food prices fell by significantly less between June and July than between the same months last year. Non-seasonal food prices rose. The Treasury said that in spite of recent strong growth in M0 - mainly notes and coins in circulation - there was no underlying acceleration in narrow money. 'Narrow money's growth reflects some continuing adjustment to earlier cuts in interest rates as well as the upward trend in retail sales,' said the report. The Treasury said that the latest average of independent forecasts of underlying inflation in the fourth quarter was 3.4 per cent, down from 3.7 per cent, which was the forecast a month ago. Consumers are becoming more confident that house prices will rise, a survey showed yesterday. The latest Gallup Housing Market confidence report, was based on 2,000 interviews among the general public in August. It reveals that four times as many home owners expect house prices to rise than to fall in the next six months. However, lingering concerns about the state of the housing market means that one-third of those interviewed cautioned against buying again. According to Gallup, the main obstacles to a faster recovery in the housing market are affordability, lack of savings and fear of redundancy. In the south-east negative equity continues to dog the market. About a third of owner-occupiers aged over 35 say that their home is worth less than the size of the outstanding mortgage.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Letter: Sunday trading: protect staff or follow Scotland? (2) Sir, Your editorial, 'Act swiftly on Sunday trading', is timely and commands overwhelming support among the public. That the law in England and Wales regarding Sunday trading is an ass is easily demonstrated. First, retailing and shopping is a wholly legal and desirable activity, but it is restricted by the mores and conditions current in 1950. Also ridiculous is the fact that unregulated Sunday trading is legal in an important part of the UK, to wit Scotland. What is required now is action to bring the law on Sunday trading in England and Wales into line with the law in Scotland. If, however, parliament insists on defying the will of the people then I am afraid that the law in Scotland must be brought into line with the restrictions in England and Wales. If Sunday trading is judged by our legislators, some of whom represent Scottish parliamentary seats, to be bad for the English and the Welsh, it must also be bad for the Scots.

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Downturn at Kewill Systems The sale of a loss-making offshoot left Kewill Systems, a Surrey-based computer software supplier, with retained losses of Pounds 5.69m for the year to March 31, against profits of Pounds 1.92m. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 435,000 (Pounds 2.42m). Operating profits were Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 3.12m) after losses of Pounds 2.28m from Weigang MCS, a German subsidiary which was sold to its management earlier this year. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 5.6m relating to the sale reflecting the implementation of an Accounting Standards Board requirement about the write-back of acquired goodwill. Turnover totalled Pounds 33.3m (Pounds 41.8m) including Pounds 2.34m (Pounds 9.09m) from discontinued operations. Losses per share were 0.6p (earnings 19.91p). The Weigang episode has cast a pall over Kewill for the past 18 months but Mr Kevin Overstall, chairman, was confident the worst was over with improved sales in the UK and US and a better performance from Han Dataport, an Austrian subsidiary. Directors intend to apply to the court to approve a capital reduction to eliminate the deficit on distributable reserves enabling the group to resume dividend payments. The shares rose 18p to 192p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- A plenary session of the Supreme Council of  Ukraine took place on 3 February, at the beginning of which a  law "On the Formation of Local Bodies of Power and  Self-Government" was adopted. The law envisages in particular  the division of power into bodies of local self-government and  bodies of state power. The chairmen of oblast, rayon, town,  settlement and village councils are directly elected by the  populace, and in accordance with their post they head the  executive committees of the relevant councils and have dual  subordination. The chairmen of councils and the executive  bodies they head are accountable to and under the control of the  relevant councils, but on issues of carrying out the authorities  of state executive power delegated to them they are subordinate  to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The last article of the  law envisages that after elections of deputies and chairmen of  councils and the formation of executive bodies, the law of  Ukraine "On the Representative of the President of Ukraine" will  become invalid. A separate resolution envisages that elections  of deputies to village and oblast councils and their chairmen  will be conducted at the same time as the election of the  president of Ukraine on 26 June 1994.    According to Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council,  the issue of amendments and additions to the law on elections of  people's deputies of Ukraine was put to the vote for the seventh  time on 3 February. But this time the voting did not yield  positive results. [passage omitted]</p>

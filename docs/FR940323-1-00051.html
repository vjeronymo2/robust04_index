			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Talussnails are extremely sensitive to desiccation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sedimentation resulting from disturbance of the talus and associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vegetation. In general, desert snails are known to protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> themselves from drying out by crawling into deep, cool rockslides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are not filled with soil. The limestone rock or other talus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that contains calcium carbonate is crucial to the species, as it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aids in shell deposition and neutralizes carbonic acid that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced during estivation (Hoffman 1990). The San Xavier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> talussnail is known to estivate for up to three years and in most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years is only active for three or four days (Hoffman 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The San Xavier talussnail was included as a Category 2 species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Service's May 22, 1984, notice of review of candidate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invertebrates (49 FR 21664) and in the January 6, 1989, animal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> candidate notice of review (54 FR 554). Category 2 species are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those for which the Service has some evidence of vulnerability, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which there is insufficient scientific and commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to support proposed rules at the time. The San Xavier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> talussnail was included as a Category 1 species in the November 21,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991, animal candidate notice of review (56 FR 58804). Category 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species are those for which the Service has sufficient biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data to support proposals for listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application to the San Xavier talussnail ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sonorella eremita <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) are as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The present or threatened destruction, modification, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> curtailment of its habitat or range.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The San Xavier talussnail is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very restricted endemic and is extremely vulnerable to any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disturbance that would remove talus, increase interstitial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sedimentation, or otherwise alter moisture conditions in its habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., road or trail expansion or alteration, mining exploration)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Hoffman 1990). Within the species' habitat are inactive mining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospects and mines, mining stakes, a powerline across the east  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ridge, and a road leading to a microwave site on the hilltop. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large copper mine is located nearby. There are housing developments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of small acreage to the north and to the southwest of the hill. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat is too steep (30 to 40 percent slope) to permit house  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction, but possible future threats include additional road  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction, expansion of the copper mine and/or tailings, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small-scale prospecting and mining.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

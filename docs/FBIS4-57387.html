			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 16 May (AFP) -- In the general  elections held on Monday, after the Central Vote-Counting Board  [JCE] had counted 46.14 percent of the votes, President Joaquin  Balaguer led with 43.40 percent of the vote, while social  democratic opposition candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez had  received 40.47 percent of the vote. The official report is  based on 1,645,179 votes cast, 1,557,712 of which were declared  valid.    These figures reportedly guarantee Balaguer's assumption of  office as president, for the seventh time, of this country of 7  million people.    The election results, nevertheless, were challenged by Pena  Gomez on Tuesday. The opposition candidate reported a "blatant  fraud" perpetrated by the JCE, which reportedly had left some  200,000 voters out of the lists.    Also participating in the race for the presidency are the  Party of the Dominican Liberation of former president Juan  Bosch, the Independent Revolutionary Party [PRI], and the Unity  Independent Movement-New Power party. The following results  are based on 46.14 percent of the counted votes.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Party                    |Votes                    |Percent                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PRSC                     |676,057                  |43.40                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PRD                      |630,057                  |40.47                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PLD                      |204,587                  |13.13                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PRI                      |35,249                   |2.26                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |New Power                |11,285                   |0.72 EOT                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

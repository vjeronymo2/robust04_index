			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 26 (CTK) -- The main government  coalition party, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), supports the  strict application of the lustration law and believes that any  doubts about its violation should be checked, ODS Deputy  Chairman Jiri Vlach said at a press conference today.    He was reacting to claims that the lustration (screening)  law  had been violated in the case of two high-ranking officers of  the Czech Army. The allegation was made by an ODS member of  parliament Tomas Fejfar, deputy chairman of the Parliamentary  Defense and Security Committee on the Nova television station on  May 24. He said Defense Minister Antonin Baudys had admitted  the fact to him.    The newspaper RUDE PRAVO then speculated the following day  the men in question were Karel Pezl, former Czech Army chief of  staff and now military adviser to Baudys, and Colonel Rostislav  Kotil who commands the South Sector of the UNPROFOR [United  Nations Protection Force] peace keeping unit in Croatia.    Vlach said today that Fejfar's claims should be properly  investigated.    Baudys told reporters today that both Pezl and Kotil met all  the requirements of the lustration law as stipulated in Interior  Ministry documents.    Under the Lustration Law of October 1991 persons who held  senior posts in the Communist Party, the paramilitary militia or  the StB [State Security] secret police in the former regime are  debarred from holding state functions for five years.    Colonel Kotil told CTK today that he was considering suing  those who reported he had received a positive lustration  certificate (proving his collaboration).</p>

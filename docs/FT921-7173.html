			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / The Week Ahead: Results due UNILEVER, the consumer products group, reports tomorrow its fourth-quarter and full-year figures. With the US poised uncertainly between recession and recovery, the UK economy still in the doldrums and growth petering out in continental Europe, the results will depend on Unilever's success in cutting costs to improve margins. Analysts' forecasts for full-year pre-tax profits range from Pounds 1.8bn to Pounds 1.84bn, a modest increase on 1990's Pounds 1.78bn. Much of the difference between the forecasts is due to assumptions about how Unilever will allocate extraordinary charges incurred during the year. British Gas will report results for the 12 months to December 31 on Thursday. This year the company is changing its accounting year-end from March 31 to December 31, so it will also supply a figure for the nine months to December 31. Most analysts expect profit before tax for the year to December to be between Pounds 1.24bn and Pounds 1.28bn. British Gas has already indicated it will announce a full-year dividend of 6p. The City will be most interested in finding out about the company's talks with the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) over OFT proposals to halve British Gas's industrial market and hand its pipeline business to another company. British Gas has so far resisted the OFT's proposals and is being threatened with a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC). UK insurers are bracing themselves to report some of the worst-ever results in the history of the industry next week. Two composites (general and life companies) - Commercial Union and Royal Insurance - report next week. Both will post losses for 1991. CU, which reports on Wednesday, will do best with a loss restricted to between Pounds 60m and Pounds 70m compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.4m last year. Royal Insurance, which reports on Thursday, has been devastated by losses from mortgage indemnity claims and could see its losses rise to between Pounds 270m and Pounds 310m, up from Pounds 187m in 1990. SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, reports its full-year results tomorrow. Analysts expect the company will for the first time make a Pounds 1bn profit compared with Pounds 860m last year. Analysts will be looking carefully at the growth rate of SmithKline's pharmaceuticals sales which have been slower than some of its rivals. In particular, they will be looking carefully at revenues from Kytril, SmithKline's treatment for nausea in cancer patients. It competes directly with Glaxo's Zofran. ICI, the chemicals giant, reports its full-year results on Thursday and is expected to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 835m. The figures are unlikely to demonstrate any sign of an upturn in demand for commodity chemicals. Attention will be focused on the pharmaceuticals division (about 70 per cent of group profit) and progress of the company's rationalisation programme. The final dividend is expected to be kept at 34p. Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, is expected on Thursday to announce increased pre-tax profits of about Pounds 170m (Pounds 126m) for the year to December 1991. The increase was mainly due to last year's acquisition of Yale &amp; Valor, the locks and domestic appliances group. After its recently failed hostile bid for Racal Electronics the group is aiming to increase profits from organic growth and agreed takeovers.

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Senior accountant is sacked ERNST &amp; YOUNG, the accountancy firm, has been forced to tighten its internal controls after one of its partners was found by the accountants' disciplinary committee to have 'misappropriated' more than Pounds 300,000 last year. Mr Andrew Oakley, a partner in the firm for more than 20 years, has been dismissed and excluded from membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. He was also ordered to pay Pounds 350 costs. Ernst &amp; Young confronted Mr Oakley in early spring this year, fired him and referred his case to the institute. The firm was able to provide proof for the removal of Pounds 300,000 between January 9 and October 30 last year, although the sums and the dates are believed to have been more extensive. Mr Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner, stressed that no client money was involved. He added that the firm's internal review procedures had been examined and tightened and said he was 'reasonably confident' it could not happen again.</p>

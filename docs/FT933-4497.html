			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (3): For once, Europe is ahead of the US game - Andrew Adonis looks at the likely impact of the new GSM networks GSM stands for Groupe Speciale Mobile, a pan-European digital telecommunications standard for a new generation of cellular services across the continent compatible with each other. The first GSM networks were launched last July in Germany, France and Denmark. Vodafone launched its UK GSM service, called 'EuroDigital', on September 1. GSM services have recently - or will soon - come on stream in the other leading west European states, and eastern Europe is following behind. Dataquest, the consultancy company, is forecasting 1m GSM subscribers in western Europe by the end of this year, growing to 13m by the end of 1997. GSM networks are not going to replace existing analogue services overnight. GSM requires new infrastructure and different, digital handsets. That leaves analogue operators, including those constructing GSM networks, with investments to recoup and capacity to fill. It also leaves their subscribers with terminals useless for digital networks. With GSM handsets retailing for around Pounds 400 in the UK - after a subsidy of more than Pounds 100 from the operators - analogue handsets selling for a quarter of the price will retain a strong attraction. Dataquest projects that shipments of GSM telephones will overtake analogue shipments by next year; and that by the end of 1997 analogue will have barely half as many subscribers as GSM. 'The speed of the transition will be variable,' says Mr Dean Eyres, Dataquest's mobile analyst. 'It will be fastest in countries like Germany, where analogue penetration was lower and competition between GSM operators is already strong.' With digital barely off the ground in the UK, Germany already has nearly 500,000 GSM subscribers, and for most German users GSM is more accessible than analogue. The old and new are therefore set to co-exist until at least the turn of the century. Indeed, some operators are deliberately delaying their GSM offerings so as to maximise the potential of existing networks. In the UK, Cellnet is still looking to double its analogue subscriber base and will not be launching its GSM service until next year. Its strategy over the coming months is to combat Mercury One-2-One and Vodafone's two digital services with special analogue deals, playing hard on its lower all-in entry fee. It is not just a question of existing capacity. Mr Stafford Taylor, Cellnet's managing director, points to rapidly falling GSM handset and infrastructure prices, and more versatile base stations appearing by the month. Motorola, for instance, has just launched a base station ('ExCell') about twice the size of a street cabinet, requiring none of the separate buildings and protective fencing of its predecessors. Mr Taylor is gambling that delayed digital gratification will bring higher short and medium-term dividends. Nor will it be a straightforward one-way migration from analogue to GSM. Operators are piggy- backing 'local' digital services, with lower access and call charges, on their 900MHz GSM networks. In the UK Vodafone's is called 'MetroDigital' and will be launched on October 1. Digital networks operating to the higher 1800MHz frequency are also being built. The launch of UK Mercury One-2-One's PCN service is imminent, and Hutchison is constructing another. In Germany the E-Plus consortium - which includes Thyssen, Veba, BellSouth and Vodafone - is also building a DCS 1800 network. In some countries far cheaper telepoint services, offering one-way communication, are advancing too. Hutchison's 'Rabbit' service has so far had only limited success in the UK, but in Benelux and France similar services have fared better - though partly because of the inadequacy of the cellular network, particularly in Paris. GSM is thus only one of a number of new or revamped mobile services entering the market. It nonetheless has a critical role to play - not only because of its technological features, but because of the mode of its introduction, which is helping to reorganise not just the cellular market, but the configuration of the telecommunications services industry across Europe. Moreover, for once Europe is ahead of the American game in mobile. The US is still engaged in a dispute between operators over two rival digital standards - time division multiple access (TDMA) and code-division multiple access (CDMA) - which is threatening to delay the widespread introduction of digital systems. GSM's principal tech- nological assets are fourfold. Being digital, its capacity is far higher than that of analogue networks. It comes with a range of value-added features. Through 'roaming' agree- ments with other GSM oper- ators, it will in due course give mobility across much of Europe. And with more than 20 countries beyond Europe having now adopted the GSM standard, including Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, it offers the prospect of cellular mobil- ity well beyond Europe. Says Mr Robert Morris, telecommunications analyst at Goldman Sachs: 'It looks as if we are going to end up with one standard for the US, and GSM for the rest of the world' - a fortuitous development for Europe's GSM users, who can expect to benefit from cheaper infrastructure and devel- opment costs in consequence. Most GSM operators now have roaming agreements with counterparts across Europe, allowing GSM subscribers to make calls in any country with a GSM network simply by inserting their personal smartcard into a digital handset. Of the wide range of value-added services available with GSM, probably the most widely appreciated will be the short message facility, allowing handsets fitted with liquid crystal screens to receive messages, like alphanumeric radiopagers. In the longer term the mobile data facility incorporated within the GSM standard will permit mobile terminals, such as portable computers and fax machines, to communicate through handsets at speeds comparable to today's fixed data lines. However, arguably the most novel and far-reaching feature of GSM is that for the first time it is providing most of Europe's cellular phone users with a choice - choice of network and choice of operator. In the UK and US, analogue networks were provided by rival operators. In most of Europe, however, the state-owned PTO provides the service, with no rival licensed and few immediate incentives for the PTO to maximise its subscriber base. By contrast, GSM licences are generally being offered to two competing operators (see table). Typically one of them is the PTO, but the cellular activities of the PTO are increasingly being moved into separate divisions and encouraged to compete aggressively. Belgacom, Belgium's state operator, has gone the farthest of all the monopolies, hiving off its GSM operation and inviting Pacific Telesis, one of the top five US cellular companies, to join it as a minority partner in the project. The reasons for this change of policy are not hard to find, although rarely stated explicitly. Most of Europe's PTOs are anxious for privatisation and greater operational flexibility. Separating out their mobile divisions, and allowing them to bid for overseas licences and to work with private sector partners, is good preparation. As for governments, which award the GSM licences, licensing rival GSM operators is a measured first step towards wider telecommunications liberalisation. Under a recent European Community agreement, full competition must be permitted in most of the fixed-wire voice market by 1998. It is also turning into a useful, and increasingly lucrative, source of government revenue. The policy of giving licences away to companies in return for commitments to build within a pre-determined timescale, and in some cases also to keep tariffs within set bounds, is giving way in poorer countries to a straight auction. Poland led the way two years ago, extracting about Dollars 100m from France Telecom and Ameritech of the US for their cellular licence. Greece turned the auction into an art form last year, when it got Dollars 164m each from two consortia for their GSM licences. Following the Greek model, the Hungarian government last month succeeded in pocketing nearly Dollars 100m in return for its licences. According to the FT's Mobile Communications newsletter, the Greek auction netted Dollars 16 per head of population; Poland Dollars 2-Dollars 3; the Hungarians nearer Dollars 5. That may be good news for southern and eastern Europe's hard-pressed taxpayers. But if it becomes the norm, then those heralding cellular as the means to meet the telecommunications needs of impoverished communities will have to find a new tune.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    GSM operators in western Europe  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              Number of Country      licences*    Operator(s)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria          1        PTO Belgium          1        PTO (with Pacific Telesis) Denmark          2        (1) PTO (2) Dansk                           Mobiltelefon (GN Great Nordic??)

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOTT OSTLER: IT'S JUST ANOTHER IN A VERY LONG LINE OF STERLING IDEAS  </P> <P> It was with shock and surprise I read last week that Donald Sterling, owner of  the Clippers, is threatening to move his franchise out of Los Angeles unless  the city builds him an $85-million arena to replace the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> I had heard rumors that the Clippers were leaving, but I assumed they were  being chased out of town by the Air Quality Management District.  </P> <P> "Is it too early to start taking nominations for the 1989 Chutzpah Award?" asks  George Kiseda, former Times staffer.  </P> <P> Just in case it isn't too early, and it never is, Kiseda (who retired a few  years ago but forgot to tell his brain) submits two candidates for the coveted  award:  </P> <P>  -- "Congress, which tried to sneak a 50% pay raise past the voters as a reward  for its splendid record in attacking the deficit, standing up to the gun lobby  and keeping close watch on the Pentagon, the CIA and the S&amp;L industry."  </P> <P>  -- "Donald Sterling, who is demanding a state-of-the-art arena as a reward for  providing the city with a state-of-the-art basketball team and state-of-the-art  ownership. Gee, that's like Morton Downey threatening to take his show off TV."  </P> <P> That's a state-of-the-art cheap shot, George. Morton Downey isn't making any  threats or demands.  </P> <P> Before we go any further, it should be pointed out that chutzpah -- the C is  silent, and the word sounds like a clearing of the throat -- is not necessarily  bad stuff. What it is is gall, or brazenness. America was founded on chutzpah.  Just ask the Indians.  </P> <P> What Sterling is showing us right now, though, is state-of-the-art chutzpah.  </P> <P> Let's examine exactly what it is that Los Angeles is in imminent danger of  losing to some other lucky Southern California city.  </P> <P> No point in rehashing the entire illustrious history of the Clipper franchise.  Let's pick it up where Donald Sterling picked it up, eight seasons ago.  </P> <P> Since then, the team truly has been one of the league's most consistent. None  of that schizo, roller-coaster performance that tears at the guts of the loyal  fans of so many NBA teams. The Clippers have a rock-steady .282 winning  percentage under the ownership of sterling Don.  </P> <P> In their five seasons in Los Angeles -- yes, this was once the fair city to  which the Clippers fled to escape economic deprivation -- they are a .276 club.  </P> <P> But what are statistics? Mere numbers. In assessing the team's value to the  community, it might be more helpful to view the franchise in poetic terms. This  team, for instance, is known as the Bermuda Triangle of draft lottery picks.  </P> <P> In the last five drafts, the Clippers have had nine first-round picks. What  have they done with that windfall of incredible talent? This season they won 21  games, which is six more than the Miami Heat won, and a whopping 15 more than  the Miami Dolphins won.  </P> <P> In fairness, last year's three-man draft crop was very good, and when Danny  Manning comes back from his injury, the team could be entertaining. What better  time for Clippers to desert their loyal fans?  </P> <P> This is a team that has traded Tom Chambers, Terry Cummings and Byron Scott,  and kept Benoit Benjamin, a center whose transmission has five gears -- first  through fourth, and salarydrive.  </P> <P> This is also a team that doesn't have a coach, state-of-the-art or otherwise.  </P> <P> In the last eight years, the Clippers have changed presidents, general  managers, head coaches -- four times, maybe going on five -- complete  front-office staffs, home cities and even ballboys. Through the years and  tears, what's the only common thread?  </P> <P> Hint: Donald Sterling.  </P> <P> Sterling says he wouldn't accept the $30-million Sports Arena-remodeling that  the Coliseum Commission is offering.  </P> <P> "Unless they build an arena that's the highest quality, has the best technology  and is totally safe, I won't sign a (new) lease," Sterling has said.  </P> <P> This, friends, is the owner of a team that, if artistic merit were the  criterion, would be playing home games at the Olympic Auditorium.  </P> <P> Still, even sub-dynastic NBA teams are hot property these days, and Sterling  says he is being hit upon by hoop-hungry Anaheim, Riverside and the San  Fernando Valley. Like the Statue of Liberty, these communities beseech Sterling  to give them the wretched refuse of his teeming team.  </P> <P> He really wants to keep his lads in downtown Los Angeles, but doggone, if the  Coliseum Commission refuses to show its appreciation for all that the Clippers  have done for this city, Sterling will be forced to move.  </P> <P> And don't insult the man with some skimpy $30-million patch-up plan.  </P> <P> If the Clippers do leave, it won't be without an outpouring of sentiment. There  might even be a dramatic demonstration.  </P> <P> I can picture the scene on the fateful day of departure, with thousands of L.A.  fans at the Sports Arena, lying down in back of the moving vans.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once the Secretary determines that a State failed to earmark the required amount of funds in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program, the State would be precluded from administering the CIL program in succeeding fiscal years. The Secretary believes that this proposed result most clearly reflects the intent of Congress. The Secretary also believes that allowing States to re-qualify would be disruptive to the consistent administration of the CIL program within a State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In those States in which there is both a DSU responsible for providing IL services to the general population and a DSU responsible for providing IL services for individuals who are blind, proposed &sect;366.32(d) would provide that the word ``Director,'' as used in subparts D and E of part 366, would mean ``the Director of the general DSU.'' This provision is proposed because only the general agency in a State has authority under State law to provide IL services on a cross-disability basis. However, both State units would be required to consult with each other with respect to the provision of services for individuals who are blind.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the Department distinguishes between procurement contracts and assistance contracts at the State level, proposed &sect;366.32(e) would permit the Director to enter into assistance contracts with centers to carry out section 723 of the Act. The Department considers assistance contracts awarded by a State as equivalent to subgrants. Proposed &sect;366.32(e) would define an assistance contract awarded by a State as an instrument whose principal purpose is merely to transfer funds allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act and 34 CFR part 366 to an eligible agency to carry out section 723 of the Act rather than as an instrument to procure services under specific terms and conditions determined by the Director. If the DSU were to use an assistance contract to award funds under section 723 of the Act, the DSU would not be permitted to add any requirements, terms, or conditions to the assistance contract other than those that would be permitted if the assistance contract were a subgrant. Under an assistance contract, the DSU would assume a role consistent with that of the Secretary under section 722 of the Act; i.e., the role of the DSU would be to ensure that the terms of the assistance contract (which are established by chapter 1 of title VII of the Act and the implementing regulations in 34 CFR parts 364, 365, and 366) are satisfied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conversely, proposed &sect;366.32(f) would implement congressional intent to prohibit the Director from entering into procurement contracts with centers to carry out section 723 of the Act. See H.R. Rep. No. 102&hyph;822, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 137 (1992) and S. Rep. No. 102&hyph;357, 92. Proposed &sect;366.32(f) would define a procurement contract as an instrument whose principal purpose is to acquire (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the DSU. Under a procurement contract, the DSU prescribes the specific services it intends to procure and the terms and conditions of the procurement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.32(g), in the enforcement of any breach of the terms and conditions of an assistance contract, the DSU would be required to follow the procedures established in proposed &sect;&sect;366.40 through 366.45.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.34(b), if the order of priorities in proposed &sect;366.22 is followed and, after meeting the priorities in proposed &sect;366.22(a) (1) and (2), there are insufficient funds under the State's allotment under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act to fund a new center under proposed &sect;366.22(a)(3), the Director would be permitted to use any excess funds in the State to assist existing centers or to return these funds to the Secretary for reallotment in accordance with section 721(d) of the Act. Proposed &sect;366.34(b) would give the Director of a DSU the same discretion that the Secretary would have under proposed &sect;366.22(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;&sect;366.39 through 366.45 would establish the enforcement and appeals procedures if the Secretary or the Director determines that a center receiving funds under section 722 or 723, respectively, of the Act is not in compliance with the standards and assurances in section 725 (b) and (c) of the Act and subparts F and G of part 366. Pursuant to section 722(g)(1) of the Act, if the Secretary determines that a center receiving funds under section 722(a) of the Act is not in compliance with the standards and assurances in section 725(b) of the Act, the Secretary is required to notify the center of the center's noncompliance. Pursuant to section 722(g)(2) of the Act, the Secretary is required to terminate funds 90 days after notifying a center that it is not in compliance with the standards and assurances in section 725(b) of the Act unless the center submits a corrective action plan to achieve compliance within 90 days after the Secretary's notification and the plan is approved by the Secretary. Proposed &sect;366.39 (a) and (b) would implement section 722(g) (1) and (2) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.39(a), the Secretary would notify the center that the Secretary will offer technical assistance to a center to develop a corrective action plan to comply with the standards and assurance. Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.39(b)(2), the Secretary would notify the center that termination of funds would occur within 90 days after the center received notice of its noncompliance unless the center requests a hearing pursuant to proposed &sect;366.39 (c) or (d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;366.39(c) would give a center 30 days from the date it receives the Secretary's written notice disapproving its corrective action plan to file a formal written appeal with the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to proposed &sect;366.39(f), the Secretary would issue a written decision to terminate funds after a hearing if the center is found out of compliance with the standards and assurances in section 725(b) of the Act and subparts F and G of 34 CFR part 366 or the center's corrective action plan cannot be approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message to the Bosnian people by Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i; </F> place and date not given--read by announcer]    [Text] World leaders are sitting and waiting for the  victims to take their last breath. These victims are the  Muslims of former Yugoslavia, and their only sin is that they  are Muslims. We do not just claim this; there is clear evidence  to prove it. The reason the world powers are against the  Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina is that it exists as a sovereign  and independent state with the ethnic Muslim population in the  majority, and the world powers cannot cope with that fact. This  is a problem facing Muslims throughout the world because the  United Nations and all other world organizations have chosen to  behave in the worst possible way in this situation. I declare  here that when it comes to the Muslim people, the UN secretary  general has tarnished his reputation and will not be able to  restore it, no matter what price he is prepared to pay.    Muslims throughout the world saw what was happening in  Bosnia, and they said: Sir, because the other side is being  helped, allow us to go to Bosnia to help the Muslims. But the  answer was: No. The Muslims then said: Allow us to send  weapons. The answer was again No, as part of a blatant attempt  to deceive the world into believing that no side is being  helped. One side has arms, the other is fighting the war  without them: one side against the other while the world  community, instead of either taking the arms from one side or  giving arms to the other, has remained on the sidelines cruelly  watching how the wretched ones fall.    They [not further identified] said they would send the blue  helmets. The Muslim countries immediately asked that their  troops be allowed to take part in the action. But the answer  was again: No. It is not just the Islamic Republic of Iran that  is not allowed to send troops; not a single Islamic country has  been allowed to set off in the direction of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  What does this mean? The soldiers sent there have been given  orders to help the Serb aggression, but the public is unaware of  this. This fact is being concealed from the Muslims. What we  are witnessing brings great shame to the Western culture and the  civlization that they constantly invoke.    America's behavior and false promises about  Bosnia-Herzegovina have yielded no results. All other  international organizations and some European  countries--England, in particular--have not produced any results  either.    A handful of Muslims has been left helpless, waiting for the  day they will be butchered. What should the Muslims do? What  other path is there, except the hajj? Only people's awareness  can destroy the West's insolence. It is not enough for some  people or ulemas from several countries to attend conferences  all over the world and issue declarations. Hundreds of such  declarations have been issued so far. Among them is the one  against the Israeli aggressor, but it has not produced any  results or helped anyone.    In conclusion, Ayatollah [word indistinct] Khamene'i said  that in Mecca during this year's hajj 15 May 1994 was declared  [as received] the Day of Bosnia-Herzegovina to protest the  suffering of the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

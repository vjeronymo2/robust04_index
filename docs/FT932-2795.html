			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / People: China clay chief of the Americas DENNIS REDIKER has been appointed president and chief executive officer of the American operations of ECC International, part of English China Clays, the world's largest producer of ball clay used as fillers and coatings in paper manufacturing. Rediker, 49, will be responsible for the group's north and south American operations which have grown substantially following the acquisition of Georgia Kaolin in 1990. He will report directly to Graham Lovering who remains managing director of ECC International's world wide industrial minerals business. English China Clays has reorganised since Andrew Teare, previously managing director of the Rugby cement group, was appointed chief executive in 1990. As part of its plan to concentrate on the industrial minerals business the group last week announced a Pounds 113.4m rights issue, a Pounds 202.3m US acquisition and plans to hive off its UK and US building materials business into a separate company. English China, which had previously announced it was pulling out of UK housebuilding, said it was acquiring Calgon, the US speciality chemicals business, for Dollars 307.5m from Merck, the US drugs group. Teare argues that Calgon will complement ECC's industrial minerals business which has become increasingly sophisticated in the use and development of speciality chemicals for paper-making and other processes. Rediker previously worked for ten years with Mead Corporation, one of the country's biggest paper manufacturers.</p>

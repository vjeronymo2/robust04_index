			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues ED&amp;F Man, the 200-year-old commodities broker, will be valued at Pounds 462.6m when it comes to market next month through a placing and public offer at 180p a share, writes Peggy Hollinger. About Pounds 110m in shares are being sold, of which Pounds 27.5m are being offered to the public. This represents about 24 per cent of the total enlarged share capital. Man was forced by the recent stock market fall to pitch its share price substantially lower than had been hoped. It had expected to float on an historic price/earnings ratio of about 12 but the shares will start on a multiple of 9.5. The share price reduction has left Man with what appears to be an attractive notional yield of 6 per cent. But analysts are not convinced the group will be able to sustain such healthy dividend payments. 'If you look at the operational cash flow over the past four years, they have moved from hugely negative to quite positive,' said one. The price announced yesterday may leave the shares looking cheap if only the p/e is taken into account. But there are several concerns over the quality of Man's earnings, which mean the jury could be out for some time.</p>

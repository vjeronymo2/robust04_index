			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-HARVARD STUDENT FACES TRIAL;  </P> <P> LA HABRA 'HOMEBOY': 'WHY' STILL BAFFLES  </P> <P> It has been more than 3 years since Jose Luis Razo crouched in a trash bin  outside a La Habra dairy and made a decision that changed the course of his  life.  </P> <P> The Harvard University freshman had just returned home from Cambridge to spend  the holidays with his family. Now, the day after Christmas, he hid behind the  Driftwood Dairy, down the street from the Catholic church where, as a  precocious grammar school pupil, he first demonstrated the academic and  athletic abilities that would take him out of the barrio.  </P> <P> With a .22-caliber pistol in his hand and a ski mask pulled over his face, Razo  waited until there were no customers in the store, then emerged from the  dumpster and robbed the elderly owner of $60.  </P> <P> "I was afraid he would kill," said the robbery victim, Damnang Meas during  Razo's preliminary hearing in 1987.  </P> <P> It was the first of more than a dozen holdups that Razo, now 22, says he  committed while home on breaks during his first 2 years at Harvard. His  confession to police -- and later to The Times and other newspapers -- in July,  1987, shocked La Habra's close-knit Latino community, which had been enormously  proud of Razo and still expected great things to come.  </P> <P> This month, Razo's trial for 10 robberies in Orange County is scheduled to get  under way. His trial in Los Angeles County for three more robberies is  scheduled to begin in April.  </P> <P> Razo's strange saga made national news when it first came to light, and lawyers  in the case expect the trial to produce the same kind of interest. Eighteen  months after Razo called La Habra police and confirmed their suspicions that he  was the "ski-mask bandit" who had terrorized clerks in fast-food restaurants,  markets and stores, the question of why remains baffling.  </P> <P> Until his arrest, Razo's life had had a storybook quality: A Mexican immigrant  raised in humble surroundings, he had excelled as a student and athlete at  demanding parochial schools and had taken on responsibility as a community  youth leader. At the country's most prestigious university, Razo was an  above-average student and a hard-nosed, respected football player.  </P> <P> But there were also a few blemishes on his record. In 1983, a "theft matter"  involving Razo was handled "informally" by Fullerton police, according to court  documents. No further information about that incident was available.  </P> <P> In 1984, Razo, then 17, was made a ward of juvenile court for stealing a wallet  from an unlocked car in La Habra. That same year, Razo was charged with assault  and battery after he got involved in a fight at a party in Brea. Razo admitted  fighting with two individuals at the party, but he said the fight started when  one of them made "derogatory remarks about Mexicans," according to court  records. Brea police agreed that the incident was one of mutual combat, and the  charges were eventually dropped.  </P> <P> And in 1986, Razo was arrested and charged with misdemeanor grand theft. The  incident involved the theft of a watch and sunglasses from a student from a  rival high school at a party in La Habra. That charge was dismissed the  following year "in the interest of justice," court records show.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kept It Well-Hidden  </P> <P> Richard Guthrie, director of the Boys' Club of La Habra, where Razo spent  hundreds of hours as a youth, said that he and others at the club knew about  the 1986 incident, but no one paid it much heed.  </P> <P> "He kept it very well-hidden," Guthrie said. "It could have been a strong  signal that something was amiss."  </P> <P> While he was an outstanding student at Our Lady of Guadalupe School, teachers  noted that Razo was sometimes unruly. His seventh-grade teacher, Rose Stalon,  wrote on his report card, "Jose's behavior in class is very disruptive."  </P> <P> On a later report card, Stalon wrote that Jose's behavior had shown "some  improvement" and that he was "helpful in many ways."  </P> <P> Razo's principal at Our Lady of Guadalupe, Sister Mary Louise, now in Northern  California, said that Razo was "one of the most brilliant boys" she had ever  had.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Natural Leader'  </P> <P> "He was a natural leader," she said. "He was innately very bright. . . . What  Jose said, and what Jose did, others willingly followed him."  </P> <P> Louise said that Razo maintained contact with her even after he went to  Harvard. "He was proud that I was proud of him," she said. "He would tell me  what kind of a place it (Cambridge) was . . . about the football team. . . . He  wondered if the games were televised here."  </P> <P> Razo and family members declined recent requests to talk before his upcoming  trial. In his statements to reporters and police in 1987, Razo said that he  used the money from the robberies to help his family and friends and also to  buy drugs.  </P> <P> "Whatever my family wanted, it got," Razo said in a jailhouse interview in  July, 1987. "I needed money for school and plane flights back and forth from  Harvard."  </P> <P> He also said that he didn't fit in at Harvard and that no one there understood  him.  </P> <P> "I am a homeboy now," Razo said, then added in Spanish: "I don't sell out my  own ethnic identity."  </P> <P> Before he dropped the case because of an unspecified conflict of interest,  deputy public defender James S. Egar said the case revolved around "mental  issues" -- the pressures Razo felt as the symbol of success for a depressed  neighborhood and the isolation he experienced as one of the few Latinos at  Harvard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Truth Is Confounding'  </P> <P> "The truth is so confounding in this case," Egar said. "He used to tell his mom  that he would buy her a house in Beverly Hills when he was a lawyer. In one  day, he went from the shining star of his family to a con . . . an inmate, just  another Mexican armed robber."  </P> <P> Razo's current court-appointed attorney, John D. Barnett, is less inclined to  talk about the problems his client might have had bridging the distinctive  worlds of Harvard and La Habra, saying only that Razo's background "will have a  place in the case."  </P> <P> Barnett, in contrast with Egar, steadfastly maintains his client is innocent.  </P> <P> He plans to introduce evidence showing that Razo confessed to crimes he did not  commit and that his statements to police were obtained by "constitutionally  deficient" means, he said.  </P> <P> Barnett would not say why Razo would confess to robberies he did not do but  said it will be "interesting" to find that out during the trial.  </P> <P> "People confess to crimes they don't do all the time," Barnett said. "The  techniques and behavior of the police . . . resulted in the receipt of an  unreliable series of statements."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Confused, Vulnerable'  </P> <P> During Razo's preliminary hearing, defense attorney Egar attacked the validity  of the confession on a number of grounds. One key area was Razo's unusual  behavior while talking to the police that Egar said showed his client's state  of mind to have been "confused, vulnerable, volatile."  </P> <P> When he first contacted police, Razo asked for a helicopter ride. Then, while  in a police car on the way to the station, he asked if they could stop at a  friend's house to pick up "a joint."  </P> <P> Later, Razo told police that "God has sent me to change this world" and other  seemingly irrational statements.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans dismissed Razo's religious statements  -- which included a claim that Satan was interfering with his phone calls to  police -- as relatively "tame" and suggested that Razo might have feigned his  bizarre behavior after confessing to the robberies.  </P> <P> "I'm sure he's rather brilliant," Evans said. "It seems like he knows what he  was doing."  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Arthur D. Guy Jr. ruled that Razo's statements were made  voluntarily and were admissible.  </P> <P> The prosecutor now on the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravi Mehta, says that he  fully expects Barnett to attack the confession in every way imaginable -- and  then, if it is once again ruled admissible, to drop the not-guilty plea and try  to negotiate a reduced sentence for Razo.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Too Much to Lose  </P> <P> "I don't really expect this case to go to trial," Mehta said. "He's just got  too much to lose."  </P> <P> Barnett declined to respond directly to Mehta's prediction that the defense  will eventually plead guilty in the case in exchange for a reduced sentence.  </P> <P> In a case settlement discussion last March, however, Razo's former defense  attorney seemed to say essentially the same thing as Mehta. Egar told Superior  Court Judge Myron Brown that if Razo's statements to La Habra police are  admitted during the trial, "the D.A. cannot lose this case."  </P> <P> Egar argued that because of Razo's exemplary background and the intense  pressure he was under at Harvard, he should not serve more than 4 years in  prison. Mehta termed the request "ridiculous" and instead asked for a 10-year  sentence, pointing out that Razo faces a maximum prison sentence of more than  20 years for the multiple robberies if he was convicted in a trial.  </P> <P> Brown offered Razo a 7-year sentence, but he turned the deal down. Egar would  not comment on any aspect of the case.  </P> <P> Razo spent a total of 16 months in Orange County Jail before friends and  relatives were able to secure his release on $150,000 bail pending his two  trials.  </P> <P> Since he got out in November, Razo has tried to reconstruct for himself some  semblance of a normal life. He attended his brother's football games at La  Habra High School last fall. He works for a longtime family friend and is  enrolled in courses at Fullerton College, said Boys' Club director Guthrie.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sobering Experience  </P> <P> Razo's time in jail was a "tremendously sobering experience for him," said  Guthrie, who sat with Razo and his parents at a couple of football games. "His  mental attitude is very good. He seems to be somewhat quiet, subdued, very  aware of what's going on in the world around him.  </P> <P> "He realizes he's been through some rough times. . . . I think he's hopeful  that it (the trial) will come out in the best possible way for him," Guthrie  said, adding that exactly what that would be is "hard to define."  </P> <P> "He wants to get it over with," Guthrie said.  </P> <P> Guthrie says the Boys' Club has made a conscious decision "not to abandon"  Razo.  </P></p>

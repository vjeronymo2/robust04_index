			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Watchdog lifts sales suspension WINDSOR Life, the Telford-based life assurance company, said yesterday that regulators have lifted a 'voluntary suspension' of its sales force. The suspension was imposed on March 19 following a revision of training and testing procedures. The move will allow some of the company's agents to resume selling today. The remainder of the agents are likely to be back at work soon. The company also said that its chief executive, Mr Brian Wood, has resigned and has been replaced by Mr William Yelverton, head of international operations at New York Life, Windsor's parent company. Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life assurance industry, asked Windsor to suspend its own sales force following a routine compliance review in December. Lautro would not comment on the shortcomings it found, but it is believed that sales agents were unable to answer basic questions about the products they were selling or about the financial circumstances of their clients. Windsor Life said that a new training and testing programme has been designed for the company with the assistance of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte and City solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines. Only those sales agents who have passed the new training and testing procedure and for whom 'fit and proper' reference checks have been provided will be able to resume selling. Windsor Life said that following a review, it did not believe that any of its clients had lost money as a result of the actions of its sales agents.</p>

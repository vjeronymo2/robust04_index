			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAFETY OF BICYCLISTS IS TWO-WAY STREET  </P> <P> Re Richard Beene's commentary on bicycle safety: When I gave up motorcycles, my  entire family had sighs of relief.  </P> <P> Now we all participate in another life-threatening sport, but we are not going  to quit.  </P> <P> We find that the rewards outweigh the risks, which we reduced with proper  bicycle maintenance, using helmets, practicing defensive riding and using  designated bike lanes and paths whenever possible.  </P> <P> The cyclist can make the difference. I, unfortunately, know all too well the  alternatives to responsible cycling.  </P> <P> CULLEN ELLINGBURGH  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

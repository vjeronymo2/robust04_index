			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Competition in mobile phones THE BRITISH government can take pride in its policy of injecting competition into the market for mobile communications. The decision to license Vodafone as a rival to Cellnet, BT's majority-owned subsidiary, in the early 1980s was largely responsible for the fast take-up of cellular services in the UK compared with other European Community countries. Now the prospect of a new rival, Mercury one2one, launching its service later this month is causing the established duopoly to cut prices. Cellnet yesterday reduced the standard cost of calls made from London by 25 per cent and launched a new service which knocks a further 20 per cent off call charges in the capital. Vodafone made similar moves in June. One2one is the first of a new breed of personal communications networks. PCNs, licensed in 1989, are a variation on cellular networks. The government's original aim in introducing competition to the cellular duopoly was to drive down prices so that mobile services were affordable to personal as well as business customers. While the forthcoming launch of one2one marks a milestone in the government's pro-competition policy, the overall goal of a mass market for mobile services is a long way from being reached. Even following the recent price cuts, mobile services will be beyond the grasp of all but the richest personal consumers. This is not because the costs of mobile communications are intrinsically high, but rather because low costs are not being fully passed through to customers. Vodafone's fat profit margins - it earned Pounds 322m pre-tax on sales of Pounds 664m in its last financial year - show the scope for price cuts. Tariffs could be halved and the company would still be virtually at break-even. Careful adjustment The casual observer could be forgiven for thinking that the new competition from one2one will quickly erode those margins. But the situation is more complicated. What is taking place is not an all-out price war but a carefully calculated adjustment of the marketplace to absorb a new player. Although some prices are coming down, others are going up. For example, customers who subscribe to Cellnet's new service will make calls at 20p a minute from inside London but pay a punitive 50p a minute - double the normal rate - if they call from outside the capital. The reason more vigorous price-cutting has not occurred is hardly a secret. Mercury has no interest in provoking a price war - at least until it is better established - and so is not pitching aggressively for the duopoly's lucrative business customers. Similarly, Vodafone and Cellnet want to keep their monopoly rents for as long as possible. Their responses to one2one are designed to segment the market, allowing them to compete for personal customers and sole traders, while not jeopardising their mainstream business client base. Heavy-handed In such circumstances, it might seem tempting to reduce mobile service prices by regulatory diktat - through a price cap formula on the lines of that used to control the charges on BT's fixed network. But such a temptation should be resisted, at least for the moment, because heavy-handed regulation would get in the way of a fully competitive market. There are two reasons for believing that in the long run a competitive market will develop naturally. First, the cost structure of the new PCNs is best suited to a mass market. One2one will therefore only be able to earn sufficient profits to justify its shareholders' investment by cutting prices to the level where they appeal to ordinary consumers. Second, the launch of a second PCN service, Microtel, scheduled for early next year, will provide a new spur. Waiting for competition to develop naturally will undoubtedly take several years. But rather than seeking to deliver the fruits to consumers earlier through price regulation, the government should first see if it can make a competitive market work even better. The best way of achieving this would be for ministers to announce that the market was open to any further companies which wished to enter. Even if none wished to take up the offer in the short run, the possibility of new entrants would keep established players on their toes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report in the "Economics" column: "The </F> Government and the Central Bank Have Taken a Hand in the Edicts.  Shokhin Does Not Care for Glazyev's Position"]    [Text] Yesterday two news conferences on economic policy  at the level of top government officials were held in Moscow.  First Viktor Gerashchenko met with journalists in the Central  Bank on the occasion of State Bank Day (old style). In the  White House [Vice Premier] Aleksandr Shokhin, in the company of  Deputy Finance Ministers Aleksashenko and Kazmin; Tax Service  chief Vladimir Gusev; and Mr. Gerashchenko, who arrived  hurriedly in his Zil limousine straight from the Central Bank,  at 1210 began to take questions from the newsmen.    In the White House, several subjects were discussed, the  most  urgent among which was the extent of the government's  involvement in drafting presidential edicts. Shokhin stated  that its participation has been more than substantial, stressing  that in the future the cabinet will be more actively promoting  its work because otherwise "others will do so." The edicts  themselves, according to Shokhin, were the result of a six-hour  meeting between the president and the premier. Commenting on  the edicts, Shokhin confirmed the need to spell out the foreign  policy edict with government resolutions. According to him, the  edict's interpretation is so far being drafted within the  framework of one document, but if it becomes impossible to  incorporate the commentaries in one, several resolutions will  then be issued on the subject. Viktor Gerashchenko, commenting  on the Central Bank's participation in drafting the edicts,  stated that it has been considerable, denying media reports  about his opposition. At the same time, according to him, at  the final stage of drafting the first package some deplorable  inconsistencies had slipped into the edicts. More specifically,  Viktor Gerashchenko said that permission to withdraw sums from  deposit accounts before term as a way to overcome the  nonpayments problem could seriously harm the banking system.    Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko, at journalists'  request, expressed the Finance Ministry's opinion on the  development of inflationary processes. According to him, the  decisions made will not lead to a growth in inflation before the  end of summer; it will stay at the May level of 7-9 percent, and  in December it could fall to 5 percent provided the current  anti-inflation policy continues and there are no serious  incidents. Unemployment growth, according to Finance Ministry  predictions, will continue to creep.    Shokhin also commented on the battle around the budget in  the  State Duma. He fully rejects the position of Sergey Glazyev,  who heads the Duma's Economic Policy Committee and proposes  respectively to add 30 trillion rubles in revenues and  expenditures into the budget. In his opinion, Glazyev's  position is counterproductive: The revenues he counts on are  hypothetical. And this means that should there be a shortage,  the government will have to sequester expenditures. Aleksandr  Shokhin has no doubt that as a result, this will affect not the  lobbyists -- who "will get what they want anyway" -- but the  social sphere and education. Shokhin relates more favorably to  the position by budget committee chairman Mikhail Zadornov who,  according to the vice premier, is ready to draw up a  "mini-budget" with possible additional revenues: Under the  project, the first three trillion of "surplus" money will go to  the military industrial complex; the next, to the social sphere,  and so forth.    Shokhin also spoke about the results of a government  delegation's visit to China where possibilities of interstate  long- term investment cooperation were considered. In  particular this included the construction of five thermal power  stations, talks about which have been going on for a long time;  a bid for the construction of a hydro-power station on the  Yangtze river, where Russia has good chances for success; and  also the problem of mutual payments. On the latter question the  Chinese side, according to the vice premier, has not as yet  granted Russian trading companies access to the national  currency, the yuan, but included a proposal in corresponding  protocols on recognizing trading firms' right to choose their  intermediaries. This should expedite the solution of the  problem of quality and mix of goods, even if supplied by a  limited number of trading agents. Shokhin believes that Russia  can use the experience of Chinese free economic zones in the  Maritime region and in the Baltics.    Both news conferences discussed lifting restrictions on  foreign bank activity in Russia. Speaking at the Central Bank,  Gerashchenko stated that "today work is under way on new `rules  of the game' for foreign banks in Russia. The Central Bank has  a deadline -- 8 June -- before which time a law has to be  drafted." Aleksandr Shokhin, speaking in the White House, said  that an agreement with the European Council could be signed on  13 June because the uranium issue has already been resolved.  According to him, restrictions on foreign banks are to be  gradually lifted (within three to five years). According to  Gerashchenko (speaking at the Central Bank), there is still a  limitation on foreign banks' aggregate share in Russia's banking  capital -- 12 percent. "The size of the limit itself, however  -- 10 percent or 15 percent -- is not of a matter of principle,"  the Central Bank chairman stated.</p>

BY THE very nature of the discipline chamber music tends not to draw attention to itself. This is never likely to become a world of punk haircuts, odd socks and football rattles, even if one could put together a quartet of Nigel Kennedys - an improbable proposition. Nevertheless, its horizons are broadening. Even in the wintry conditions that obtain in the depths of a recession there is no lack of opportunity for musicians to get their performances on record these days. The blossoming of record company contracts in the boom years has provided chances all round and even young chamber ensembles find they are being seized first by one company and then another. In the circumstances it cannot be easy for newcomers to carve a niche for themselves, which may explain why EMI's promotions department has been working overtime for its new chamber group, the Britten Quartet. The quartet is young, but not inexperienced on the recital platform. It has also made recordings previously for another company. But here its members are, posing like four Humphrey Bogarts in long raincoats with their collars up, while one of their discs comes with a cartoon on the cover. They say that they hope that will appeal to a younger audience. These first two of the group's EMI releases display a fine range of technical virtues, as anticipated, although each is on the careful side. The main work on the Schubert disc is 'Death and the Maiden', D810, (with cover design depicting skeletal Death leering over a Hollywood blonde.) The playing is well groomed all round, but needs more pace and tension if it is to force the demon within this music out into the open. The finale goes best, with real drive. On the second disc the performance of the Ravel Quartet is too docile to compare with the best. Something tauter is required for this intellectually sharp composer. The good idea is the coupling, which makes the link between the inimitably French Ravel and his pupil Vaughan Williams, represented by his G Minor String Quartet and the song-cycle On Wenlock Edge with pianist Howard Shelley. Philip Langridge, the guest tenor, brings drama as well as pastoral delicacy to his part. The sound which EMI has given the Brittens, while nicely intimate as befits the group, does not encourage vibrancy of colour. Even so, I prefer it to the close balance provided by Decca for the Takacs Quartet. This is an ensemble which we have had ample opportunity to hear in London and it is difficult to reconcile the wiry, strained sounds on show here with its usual tonal poise. The Dvorak disc, including the 'American' Quartet and the A Flat, Op. 105, is the better of the two, as it captures some of the affectionate lyrical warmth for which the Takacs is known live. The Brahms is an altogether more strenuous affair and it is wearing to have such tempestuous readings of the Op. 67 Quartet and the Piano Quintet, Op. 34 (with Andras Schiff joining in the rough and tumble) thrust so close to the microphones. One thinks back wistfully to the stylish contributions the group made to last year's Mozart festivities at the Barbican. Meanwhile, on the South Bank it was the Emerson String Quartet that was assigned the chamber music offering on the bicentenary day and by coincidence it has just completed the set of Mozart's six 'Haydn' quartets which it began recording a couple of years ago. This is a high quality ensemble and the standard of its Mozart at the Royal Festival Hall invited further investigation. Heard here in more intimate conditions at home, in close-up as it were, everything sounds just as impressively well detailed as it did then. The delivery of rhythms is as cleanly cut, the textures admit no minor blemish. But a degree of insistence has crept in, as though the players could not quite bring themselves to give up the aggressive instincts that have given them so brilliant and tenacious a hold on the 20th-century repertoire. In the end one wants them to relax more and let the music sing. And it is for that quality, among others, that I would turn to the final quartet in this survey. The Borodin String Quartet is now well advanced in its series of recordings for Virgin and has started on its new Shostakovich cycle with Quartets Nos 3, 7 and 8. What depth of understanding there is here. It may be that the physical shock of the music no longer hits home with this quartet as it did the first time, but in its place has matured a rare expressiveness. The players simply get more music out of the notes on the page than do most of their rivals and the reward per minute is golden, as it is no less on their other new disc, devoted to Schubert with a moving account of the A Minor 'Rosamunde' Quartet. By chance that is coupled with the early E Flat Major, D87, which is also on the Britten Quartet's Schubert disc mentioned earlier. But there are no surprises: it is the Borodins who make the music sparkle. By the way, seeing that cover of Death and the Hollywood blonde again, I have decided that it would actually put me off buying the disc. Either the marketing people are wrong or I am not as young as I used to be.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: REWRITING OREL'S HISTORY CAN BE CHILD'S PLAY  </P> <P> For your theoretical amusement, we now bring you: Children's Letters to Orel  Hershiser.  </P> <P> Dear Mr. Hershiser:  </P> <P> I am a Little Leaguer who hopes to become a big leaguer, just like you. Please  give me some tips. When I win 20 games some day, should I go ahead and accept  $7.9 million in salary, or should I insist upon proper contractual language in  case of a lockout?  </P> <P> James from Baldwin Park  </P> <P> Dear Mr. Hershiser:  </P> <P> My Dad and me are having an argument. I say that after winning the World Series  you said: "I'm going to Disneyland." He says that after winning the World  Series you said: "I'm going to buy Disneyland." Who's right?  </P> <P> Nathaniel from Hawthorne  </P> <P> Dear Orel:  </P> <P> My friends in school are giving me a hard time because I want to go into  professional baseball some day. They make fun of me because I hope to become an  arbitrator. They say arbitrators are jerks. What do you say?  </P> <P> Roberto from San Clemente  </P> <P> Dear O-Man:  </P> <P> I bet my best friend a buck that your paycheck has more zeroes than the line  score of the last Oakland game. How about it?  </P> <P> Vincent from Gardena  </P> <P> Dear Mr. Hershiser:  </P> <P> How come nobody ever talks about Orelmania? Or about you being Doctor O?  Fernando had mania. Gooden's called Doctor K. Are you being discriminated  against because you're a skinny white guy?  </P> <P> Charlie from Watts  </P> <P> Dear Hot Stuff:  </P> <P> I have seen your BVD ad. How come you don't pitch underwear the way Jim Palmer  does? I've seen rosin bags bigger than what he wears.  </P> <P> Jane from Tarzana  </P> <P> Dear Orel:  </P> <P> The kids in my class make fun of my name. I tell them the toughest guys in the  movies are named Arnold and Sylvester. But they never listen. When you were my  age, did you get beat up a lot?  </P> <P> Julius from Irvine  </P> <P> Dear Mr. Hershiser:  </P> <P> If I only break even two years in a row but then have one good year, can I  still get $2.63 million a year like you do?  </P> <P> Joanna from Carson  </P> <P> Hello Orel:  </P> <P> I want to go to summer camp, but my parents are broke. Please send money.  </P> <P> Allan from Sherman Oaks  </P> <P> Dear Mr. Hershiser:  </P> <P> I asked my Daddy if Orel Hershiser ever played T-ball. He said Orel Hershiser  is probably more interested in T-bills. I don't get it.  </P> <P> Clint from Westwood  </P> <P> Dearest Orel:  </P> <P> Would you happen to be busy Friday night? We could have coffee.  </P> <P> Margo from Costa Mesa  </P> <P> Hey, Dude:  </P> <P> You make all that money and don't even do any heavy lifting, except when you  hug the manager. Cool.  </P> <P> Howie from Long Beach  </P> <P> Dear Mr. Hershiser:  </P> <P> Mommy says you are the kind of grown-up who sets a good example. I heard how  much you are making and you sure are.  </P> <P> Sybil from Banning  </P> <P> Dear Mr. Hershiser:  </P> <P> If you autograph my baseball card, do I still have to pay you, like with that  rat fink Mickey Mantle?  </P> <P> Peaches from El Monte  </P> <P> Dear Money Bags:  </P> <P> Seven-point-nine million bucks! For workin' every fifth day! Come on! Get  serious! There are poor people in this land of ours, my friend! Two-and-a-half  mil a year for playin' ball 35 days outta 365! Gimme a break! I work five days  a week, pal! You gotta be kiddin' me! There's somethin' wrong with this  country!  </P> <P> Morton from Downey  </P></p>

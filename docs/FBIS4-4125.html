			<p>BFN     [Text] Guiyang, April 28 (XINHUA)--A massive survey into  the habitations of 12 minor ethnic groups in Southwest China's  Guizhou Province has been very fruitful, sources here said.    Yu Hongmo, a scholar of minor ethnic origin who has been  taking part in the survey, said the 12-year survey acquired a  huge amount of precious first-hand materials about the ethnic  peoples in the province and their natural surroundings, and  provided a further insight into their life, customs, economics  and culture.    The 12 ethnic peoples, namely Miao, Buyi, Yi, Tong, Tujia,  Yao and others, account for one-third of the province's  population. And most of them live in remote mountainous areas.    More than 300 scholars, mainly from the Guizhou Minority  Ethnics Institute, the provincial academy of social sciences,  the Guizhou Museum and other research bodies, participated in  the survey, the second of its kind since the 1950s.    Yu, who is director of the Guizhou Minority Ethnics  Institute, said most of the surveyors are of ethnic background.  Their knowledge of the languages and customs of the people  surveyed is critical to the success of the survey.    The survey shows that the province's ethnic areas hold more  than 8,000 kinds of plants and 300 kinds of animals of important  economic value.    Among them, 67 sorts of plants are rare and endangered  species under government protection, and 68 sorts of animals are  either near-extinct or special to the region.    The survey also found that the ethnic regions, though  underdeveloped, possess rich resources of coal, antimony,  phosphorus and mercury that are easy to exploit.    Based on their survey, scholars have set forth many  suggestions on developing local economies, tourism, ethnic  language education, and protection of ethnic cultural heritage  which have been widely adopted by the provincial and local  government, yu said.    Since 1983, scholars have published 11 treatises on their  survey findings and studies, which provide a precious reference  to ethnic researchers at home and abroad.    Yu disclosed that the survey would continue in the future,  as  the provincial government has agreed to provide further  financial support.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY  </P> <P> How the mayor's pet project eventually became 'Fido Fountain.'  </P> <P> Local government can be frustrating, and few practitioners of the municipal art  know that better than Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert.  </P> <P> Normally, Geissert spends hours at council meetings listening to angry  residents berating each other about hillside view obstructions, the roar of  airplanes or the "Taj Mahal" being built next to someone's basic three-bedroom,  three-bath tract home.  </P> <P> Among municipal issues, few are more volatile than those involving dogs, whose  masters take to howling at the slightest hint of further regulation of their  beloved pets.  </P> <P> But when Dorothy King wrote Torrance City Hall about a canine problem on the  beach, Geissert saw a chance to get something accomplished -- quickly, cheaply  and, most unusually, without raising anyone's hackles.  </P> <P> Torrance resident King and her dog take a daily four-mile stroll along the  beach. Afterward, they sit in Miramar Park, overlooking the ocean. The park has  a single water fountain.  </P> <P> "People . . . are letting their dogs drink out of this fountain," King  complained April 6. "The large dogs jump up as their masters turn on the water  for them. Very upsetting to me, and others, if they knew they were drinking  after dogs. I myself love my dog . . . but I do not eat or drink after my own  dog."  </P> <P> King suggested that the city put in a water fountain at the base of the  existing fountain. "Something must be done . . . to keep the city of Torrance  clean health-wise," she wrote.  </P> <P> Geissert agreed.  </P> <P> "That sounded reasonable to me," the mayor said. "There are not many  opportunities to serve people that don't cost much money. In rather short  order, they put in a ground-level basin."  </P> <P> And there, you might think, the tale would end.  </P> <P> Thirsty dogs watered, sensibilities preserved. Problem solved.  </P> <P> But back at the park, beach-goers just did not understand.  </P> <P> King wrote again. "Some people do not use their head. . . . Some people are  using the dog fountain to wash their feet, and the sand is stopping up the  drain.  </P> <P> "Dog lovers," she added, "are talking about it."  </P> <P> And that is how the city of Torrance came to erect a miniature headstone at its  canine watering spot, "Fido Fountain."  </P> <P> Geissert thinks it may be some sort of first.  </P> <P> "I don't know if there is another Fido Fountain around," she said.  </P> <P> On July 22, the ever-observant King again wrote: "I have seen many people stop,  read this sign, walk away with a smile on their face. . . . I am truly  grateful." George Stein  </P></p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Gilt market sees future in greater transparency The Stock Exchange will next week announce plans to improve the quality of information provided in the UK government bond market, in an attempt to increase the transparency of the gilt market. Since the reorganisation of the gilt market at the time of Big Bang in 1986, the question of transparency has barely been addressed. The current system is by no means perfect. Private client stockbrokers are damning about the lack of live price information, compared with what is available in equity markets. Gilt-edged market-makers, known as Gemms, are not obliged to quote their bid-offer prices on a screen for all to see, nor do they have to publish the price at which the last trade was conducted. By contrast, market-makers in equities publish their bid-offer spreads on Seaq International and the best prices available are shown on the so-called 'yellow strip' (the space at the top of the page devoted to a particular stock). They also publish the last trade. Stockbrokers complain that information available in the gilt market is inadequate, particularly for retail investors. The dealers or Gemms themselves have access to inter-dealer broker screens, where they can see the price quoted by other dealers, who remain anonymous. Market-makers prefer anonymity to having their names beside the quotes: they dislike the idea of competitors being able to see what prices they are quoting as it can lead to manipulation in the market. Some participants believe that complete pre-trade transparency would lead to a widening of the bid-offer spread. Stockbrokers, however, do not have access to the inter-dealer broker service. There are certain 'closed-user groups'. For example, on the Stock Exchange's Topic screen, Greenwell Montagu, SG Warburg, UBS and Goldman Sachs have closed-user pages, showing their particular prices, although in certain cases users complain that the prices are not updated very frequently, which can pose a problem when the market is volatile. In addition, the Stock Exchange Topic screen shows the 'mid-price' (the price halfway between bid and offer prices) of gilts. The service is compiled from a representative sample of Gemms and is updated at least every hour and sometimes more often. The Bank of England and the Stock Exchange set up a Retail Gilts Working Party at the end of 1992 to look at dealing and settlement in the gilt market. The results are due to be announced next week and the Stock Exchange said it will make recommendations on improving the quality of its mid-price service. Some experts think it needs updating more regularly and would like to see greater post-trade transparency - at least for retail trades - with the publication on screen of the last deal. In that way, the mid-price service would give a sense of what market-makers are quoting and the 'last-deal' service would give a sense of what had actually been done. However, some stockbrokers would prefer to see even greater transparency, with Gemms forced to quote their bid-offer spreads on one single screen for all to see.</p>

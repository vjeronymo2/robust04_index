			<p>BFN     [Text] In what some may regard as a positive sign, the  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] organization has welcomed  the return of the PLO deportees to the territories. Dr. Mahmud  al-Zahhar, one of the leaders of the Islamic Movement in the  Gaza Strip, told IDF Radio this morning that although he does  not believe in the political process, those promoting it should  be given a fair chance. Our Arab affairs correspondent Netan'el  Semrik reports:    [Begin recording] [Semrik] Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of the  political leaders of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, has many memories  of the time he spent at the deportees' camp at Mazra'at Bayt  Nawfal in southern Lebanon. This morning, we called him at his  villa in the Gaza Strip and asked for his reaction to the fact  that the list of returning deportees does not include any  members of organizations that have rejected the political  process.    [Al-Zahhar, in English] Firstly, I would like to address the  fact that I was one of the people who were deported since one  year. I feel very happy on return, so I am appreciating and I  think everybody here appreciating the return of the  ex-deportees. We are happy for any Palestinian to come to his  homeland.    [Semrik translates above into Hebrew and continues] Taking a  very moderate tone, Mahmud al-Zahhar explained why Hamas is  ready to give peace what he called a very big chance.    [Al-Zahhar, in English] We are going to give a very big  chance for peace, but our assessment was and is still that this  is not the proper way to achieve our basic demand. We will not  participate in autonomy, but we will not put any hindrance for  the implementation of autonomy. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] With the latest interim results of talks between  Czech and Slovak Presidents Vaclav Havel and Michal Kovac in  Bratislava, here is Eva Hulkova.    [Begin recording] According to Czech presidential spokesman  Ladislav Spacek, President Havel stressed that the foreign  policy orientation of both countries is very similar, and in  some respects identical.    Unresolved issues between the two countries have, in the  eyes  of both sides, ceased to be political and have become the  subject of negotiations between experts. Of 12 agreements  expected to be signed, eight have been signed already.  President Kovac expressed the hope that the process of  concluding the agreements might be completed by the end of the  year. The Czech Republic praised the fact that the Slovak  Republic had agreed to a standard form of border controls, and  the formal signing of a treaty to that effect is equally in  sight.    The presidents stated that the fall in trade between the two  countries constituted a certain weakening of mutual relations.  According to President Kovac, administrative standardization in  both countries and the process of transformation, whereby the  state has fewer possibilities of intervention, are throwing up  barriers in the culture and education spheres. The decline in  cultural and educational exchange activity could be compensated  for by nongovernment-sponsored arrangements. President Havel  proposed in this context the setting up of an Institute of  Czecho-Slovak Studies. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the  latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the  border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.    The latest reports from the NKR have confirmed that no  incident has occurred in the confrontation areas. The sides  have been trying not to allow any incident which may create a  new tension in the region. In general, the cease-fire agreement  is being heeded. The situation in the front line areas is  peaceful, that is, not taking into account the shooting by  Azerbaijan's military units from time to time. In view of that,  we hope that the peaceful situation will not be temporary and  that a result will be achieved through the talks that are held  at various levels to convince the two sides to end the  confrontation.    Regrettably, a stable situation has not been established on  the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The reason for that  state of affairs is the frequent shooting from Azerbaijan in the  direction of various settlements in Armenia. Azerbaijan's  military units have fired mainly on Armenia's Idzhevanskiy,  Tavushskiy, Noyemberyanskiy, and Araratskiy Rayons. Other areas  also have been fired on. It must be stressed for the sake of  justice that the Armenian side has refrained from returning the  fire in several cases.    The Armenian Ministry of Defense Information Service has  disclosed that Azerbaijan's military units fired on several  border towns in Noyemberyanskiy Rayon with various types of arms  last night. The Armenian side did not return the fire.</p>

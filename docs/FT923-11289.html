			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / The Long View: Autumn tea-leaves A SMALL island economy off the northwest coast of Europe is trying once again to stabilise its currency. Few but the natives are very interested. The big picture, meanwhile, is that the two global economic giants, the US and Japan, are grappling with debt difficulties which will take years to solve. By and large Europe does not have a debt problem (although Germany seems intent on creating one). All the while, the growth focus of the global economy is shifting to Asia and the world will look a very different place in 20 or 30 years. When Wall Street crashed in 1987, there was an obvious parallel with 1929. In fact, this turned out to be seriously misleading. What has happened in the US in the past five years has not been at all like what took place at the beginning of the 1930s. Sticking with the stock market as an indicator, the Dow Jones Average has actually headed upwards to new highs, albeit rather erratically and unconvincingly. In stark contrast, between the September 1929 high and the eventual low nearly three years later the Dow lost 89 per cent. You can argue that it is what has been happening in Tokyo that is more directly comparable with events in the US some 60 years ago. During the 1920s the US had been the brash, fast-growing star of the world economy, marked by soaring asset values and financial excesses. A classic stock market bubble was created. In important respects Japan fulfilled the same role during the 1980s. Perhaps the Tokyo stock market has collapsed in slightly a more orderly way than Wall Street did all those years ago, but the Nikkei Average has nevertheless managed to lose 60 per cent of its value in 2 1/2 years and this week it hit another new low. The theory of long economic cycles is sketchy to say the least, but there is some basis for arguing that human attitudes are affected by whether unhappy memories are fresh in the mind or only found in dusty history books. In some circumstances debt spells disaster - as many recent homebuyers in the UK can testify - but at other times optimism dominates and a wave of confidence can lead to the build-up of excessive risk. Corporate and personal debt is a familiar part of the problem. The newer factor in this second 20th century supercycle has been the willingness of governments to accumulate huge debts, reflecting attempts to stimulate economic growth and also to meet social spending obligations. That is the American problem, and suddenly it is becoming a British problem too, as the ministers at Wednesday's cabinet meeting were made uncomfortably aware. In the end governments become hemmed in. Last year the British government took the decision to raise 1992-93 public sector borrowing from Pounds 14bn to what now seems likely to be well over Pounds 30bn. But judging by the reactions of the building societies, there is little more room for the government to go further into deficit. Meanwhile the exchange rate is supposedly untouchable, taxes cannot be raised, and the election manifesto was full of expensive public spending pledges. Something will have to give. Similarly, in the US a reckoning awaits after the presidential election. Borrowing cannot go on at the current level. It is because forced changes are on the way that there is a growing sense of crisis in the financial markets. Things are brewing up nicely for September and October, when these problems traditionally come to crisis point. There was absolutely no alternative but that the UK should stay on the gold standard in 1931. To devalue by a quarter, as eventually happened in September that year, would be, they said, disastrously inflationary and would forfeit Britain's economic and political leadership. But the Bank of England ran out of gold. Indeed the UK had to eat humble pie and move down the economic pecking order, but the inflation turned out not to be a problem. As we find ourselves once again perhaps 25 per cent overvalued against the dollar, the potential inflation problem looks much more serious: imports these days satisfy a third of domestic demand, and most would rise in price in terms of sterling by the full amount of the devaluation almost immediately. The flicker of life in the dollar price of gold during the past few weeks is a reminder that potential currency depreciation is not just a British problem. Only the Bundesbank appears to be determined to fight seriously against currency debasement. The battle has only just begun, but already many fainthearts in Britain have started to throw in the towel. In the US in the early 1930s a bloated banking system was allowed to collapse. Today banks in the US, Japan, the UK and elsewhere similarly should shrink drastically, but it seems unlikely that the politicians would tolerate the consequences. The British government, for instance, appears to walk in awe of the building societies. The question therefore is whether the inflationary solution is more likely to be adopted this time than the deflationary one: it certainly looks that way in the US. The upwave of a long cycle is reached when the debt burden has been reduced to acceptable levels and people recover confidence to spend and invest. After an unpleasant period of adjustment, people will once again sell their labour at a price at which they can be profitably employed. However, the vigour of the recovery depends on how human and natural resources, together with technological innovation, can be harnessed within an encouraging political framework. The US led the way early in the century, then Japan took over. In future the biggest opportunities will be elsewhere, perhaps in China. The recovery could be surprisingly strong when it comes. The London stock market doubled between 1932 and 1936. But there are hard decisions to be taken, whether or not devaluation is chosen. The problems of a small country can be fascinating if you live there.</p>

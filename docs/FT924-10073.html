			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Prudential Corporation The market was expecting too much from Prudential's new method of accounting for life insurance business. Admittedly, the new accruals method of recognising profits results in a higher earnings figure. If investors are less flummoxed by the way profits are generated from the life side, the Pru's rating could also benefit. By recognising profits earlier in the term of life policies, though, the Pru neither increases nor diminishes the hard cash it has available to support the dividend. Under the accruals method new business sales will be reflected in the profit and loss account. True, this means the earnings figure will be more volatile  -boosted by sales of Pounds 1bn from single-premium bonds this year, for example. If better disclosure helps the market predict the dividend trend, so much the better. A further question is whether the new method will become an industry standard. Non-financial groups such as BAT Industries will doubtless be grateful for the opportunity to consolidate higher profits. Yet Legal &amp; General has already pinned its colours to a different mast. The rest are likely to remain sceptical until the impact on Prudential's share price is clearer. There is a danger the market will be confronted with a proliferation of accounting methods. Even if the in-dustry follows the Pru, the sums turn crucially on management assumptions about investment returns, policy surrenders and so on. This fact alone is reason enough to be sceptical.</p>

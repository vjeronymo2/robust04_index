			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Britain withdraws Kenya forest aid Britain's Overseas Development Agency has withdrawn a Pounds 12m grant for a forestry conservation programme in Kenya because of concerns over unregulated land use in protected forest reserves. This is the first aid-funded project to be cancelled since the international donor community restored financial assistance to Kenya last November. Balance-of-payments aid had been frozen for two years over allegations of corruption and economic mismanagement, problems which have not been fully addressed. The British High Commission yesterday said it had been 'unable to agree on mutually acceptable conditions for further support for the Kenya Indigenous Forest Conservation project'. The ODA is believed to have pressed the Kenyan government to end the illegal allocation of protected forest areas to members of the ruling Kanu party and their acolytes. It also demanded an end to unregulated logging concessions, which are destroying Kenya's tropical hardwood forests. It is believed the vation project was cancelled when the government failed to provide these assurances. Government officials were unavailable for comment. Land has always been a political issue in Kenya because of the scarcity of arable land for a rapidly growing population. It is a main cause of ethnic violence in Kenya. Dr Richard Leakey's resignation as director of the Kenya Wildlife Service last month was also triggered by the political hunger for land. He contended that his refusal to grant mining or commercial concessions within Kenya's nature reserves provoked a vendetta against him.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Comparison of articles of the current Constitution and the </F> proposed amendment of those articles]    [Text] Article 136. Constitution.    An autonomous tribunal is hereby established to guarantee  the  popular election's freedom, purity, and effectiveness. The  tribunal's legal status, patrimony, and the right to manage it  are hereby recognized. The tribunal shall exclusively interpret  and apply the Electoral Law. It shall direct and supervise the  registration of vital statistics, such as decease,  naturalization, and other juridical acts related to the civil  status of people, the issuance of personal identification cards,  and the electoral process' various stages. (The rest of the  article remains unchanged, except the name: Supreme Electoral  Tribunal).  <H5>  Proposed Amendments </H5>   A Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], with its own rank and  independent from the states branches, is hereby established to  guarantee the popular election's freedom, purity, and  effectiveness. The TSE shall have jurisdiction throughout the  country. It shall be made up of three magistrates, who must  meet the same requirements demanded of a Supreme Court of  Justice [CSJ] magistrate. The three TSE magistrates shall be  appointed for a 10-year term. One of them shall be proposed by  the Legislative Branch, one by the Executive, and one by the  CSJ. The candidates shall not be members of the proposing  branch. Two alternates shall be similarly proposed for each of  the principals. The alternates cannot be chosen from among the  TSE officials. The TSE magistrates shall answer to the CSJ for  offenses or crimes committed during the exercise of their  functions. Articles 202, 205, 208, 209, and 213 apply, with the  penalties stipulated by law.  <H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>   1. The name Electoral Tribunal has been substituted for  that of Supreme Electoral Tribunal, like in Costa Rica,  Guatemala, Ecuador, and El Salvador.    2. The TSE is given the status of a government branch  without it becoming one, like in Costa Rica.    3. The TSE's administrative and financial autonomy is  established. It is exempted from preliminary control, to make  sure that it will not be co-managed from the public finance's  viewpoint.  <H5>  Article 137. Constitution. </H5>   The Electoral Tribunal shall have the following functions:    ....    3. To establish the Electoral Law bylaws, interpret and  apply the law, and hear any controversies originating from its  application.    4. To punish offenses and crimes committed against the  freedom and purity of the elections, according to the law.    7. To process immigration and naturalization requests.    (Paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 remain unchanged. Paragraphs 3  and 6 are modified. One paragraph is eliminated. Paragraphs 8  and 9 are introduced.)  <H5>  Proposed Amendments </H5>   In addition to those outlined by law, the TSE shall have the  following functions, which it will exercise exclusively, except  those stipulated in Paragraphs 4 and 6.    1. To register births, marriages, deaths, naturalizations,  and any other events and juridical acts related to the civil  status of people, and to make the corresponding annotations in  the corresponding registers.    2. To issue personal identification cards.    3. To interpret the constitutional and legal directives on  elections, to establish Electoral Law bylaws, and to hear any  controversies originating from the application of the law.    4. To conduct an electoral census.    5. To organize, to direct, and to supervise the  registration of voters, and to settle any controversies,  complaints, or allegations related to voter registration.    6. To process naturalization requests, according to the  law.    7. To appoint members of electoral corporations, in which  the representation of legally created parties shall be  guaranteed. The law will regulate this matter.    8. To assume control of the Public Forces from the opening  of the electoral process and until the new president of the  Republic is proclaimed, with the exclusive purpose of  guaranteeing the freedom, purity, and effectiveness of the  popular elections. The Executive will continue to control the  Public Forces for everything related to national defense and the  protection of the lives, honor, and property of the nationals  and aliens under its jurisdiction. The fulfillment of these  responsibilities shall not serve as an excuse for interfering  with the political and party neutrality the Public Forces must  maintain during the electoral process.    9. To appoint ad honorem Electoral Delegates according to  the law. The TSE's decisions regarding elections only can be  appealed before itself and the appeal will be final,  irrevocable, and binding once the legal procedures have been  complied with. Amparo recourses or inconstitutionality  warnings, with the exception of unconstituionality recourse,  shall not apply.  <H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>   1. As in Costa Rica, the TSE is given the authority to  interpret electoral regulations both from the Constitutional and  legal viewpoints.    2. Its authority to handle electoral offenses has been  removed.    3. Its authority to handle immigration, which had never  been regulated, has been removed. The tribunal retains its  authority to handle naturalizations according to the law. (At  present, those requesting naturalization are tested on history,  geography, and politics).    4. A legal provision is made for the transfer of authority  over the Public Forces to the tribunal and the time for the  tribunal to assume control of the Public Forces is extended from  the current six days before the elections to six months. As the  Electoral Tribunal did in a decree, the proposed amendment  clarifies that this control of the Public Forces extends up to  the time when the new President of the Repubic is proclaimed.    5. As in Costa Rica, the Electoral Delegates at the  Constitutional level are recognized.    6. Recourses cannot be filed against the Electoral  Tribunal's decisions on electoral matters only and that no  amparos (as established by law) or unconstitutionality warnings  (as established by the Tribunal's decision and confirmed by the  CSJ) shall apply. Unconstitutionality recourses can be applied,  however.  <H5>  Constitution in Effect </H5>   Art. 138. The Office of the Electoral Prosecutor is an  independent investigation agency assisting the Electoral  Tribunal.    The Electoral Prosecutor will be appointed by the Execuve  Branch subject to the approval of the Legislative Branch...    The Electoral Prosecutor's responsibilities are:    1. To safeguard the political privileges of all citizens.    2. To watch over the official conduct of all public  officials relating to electoral priviliges and political  obligations.    3. To prosecute electoral crimes and violations.    4. To exercise all other duties the law may indicate.  <H5>  Reform Proposal </H5>   Investigations and trials related to electoral crimes will  fall under the competence of ordinary jurisdiction.    Transitory paragraph: The Office of the Electoral Prosecutor  will become an Electoral Delegate Attorney's Office assigned to  the Office of the Attorney General and specializing in electoral  offenses. Those election violations still pending to be  processed at the Electoral Tribunal will be forwarded to the  appropiate penal courts in accordance with the respective  competence, except those cases where appeals are still pending.  Cases where the Electoral Tribunal has already ruled will be  appealable before the Supreme Court of Justice Penal Court.  <H5>  Explanations by the Magistrates </H5>   In eliminating the Electoral Tribunal's competence with  respect to penal electoral issues, penal electoral jurisdiction  is eliminated as a separate jurisdiction to incorporate it into  ordinary jurisdiction. For this to take place, the Office of  the Electoral Prosecutor must be abolished as an independent  institution so that it may be incorporated into the Office of  the Attorney General.    This measure not only solves the fact that the Panamanian  Electoral Tribunal is the only one if its kind throughout the  world that decides on electoral offenses, but it also  automatically grants the accused the right to file an appeal  before a higher jurisdiction. Currently, individuals accused of  electoral offenses are not entitled to this measure since  decisions by the Electoral Tribunal are unappealable. Likewise,  the destiny of the different cases currently being processed are  to be determined on a provisional basis.  <H5>  Constitution in Effect </H5>   Art. 139. Public authorities are obligated to follow and  obey guidelines and decisions of officials with electoral  jurisdiction. Public authorities are also obligated to comply  with, cooperate with, and assist officials with electoral  jurisdiction carry out their obligations. Disregard and  negligence on the part of public authorities in performing their  respective duties will be punishable in accordance with the law.    (The proposed incidental clauses are to be added to this  article)  <H5>  Reform Proposed </H5>   The following incidental clauses are to be added to Article  139:    The Supreme Elections Tribunal will formulate its budget  proposal and will forward it to the Executive Branch. The  Supreme Electoral Tribunal magistrates will be allowed to  justify the respective proposed budget project in all its  phases. The Supreme electoral Tribunal budget will not be less  than seven tenths of one percent of the Central Government's  current revenues. During elections and referendum years, and  those years prior, the additional budget requested and justified  by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal will have precedence within  the public sector's budget. Nevertheless, when the quantity  resulting from the application of said percentage is greater  than the amount required to cover basic needs proposed by the  Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the Executive Branch will be allowed  to include the surplus as part of other expenditures or  investments in the public sector budget proposal.  <H5>  Explanation by the Magistrates </H5>   The amendments assure the Electoral Tribunal will have a  minimum of resources for its regular functions, as one must keep  in mind that it in is charge of the civil registry and the  issuance of cedulas. During an election or referenda period  priority is granted to the budget required to hold the  elections. It is the same text of the amendments approved in  1992.  <H5>  Article 141 </H5>   (It explains in detail how the current electoral circuits  are  established in line with the political administrative division  and the number of inhabitants. It establishes one legislator  for those parties that retain their legal status but no  candidate to legislator from that party was elected. It  establishes that only political parties can nominate candidates  for legislators.)  <H5>  Amendment bill </H5>   The Legislative Assembly will comprise 20 national  legislators and 41 legislators elected in circuits where  individual [uninominal] candidates run through the regulations  approved to that effect by the Supreme Elections, taking into  consideration the population, territorial proximity,  concentration of Indian population, neighborhood ties, roads,  and historic and cultural factors. No province nor the San Blas  Reservation will have less than one legislator. Every time a  national population census is held, the Supreme Elections  Tribunal will review and update the creation of electoral  circuits to maintain the proportion of the population among them.    The seats of national legislators will be assigned to the  parties that have garnered the votes needed to retain their  legal status based on the proportion of the votes the parties  obtain in the presidential elections, following the order of the  candidates in each list. The candidate with the most votes will  be elected in circuits where individual candidates are running.  Each legislator will have a personal alternate who will be  elected when the legislator is elected. The legislator will  replace his alternate if case of wrongdoing.  <H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>   1. The composition of the current Legislative Assembly,  which is based upon uninominal and plurinominal electoral  districts that lack a fixed number of legislators because their  number increases every 10 years according to population growth,  will be changed to an Assembly that has a fixed number of  legislators, thereby incorporating the concept of national  legislators and legislators from uninominal districts only.  Plurinominal electoral districts are thus eliminated, because  these districts have traditionally sparked tension and vote  challenges in every elections due to the complexity of the  proportional representation system. In addition, uninominal  electoral districts endorse the principle of governability that  has successfully prevailed in the United Kingdom and France.    2. The known concept of the "Lone Ranger" legislator is  also eliminated. This concept, which increases the number of  legislators, is being used for the first time in 1994 in the  case of the National Renewal Movement (Morena).    3. The election of two alternates is eliminated. Only  one personal alternate will be elected in the same manner  legislators are elected.  <H5>  Constitution </H5>   Article 144. Legislators shall act on behalf of the Nation,  and at the Legislative Assembly, they represent their respective  political parties and voters from their Electoral Districts.  <H5>  Amendment </H5>   Once elected, legislators shall represent the Nation and  shall observe only the dictates of their consciences.  <H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>   As the concept of impeachment is eliminated, it is necessary  to modify this article to reinstate the principle of the 1946  Constitution.  <H5>  Constitution </H5>   Article 145. Political parties shall be able to impeach the  legislators and alternates they nominate... (requirements and  procedures are stipulated).  <H5>  Amendment </H5>   This article is abolished.  <H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>   The controversial guideline that grants political parties  the  right to impeach a legislator elected by the population is  eliminated. We reinstate the principle of the 1946  Constitution, which stipulates that legislators represent the  Nation and are not subjected to any mandate.  <H5>  Constitution </H5>   Article 147. The following is required to be a legislator:    ... 4. Not have been previously tried for having committed a  crime against public administration and sentenced to lose his  freedom. The Electoral Tribunal could not have tried him for  having committed a crime against the honesty and integrity of  the suffrage.  <H5>  Amendment </H5>   The following is required to be a legislator:    1. Be Panamanian by birth or by naturalization, with 15  years of residency in the country after having obtained the  citizenship.    2. Be an acting citizen.    3. Be 21 years old at election time.    4. Not have been tried for committing a crime against the  public administration or for committing an electoral crime  whereby freedom was lost.  <H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>   The residency requirement for legislators, which has  triggered so much controversy, is eliminated. It has been  stipulated that with honest and fair elections, a candidate's  financial situation is not the requirement that will let him be  nominated by an electoral district where he does not live and be  elected beyond people's will. As the electoral and penal  jurisdiction is eliminated, it conforms with the wording of  point 4 of Article 147.  <H5>  Constitution </H5>   Article 159. The following shall be able to propose laws:    ... 3. The Supreme Court of Justice, the Attorney General,  and the Solicitor General as long as it alludes the issuance of  or amendments to national codes.  <H5>  Amendment </H5>   The following shall be able to propose laws:    ... 3. The Supreme Court of Justice, the Attorney General,  and the Solicitor General as long as it alludes the issuance of  or amendments to national codes, as well as the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal [Tribunal Superior de Elecciones] as long as  it alludes to issues concerning elections, civil registry, and  issuance of personal identification cards.  <H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>   The Electoral Tribunal has the initiative on matters that  must come under its jurisdiction, but currently do not.</p>

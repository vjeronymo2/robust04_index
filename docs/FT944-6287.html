			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): City welcomes bond market liberalisation - Gilts repo plans The Bank of England and Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday cheered UK government bond markets by unveiling plans to further liberalise the trading of gilt-edged securities. The announcement of the intention to establish an open market for gilt sale and repurchase agreements - known as 'repos' - was warmly welcomed though widely expected. Changing the rules will mean that any institution will be able to borrow or lend gilt edged stock. The requirement for such transactions to take place through one of the City of London's eight money brokers will also be scrapped. 'It is exactly what the market wanted to see. Long-term, I think it will be beneficial for the gilt market,' said Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International. While the authorities yesterday stated their intention to set up a repo market, the details have yet to be hammered out. The Bank published a discussion paper yesterday, proposing that repo transactions can be carried out by any financial institution and not just gilt-edged market makers (Gemms), as at present. The requirement that stock can only be lent or borrowed through stock exchange money brokers will also be scrapped. The Bank is seeking comments on the paper from market participants by January 31, 1995. Final decisions will be taken after the completion of the consultation process, the Bank said, adding that gilt repo activity could not begin before July 1995. A repo is, in essence, a loan agreement between two parties in which bonds act as collateral. The institution which owns the bonds sells them to the counterparty and in return receives cash. At a set date in the future, the original bond owner agrees to buy back the bonds for a set sum. The buy-back sum will be higher than the original cash amount, the difference reflecting the rate of interest on the loan. In theory, both parties can gain from this transaction. The original bond owner raises money at a cheaper rate than by borrowing without using collateral. Meanwhile, the lender may receive interest at a better rate than by just depositing the cash with a bank, and has the comfort of the bonds as security. Government bond markets in other countries, including the US, France and Germany, already have well-developed repo facilities. Although London has long been the European centre of non-dollar repo business, the sterling sector has lagged behind its international competitors. The Bank of England said it 'believes that these steps should enhance the liquidity and efficiency of the gilt market, increase demand for gilts, and thereby reduce the overall interest cost over time to the government and the taxpayer'. The proposed changes would do so, it said, by giving investors in gilts ready access to the sterling money market, using gilts as collateral; by enabling all of the market to borrow stock to cover short positions; by widening arbitrage opportunities; by ensuring international investors could use the repo mechanism with which they are familiar; by encouraging greater participation in the gilt market; by extending the range of instruments traded in the sterling money markets; by promoting greater integration of the money and gilt markets; and by enhancing the position of London as a financial centre. The chancellor said that an open repo facility 'should improve both liquidity and efficiency, reducing yields and hence the government's debt interest costs'. He added that 'each reduction in yields of just one basis point will eventually save more than Pounds 25m a year of public expenditure.' The UK currently has had two types of gilt repurchase agreements, only one of which is being reformed. The type which is being left alone consists of the Bank of England's fortnightly money market repos, under which the Bank lends two- and four-week funds to the market against the security of gilts.</p>

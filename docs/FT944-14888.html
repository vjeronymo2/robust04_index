			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Turnround at US cellular phone operator Lin Broadcasting, the US cellular telephone company, yesterday reported a 13 per cent increase in third-quarter operating income to Dollars 109.1m on net revenues of Dollars 238.3m, which were 22 per cent higher than a year ago. The improvement in operating income helped Lin report consolidated net income for the quarter of Dollars 37.9m, compared with a loss in the corresponding period of 1993 of Dollars 26.5m. Lin is 52 per cent-owned by McCaw Cellular, the industry leader acquired earlier this year by the long-distance telecommunications group AT&amp;T. The turnround in profitability at Lin was partly accredited to continued growth in its core cellular business - subscribers were up 200,000 at 974,000 from a year earlier. Revenues from Lin's television station business, which the company plans to spin off to shareholders later this year, rose 7 per cent during the quarter to Dollars 42.3m.</p>

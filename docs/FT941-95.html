			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ashley in Pounds 20m Spanish write-off Ashley Group, the window blinds and timber company, is to write off the entire Pounds 20m deferred payment from the sale of its Spanish food subsidiary. This would result in substantial losses for 1993, the company said yesterday. Ashley also admitted that it had breached certain banking covenants on its Pounds 18.5m of net debt, but said its principal bankers had 'been supportive of the steps taken to date.' The announcement follows a business review undertaken after significant board changes in January, including the appointment of Mr Hamish Grossart as chairman in place of Mr James White. Digsa, the Spanish retailer, has been the root of Ashley's problems. It was sold last April, but the directors have decided it 'would not be prudent to assume at this stage that any value attaches to the deferred consideration' of Pounds 20m. A further Pounds 1.07m will be written off related to discontinued activities. Ashley will announce full results in May, but it indicated that it had achieved operating profits of Pounds 3.1m before interest, and had maintained positive operating cash flow. Mr Grossart said that given the provisions, and its level of debt, some equity financing would be necessary once it had fully clarified its financial standing. Meanwhile, preference dividend payments, due on March 31, will be defer-red. The shares fell 3/4 p to 7 3/4p.</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Higher prices help Phillips advance to Dollars 99m PHILLIPS Petroleum, the Oklahoma-based energy and chemicals group, yesterday posted a third-quarter profits advance, lifting net income to Dollars 99m, or 38 cents a share, from Dollars 56m, or 21 cents. Revenues edged ahead to Dollars 3.13bn from Dollars 3.11bn last time. Mr C. J. Silas, chairman and chief executive, said exploration and production earnings were helped by higher prices, particularly for domestic natural gas and natural gas liquids. Earnings from downstream operations were hurt by higher feedstock costs and plant turnrounds. The results, however, were distorted by extraordinary items. In the 1992 quarter, Phillips recorded one-time gains of Dollars 6m from an asset sale and Dollars 789m from revised estimates of tax obligations. These were partly-offset by one-time charges of Dollars 19m from gas imbalance positions and Dollars 12m related to an oil pricing dispute. Excluding these items, Phillips earned Dollars 51m in the quarter, against adjusted earnings of Dollars 13m. For the first nine months, net income stood at Dollars 89m, or 34 cents, against Dollars 179m, or 68 cents. Revenues rose to Dollars 8.98bn from Dollars 8.89bn. Stripping-out one-time items, Phillips earned Dollars 122m at nine months, against Dollars 234m. Third quarter results from Unocal, the California-based energy group, were also muddied by one-time items which brought net income to Dollars 11m, or 1 cent, after dividends on preferred stock, compared with earnings of Dollars 9m, or 4 cents, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Unocal earned Dollars 65m, or 24 cents, in the latest quarter, against Dollars 23m, or 10 cents. Revenues were Dollars 2.51bn against Dollars 2.68bn. For the first nine months, it earned Dollars 117m, or 46 cents, on revenues of Dollars 7.6bn, compared with Dollars 89m, or 38 cents, on revenues of Dollars 8.13bn. Eliminating one-time items, nine-month earnings were Dollars 143m, or 57 cents, against Dollars 96m, or 41 cents, last year.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures down THERE WAS slightly duller sentiment about a near-term cut in UK base rates yesterday after the governor of the Bank of England said he would like to see a stronger sterling exchange rate, writes James Blitz. In previous days, tensions between the UK government and Britain's building societies had raised speculation that the government might come under pressure to reduce base rates. However, Mr Robin Leigh- Pemberton's comments at a meeting of British MPs yesterday reinforced the view that the authorities were disinclined to cut rates again, on the basis that a modest recovery might already have started. The governor's comment that Britain should pursue a policy of stable interest rates triggered a small sell-off in short-dated futures. The June contract fell 8 basis points from its previous close of 94.28, while the September contract declined 5 basis points to 94.40. The sterling cash market was a good deal quieter. Three-month money finished little changed at 5 15/16 per cent, and the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 650m, which was easily removed. In Germany, Euromark futures fell back after the lowest accepted rate in the Bundesbank's repo was cut by 8 basis points to 8.17 per cent. Some dealers had been expecting the repo to be cut to 8.10 per cent. The June Euromark contract ended 8 basis points down at 92.83, while the March contract slipped 6 basis points to close at 93.68. In the cash market, call money fell very sharply in a market that was over-provided with liquidity at the month-end. Banks' reserves at the month-end were so far above the Bundesbank's new requirements that call money was quoted in a range of 1 per cent to 7.5 per cent. Several money market dealers said they did not expect any change in the Bundesbank's officially posted interest rates at today's meeting of its policy-making council. It is only two weeks since the Bundesbank reduced its discount rate by 50 basis points to 7.50 per cent. However, there were strong expectations that the Bank of France would lower its intervention rate today in the wake of the franc's stronger than expected performance since the new French government was nominated.</p>

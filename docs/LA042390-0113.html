			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LI PENG IN MOSCOW TO RELIEVE TENSIONS  </P> <P> Chinese Premier Li Peng arrived today for the first visit in 26 years by a  Chinese head of government to the Soviet Union, China's longtime rival for  leadership of the Communist world.  </P> <P> The four-day trip is to promote normal relations and ease border tensions at a  time when both countries are confronted with serious domestic problems.  </P> <P> The 61-year-old premier was expected to hold at least two rounds of talks with  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who last May went to China in the first visit  by a Soviet leader in three decades.  </P> <P> "Li's visit to the U.S.S.R. underscores the importance of continuing the  Sino-Soviet dialogue at the summit level, which began a year ago and signaled  the normalization of relations," Tass press agency said.  </P> <P> Li was met at the airport by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze.  </P> <P> "I will be exchanging views with President Gorbachev, Chairman Ryzhkov and  other comrades from the Soviet leadership on matters concerning bilateral  relations and on major international issues of common concern," Li said at the  airport.  </P> <P> Tass said Ryzhkov and Peng began meeting today but did not report what they  were discussing.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's historic visit to China was overshadowed by student-led  pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing, which ended weeks later when Li and  other Chinese leaders sent in troops to crush the movement.  </P> <P> In Moscow, Gorbachev is contending with the crisis in Lithuania, which declared  independence March 11.  </P> <P> The official Chinese press, before Li's departure, said his trip would have  "profound significance" on peace in Asia and the world.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>   [Text] His majesty the king denounced the assassination of  a Jordanian diplomat in Beirut, and said that treacherous crimes  committed against us would only increase our determination to  continue in our path as one family. In a message to His Royal  Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the regent, the king said that  Jordanians are the soldiers of the nation who are not afraid of  death to defend its rights and to secure life and peace. His  majesty said the rats and the bats of the night, whether  ordering or executing the murder, will be disgraced till  doomsday.    The body of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, who was  assassinated in Lebanon this morning, was brought back home  tonight. His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the regent,  accompanied by the prime minister and several other officials,  as well as his family members, were at the airport to receive  the body. The regent described the killing as a heinous crime,  and said Jordan would seek the culprits out and bring them to  justice.    [Begin recording] [Hasan] It is too early to tell. It is a  heinous crime. It is another outrage against Jordanian  diplomats abroad. And we are certainly going to make every  serious, determined effort to find them out and to bring them to  justice.    [Reporter] Will you file a protest with the Lebanese  Government?    [Hasan] The Lebanese Government have been extremely helpful,  extremely concerned. The prime minister was in touch with our  embassy this morning, as were the Lebanese foreign minister and  minister of interior. We appreciate this strong stand.    [Reporter] How do you feel about that? It is a sad story?    [Hasan] I think it is an outrage that proves once again that  individuals and innocents pay the price when criminals are  (?abroad). And that this is something that this country will  never accept. We shall continue to do every thing in our power  to bring the perpetrators to justice.    [Reporter] Do you think that this was an act against the  peace process?    [Hasan] Well, it is certainly against every thing that  civilized [words indistinct] in this part of the world and the  world ....    [Reporter] Thank you.    [Hasan] Thank you. [end recording]    Forty-three-old Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, a counselor at the  Jordanian Embassy in Beirut was gunned down as he was leaving to  work. Lebanese police said a lone assassin with an unarmed  accomplice went up to al-Ma'ayitah's car and pumped at least  seven bullets through the driver's window. Al-Ma'aytiah died  instantly as most of the bullets from a 9 mm pistol hit his head  and neck. There was no immediate claims of responsibility or  clues as to the motives of the assassination, the first such  crime against a foreign diplomat in Lebanon since 1987. Police  officials said the killer and the accomplice escaped possibly in  a car waiting close by.    Al-Ma'ayitah, who had been serving in Lebanon for about one  year, is survived by his wife and two sons and a daughter.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Option 5: Promulgate Regulatory Standards for the Management of CKD Waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously stated, the Agency's analysis of the risks associated with cement kiln dust suggest that by merely lifting the exemption at 40 CFR 264.1(b)(8), certain pathways of potential concern under the hypothetical scenarios may not be adequately addressed under Options 3 and 4, should EPA decide that subtitle C regulation is warranted for CKD in the first instance. Specifically, EPA's risk assessment indicates indirect foodchain risks are of potential concern from releases of CKD from disposal piles to nearby surface waters and crop lands and from the direct application of CKD to croplands as a soil amendment assuming reasonable worst-case conditions. The Agency acknowledges, as discussed in detail in Chapter 6, that these modelled risks, while plausible, are of probably minimal incidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described above, the likely regulatory result under Options 3 and 4 would be to make CKD generated by a kiln that burns listed hazardous wastes itself a hazardous waste under the derived-from rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)). The indirect foodchain risks potentially identified in this Report, however, are not associated only with CKD generated by hazardous waste burning kilns. As a result, EPA is also considering regulatory mechanisms that would specifically address these risks, including promulgating regulatory standards under subtitle C for the management of CKD waste that would provide adequate protection against these risks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RCRA section 3001(b)(3)(C) provides that EPA shall within six months of the RTC ``determine to promulgate regulations under this subchapter *&blank;*&blank;* or determine that such regulations are unwarranted.'' The statute does not describe the type of regulation that EPA should consider promulgating (if any), other than that such regulation be under subtitle C of RCRA. For example, RCRA does not expressly direct EPA to determine whether to list CKD as hazardous, as required for other wastes under the mandates in RCRA section 3001(c). Furthermore, RCRA section 2002(a) gives the Administrator the broad authority to ``prescribe *&blank;*&blank;* such regulations as are necessary to carry out his functions under this chapter.'' The Agency believes it has the authority where appropriate to promulgate Federally-enforceable regulatory standards under subtitle C for the management of CKD. EPA could explore mechanisms for imposing regulatory standards for CKD, e.g., under grant of rulemaking authority under section 3001(b)(3)(C). Alternatively, EPA could consider conditioning the CKD exemption from the definition of hazardous waste (40 CFR 261.4(b)(8)) on compliance with appropriate management standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA could promulgate minimally burdensome management standards for cement kiln dust that would adequately control the indirect foodchain risks, such as: (1) Requiring that dust piles be kept covered to control fugitive emissions and institute surface water runoff and erosion controls; (2) maintaining groundwater protection, perhaps by requiring that CKD piles be maintained on a non-earthen base or by requiring a liner; and (3) establishing risk-based concentration thresholds for all constituents of concern (including 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD, arsenic, cadmium, and lead) for CKD used as a direct soil amendment. Additional or alternative standards may be appropriate, and EPA welcomes comments and suggestions on this aspect of its options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the five options being considered by the Agency, Options 3, 4 and 5 would provide more control through implementation of the provisions of subtitle C. The principal difference between Options 3 and 4 is the timing of the implementation of the regulatory controls. Option 3 provides industry additional time to implement waste minimization/pollution prevention options and more protective CKD management standards. Option 4 would bring CKD under subtitle C regulatory control more quickly. Removing the exemption also would impose regulatory equity between CKD generated from kilns that burn RCRA hazardous waste and residues from other incinerators that burn RCRA hazardous waste that do not have such an exemption. Option 5 would provide management standards to control all CKD, and would be targeted to specifically address only those risks of potential concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency did not evaluate the risk from the land application of agricultural lime, so it cannot determine whether there is an increase in incremental risk when CKD is substituted. In any event, CKD-sewage sludge derived fertilizers and soil amendments are considered safe for such uses as fertilizer and pose minimal risk because these final products are required to be tested to assure they comply with all provisions of 40 CFR part 503, which are fully protective of human health and the environment. It should be noted that if the exemption is removed, fertilizer that is derived from CKD generated from a kiln that burns listed hazardous waste is itself a hazardous waste under the derived-from rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)); the extent of regulation, however, is limited (see 40 CFR 266.20(b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, it should also be noted that under current rules, if CKD is recycled, the resulting clinker is not automatically subject to the provisions of subtitle C. By removing the exemption, however, clinker may be affected by the derived-from rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)) if the kiln burns listed hazardous waste, thereby becoming a hazardous waste. The Agency has not yet fully analyzed available data on trace constituents in clinker. Based on our understanding of current data, however, the Agency does not believe that clinker produced from kilns that burn listed hazardous waste generally poses a hazard to human health and the environment. The Agency is, therefore, considering crafting appropriate regulatory language for clinker. The Agency, however, is interested in receiving comment on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> E. Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Agency encourages all interested parties to obtain a copy of the Report to Congress and provide comments or further information that might be necessary to the Agency on the data, analysis, and findings contained in the Report to Congress, and on the types of specific requirements that might be necessary under RCRA subtitle C or D for this waste. In addition to receiving input from the various stakeholders regarding the appropriateness of each of the five regulatory options presented for the management of CKD, the Agency is interested in receiving additional information and/or comment on the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;CKD sampling data (analytical results, including conditions of sampling, fuels burned at time of sampling, types of samples collected and analytical methods used).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Documented cases of damage to human health and the environment traceable to CKD disposal, including notices of violation, administrative orders, and scientific studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;How the burning of RCRA hazardous wastes, non-hazardous wastes (such as tires and non-hazardous used oils), and fossil fuels affect the quantity and chemistry of generated CKD, as well as the partitioning of toxic metals, chlorides, and alkalis between stack gases, CKD, and clinker.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Agency's consideration of drafting appropriate regulatory language for clinker acknowledging that, based on the Agency's preliminary assessment, clinker produced from kilns that burn hazardous waste generally poses no hazard to human health or the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The extent to which activities such as farming (including the recreational gardening of vegetables) and fishing occur around these facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

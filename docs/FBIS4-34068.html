			<p>BFN     [Text] Panama, 12 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- U.S. Army South, based  in the Panama Canal area, today sent 37 troops in two "CH-47  Chinook" helicopters to Colombia to help victims of the  earthquake and subsequent floods, which have left several towns  mired in mud.    A U.S. Army South communique says the troops sent to  Colombia  are specialists in meteorology, air traffic control,  civilian-military operations, security, and medical treatment.  The U.S. troops' mission is to transport Colombian Government  first aid personnel and supplies and to evacuate disaster  victims.    The Neiva Airport in Colombia is serving as an operations  center and a storage center for supplies that will later be  transported by helicopter to affected areas that are  inaccessible by land following last week's earthquake.    The strong earthquake, which resulted in hundreds of deaths  and disappearances early this week, was part of a wave of  earthquakes that "bounced" among Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Paraguay,  Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, the United  States, and Canada. Earthquakes have recently increased in the  so-called "circle of fire" in the Pacific, which includes all  countries on the Pacific coast.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Structural flaws undermine Nippon Housing / Attempts to rescue an ailing property developer Back in the heady days of the late 1980s, Nippon Housing Loan could do no wrong. Property developers queued for loans, rural financial institutions rushed to pump money into the company, and individual investors were enthusiastic purchasers of its mortgage-backed securities. Nippon Housing was so delighted by mortgage certificate sales that it decided to give the product a new Japanese name, yorokobi, or congratulations. In summing up the successes of 1988, the company noted that it had 'secured high-grade customers' and invested in 'superior properties'. However, since then the funds washing over the Japanese economy have receded and the property market has collapsed in on itself. Nippon Housing has been left with an estimated Y1,300bn (Dollars 10.3bn) in non-performing loans out of a total loan portfolio of Y2,200bn. It is the most serious political problem on the country's bad loan books. and with the political background in mind, the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance are negotiating a bail-out with the nine commercial banks which founded Nippon Housing, and with other leading institutional lenders. The parties are close to an initial agreement, but the deep structural flaws at Nippon Housing are likely to force the government to lend assistance, directly or indirectly. The nine commercial banks, whose exposure is estimated at about 33 per cent of the total, will accept a reduction to nominal interest rates of between zero per cent and 1 per cent. The influential farmers' groups, who provided about 35 per cent of the funds, will take a rate fall from about 6 per cent to 4.5 per cent. Affected institutions are likely to get help from the Bank of Japan, which can support the rescue by offering them more loans at the official discount rate (ODR), allowing them to profit from the margin with market rates. In the longer term, the government may have to consider direct assistance. Nippon Housing Loan was founded in 1971 by the nine banks, including Sanwa Bank and Sakura Bank, which, at that time, were focused on industrial clients and not on individual borrowers. Eight housing loan companies were established, with Nippon Housing the largest, and all had to find new clients during the 1980s, when commercial banks put more emphasis on their own housing loan divisions. The commercial banks had grown wary of the lending enthusiasm of Nippon Housing, and gradually reduced their exposure. The new Nippon Housing clients were property developers, some of which were unable to get funds from mainstream banks, but which found the housing company willing to lend for speculative apartment projects and out-of-town office buildings . With demand still strong, new sources of funds were needed, and along came the farmers' groups. Not only Norinchukin, the central agricultural bank, which has an exposure estimated at Y157.9bn, but small regional agricultural institutions ploughed funds into Nippon Housing. While farm-related institutions account for more than a third of the exposure to Nippon Housing, they are the most reluctant to accept an interest rate reduction. The Ministry of Agriculture even attempted to link the bail-out to the rice market by suggesting that farm groups be fully repaid in expectation of allowing rice imports. Norinchukin argues that the government is responsible for the housing loan companies because 'they were established in the 1970s at the government's request'. The agricultural bank also insists that the Ministry of Finance, which had direct control over the institutions, should be held responsible, as should the founder commercial banks. The Norinchukin response reflects the surprise in Japan at the risk that goes with investment. When looking at Nippon Housing, investors saw instead Sanwa Bank, Sakura Bank, Daiwa Bank, and the other famous founders, who, at the same time, were reducing their exposure to the company. Purchasers of the mortgage-backed certificates, happy to take an interest return far higher than available on bank deposits, were unaware that Nippon Housing had befriended some of the country's shakier developers. In 1986, the total of outstanding certificates was Y22.1bn, but that rose to Y87.96bn by the end of March 1989, and Y300.99bn as at March last year. In Japan, most of these certificates are issued on individual buildings, rather than on a parcel of properties, which would spread the risk. The Mortgage Certificate Companies' Association admits that an unspecified number of these development projects have flopped, but says the certificate holders should have no fear. 'This is not America. The housing loan companies are not going to collapse,' the association says. But awareness of the risk and the slowing of new developments has lead to a fall in demand for the certificates -  the outstanding value of certificates was Y6,500bn at end-September, down 0.4 per cent from March, the first fall since the association began collecting national figures in 1989. Nippon Housing Loan says that if a developer which has borrowed on the mortgage collapses, 'we can use that mortgage to return money to investors' or 'we offer to buy the certificates that have problems and issue new ones that don't have problems'. The former method raises the same question facing Japanese banks -  how to cash in property collateral for which there are no buyers. Regardless of the final terms of the rescue package, Nippon Housing Loan will weigh heavily on the Japanese financial system for the next few years.</p>

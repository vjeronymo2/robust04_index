			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Eating Out: Your guide to the guides DO YOU long to be a restaurant inspector? The perks include: free lunches and dinners; travel; being paid for the privilege of eating and drinking; and the opportunity to pass judgment on those who stand and serve. The reality is very different. Lunch and dinner may be far from memorable and there may be a long stretch of motorway in between. At the end of the day, all that may await is a strange bed, a mountain of paperwork and a creaking digestive system. Small wonder that many inspectors have shorter lifespans than Chicago futures dealers. This week sees the publication of The 1992 Michelin Guide to Great Britain and Ireland (Pounds 10), the last of the four major guides for 1992. The others are The Good Food Guide (Pounds 12.95), The Egon Ronay Cellnet Guide (Pounds 12.95) and the AA guide (Pounds 12.99). They are full of facts, percentages, telephone numbers and ratings. But do not buy any of them if you are looking for inspiration or a sense of fun. For those who want a guide containing information, description and a sense of the real pleasures that may await, the solution could be to ignore the national guides and invest in new, more particular ones. Harden's London Restaurants 1992 (Pounds 7.50) is the most practical solution for anyone in town. And I can recommend John and Sally McKenna's Bridgestone Irish Food Guide (Pounds 9.95) for those crossing the Irish Sea. However, The Good Food Guide remains the most readable of the major players. Its editor, Tom Jaine, a former restaurateur and a knowledgeable food writer, has done a great deal to rectify the quirkiness indulged-in during the 1980s. But the guide has not sought to match the increasing professionalism of British restaurateurs and hoteliers with more professional and precise inspections that rely less on readers' reports. So, I think the guide, which this year celebrates its 40th birthday, has relinquished pole position. It is a place the Egon Ronay guide has shown no inhibitions about trying to fill. It is packed with advertisements: the first 20 pages extol Cellnet and the cellular society, followed by an exhortation to eat American ice-cream and then pay for it all with an American credit card. It does seem, however, to have lost touch with the reality of 1992. This year's awards go to an hotel where a room for the night costs Pounds 250, and to two restaurants where dinner for two will be not less than Pounds 130. It adds, condescendingly for those who cannot afford those prices, that one of the chefs will soon be opening a new restaurant 'to a larger public of smaller means.' The Ronay guide and the AA guide are, however, the most comprehensively descriptive guides to what this country has to offer. Graphically, they both need a major overhaul; lost at night in a country lane with either of these guides, you will need a magnifying glass to help find the way to bed. Michelin suffers from no such faults. Its city centre maps are clear and its information extensive. Why, then, does it do so little with all these facts? This year's guide merely tinkers with the starred restaurants. There are no changes among those with two or three stars, and some strange omissions and additions to those with one star. But, the biggest change, unexplained, is the 20 per cent decline in the number of restaurants in England and Wales with a red M - the category of restaurants 'supplying carefully prepared meals at reasonable prices.' Has the quality offered in this category - the type of restaurant to which you should be able to afford to go more than once a month - declined so much in one year? If so, Michelin ought to be explaining this, not only to the general public but also to the catering world.</p>

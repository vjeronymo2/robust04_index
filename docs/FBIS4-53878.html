			<p>BFN     [Text] Vietnam perceives that Thailand has a lot of  experience in marketing rice so it is asking for help in this  area, according to the Thai deputy commerce minister. Chaiyot  Sasomsap met yesterday with his Vietnamese counterpart.    Vietnam is faced with decreases in orders from African  countries which have devaluated their currencies, Chaiyot said.    The Vietnamese mission, comprised of senior officials and  representatives of the private sector, is led by Nguyen Xuan  Quang, the deputy trade minister.    The talks, to be held for three days to Wednesday, focus on  the sharing of information, marketing and the control of  production.    Chaiyot said if the two parties agree to exchange more  information it would benefit both sides. He complained that  Vietnam does not disclose much information about its rice  production and marketing, while Thailand discloses a lot of  information to them.    "We don't exactly know when Vietnam's rice is to come on the  market. If it is not on the same month (as ours) it is great,"  Chaiyot said.    Chaiyot wants the two sides to reach an agreement to  cooperate in marketing, sharing the world market.    "Thailand could sacrifice on its part, letting Vietnam be  the  biggest exporter of 15 per cent rice," he said.    The two sides might also cooperate to limit rice production  in order to avoid an oversupply on the world market, which would  lead to lower prices.    The results of technical discussions will be submitted to  Chaiyot and his counterpart Quang on Wednesday for approval. If  any further progress has been made the two sides will use the  results as principles for cooperation but if not the two sides  will follow a memorandum of understanding signed last year.    Chaiyot said the Vietnam will export this year about 1.7  million tonnes, down from the previous estimate of 2.2 million  tonnes. Thailand will export about 4.8 million tonnes, same as  last year.    Rice exports from the two countries of about 6.5 million  tonnes represent 40 per cent of world rice exports. Each  country produces 20 million tonnes per annum.</p>

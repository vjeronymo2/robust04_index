			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Madonna's Money: Apparently, the Material Girl isn't all that concerned with  money.  </P> <P> Madonna was listed in a recent New York newspaper ad trying to notify people  who have $50 or more in accounts that have been dormant for five years at  Chemical Bank. The notice listed her as Madonna Ciccone of 1775 Broadway and  she has until Oct. 20 to claim the money. After that, the bank turns the money  over to the state. Earlier this week, Forbes magazine included Madonna on its  list of the top 40 wealthiest entertainers, estimating her fortune at $62  million. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

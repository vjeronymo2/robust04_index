			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN SHOULD A COP SHOOT?  </P> <P> Sheriff Sherman Block reacted to a deputy's shooting and killing of a black  Muslin in Los Angeles last month with the simplest of common sense. From now on  officers will "avoid taking some enforcement action in minor incidents."  </P> <P> That was a good starting point. But with the recent controversial shooting of  an unarmed, nearly blind man by another sheriff's deputy, it may be time for  Block and other local law enforcement officials to make sure they are doing all  that they can to make sure officers as using their guns as carefully as they  possibly can.  </P> <P> Existing police guidelines stress that firearms be used only when absolutely  necessary. They are reasonable, and in the case of the Los Angeles Police  Department, laudably specific in emphasizing the training and reasoning behind  its firearm policy. But no matter how well-wrought the guidelines may be, they  can't possibly cover every situation an officer faces, from emotional family  arguments to drive-by shootings. What law enforcement leaders can and must do  is encourage what former cop James J. Fyfe calls a "corporate culture" that  makes the use of deadly force at best a necessary evil in the career of an  officer.  </P> <P> Fyfe, now a professor of justice at American University in Washington, says  that unnecessary police violence rarely occurs because a cop is brutal. Most  often it's because the officer is ill-trained in how to respond in a specific  situation. Big city departments around the country offer similar training for  their officers. Yet Fyfe's research reports that the rate of fatal shootings by  police from 1975-83 showed a major difference between New York and Los Angeles  police officers. The LAPD (the sheriff's department was not studied) was twice  more likely to use deadly force than was the NYPD, even taking into account the  larger number of NYPD officers. Fyfe admits that one variable that could cause  such a noteworthy difference is the crime environment in a city, and that lies  beyond the direct control of police administrators.  </P> <P> But one controllable factor is organizational. When top police management  embarks on a crusade to make the use of firearms a last resort, officers in the  field soon get the message. Insistence on restraint can help avoid bloodshed in  tense situations. Sure, law-enforcement officers have tough, rewarding and  sometimes scary jobs. The sheriff and the police chief often remind a demanding  public of the many hazards facing a police officer. But it is equally important  for law- enforcement leaders, in word and deed, to remind officers of their  singularly most crucial responsibility: restrained response.  </P></p>

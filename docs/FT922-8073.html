			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Africa pledge by developed nations LEADING industrialised nations assured Africa yesterday they remained committed to rescuing its fragile economies, despite increased competition for aid due to changes in eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc, Reuter reports from Dakar. The Netherlands minister for development cooperation, Mr Jan Pronx, told the annual meeting of the African Development Bank it was difficult to see where resources required to assist growth and attack poverty would come from, without more effective rescheduling of debt. 'In the view of the Netherlands, we still have to strive for a write-off debt of all least-developed countries,' he said. Representatives of other industrialised states stopped short of endorsing a need for new debt relief schemes, but chorused their intention to stand by Africa. 'My country is committed to remaining engaged in this continent,' declared Mr Olin Wethington, assistant secretary for international affairs at the US Treasury. Mr Alhaji Abubakar Alhaji, Nigeria's finance minister, said debt relief now provided 'a glimmer of hope', but Africa's economic plight was alarming. He proposed that concessions which multilateral aid agencies allowed to the poorest countries should be extended to the less well-off, middle-income states. But Mr Wethington told a news conference that Washington was reluctant at this stage to agree to such a proposal. He outlined at the meeting a two-pronged approach by his country in its economic relations with Africa in the post-Cold War world. While helping to meet social and economic needs, it would stress the value of democracy and market-based economies, and favour changes to promote the private sector. 'The long-term future lies with encouraging private enterprise,' he told reporters. 'The private capital markets will be able, in the long term, to provide resources that will exceed those available through official channels.' Mr Alhaji urged industrial countries to open their markets. 'At present, excessive subsidies to agricultural products of the developed economies create the double-edged sword which keeps our farm products out of their markets and, at the same time, depresses markets for our products,' the minister said.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Letter: Rigour key to team briefing Sir, Your article 'Team briefing has little effect on commitment' (July 27) on research sponsored by the Department of Employment - covering 25 companies - suggested that team briefing and related initiatives were having little positive effect on employee commitment and understanding. In a comprehensive study covering 87 major companies - to be published next week - we establish that it is the way team briefing practices are shaped and implemented that determines their success. As Tom Lehrer said when comparing life with a sewer, 'what you get out of it depends on what you put into it'. It is clear from our research that there are certain key disciplines and parameters to be applied in devising and managing these critical internal communication systems, which it would appear a majority of companies are not using sufficiently rigorously. The answer ultimately lies in the management, not the mechanism. Andrew Lambert, managing director, Lambert Consultancy, 50 Riversdale Road, London N5 2JT</p>

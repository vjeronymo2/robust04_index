			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 28, BNS -- The United States has allotted  160 million dollars to build homes for Russian officers  repatriating from the Baltic states and Eastern Europe, said  representatives of the U.S. State Department and the U.S.  International Development Agency [USAID].    The group toured Riga this week to acquaint Latvians with  the  implementation of two housing programs for Russian military.    The first experimental apartments will be ready next week in  the Novgorod and Pskov regions of Russia, said George Deikun, a  spokesman for the USAID. All 350 flats in this program will be  completed in the near months, he noted.    To accommodate 450 officers, 100 vouchers will be issued to  enable the officers to acquire apartments in Russia in 90 days.  From the 450 apartments, 80 percent are designed for those  withdrawing from the Baltic region.    The second project foresees to build 4,000 apartments and  distribute 1,000 vouchers. The general contractor for the  implementation of this project will be found until July.    Under a U.S.-Russian agreement, the construction is carried  out by American or Russian privately-run firms, or U.S.-Russian  joint ventures, said Deikun.    Unfortunately, Deikun said, the homes are and will be built  in compliance with Russian and not with American standards. The  apartments, however, will become private property of the  officers.    The U.S. delegation also met Wednesday [27 April] with  representatives of Russian Northwestern Army Group command to  discuss the implementation of the projects.    The officers basically want to return to their native  districts or places where it is easy to find jobs. USAID drafts  the list of officers who need accommodation together with the  Russian Interministerial Housing Committee, Russian local  governments and army command.    U.S. Ambassador to Latvia Ints Silins reconfirmed the  intention of the United States to donate 2 million dollars to  help Latvia dismantle the new block of the Skrunda radar  facility.    BNS asked Silins whether the United States will participate  in the financing of the Russian military retirees' repatriation  foundation, which will also deal with the rehabilitation of the  Skrunda environment. Silins answered he lacked information  about the goals of the foundation and, consequently, abstained  from comments.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Minister says laws hamper local authority changes Reshuffles of responsibility in the two-tier local government system in rural England are not possible because they are not allowed by legislation, Mr David Curry, the local government minister, said yesterday. He told a conference of the Association of District Councils: 'Whatever the intellectual arguments which say we should reduce the county councils to a more genuine strategic authority and devolve down to the districts, that option is not open to us.' Mr Peter Johnson of Fylde Borough Council in Lancashire said his council had already agreed to merge with a neighbouring authority, but members now wondered whether they had 'surrendered the borough too soon'. He said there was 'powerful lobbying' to redistribute functions between counties and districts, but leave boundaries undisturbed. Mr Curry said the government still favoured all-purpose unitary authorities, combining all the functions now done by counties and districts despite last month's High Court ruling that this preference could not be written into the government's guidance to the commission. Mr Curry said districts must agree on mergers, but should think more about how to provide low-profile services such as archive services and planning instead of arguing about drawing boundaries. He said that if new unitary authorities could not reach voluntary arrangements on joint planning the alternative would be voluntary agreements 'where my department at the end of the day stands behind to make sure there's no failure in delivery - it would be a sort of guided voluntary activity'. Professor Michael Clarke of Birmingham University, a former chief executive of the Local Government Management Board, told the conference there was a danger that chances to decide on basic issues for the future of local government could be missed. New unitary authorities would be 'totally new animals' and not a continuation of old councils, he said. One chief executive of a district council planned that the education department, now run by the county, would become a division of the district's leisure department. The leader of another district had decided that social services, also a county task, should be a division of the district housing department, Prof Clarke said.</p>

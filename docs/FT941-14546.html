			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Aspin to stay as defence hunt goes on Mr Les Aspin, due to step down today as secretary of defence, has agreed to stay on until the Clinton administration names a new successor, following Mr Bobby Ray Inman's abrupt withdrawal as nominee to the Pentagon on Tuesday. As President Bill Clinton left a Washington in the grip of record cold to inspect the Los Angeles earthquake disaster, there was no word on when a new candidate would be named, or even if the administration had compiled a prospective short list. The search for a new nominee, led by Mr Mack McLarty, White House chief of staff, only began last weekend, when the president, still in Europe, was advised of Mr Inman's intention to withdraw. The retired admiral said that he had recommended a successor but, given the embarrassment he has caused, it is unlikely to be given any weight. In effect Mr Clinton is back to where he was two months ago, when it was first decided to seek Mr Aspin's resignation. There is a list of people whose names are invariably mentioned for senior defence positions and it appears to remain as it was, with the subtraction of Mr Inman's name. Generally reckoned to be on it are Mr James Woolsey, currently head of the CIA; Mr William Perry, now deputy secretary of defence; Mr John Deutch, Pentagon undersecretary for acquisitions; Mr Norman Augustine, head of Martin Marietta, the leading defence contractor; Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate armed service committee; and congressman Dave McCurdy, the Democrat from Oklahoma. Also mentioned are retired General Colin Powell, former head of the joint chiefs of staff, and retired Admiral William Crowe, due to be the next ambassador in London. Both would require waivers from the law preventing former military men from serving in the Pentagon before a number of years have elapsed. Each may have reasons not to accept any offer. Senator Nunn, for example, seems far too wedded to his power base on Capitol Hill to want to follow Mr Aspin's path to the Pentagon. General Powell's politics are a closely guarded secret, as are any political ambitions he may have. Vulnerable targets, Page 19</p>

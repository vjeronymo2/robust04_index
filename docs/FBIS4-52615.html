			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Posts and Telecommunications  Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa and a U.S. leader of the "information  superhighway" project agreed Thursday [12 May] to cooperate in  the construction of an optical-fiber global information network,  ministry officials said. Hikasa met with Edward McCracken,  cochairman of the U.S. National Information Infrastructure (NII)  Council, who is visiting Tokyo.    Japan is preparing to build an optical-fiber network for  domestic communications, and is calling for a wider network  joined by South Korea and other Asian nations.    The ministry officials said Hikasa told McCracken that Japan  will back the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) project  which is being promoted by the United States.    The GII plan was proposed by U.S. Vice President Al Gore in  March. It aims to provide instant access to information around  the world through a large optical-fiber communication network.</p>

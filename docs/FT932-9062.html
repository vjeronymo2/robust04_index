			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Tadpole moves back into the black TADPOLE Technology, the high technology group, made a profit in the first six months reversing the trend of earlier years. Before tax the figure for the half year to March 31 amounted Pounds 26,800 compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.4m a year ago. Turnover rose from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 8.9m and the order book at period end stood at Pounds 5.5m. Earnings per share of 0.3p compared with previous losses of 15.9p. The group, based in Cambridge in the UK and Austin, Texas, is not paying a dividend following the practice of high technology companies in the US which rarely pay dividends in their early years. The shares closed 22p down at 307p, but Mr Robert Booth, finance director, said there had been speculative buying in the weeks leading up to the interim results and the price was now back at its usual level. Tadpole moved from the over-the-counter market to a full listing in December last year at 65p a share and swiftly shot up to the 300p mark. Tadpole is a specialist in printer circuit board design and manufacture. It has managed to combine the elements of a Sun Sparc work group station - the workhorse of technical computing - in a notebook sized package called the Sparcbook. Mr George Grey, chief executive, said the results reflected growth of Sparcbook sales coupled with a good performance from the printed circuit board division. The directors intend to appoint US financial advisers with the objective of moving towards an ADR listing.</p>

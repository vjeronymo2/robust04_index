			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A Hizballah delegation is touring African  countries. After its fruitful and successful visit to Cote  d'Ivoire, the Hizballah delegation led by Deputy Muhammad  Barjawi arrived in Sierre Leone. The delegation was accorded a  warm reception by a huge crowd of the Lebanese community led by  the community's president, the Iranian ambassador in Freetown,  and the iman of the town's mosque.    During the visit, the Hizballah delegation met the vice  president, the prime minister, and Presidential Affairs Minister  Colonel Jomo [name and title as published]. Deputy Barjawi and  his delegation also met Hindolo Tyre, secretary of state for  information. The two sides discussed bilateral relations and  the status of the Lebanese community in Sierre Leone.    The Lebanese ambassador in Freetown hosted a dinner banquet  in honor of the visiting delegation. Deputy Barjawi delivered a  speech during the banquet. He said: We have come to visit our  expatriate kin and to reiterate our cooperation and solidarity  with them. We also urge them to increase their participation in  the reconstruction process in Lebanon and support their  steadfast kin in the south and western al-Biqa'.    Syria's Honorary Consul in Freetown, al-Hajj Husayn Jawad,  hosted a dinner banquet in honor of the Hizballah delegation.  Present were the Lebanese ambassador, the Iranian ambassador,  and Turkey's honorary consul. It was an opportunity to exchange  views and to praise the role of resistance in confronting the  Israeli occupation.

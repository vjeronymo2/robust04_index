			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ISRAEL;  </P> <P> PAMPHLET CALLS FOR ATTACKS ON ARABS  </P> <P> A pamphlet distributed among Jewish settlers urges them to shoot Palestinians  and gives detailed instructions on how to obtain guns and avoid capture,  according to Israeli media reports. The anonymous pamphlet advises settlers to  gather explosives from the army, masquerade as soldiers during attacks and  leave behind misleading evidence. It says the settlers in the occupied West  Bank and Gaza Strip should respond to stoning attacks on their cars with  gunfire and should try to "hit and cause much damage."  </P></p>

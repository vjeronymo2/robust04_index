			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Emilio Crespo] </F>   [Excerpts] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 16 Jun (EFE) --  The Central American presidents, who had planned to meet with  Cuban President Fidel Castro today to request the island's  democratization, have decided not to hold the meeting in light  of the reluctance of several presidents who have not forgotten  the role Havana once played in their region.    Although the official explanation of the cancellation of the  meeting was "agenda problems," different Central American  sources said several presidents did not want to meet Castro  because of the scant affinity they feel toward him because of  his support for the now nearly extinct guerrilla movements on  the isthmus.    Salvadoran sources told EFE that, in particular, for  President Armando Calderon Sol of the right-wing ARENA  [Nationalist Republican Alliance], such a meeting would have  been difficult. Even though peace has come to El Salvador, it  would have been objectionable for Calderon Sol to meet with one  of the politicians who fostered the military conflict in El  Salvador.    Calderon Sol, who took office on 1 June, today said Cuba  still has a long way to go in terms of encouraging freedom and  democracy. He added that as long as Cuba does not create more  opportunities for freedom, there will be no progress in  cooperation with the island.    "All of us who love democracy and expect respect for human  dignity must raise this topic (at the summits)," the Salvadoran  president added. [passage omitted]    Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres today commented on  the failed meeting with the Cuban leader by saying it was not  held "because the topics we would have addressed with President  Castro were broadly reviewed at the (summit's) private session  on Wednesday afternoon."    Officially, Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal [title as  received] and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo told  EFE that agenda problems and the presidents' departure for their  home nations today made the meeting with Castro impossible.  This meeting had sparked interest because the six Central  American presidents, who met Monday in Costa Rica to prepare a  joint position on the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, had issued  in San Jose a communique asking for Cuba's democratization.

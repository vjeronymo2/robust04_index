			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Markets: Please sir, we'd like a little time - London THE STOCK market got a Pounds 204.5m begging letter this week, disguised as a one-for-two rights issue from Trafalgar House. True, the issue is fully underwritten, so the company is something of a hypothetical mendicant. But that does not make the request any the less pressing. For example, the issue document makes clear that any shareholder taking up the rights will be financing his own dividends, since the 3.25p payout promised for the year ending in September 1993 will come from reserves. Those reserves are heavily depleted by write-downs and exceptional losses on the company's Pounds 724m property portfolio. Without the proceeds of the rights issue, Trafalgar House would be Pounds 92m short of the Pounds 500m of capital and reserves required under its banking covenants. It is not surprising, perhaps, that the new ordinary shares are being pitched at a 32 per cent discount to the market price. Or that they are accompanied by a significant tightening of the grip of Honkgong Land, a sister company of Jardine Matheson and part of the Keswick family group. The arrival of the Keswicks, who first took an interest in Trafalgar House last year, has already brought about a change at the very top of the company. Now, through the mechanism of the rights issue, they may well take their stake close to the 29.9 per cent for which they made an unsuccessful bid last year. While all this has been going on the price of the company's ordinary shares has doubled. It touched a low of 39p last year, before the Keswicks arrived, and was 88 1/2 p immediately before the rights issue. Since then it has fallen, closing on Friday at 76p, down 16 per cent on the week. The Keswicks have proved shrewd investors to follow in the case of one UK company, Kwik Save, which has risen from roughly 300p to over 800p since they took an interest in early 1987. Whether their judgment remains as sound in the case of Trafalgar House is open to question: much turns on the outlook for the heavy engineering business, which is now the company's core activity, and the market for the group's other subsidiaries. On the first point, the short-term prospects are poor, since levels of activity in this business are still falling. On the second point, the company makes it clear that the rights issue is intended to buy time to allow non-core activities to be sold off at a reasonable price. A verdict on the shares thus revolves around how much time is needed - and how much of it Pounds 205m will buy. Trafalgar's directors were not the only people buying time this week. The governor-designate of the Bank of England, Eddie George, was busy at the same task. He was attempting to stave off the moment at which it becomes necessary to raise interest rates to prop up the pound. The urgency of this activity stemmed from the slide in sterling, which fell for most of the week, touching DM 2.3245 in early trading on Friday, a drop of 7 pfennigs on the week and a devaluation of 21 per cent from the old ERM central rate. The stock market, casting off the insouciance with which it had regarded the falling pound in recent weeks, suddenly woke up to the fear that its weakness might force the government to raise interest rates: on Tuesday, the FT-SE 100 index dropped 38.7 points, to 2,831.3. By Thursday, an urgent defence of the pound was clearly needed. First, on Thursday, Eddie George gave an unusually personal speech in Frankfurt, capital of hard-money rectitude, in which he stressed his commitment to monetary stability. Then, on Friday, still in Germany, he gave a press conference. 'It is clear,' he said, 'that if the exchange rate weakened substantially further, we would have no option but to tighten policy further.' Of the two, the Thursday speech may prove the more memorable. George stressed the importance of the Bank's new quarterly inflation reports - the first of which is due on Tuesday - and the chancellor's emphasis, when appointing the new team at the Bank, on the task of bringing about a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation. 'We take both these responsibilities extremely seriously within the Bank,' George told his German audience. 'They may not amount to constitutional independence for the central bank, such as you enjoy here, but in our view they represent a very considerable forward movement, which will do very well to be going on with.' In spite of these stirring words, the pound continued to fall after the speech. Its recovery, which started in mid-morning on Friday, stemmed not from any rhetoric from the Bank, but from the visible signs of lack of inflationary pressure in the economy. The consumer price index for January showed that prices were only 1.7 per cent higher than a year ago, the lowest figure since 1967. Even stripping out the effect of lower interest rates, inflation was still substantially better than the City's economists had expected: the underlying rate was only 3.2 per cent, a drop of half a percentage point in a month when most economists were expecting a rise close to the government's intended 4 per cent ceiling. The drop in underlying inflation was the more striking since Tuesday saw a sharp rise in manufacturers' costs, which are growing at 7.2 per cent a year. Gilts rallied strongly on the inflation news, with the yield on 10-year gilts dropping to 7.9 per cent, the first time it had been below 8 per cent since at least 1976. Sterling recovered, to close at DM 2.3480. It was a development the Bank of England's new man can regard with some satisfaction. But it also offered a warning: from the market's point of view, deeds count more than words.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Fashion: Why Soho can suit the smart set - It is not just Savile Row tailors who can cut a dash in the world of top-class menswear Jack Nicholson has been in London. Between dining at San Lorenzo, dancing at Tramp and sleeping at The Connaught, the actor has been stocking up on a few conversation-piece suits. Nicholson is not to be found on Savile Row but in Soho, giving his high-profile custom to John Pearse of Meard Street. Pearse must be a very successful man, for he does not regard politeness as a tool of his trade. One imagines the sparring that takes place over the tape measure as he calculates the jib of Nicholson and fellow celebrities Mick Jagger, Tom Cruise, Malcolm McClaren, Nicole Kidman and Mariella Fostrupp, for he subscribes to the tiresome 'it's-cool-to-be-rude' style of badinage with customers, for fear, perhaps, that they will mistake his work for a service. His tailoring style is 'laddish'. While he can offer the full gamut of classics - grey flannel, Prince of Wales check and Harris tweed - since his days at 'Granny Takes a Trip' in the 1960s, he leans towards more attention-seeking tailoring, such as changeant velvet, Hendrix suits, pony-skin print shirts, horizontal pinstripes, and bookmaker checks. But he finds today's rich rock stars of a certain age prefer his more conventional offerings. 'You can get bored of being a fashion plate, and so you dress down in a neutral uniform.' The greatest compliment that Pearse can pay a customer is that 'I don't recognise one of my own suits on them, it becomes part of them'. He has cited Richard Ingrams as a pleasing example of this, in his signature, bashed-up corduroy suits. While most of Pearse's clients fall into the 'performing arts and their hangers-on' category, he also caters for the business community. So if you can afford at least Pounds 700 for a suit, and like verbal jousting, Pearse will oblige. A similar counter-culture is served by the talented young tailor Oswald Boateng. But, while cutting the sharpest suit in the trade, he will ply you with old world courtesies. A tall, athletic client is best suited to the Boateng treatment for he cuts suits with fork-prong narrow trousers and high-waisted coats. Both his male and female customers emerge from his Portabello Road studio looking like gloriously-coloured Daddy Longlegs. David Chambers, a jovial tailor based in Hertfordshire, will come to your home or office for fittings, and lists singer Bryan Ferry, designer Sir Terence Conran, artist Patrick Hughes and gallery owner Tim Jeffries, among his clients. Chambers has a keen eye and a sure hand. He is also flexible, taking full advantage of the bartering school of business. Hamish McAlpine, the film distributor, swopped his much-coveted Ferrari for 28 Chambers suits. Prices start at Pounds 500. Mark Powell, another Soho-based tailor, specialises in nostalgically-inspired suits, such as the new Edwardian, four- button coat favoured by musician Jools Holland and comedian Vic Reeves. He is not only patronised by stars but also by stage companies requiring period costume. His imposing frame, shaved head and Michael-Caine-in-Alfie manner belie a courteous temperament.

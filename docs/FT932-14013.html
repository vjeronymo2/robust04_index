			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten rallies Tory backbenchers over policy on school tests TORY MPs rallied behind Mr John Patten, the education secretary, in the Commons last night when he insisted that schools should proceed with the tests they are legally required to stage this summer. He described the attempt made by the National Union of Teachers to promote a boycott of the tests as 'absurd' and forecast that the 'committed professionalism of teachers' would result in the law being obeyed. The government secured a majority of 54 (317-263) to defeat a Labour motion calling on the education secretary to withdraw the compulsion on schools to carry out key stage three tests in English and tech-nology. Mr John Major, the prime minister, had again emphasised the importance of ensuring that the tests took place. He said: 'I believe any attempt to sabotage our reforms could damage our long-term ability to compete, and damage the education of our children.' Mr Patten rejected a suggestion by Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow education secretary, that parents should be balloted on whether they wanted the tests to take place in the summer. Challenged by Tory backbenchers on whether she backed calls for a boycott, Mrs Taylor said she supported the professional and educational case made by the teachers. She said the actions teachers took in support of their cases 'must be for their decision.' Mr Patten argued that tests enabled parents to establish the progress their children were making at school, and also helped ministers when deciding the resources that needed to be allocated to education. Mrs Taylor acknowledged the value of 'good and appropriate' tests, but maintained that those which Mr Patten had devised were 'high on administration and low on educational value'. Sir Malcolm Thornton (C Crosby), chairman of the cross-party education committee, said he could understand teachers' frustration but cautioned that a boycott would do nothing but harm. He advocated improved consultation procedures for teachers and suggested that an agreement to make the tests voluntary rather than statutory for the present year offered a way forward. Mr Patten assured him that teachers would be able to make their views known to Sir Ron Dearing, the chairman of the schools curriculum and assessment authority. Earlier in the day the Liberal Democrats broadened their campaign for the local elections with the launch of a paper promising new approaches in education instead of the current 'division and chaos'. Mr Don Foster, the party's education spokesman, predicted that there would be a widespread boycott of the tests by parents as there had been in Scotland. Agreeing with the concerns that teachers had voiced about the tests, he added: 'They are the professionals, they are the ones that must make the judgment about what is best for their particular children - I will support the judgment they come to.' The government was defeated by 34 votes in the House of Lords when peers approved a Labour amendment requiring that people with experience of special educational needs should be appointed to the funding agency established under the education bill.</p>

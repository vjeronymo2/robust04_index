			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'BATMAN' VIDEO DEFEATS 'E.T.' IN RENTAL RACE  </P> <P> Warner Home Video's "Batman" has soared to new heights in the video rental  business with 9.8 million transactions counted in two weeks, according to the  New York research firm of Alexander &amp; Associates.  </P> <P> The film noir version of the comic book hero's clash with the Joker rang in an  estimated $21 million in holiday rentals from its Nov. 17 release until Dec. 4.  </P> <P> Batman's two-week rental record eclipsed the previous high set by "E.T. The  Extra-Terrestrial," beating the bicycle-levitating alien by "more than 3  million turns," said Robert Alexander, the firm's president.  </P> <P> Batman's velocity also helped carry the video industry to its best week  overall, said Alexander, who counted 94.8 million video rentals for the week  ending Dec. 4.  </P> <P> The previous high was 91.8 million in rentals, set in the last week of  November, 1988, when "E.T." was released.  </P> <P> When it comes to video sales, however, it appears that MCA Home Video's "E.T."  probably will outperform "Batman."  </P> <P> Analysts estimate that about 4.2 million copies of "Batman" have been sold to  consumers, with about 1.3 million representing sales to video rental operators.  </P> <P> Retailers indicated that "Batman" sales are about half the pace of "E.T."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP VIDEO RENTALS  </P> <P> Last week's top videocassette rentals, from Billboard magazine:  </P> <P> 1.

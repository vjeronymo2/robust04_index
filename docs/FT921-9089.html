			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries remain weak after auction THE Treasury's quarterly refunding programme remained the dominant influence on US bond market sentiment yesterday, with bond prices continuing weak across the board after the afternoon auction of 10-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  11/32 at 102 3/32 , yielding 7.811 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down 1/8 at 99 5/32 , yielding 5.060 per cent. There was little buying and selling during the morning, and the main objective among market participants was to establish secure positions in advance of the 10-year auction. Demand for the new securities had been expected to be relatively light, and the auction subsequently went much as expected. The unusual steepness of the yield curve, however, was believed to have lured more investors to the 10-year issue than Tuesday's three-year issue. The final leg of the refunding is later today, when the Treasury sells Dollars 10bn of 30-year bonds. THE PRICES of longer-dated UK gilts edged higher yesterday on continuing signs of economic weakness, although prices slid marginally at the short end on weaker hopes of an early cut in interest rates. The latest quarterly bulletin from the Bank of England, published yesterday, gave little evidence of economic recovery, although the Bank said that it still expected recovery this year. Analysts also expect to find little sign of recovery in employment data due today or inflation data on Friday. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent bond due 2003/07 firmed from 111 7/32 to 111 15/32 during the day. In a light day on Liffe, with only 16,000 contracts traded, the long gilts future rose from its opening of 97.27 to close near the high of the day at 98.00. In contrast, the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 fell by  1/32 of a point to 101 3/16 . PRICES of German government bonds remained firm, with 34,000 of the March 10-year bund contract traded. Expectations that 10-year bund issues would remain scarce helped to keep prices firm, analysts said. Shorter-dated government bonds, by contrast, weakened. JAPANESE government bond yields rose yesterday on fears for the yen. Reports that the US Federal Reserve does not want to see any further depreciation in the dollar led to concern that intervention would hit the yen, helping to push Japanese government bonds down from their Monday close. (Tuesday was a holiday.) The yield on the benchmark no 129 bond rose from Monday's close of 5.445 per cent to 5.5 per cent during the day.</p>

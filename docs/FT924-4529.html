			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Buthelezi threatens to form new state CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, yesterday issued a veiled threat to declare the unilateral independence of the KwaZulu black homeland and the white province of Natal from South Africa. His move, on the eve of important constitutional negotiations between the African National Congress and the government, appeared aimed at influencing the talks rather than raising an immediate prospect of secession. The Inkatha leader, who is chief minister of the KwaZulu 'homeland', said he would seek to hold a referendum to test the popularity of a new multi-racial state called KwaZulu/Natal, formed by unifying white Natal province and the black homeland. The state would have autonomous powers within a federal South Africa. He published a draft constitution for the new state, which would include protection for minorities and special representation for 'cultural formations', which in many cases would be the same as racial groups. Chief Buthelezi claimed that the Joint Executive which now administers some aspects of government in KwaZulu and Natal together, would have the authority to call an all-race referendum on the proposed constitution. 'Once ratified by the electorate of KwaZulu/Natal, the new constitution will stand in force, regardless of the direction taken by the constitutional process in South Africa,' Chief Buthelezi said, a threat that the new state would in effect secede if its demands for regional powers are not granted. Though such a constitution would have no legal force under the current South African constitution, popular backing - if it could be achieved, which is far from certain - would put pressure on the ANC to grant strong powers to regions such as KwaZulu/Natal. So far, the ANC has insisted on only limited devolution of power to regions, while the ruling National party seeks greater regional devolution. Inkatha goes one step further than the National party, demanding full-fledged federation. Chief Buthelezi's announcement brings to the fore the issue of regional devolution, which is likely to prove the most difficult question in the constitutional talks soon to begin. Government officials yesterday rejected his plans and indicated Pretoria would bring pressure on Natal authorities to prevent a referendum. Officials said they did not believe Chief Buthelezi was contemplating secession from South Africa but that he would do so if he could not guarantee strong regional powers through negotiation.</p>

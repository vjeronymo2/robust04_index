			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: PSBR funding The gilt market should not be too disappointed at the chancellor's failure in his Autumn Statement to relax the full funding rules. It would not have been enough simply to declare that bank and building society purchases of gilts would count towards PSBR funding. To make much difference, these institutions would also have to be large scale buyers of government paper. There is not much evidence that the advent of a positive yield curve has given them much incentive in this respect - in contrast to the behaviour of banks in the US. Part of the reason is institutional. Banks and building societies traditionally look to gilt market investment more for liquidity management than profit. There may now be some temptation to step up gilt purchases, especially given stagnating loan demand, but the margins for banks are skimpy. Indeed, three month sterling has been higher than the redemption yield on 5 year gilts for much of the period since Black Wednesday. To earn a decent margin banks would have to move out along the maturity spectrum - to a point where the risk of capital loss was now arguably greater than it was before the devaluation. Net bank and building society purchases of gilts were only Pounds 875m in 1991-92 and Pounds 980m in the first half of the current year. Allowing such purchases to count as funding would not make a large dent in the PSBR. Nor, unless the yield curve grows much steeper, can UK banks expect the kind of windfall profits from government securities which have allowed US banks to rebuild their capital after the ravages of the recession.</p>

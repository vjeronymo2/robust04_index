			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crop recovery spreads gloom among Greece's olive groves - A glut that is hitting prices MANY GREEK olive oil producers, facing slack demand this year, have resorted to doing their own marketing. Farmers have gone direct to the consumer, selling oil door-to-door in 20-kilogram tins, at prices that barely meet production costs. Output in the 1991-92 season returned to average levels after a shortfall in 1990-91, the result of a prolonged drought. According to the Agriculture Ministry, total production reached about 320,000 tonnes, compared with only 197,000 tonnes the previous season. The increased production meant that farmers in Crete and the Peloponnese, which normally account for almost two-thirds of Greek output, were left with about 160,000 tonnes of oil that seemed unlikely to find buyers. Producer prices collapsed earlier this year, falling from Dr1,200 (Pounds 3.40) to Dr600 a kilogram for extra virgin oil. 'This is around cost price for a farmer who does most of the work with his family. Producers who hired pickers last winter have come out with losses,' says a government agricultural officer in Sparta in the southern Peloponnese. There are an estimated 400,000 olive farmers in Greece, most of whom cultivate small orchards, with assistance from their families at harvest time. A labour shortage in the countryside means that larger producers must pay high daily rates to itinerant pickers. Early forecasts suggest that this winter's olive crop will match last year's, and growers fear that they will again have trouble finding sufficient customers. However, this month the European Community came up with an intervention price of Dr587 a kilogram for top-quality oil, enabling producers to recoup outlays by selling their produce to the co-operatives before the next harvest. At the same time, exports have picked up slowly as Italian buyers, taking advantage of the price slump, resume large bulk purchases. Greek oil exports are volatile, but have averaged about 70,000 tonnes annually in recent years. Greek producers complain that most of the high quality oil is mixed in Italy with small amounts of local oil and exported to northern Europe and the US as Italian. 'The best Greek oil compares for quality with oil from Tuscany. But not enough effort is made to market it,' says Mr Julian Cassaveti of Harvest Commodities, an Athens-based analyst. A new law that comes into effect with this year's harvest, requires all Greek oil to be sold with a label showing its region of origin. This, it is hoped, will have the dual effect of discouraging local merchants from mixing Greek oil with cheaper Spanish imports and encourage a new approach to marketing. The farmers carrying cans of oil to city apartment blocks may have taken the first step. But, says Mr Giorgios Economou of Sevitel, an oil exporters' association: 'We have to make the switch to bottled oil with labels of origin and do more work on finding distributors abroad.'</p>

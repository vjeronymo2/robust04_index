			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Forum provides management, administrative, and distribution related services to Norwest Funds and will provide similar services to the Advantage Funds and Core Trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The fifteen Advantage Funds will consist of seven equity funds (Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Large Company Growth Fund, Small Company Growth Fund, Income Equity Fund, Index Fund, and International Fund); three balanced funds (Conservative Balanced Fund, Moderate Balanced Fund, and Growth Balanced Fund), and five fixed income funds (Intermediate U.S. Government Fund, Managed Fixed Income Fund, Stable Income Fund, Short Maturity Investment Fund, and Ready Cash Investment Fund). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Five of the Advantage Funds_Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Conservative Balanced Fund, Moderate Balanced Fund, and Growth Balanced Fund (the ``Blended Funds'')_will continue their predecessor CIFs' practice of allocating specified percentages of their assets among several different investment styles. The Diversified Equity Fund and the Growth Equity Fund (the ``Blended Equity Funds'') seek to achieve long term capital appreciation by investing in equity securities. Consistent with their investment objectives, the Blended Equity Funds allocate a fixed percentage of their assets to several investment styles. Each Blended Equity Fund allocates a significant portion of its assets to investments in large, high quality domestic companies that, in the view of its adviser, have superior growth potential as well as, in the case of the Diversified Equity fund, equities that may provide above average dividend income. In addition, each Blended Equity Fund allocates a portion of its assets to investment in equity securities of small companies and a portion to investment in non-U.S. issuers. The Diversified Equity Fund also invests in a group of securities representing 96% or more of the capitalization-weighted market value of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index. The Conservative Balanced Fund, the Moderate Balanced Fund, and the Growth Balanced Fund (collectively, ``Blended Balanced Funds'') invest in a balanced portfolio of fixed income and equity securities. Like the Blended Equity Funds, the Blended Balanced Funds allocate portions of their assets among different investment styles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. To an extent consistent with its investment objectives, each Blended Fund will invest directly in equity securities and, in the case of the Blended Balanced Funds, fixed income securities. Applicants believe that investors in the Blended Funds can obtain substantial benefits, however, if the Blended Funds pool the assets they allocate for investment in the securities of small companies, non-U.S. issuers, and companies listed in the S&amp;P 500 Index. Accordingly, applicants propose that the Blended Funds invest those portions of their portfolios in the Small Company, International, and Index Portfolios of Core Trust. Although at present only the Blended Funds intend to rely on the order, applicants also propose that any other series of Norwest Funds for which the Bank or any company controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Bank acts as adviser, or any open-end investment company for which the Bank or any company controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Bank acts as adviser in the future (collectively the ``Future Funds''), be permitted to invest in the Small Company, International, and Index Portfolios of Core Trust in the same manner as the Blended Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Each existing CIF will convert into a corresponding series of the Advantage Funds by transferring the securities and cash in its portfolio to the corresponding Advantage Fund in exchange for shares of the Advantage Fund. Each CIF will then distribute shares of the Advantage Funds to each employee benefit plan  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  according to its interest in the terminating CIF. When the Portfolios commence operations, each Blended Fund will contribute the small company, international, and S&amp;P 500 Index securities in its portfolio to the corresponding Portfolio in exchange for shares of that Portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. All portfolio securities contributed in-kind will be appropriate investments for the Portfolios. Such in-kind transactions will comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (f) of rule 17a&hyph;7, except that the consideration for the securities contributed to Core Trust will be Core Trust shares rather than cash. After the initial contribution of securities, the Portfolios will buy and sell portfolio securities at the discretion of their respective portfolio managers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARSONIST SOUGHT IN 80-ACRE CANYON FIRE  </P> <P> Authorities searched for an arsonist Thursday who sparked a brush fire that  raced through 80 acres of Carbon Canyon Regional Park.  </P> <P> Arson investigators searching the southeast portion of the park found a charred  incendiary device, footprints and other evidence that led them to conclude the  blaze was intentionally set.  </P> <P> A plea for the public's help in locating the arsonist seemed to be working,  with fire and police investigators receiving numerous tips, Orange County Fire  Capt. Dan Young said.  </P> <P> "We've been getting lots of calls," Young said. "We've got several leads and  they are good leads. It's good to see the community pitching in to help like  that."  </P> <P> Meanwhile a warming Santa Ana condition that was bringing high winds into the  area worried fire officials and prompted them to leave extra crews on the scene  during mop-up procedures.  </P> <P> "There are still hot spots that we can't walk away from," Young said.  </P> <P> The blaze charred dense grassland in the 120-acre park, narrowly missing three  groves of 60-foot-high California redwoods that were planted in the park in  1975 for preservation purposes.  </P> <P> The fire burned within a quarter of a mile of two neighborhoods. No one was  injured and no property was destroyed, Young said.  </P> <P> The 110 county firefighters at the scene, comprising 25 engine companies, two  bulldozer crews and four hand crews, fought increasing winds and chilly  temperatures as they worked all night to contain the blaze, Young said.  </P> <P> Arson investigators declined to describe the device they believe was used to  set the blaze.  </P></p>

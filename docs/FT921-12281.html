			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Return to black at Dale Electric DALE ELECTRIC International, the Yorkshire-based power and lighting group, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 497,000 in the six months to October 27, compared with a loss of Pounds 146,000 in the corresponding period. The group said the improvement continued the good work of the second half of last year, when it moved back into the black after suffering from project delays. Turnover was flat at Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 24m) but directors said that continuing rationalisation and the strength the group's export markets had improved its resilience to recession. The order book stood at Pounds 35m, enough for seven months work. Although lower base rates cut interest payments from Pounds 1.28m to Pounds 962,000, gearing remained about 88 per cent. The group is seeking to dispose of surplus property in Ashford, Kent, but this was being delayed by uncertainty over the Channel rail tunnel and the present depressed state of the market. Sir Tom McDonald, chairman, said that the generating set and battery-based power system sides of the group showed greater strength than the aerospace interests, where markets still suffered from the economic downturn and the malaise caused by the Gulf war, although there was now prospect of positive change. He said: 'The group looks forward to a very active trading period in the traditionally stronger second half.' Earnings per share of 2.79p compared with losses of 1.76p last time. The interim dividend is maintained at 2p.</p>

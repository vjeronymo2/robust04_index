			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article based on foreign military press materials by </F> Colonel Yu. Fesenko, doctor of technical sciences, and Major S.  Zhuravlev, under rubric "Foreign Military Affairs": "Artillery  in the Persian Gulf"]    [Text] The Persian Gulf war has become the property  of history, but interest in features of combat operations in the  "Kuwait Desert" is not abating inasmuch as outlines of the "war  of new technologies," which will determine the development of  military affairs over the next decades to a significant extent,  showed up clearly here.    Despite repeated statements abroad about artillery's reduced  role in modern war, in the "Kuwait Desert" both sides  concentrated such an amount that it conceded nothing to the  overall strength level of groupings in a number of the largest  World War II operations such as the Balaton Operation of 3rd  Ukrainian Front. Even by Pentagon estimates, there was a small  quantitative superiority on the side of the international forces  directly in the combat operations zone. Technical outfitting was  another matter. The difference in it, like the difference in  conditions for performing combat missions, turned out to be much  more significant.    U.S. 155-mm M109A2 and 203.2-mm CF M110A2 self-propelled  [SP]  howitzers, M198 and TR 155-mm towed howitzers, and also MLRS  multiple-launch rocket systems made up the basis of  multinational forces [MNF] artillery. The majority of artillery  systems were self-propelled and over 80 percent were armored.  U.S. formations also had several models of the ATACMS tactical  missile system (based on the MLRS) equipped with a missile with  cluster warhead (100 submunitions with hollow  charge-fragmentation effect) with a launch range up to 200 km.    Artillery subunits and a considerable number of MNF  formations had automated artillery fire control systems and  digital data transmission equipment. AN/USQ-70 survey  instruments, the PLRS position finding, identification and data  transmission system, and a NAVSTAR space navigation system  ground receiver were used for topogeodetic support to combat  operations.    OH-58 reconnaissance helicopters and Pioneer drones were  employed to collect data on the enemy and terrain along with  radar and sound-ranging reconnaissance equipment as well as  artillery forward observers' opto-electronic equipment. In  addition, MNF formations were outfitted with mobile stations for  receiving data from the J-STARS radar system for aerial  reconnaissance of ground targets and control of strikes, which  gave a good account of itself when tracking the movement of  reserves and the maneuver of enemy artillery at ranges exceeding  capabilities of formation reconnaissance equipment. In necessary  instances artillery could obtain aerial and space reconnaissance  data in planning fires.    With respect to Iraq, it had only a limited number of SP  armored guns (French-made GCT and Austrian-made GHN-45 155-mm  howitzers, 2C3 152-mm howitzers and 2C1 122-mm howitzers). True,  this shortcoming was made up to a certain extent by the  considerable number of highly mobile MLRS--the BM-21 system and  the Brazilian Astros system. Mounted on the base of a vehicle  with good cross-country capability, Astros was equipped with  transport-launch containers loaded with projectiles of three  calibers--127, 180 and 300 mm--with a maximum range of fire of  30, 35 and 60 km respectively. It is noteworthy that the system  surpassed the U.S. MLRS in a number of its characteristics. A  large number of Iraqi artillery pieces were towed. Approximately  half consisted of M-46 130-mm guns, but South African 155-mm  guns were also present (G-5 howitzers, which western military  specialists placed among the best models of towed systems in the  world). The predominance of artillery pieces superior to the  majority of similar MNF systems in range of fire (Table 1)  permitted the Iraqis to locate firing positions at a  considerable distance (10-20 km) from the sides' line of contact  while retaining the capability to effectively pressure enemy  artillery deployed near the Kuwait border.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-004C-51A>           Table 1 - Comparative Range Assessment of MNF and Iraqi Artillery Systems </FIG>          At the same time, the great diversity of systems of calibers  in Iraqi artillery substantially complicated its combat  employment and logistic support. There also was a most negative  effect from the outfitting of Iraqi artillery with obsolete  communications equipment, the personnel's total inability to use  it under communications jamming conditions, and the poor state  of supply of automated command and control equipment, especially  at echelons above the artillery battalion. Finally, the shortage  of radar equipment and absence of aerial and space  reconnaissance assets cannot be discounted. In the opinion of  western military specialists, Iraqi artillerymen "proved  incapable of looking behind the nearest sandhills." The  conclusion from what has been said is quite obvious: as a whole,  Iraqi artillery was seriously inferior to MNF artillery in its  technical level.    Meanwhile, the Iraqi command's defensive concept gave  artillery a deciding role in destroying tanks and motorized  infantry. The concept of the defense envisaged drawing attackers  onto minefields of the "Saddam Hussein line," with their  subsequent destruction by massed, concentrated artillery fire  from indirect firing positions.    Thus, a serious miscalculation was contained in the very  sense of the defense; blindly following the chosen operating  tactics and passively waiting for an attack by enemy ground  troops could not, of course, bring success.    Let us briefly examine the conditions for mission  accomplishment by the sides' artillery. In deploying at firing  positions without engineer preparation within range of Iraqi  artillery, MNF artillerymen correctly feared its return fire.  Therefore at first they changed positions immediately after  executing fire missions, but after seeing that as a rule there  was no return fire, they subsequently gave up the fire-evasion  maneuver.    Division counterbattery fire systems deployed near the state  border with Kuwait and operated in a "waiting" mode. The fire of  individual batteries against command and control facilities and  other important targets on the "Saddam Hussein line" was used  widely to uncover the makeup of Iraqi artillery groupings. In  case of return fire, the counterbattery fire systems would open  up fire for effect.    In raiding operations one artillery battalion most often was  attached to battalion task forces for direct fire support and  one or two radars and an MLRS platoon were attached for  counterbattery activities. Their radios were in the same radio  net and, on deploying into combat formation, supported the  transmission of data on detected targets directly to the  latter's fire control station. This permitted significantly  reducing time for preparing return fire.    An MLRS platoon or howitzer artillery battalion usually is  used to engage one battery. The MLRS conducted fire for effect  with cluster projectiles with submunitions having hollow  charge-fragmentation effect, and artillery pieces fired  HE-fragmentation projectiles with impact or time fuze.    It must be said that the MNF command regarded Iraqi  artillery  as a serious threat to operations of its ground troops. It also  saw it as the primary means of employing chemical weapons if the  Iraqi leadership decided to use them, for Iraqi artillerymen  were well trained and it was of no small importance that they  had combat experience of eight years of war with Iran. Therefore  artillery at positions was included among very important  targets. It was engaged by fighter-bombers, A-6 and A-10 attack  aircraft, AH-64 Apache combat helicopters and, in the second  stage of Operation Desert Storm, by division counterbattery fire  systems and ship guns, including 406-mm main battery guns of the  battleships Wisconsin and Missouri.    Aviation employed precision and conventional bombs and  combat  helicopters employed the Hellfire ATGM. Attempts to use fuel-air  explosive munitions, which had given a good account of  themselves in engaging large targets, proved insufficiently  effective in combating small targets.    During Operation Desert Storm MNF artillery supported the  deployment of friendly ground troop formations in operational  tasking areas and their redeployment in accordance with the  concept of subsequent offensive operations, delivered fires on  the "Saddam Hussein line," conducted counterbattery fire,  demolished engineer works, carried out fire support to raiding  operations of battalion task forces, used fire to cover the  breaching of obstacles, and took part in repelling assaults by  Iraqi troops.    As a rule, separate artillery battalions were used to  perform  those missions. Observed targets were registered by battery and  battalion volleys. Depending on the size of targets, batteries  conducted fire for effect at several range settings and several  deflection settings (from one to three), expending two rounds  per gun per setting. Engagement was accomplished by brief fire  assaults usually not lasting longer than 10 minutes.    As the beginning of Operation Desert Sword approached, the  intensity of MNF artillery combat operations increased. Its  deployment was completed three days before the beginning of the  offensive. The most powerful fire assault was at this time. It  was conducted against Iraqi troop positions on 21 February 1991,  and over 10 battalions from the UK 1st Armored Division and a  number of U.S. units were used for it. In addition to 12 MLRS  launchers, 72 artillery pieces took part in the fire assault  from the British side. In the assessment of a command  representative, the weight of their volley was 50 tonnes, i.e.,  quadruple that of the 882 guns of the UK 9th Army in the Battle  of El Alamein in 1942.    Individual ATACMS missile system launchers were used to  engage targets in the depth (SAM and artillery positions,  command and control facilities, logistic installations and so  on). According to press data, a number of important targets were  engaged by single missile strikes.    Shifting to Iraqi artillery operations, it should be noted  that they were complicated also by the special desert  conditions, where each position and each vehicle was clearly  observed from the air with the contrast of daylight  illumination. The movement of military columns was visible at  great distances due to long dust plumes, which hampered the  daytime maneuver of artillery under conditions of absolute  superiority of MNF aviation. And at night it became easy prey to  aircraft employing bombs with thermal-imaging and infrared  homing heads.    Despite the significant extent of maskirovka [lit.  "camouflage," however, includes "concealment" and "deception"]  measures performed by Iraqi artillerymen, they did not always  achieve the goal inasmuch as firing positions were easily  detected from the air from the characteristic disposition of  guns in a line. One firing position was the absolute copy of  another, which facilitated their detection by aerial  reconnaissance.    As the epicenter of Operation Desert Storm shifted to troop  groupings disposed at the southern border of Kuwait, strikes  against Iraqi artillery became more and more fierce, as attested  by data of Table 2. While 55 Iraqi guns were knocked out during  the first two weeks of the operation, 385 were knocked out right  away during the last week. In other words, the intensity of  Iraqi artillery losses had increased almost 14 times by the end  of Operation Desert Storm.    Table 2 - Dynamics of Iraqi Artillery Losses by Days of Operation Desert Storm    Days of Operation                      14th          30th          38th   Amount of losses    Artillery pieces   55            1100          1485    As a percentage     2                  35            48      It is also evident from the table that by the beginning of  the ground troop offensive the MNF succeeded in knocking out  around half of Iraqi artillery through the comprehensive effect  of all weapons. This permitted bringing the artillery force  ratio to 2:1 in favor of the MNF. And the ratio turned out to be  even greater considering the fact that in attempting to preserve  the latest equipment the Iraqi command decided to withdraw G-5  and GHN-45 155-mm howitzers, the Astros MLRS and a number of  other artillery pieces to the rear ahead of time.    Significant losses also were inflicted on Iraqi artillery  personnel. Survivors ended up considerably demoralized.    Employment of artillery in the battle of Ras Khafji (on the  night of 28/29 January 1991), when several tank and motorized  infantry battalions of the 1st and 5th motorized infantry  divisions assaulted subunit positions of the U.S. 1st Marine  Division and Saudi troops, was the most indicative with respect  to the Iraqis. The assault was supported by the fire of several  artillery battalions and salvos of Astros MLRS. This probably  was the only case of mass employment of Iraqi artillery. Taking  advantage of the effect of surprise and the powerful fire  support, the attackers took Ras Khafji but were unable to  exploit the success achieved without reliable air cover and soon  were forced to withdraw to the initial positions.    It also should be noted that Iraqi artillery fire, whose  strong psychological effect is beyond doubt, was not very  effective since it was conducted not against specific targets,  but against presumed disposition areas of MNF subunits.    Thus, MNF artillery was able to perform fire missions  without  fear of enemy artillery return fire. The technical capabilities  for realizing the concept of "fire strike/firing position  change" ("shoot and scoot") were not called for.    Operation Desert Sword began with a powerful fire assault  against Iraqi troop positions, reserves, command and control  facilities and weapons; and with electronic jamming. The length  of fire preparation of the assault in regiments [and] of  formation operations varied. It did not exceed 20 minutes in  Marine divisions, but it was 45 minutes in the UK 4th Armored  Brigade. MNF artillery managed to inflict telling personnel and  equipment losses on the enemy during fire preparation of the  assault.    During the offensive MNF artillery supported the friendly  troop assault, supported the landing and operations of  helicopter and amphibious assault forces, supported operations  of attackers in taking Al Kuwait, took part in repelling  counterattacks by Iraqi troops and in consolidating captured  lines and objectives, and continued counterbattery activities.  In operating as part of an enveloping grouping, organic and  attached artillery (from three to seven artillery battalions) of  formations moved at the head of main body columns in readiness  for immediate deployment. An assault on Republican Guard  positions near Basra was preceded by a 30-minute fire  preparation, which facilitated MNF formations' capture of  crossings over the Euphrates River.    When individual Iraqi batteries and battalions attempted to  prevent the attackers' advance, they immediately came under  bombardment. Thus, one MLRS subunit and two 203.2-mm howitzer  battalions destroyed 97 out of 100 artillery pieces of one Iraqi  division with their fire, i.e., the fire of artillery and  especially of MLRS proved more effective than air strikes.    Persian Gulf war experience confirmed that under present  conditions the role of aerial reconnaissance operating in  support of the delivery of fires is growing considerably. The  possibility of using the J-STARS system for planning MNF field  artillery fire substantially increased the latter's capabilities  of engaging highly mobile, unobserved targets, and this  contributed to no small extent to its success in opposing Iraqi  artillery.    Division counterbattery fire systems demonstrated high  combat  capabilities dictated by the deep integration of reconnaissance  assets, command and control assets and weapons. Centralized use  of radars of the Firefinder radar system, which permitted  creating a radar field with overlapping of two to four times in  areas of enemy artillery firing positions and maintaining it for  the entire battle and which provided reliable detection of enemy  firing batteries, proved justified. Automated processing and  transmission of data to weapon fire control stations using the  TACFIRE automated command and control system (which has a high  degree of automation of fire preparation processes and short  volley duration) permitted substantially reducing systems'  reaction time to the detection of targets.    Iraqi artillery could win the fight with counterbattery fire  systems only with adequate technical outfitting, which it did  not have. That which fully justified itself in the Iran-Iraq  military conflict proved unsuitable in the "war of new  technologies." Slow-moving subunits of towed pieces became easy  prey for modern automated systems, which managed to open fire  for effect before the shells of detected enemy batteries burst.    The effectiveness of counterbattery fire systems was  determined to a considerable extent by good performance  characteristics of the MLRS. Along with a high degree of  automation, its important feature was canister loading. The use  of transport-launch canisters noticeably accelerated the loading  of launchers and permitted considerably increasing their  readiness for performing fire missions in the course of battle.    According to prisoners' statements, surprise MLRS salvos  were  a very effective means of engaging Iraqi towed artillery. This  was determined both by the high destructive capacity of hollow  charge-fragmentation submunitions and by the stunning effect of  salvo fire on the personnel's minds. With the missile warhead  filled with 644 (according to other data 688) submunitions, the  salvo of one combat vehicle numbered around 8,000 submunitions  dispersing in a 400x400 m area. According to assessments of  foreign military specialists, achieving a similar effect  required using 22 M109 155-mm howitzers for firing with an  expenditure of four rounds per piece. It was no accident that  MLRS salvos were nicknamed "steel rain" by the Iraqis. Over  10,000 missiles with cluster warheads and 30 ATACMS missiles  were expended during combat operations.    Along with this, it is impossible not to recognize that the  Iraqi artillery command underestimated the importance of  counterbattery fire in our time, had nothing with which to  counter U.S. tactics of conducting it, and did not promptly make  necessary changes in methods by which artillery performed fire  missions. It also must be recognized that successful operations  of artillery are impossible today without reliable air cover.  Persian Gulf war experience shows that its absence is fraught  with serious human and material losses.    Outfitting troops with NAVSTAR space navigation system  ground  equipment considerably simplified topogeodetic support to their  combat operations on terrain that was poor in contour points  (reference points). Its wide use accelerated the determination  of firing position coordinates during deployment in unsurveyed  areas. It played a role of no less importance in the course of  the multikilometer desert march by MNF troops in executing an  enveloping maneuver.    At the same time, the experience of employing the above  equipment in artillery combat operations showed that its  potential capabilities can be realized to the full extent if  each battery and the battalion staff are outfitted with two sets  of navigation system receivers at the very least. This will  enable determining not only rectangular coordinates and the  absolute height of artillery combat formation elements, but also  grid azimuths of directions of orientation, which will ensure  high autonomy of each artillery subunit, including when  realizing the "shoot and scoot" concept.    The M190A2 SP and M198 towed 155-mm howitzers earned a  differing evaluation. The former showed high mobility in the  course of marches of many hours over rugged and often difficult  terrain. Like other equipment on a wheeled base, the latter  demanded special attention. In addition to tire pressure  adjustment, ensuring its successful movement in the desert  required advance distribution of repair, overhaul and rebuilding  assets along movement routes, especially in places where it was  possible to expect a delay in column movement.    Nevertheless, U.S. military specialists admit that both the  M190A2 and M110A2 SP howitzers are considerably obsolete. The  former in particular was substantially inferior to the French  GCT 155-mm howitzer. This piece, mounted on the AMK-30 tank  chassis and with a barrel 40 calibers long, is capable of firing  rocket-assisted projectiles to ranges up to 30 km. It also  considerably surpasses the U.S. howitzer in rate of fire (thanks  to an automatic loader) and in the number of rounds in battle  stowage.    In the process of the howitzer's projected modernization, it  is planned to install the M2284 long-barrel gun, which will  permit increasing the maximum range of fire from 23.5 km to 30  km. It is also proposed to outfit the gun with a more advanced  fire control system, a more advanced night sight, new  communications equipment and a system for protection against  mass destruction weapons.    It is characteristic that as a result of the brevity of fire  preparation of the assault on axes of operations of some MNF  formations, Operation Desert Sword essentially began immediately  with fire support. This evidently is explained by the fact that  it was preceded by the lengthy period of the "electronic-fire"  phase of the war, during which considerable damage was done to  the enemy, command and control was disorganized, and his will to  resist was undermined.    In the course of fire support, the system of its  coordination  adopted in the U.S. Army gave a positive account of itself on  the whole. Fire support coordination elements at all command and  control echelons down to and including the infantry (tank)  company, artillery forward observers in platoons, and high  personnel training ensured close coordination of field artillery  with combined arms units and subunits in the course of the  offensive and timely requests for fire against newly detected  targets; and the presence of forward air controllers and shore  parties for spotting ship gunfire in the fire support  coordination teams of motorized infantry (tank) companies  ensured precise coordination of the fire of field artillery and  ship guns with air strikes.    In the course of combat operations, however, the  insufficient  technical outfitting of artillery forward observers and  imperfection of the accepted scheme for passing their fire  support requests were revealed. The increased range of effective  fire of combined arms subunit weapons, above all tanks and ATGM  systems, considerably increased their capabilities to destroy  observed targets, i.e., targets which previously were engaged  based on requests of artillery forward observers. The forward  observers themselves, moving in combat formations of motorized  infantry platoons, were not always able to be disposed in places  where a special threat to combined arms subunits was possible.  At the same time the number and importance of weapons taking  part in close combat but unobserved from ground observation  posts (mortars, FOG ATGM systems and so on) sharply increased.  Consequently, in the course of combat operations a contradiction  was revealed between the increased number of targets determining  the course and outcome of close combat and the capabilities of  artillery forward observers to detect them.    In the opinion of foreign military specialists, its solution  should be sought on the one hand along paths of improving the  outfitting of artillery forward observers, particularly the  creation of devices with variable observation height and  disposed on telescopic masts (or underground platforms), and on  the other hand in a change in the procedure for passing fire  support requests from artillery forward observers. In a number  of cases in the course of Operation Desert Sword the requests  did not go directly to weapon fire control stations or to  company fire support coordination teams as required by U.S.  Field Manual FM 6-20, but to fire support coordination officers  in battalions. This enabled determining the priority of requests  based on interests not of the platoon (company), but of the  battalion as a whole, and using the entire arsenal of weapons at  its commander's disposal for fulfilling them. The latter  evidently is the main thing inasmuch as it reflects a general  trend manifested during the Persian Gulf war--using the maximum  number of weapons for performing fire delivery missions that  arise suddenly. This permits not only performing unscheduled  missions in the shortest time and thereby freeing up weapons  faster for performing other fire missions, but also making  maximum use of the psychological effect of concentrated fire on  personnel.    It also is impossible to ignore the conclusion drawn by  western specialists based on a generalization of artillery  combat employment in the Persian Gulf. Despite the fact that  formation commanders had a considerable amount of general  support assets, which if necessary were capable of having a  decisive effect on the course of combat operations, commanders  of subunits participating in the battle must have a sufficient  amount of artillery for direct fire support. Only this gives  them necessary tactical mobility and independence in performing  combat missions.    Consequently, the serious results achieved by MNF aviation  during Operation Desert Storm did not shake the joint command's  views on the role and importance of artillery in performing  missions of direct fire support to troop combat operations.    Meanwhile, as shown by experience of MNF artillery combat  operations, there was nothing new that appeared in their  organization and conduct which would have differed substantially  from known provisions of field manuals of countries which  participated in the Persian Gulf war. Moreover, in the course of  combat operations numerous deviations were allowed from demands  of field manuals: firing subunits conducted fire from one and  the same firing positions for a long time, artillery pieces at  positions were disposed in the open and not camouflaged, field  artillery radars as a rule operated in a continuous mode and so  on. With an adequate enemy reaction, such violations could have  led to serious personnel and equipment losses.    COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 8 1993</p>

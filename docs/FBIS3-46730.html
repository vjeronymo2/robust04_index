It notes:    Let us strive harder and advance toward a new victory with  revolutionary optimism -- this is an important militant slogan  which our party and people must hold high now.    The conviction of victory and revolutionary optimism are our  invincible ideological and spiritual weapon in the general march  of socialism at the present time.    What is important in winning a new victory, full of  revolutionary optimism, is that the entire people have the  unshakable will and faith that they will surely win when they  advance under the leadership of our party.    The mental support for our people is Comrade Kim Chong-il.    All the party members and other working people must always  keep in mind the conviction of victory and the future of the  revolution, deeply understanding his greatness.    Loudly singing the song "We Will Win Because You Are Leading  Us," we must have a strong will, fearing no difficulty,  adversity and formidable enemy, under the guidance of the dear  leader.    We must also be firmly convinced of the invincibility of the  cause of Korean-style socialism which is vigorously advancing  under the banner of the great chuche idea.    If our officials and working people are to live and struggle  with revolutionary optimism, they must learn from the  ideological and spiritual world of Comrade Yi In-mo who  steadfastly defended the principle as a revolutionary, convinced  of the victory of our revolutionary cause.</p>

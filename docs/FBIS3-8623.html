			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After three days of very intensive talks and work on  the coordination of positions, the military representatives of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government and the Croatian Defense  Council [HVO], Generals Rasim Delic and Ante Roso, signed a  document on accepting certain principles for the implementation  of military agreements as an obligation stemming from the  general agreement in Washington. The document was signed at the  Villa Dalmacija in Split in the presence of U.S.  mediator-ambassador Jack Galvin. By signing the document, the  military leaders of the Croat and Muslim sides in  Bosnia-Herzegovina accepted and strongly upheld the earlier  peace agreement concluded through UNPROFOR's [UN Protection  Forces] mediation and accepted certain tasks concerning the  organization of the federal army of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The signing of this document by the military delegations of  the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army was described by U.S.  mediator Jack Galvin as historic. Galvin paid tribute to both  sides for their support and readiness to implement the document  in its entirety. The cease-fire process, as U.S. mediator Galvin  said in a statement for the public, has taken off successfully  in the field and is even being implemented beyond all  expectations. This initial step and today's signing of the  document by the military commanders of the HVO and the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army are also important because they prove to  the United States that the agreement signed in Washington was  something acceptable to both sides.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADVENTURE TRAVEL: DIVING TRIP NETS UNDERWATER BOUNTY;  </P> <P> DIVE: FULL-SCALE UNDERWATER VACATION  </P> <P> Gauguin could have painted the colorful picture that came into focus through  the faceplate of my snorkeling mask in these aquamarine waters of the South  Pacific.  </P> <P> A coral sculpture shaped like the head of a tiki god had a golden glow. Small  fish created a rainbow of colors around it.  </P> <P> My wife and I were snorkeling in the lagoon shaped by the atoll of Rangiroa in  the Tuoamotu archipelago about 200 miles northeast of Tahiti, where Gauguin  arrived from Paris near the end of the 19th Century to begin his greatest  paintings.  </P> <P> The lagoon is a sea within a sea. It could contain the entire island of Tahiti  within its stretch of 42 miles by 16 miles, surrounded by the rim of Rangiroa  atoll that rises with its lush tropical foliage and two Polynesian villages  above the submerged crater of an ancient volcano.  </P> <P> Two passes through the rim, with tidal currents between the open sea and the  lagoon, help to make these waters one of the great destinations on this planet  for the adventurous traveler who enjoys snorkeling and diving.  </P> <P> All of the Tuamotus were once barrier reefs that surrounded volcanic islands.  As eons passed, the inner islands subsided, leaving only the rims and coral  reefs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Underwater Life  </P> <P> Here on Rangiroa, in the heart of the world's largest collection of coral  atolls, you can view a fabulous variety of underwater life by inflating your  life vest and riding the currents to and from the open sea.  </P> <P> This adventure has to be carefully coordinated with a pickup by the inflatable  boat or outrigger canoe that provides your base for snorkeling or diving near  the reefs.  </P> <P> If you are renting your own outrigger or small boat, check in advance for the  timing of the current so that you don't end up too far out to sea or into the  lagoon when the tide changes. This flushing of the tidal currents keeps the  aquamarine waters of the lagoon crystal clear.  </P> <P> We arrived in the Rangiroa lagoon aboard the Wind Song sail cruiser with 120  adventure-minded fellow passengers, including 19 certified scuba divers and at  least twice that many snorkelers.  </P> <P> Capt. Dag Dvergastein, our Norwegian skipper, and the pilot brought the Wind  Song between the reefs of the tidal pass into the lagoon.  </P> <P> From the anchorage, slipping or jumping over the rim of the inflatable took us  instantly into a coral underworld with more fish than we could possibly  identify or name.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diving Excursions  </P> <P> If you arrive in the lagoon with your own sailboat, or aboard the  passenger-carrying freighter or one of the smaller cargo carriers serving the  islands of French Polynesia, you can arrange for snorkeling and diving  excursions from the villages of Taputa and Avatora.  </P> <P> Scuba diving centers are based at Kia Ora Village Hotel across the pass from  Taputa, and at the Raie Manta Club in Avatora.  </P> <P> There are also daily flights between Tahiti-Faaa Airport and Rangiroa. The  46-passenger Air Tahiti planes make the flight in about an hour. One-way fare  is about $100 U.S.  </P> <P> All of Rangiroa has scarcely 1,400 inhabitants, most of them in or around the  two villages.  </P> <P> For longer stays than a Wind Song or cargo vessel stopover, there are three  hotels and nine pensions and private homes with accommodations for guests.  </P> <P> Kia Ora Village, the largest of the hotel complexes, has only 25 thatched-roof  bungalows in a coconut grove beside the beach. Amenities include a restaurant  and bar with tables on the beach-front deck, where guests or visitors from the  beach and the reefs can relax after snorkeling and diving.  </P> <P> When we had finished our underwater adventure along the reef, we tendered from  the anchored Wind Song to the Kia Ora and went snorkeling from the beach into  another coral world alive with multicolored fish. Some of them came close  enough to look right into our faceplates.  </P> <P> Rates for a twosome at a Kia Ora Village beach bungalow are about $270 U.S. a  night, including breakfast and dinner. Among free activities for guests are  snorkeling, sailing, bicycling, windsurfing and fishing. One of the optional  activities is scuba diving with a qualified instructor.  </P> <P> A plaque at the Kia Ora reads: "Welcome to Kia Ora Village -- first hotel of  the atolls, founded in 1972 by three lovers of the Tuamotu Islands -- Serge  Arnoux, Robin Angely and Laris Kindynis. . . ."  </P> <P> Carnoux and Angely had wandered to the Tuamotus from France; Kindynis from  Greece.  </P> <P> Pension and private home accommodations start at about $30.

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / DTI opens war on red tape MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has launched a sweeping review of every aspect of government impact on business. He has asked every Whitehall department to provide details of all the regulations for which it is responsible that affect business, including those from the European Commission and from local government. The information is due by the end of next month. The aim of Mr Heseltine's 'baseline survey' is that everything on the list should be considered for abolition or simplification, and that the survey will form a mechanism for continuous review. The DTI is conscious that the drive for deregulation is likely to work only if it is accompanied by continuing ministerial pressure. Mr Neil Hamilton, the junior industry minister, has started a series of meetings with ministers in other departments to remind them that the initiative is strongly supported not only by Mr Heseltine but also by Mr John Major, who highlighted it in his speech to the Tory party conference. The department has also won the first round of a battle over the government's estimate of the cost to industry of complying with legislation. Ministers have agreed to explore whether compliance-cost assessments can be published at the same time as the legislation to which they relate. At present the assessments trail so far behind that they have scarcely any impact on policy or legislation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The leadership of the Confederation of Independent  Trade Unions in Bulgaria [KNSB] considers yesterday's national  warning strike a success. In practice, it achieved all its  planned aims and created the conditions for the success of the  upcoming general strike on 17 May. KNSB President Professor  Krustyu Petkov declared this at a news conference today.    A few hours later, the KNSB Executive Committee decided at a  meeting to instruct the KNSB National Strike Committee to start  preparing for the general strike tomorrow. The committee also  decided to support the Union of Democratic Forces' [SDS]  proposal for updating the national budget. The KNSB Executive  Committee appeals to the parliamentary groups of the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP], Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS], Union  of Democratic Forces [SDS], and other members of the dynamic  majority not to cast their votes against the cabinet retaining  its present membership.    The KNSB leadership has unfortunately established that the  government ignored the strike and encouraged repressive actions  aimed at threatening the strikers and trade union leaders.  Following his visit to Dupnitsa today with General Kosta  Bogatsevski [chief secretary of Interior Ministry], Professor  Krustyu Petkov stated that the KNSB has no claims in connection  with the action taken by the local police there, but believes  that the police were ordered to counteract the strike action  there and that the order came from people above Interior  Minister Viktor Mikhaylov.    The actions of the KNSB may bring the communists to power,  Dr. Konstantin Trenchev, president of the Podkrepa Labor  Confederation, declared at a news conference today. Podkrepa's  view that the government is procommunist and is promoting active  recommunization remains unchanged. According to Trenchev, the  solution is to hold elections. At the moment, Podkrepa is  waiting to see how the situation develops because no further  mistakes can be allowed to occur, Dr. Trenchev said. However,  the confederation's position might change to an aggressive  stance if the Podkrepa Confederative Council decides so at its  meeting on 9-10 May in Pazardzhik.</p>

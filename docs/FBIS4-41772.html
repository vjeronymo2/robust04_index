			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Aleksandr Lyushkevich for </F> TASS]    [Text] Minsk 27 June TASS -- According to Belarusian  presidential candidate Aleksandr Lukashenko, "all the generals  and all the leaders of state bodies of power will be removed  within 24 hours" if he becomes president.    However, Lukashenko called rumors that he wanted to kick out  the whole state apparatus if he is elected groundless. "85 per  cent of government employees and law enforcement personnel --  the police, the KGB, the Interior Ministry, the procurator's  office -- are respectable and honest people," he announced at a  press conference in Minsk on Monday.    With the exception of the top military and civilian brass,  Lukashenko and his team are "ready to work and cooperate" with  government employees. That statement also concerns the  republic's industrial managers, whose enterprises will be given  up to January 1, 1995 to "function normally." If they are not  capable of meeting that deadline, "the heads will be fired,"  Lukashenko explained.    The Belarusian candidate refused to exclude the possibility  that he would invite one of the members of the current  government to fill the prime minister's seat, if he is elected.</p>

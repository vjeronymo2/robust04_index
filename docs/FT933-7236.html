			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Paying for universities BRITAIN'S university vice-chancellors should be congratulated for grasping a political nettle. Their report, which last week outlined four 'painless' methods for students to pay towards their tuition, at last forces the government to confront an issue which has caused it deep embarrassment in the past. But the need for a debate over higher education goes further than funding. University expansion - which has seen the numbers in higher education rise by 46 per cent in four years, despite a decline in the number of 18-year-olds - has been the most important, undiscussed policy change of the last four years. Neither policymakers nor educationalists seem to have given any thought to the kind of higher education system they wish to emerge. But such a vast expansion will inevitably bring with it greater diversity of provision. With one in four, rather than one in seven, of the relevant age group now involved, a similar diversity in quality also seems inevitable. The mass systems of France and the US offer examples which the UK could follow. Should the UK move towards a norm where most students go to their local university, with only a gifted elite travelling to acknowledged centres of excellence? Alternatively, those universities with the strongest international research reputations could be allowed to concentrate on research by becoming graduate-only. Regional universities would then be freed to put most of their resources into teaching. Fair and efficient Either course should allow a significant improvement in education for those students who previously would have left education altogether at 18, while leaving the best features of higher education unblemished. Access to the true elite institutions, at the graduate level, might become more open than it is now. One likely consequence of such a system is that different universities would set different fees, which would have to be paid by students. This may sound anti-egalitarian, but few complain about the American system, where the most able graduates of excellent and cheap state universities can move on to Ivy League law schools. None of these choices will be saleable unless the method of payment is fair and efficient. That means adopting the income-contingent loans used in three of the vice-chancellors' four proposed new methods of funding. The 'graduate tax' which would ask all graduates to pay a higher rate of income tax for their entire working lives, is unwieldy and unlikely to be politically acceptable. It can safely be ignored. Middle-class parents Under an income-contingent loan, students would be charged a fee, which would be paid for them at point of entry by the state. They would repay the loan, which would be at a subsidised rate of interest, by paying a higher rate of national insurance or income tax, once they had graduated. The government may feel nervous about making students pay for tuition. After all, Sir Keith Joseph's proposals for tuition fees in 1984 were scuppered by Conservative backbenchers in an alliance with middle-class parents. However, income-contingent loans differ from the Joseph scheme in several vital respects. First, parents would feel less threatened, because students would not be assessed on the basis of their parents' income before they matriculate. Repayments would not need to be made until the student had started earning. Second, loan repayments would be contingent on income. Graduates would not therefore be deterred from opting for a low-paid career. Those who do so would be allowed to take longer over making their repayments. Third, by using the tax system these loans would be simple and cheap to administer. This compares favourably with the Joseph tuition fees and with the current loans for student maintenance, which the Student Loans Company, rather than the Inland Revenue, must enforce. Once the government has given the universities the help they need by establishing income-contingent loans, it should decide what role it wants the expanded higher education system to play. That question is more difficult, but its importance is profound.</p>

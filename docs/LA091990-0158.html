			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BILLS DROP KINNEBREW, ADD TUTEN  </P> <P> The Buffalo Bills today waived fullback Larry Kinnebrew, their second-leading  rusher last year, and re-signed punter Rick Tuten to shore up their kicking  game.  </P> <P> Tuten was released at the end of training camp when the team decided to go with  rookie punter John Nies.  </P> <P> But after Nies averaged 34.8 yards on five punts in Sunday's 30-7 loss at  Miami, Coach Marv Levy announced he was giving serious thought to making a  change at the position.  </P> <P> Levy was not immediately available to explain why the team decided to make room  for Tuten by releasing Kinnebrew, rather than Nies.  </P> <P> Kinnebrew rushed for 533 yards on 131 carries last year.  </P></p>

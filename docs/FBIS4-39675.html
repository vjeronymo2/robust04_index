			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksey Trotsenko for </F> TASS]    [Excerpts] Kiev 9 June TASS -- Ukraine and North Korea  signed a consular convention and several other inter-state  agreements on Wednesday [8 June].    North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam who is on an  official visit in Ukraine and his Ukrainian counterpart Anatoliy  Zlenko also signed a protocol on consultations between the  Ukrainian and North Korean foreign ministries.    After the signing ceremony Kim Yong-nam met with journalists  to answer their questions.    He said that his talks with Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk, Deputy Parliamentary Chairman Aleksandr Tkachenko and  Foreign Minister Zlenko helped him understand better the  processes going on in Ukraine.    Speaking about the nuclear problem, the minister stressed  that it is "artificial. It was created by certain circles in  the U.S. and IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) in order  to strangle socialism in the country." "The nuclear crisis on  the peninsular must be solved by the United States and North  Korea through negotiations," he said. [passage omitted]    He emphasised that the peaceful settlement of the conflict  will largely depend on the successful outcome of the talks with  the United Nations and IAEA. He expressed regret that the first  two rounds of talks did not bring the desired results and noted  that North Korea pins hopes on the third round. [passage omitted]    Asked about what nuclear weapons North Korea could afford  today, Kim Yong-nam replied that "we have no any nuclear  weapons. Moreover, we have neither possibilities, nor equipment,  nor funds to make them."    Speaking about prospects for reunification with South Korea,  the minister said that only peaceful reunification is possible,  without interference of other countries. The two countries  should form a confederation, while preserving their systems and  governments, he said.</p>

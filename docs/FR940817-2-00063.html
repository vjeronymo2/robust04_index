			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to emissions data, EPA also reviews data on fuel composition and specifications, both to fully characterize a proposed fuel, and to determine whether that fuel would cause or contribute to a failure of vehicles to comply with their emission standards. Such a failure often can be predicted from characterization data. For example, volatility specifications of the fuel could demonstrate a tendency for high evaporative emissions. Similarly, data on materials compatibility could show potential failure of fuel systems, emission related parts, and/or emission control parts from use of the fuel. Such failures could result in greater emissions. Likewise, fuel characteristics that could cause significant driveability problems could result in tampering with emission controls and, thus, increased emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One issue raised previously in the context of Ethyl's present application was whether Ethyl was required to show that MMT will not cause or contribute to noncompliance with emission standards by vehicles certified to ``future'' emission standards (i.e., 1994 model year standards, which were not in effect at the time of the waiver application), as well as vehicles certified to ``current'' standards (i.e., standards in effect at the time of the waiver application). Ethyl believes that the statute only requires it to establish that MMT will not cause or contribute to the failure of vehicles to meet current emission standards. For the reasons outlined in the Agency's January 1992 waiver decision, EPA disagrees with this reading of the statute and continues to believe that it is appropriate to consider the effects of an additive on vehicles' ability to meet more stringent future standards under circumstances similar to these. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  (See 57 FR 2537&hyph;8 January 22, 1992.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA also considered effects on compliance with future standards in a previous MMT decision.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 43 FR 41424 (September 18, 1978), In Re Application for MMT Waiver. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the past, EPA has analyzed both instantaneous emission effects and durability effects using statistical tests to determine if the fuel additive will cause a ``significant'' number of vehicles to fail emissions tests. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  Generally speaking, these tests have focused on the portion of the fleet that will actually fail emission standards as a result of using the fuel or additive. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  Thus, the tests used to date by the Agency primarily consider only the ``cause'' language in the statute and do not consider the portion of the statute which requires that the applicant must also show that the fuel or additive will not ``contribute'' to the non-compliance of vehicles with emission standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a detailed description of the statistical tests which have been used in the past for instantaneous effects see ``Decision Document'', Texas Methanol Waiver Decision, U.S. EPA Air Docket Number EN&hyph;87&hyph;06, and for those used for durability effects, see 43 FR 41426. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In fact the primary criteria allows for the failure of some portion of the fleet as a result of use of the fuel or additive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency believes that its present statistical tests and criteria do not give adequate weight to the requirement in Section 211(f)(4) that an applicant demonstrate that a fuel will not ``contribute'' to an emission standard failure. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  This is of particular significance in light of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990, which evidence a strong Congressional concern that more needs to be done to ensure that people are not exposed to unhealthy levels of airborne pollution. EPA is presently reviewing alternative criteria and statistical methodologies for determining whether use of a fuel or fuel additive will ``cause or contribute'' to emission exceedances. The Agency expects to initiate a rulemaking in the near future which will propose more appropriate criteria and statistical methodologies for reviewing waiver applications and will afford formal notice to future applicants of the Agency's intention to adopt revised criteria and methodologies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In fact, the Agency raised questions about the appropriateness of these previously used approaches in its original decision on Ethyl's 1991 MMT waiver application.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 57 FR 2535, 2537 and 2538 (January 22, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As explained below, the Agency has concluded that it would not be appropriate to utilize new criteria and statistical tests concerning which Ethyl received no prior notice in evaluating Ethyl's application. However, in the event that Ethyl reapplies in the future for a section 211(f)(4) waiver to allow the use of MMT or any other additive, that application will be evaluated in accordance with any new fuel waiver criteria in effect at that time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Discretionary Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in part II of this decision, above, the Agency believes that the use of the term ``may'' in Section 211(f)(4) of the Act affords the Administrator broad discretion to consider other factors in deciding whether to grant a waiver, once a waiver applicant has demonstrated that a fuel or fuel additive will not cause or contribute to an emission standard failure. This construction of section 211(f)(4) is also consistent with the other provisions of and the general purposes underlying the Clean Air Act. Although the Administrator has not relied on this discretionary authority to deny a waiver in the past, certain general principles should guide the Administrator's exercise of such authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the discretion of the Administrator to consider other factors in making a waiver decision is broad, it is not unfettered. To assure that any decision based on factors other than emission standard failures is not arbitrary and is based on a proper record, the applicant and other interested persons should be afforded proper notice of any additional factors to be considered by the Administrator and an opportunity to comment or submit information concerning those factors. Any decision based on the discretionary authority of the Administrator to consider other factors should include an explanation of the factors which were considered and the relation of those factors to the decision. Moreover, any policy adopted as part of a decision to deny a waiver on a discretionary basis should be applied consistently to all similarly situated applicants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protection of the public health is a major goal of both the Clean Air Act in general and the section 211 fuels provisions in particular. Accordingly, the Agency believes that when a waiver is sought for a fuel or fuel additive and there are unresolved concerns regarding the potential impact of that fuel or fuel additive on public health, potential health effects can and should be examined as part of the waiver process. As part of this examination of the potential health effects of a fuel or additive, the Agency should review any relevant studies or analyses of which it is aware or which are brought to its attention by the waiver applicant or by commenters on the waiver application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>SUMMARY                               The new cabinet named on 20 January after several delays as well  as repeated and apparently difficult talks between President  Boris Yeltsin and Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin is less reformist  than the pre-election cabinet, with radical reformers Yegor  Gaydar and Boris Fedorov gone and more conservative leaders-  -Chernomyrdin, First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets, and Deputy  Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha--now running the show.  Despite  signs that Sergey Shakhray and Aleksandr Shokhin would be purged  for their attacks on Gaydar's Russia's Choice party during the  election, they remained in the cabinet, at least as ministers,  while several Russia's Choice leaders left.  The new cabinet  appears to be a compromise between Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin and  only a temporary fix since some posts--such as first deputy  premier and finance minister--remain vacant and no one was added  to the cabinet to replace those who were dropped.                           END SUMMARY     The shift toward conservatism evident in the new cabinet is a  considerable departure from initial post-election assurances by  Yeltsin, Gaydar, and apparently even Chernomyrdin to stay on a  reformist course.  Yeltsin set the reorganization in motion with  a 23 December edict ordering Chernomyrdin to prepare a plan to  revamp and reduce the cabinet (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 28 December  1993) and a 10 January edict reducing the number of deputy  premiers, reorganizing ministries, and apparently dropping state  committees from the cabinet (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 January)--see  background section.  With the reduction of posts, it was likely  that some reformers might be dropped from the cabinet, but in his  first post-election news conference Yeltsin stated that "Gaydar  stays" and "so does the policy that he is pursuing" (Ostankino  TV, 22 December 1993).  On 13 January Yeltsin personally ensured  that prominent reformer Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State  Committee for Managing State Property, would remain in the  cabinet by reappointing him deputy premier by presidential edict  (ITAR-TASS, Russian TV, 13 January).  Gaydar himself stated that  he would not resign as long as he "felt we are pursuing a  sensible course" and cited Chernomyrdin's assurances that there  would be no revision of the government's program (Interfax, 29  December 1993).     Despite this, Gaydar on 16 January sent Yeltsin a letter of  resignation as first deputy premier and minister of the economy,  complaining that decisions harming reform had been recently  adopted over his objections (Interfax, 16 January).  This was  followed by Deputy Premier and Finance Minister Fedorov's 17  January ultimatum that he would not accept reappointment unless  Deputy Premier Zaveryukha and Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko,  whom he accused of opposing reform, were removed (Interfax, 17  January)  (See Box).     Gaydar's resignation and Fedorov's ultimatum threw plans to  announce a new cabinet into turmoil.  Yeltsin began urgent talks  with Chernomyrdin, and on 18 January they spent six hours  discussing the makeup of the cabinet (Radio Mayak, 18 January).  Chernomyrdin held to his favorites, Soskovets and Zaveryukha, and  would not concede to Fedorov's demands (Izvestiya, 21 January),  although he did not object publicly to Yeltsin's preemptive  reappointment of Chubays.  But, as Shokhin publicly stated, the  president and premier "have different views" on accepting  Fedorov's demands (Interfax, 20 January).  Although the president  has final power over cabinet appointments, (See Note) he  apparently did not or could not persuade Chernomyrdin to add more  reformers or meet Fedorov's demands.  The list of cabinet  appointments announced on 20 January failed to include the key  posts of first deputy premier and finance minister and appeared  to leave some other posts unfilled also.     (Note) According to the new constitution, he appoints deputy  premiers and ministers "on the proposal" of the premier  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 December 1993).     Some Reformers Remain     Without Gaydar and Fedorov, the cabinet loses the two strongest  voices for economic reform and tight money, but some reformers  still remain.  Radical reformers Chubays (deputy premier and  chairman of the State Committee for Managing State Property),  Viktor Khlystun (agriculture minister), and Russia's Choice  leader Andrey Kozyrev (foreign minister) remain, while Shakhray  and Shokhin, who have been pushing more moderate reform, gave up  their posts as deputy premiers but retained ministerial posts,  Shakhray as minister for affairs of nationalities and regional  policy and Shokhin as minister of the economy.  Moreover, Chubays  and Kozyrev have publicly declared that the new cabinet does not  necessarily spell the end of reforms (Russian TV, 18 January;  Interfax, 24 January).     The retention of Shakhray and Shokhin presumably reflects  Chernomyrdin's desires more than Yeltsin's.  Shakhray and Shokhin  split with Gaydar, formed the Party of Russian Unity and Accord  (PRES) to run against Gaydar's Russia's Choice during the  election, and began criticizing Gaydar for pushing overly radical  reform.  PRES leaders trumpeted their support for and closeness  to Chernomyrdin during the election.  After the election Yeltsin  dismissed PRES leaders Aleksandr Kotenkov (as State-Legal  Administration head) and Sergey Stankevich (as councillor), and  it appeared that he would drop Shakhray and Shokhin from the  cabinet in displeasure at their splitting his reform team and  contributing to the reformers' election defeat.  Interfax on 31  December 1993, for example, reported that the removal of Shakhray  and Shokhin was "virtually settled."  But instead, Russia's  Choice leaders Gaydar, Fedorov, Vladimir Shumeyko (who left as  first deputy premier after being elected Federation Council  chairman), and Ella Pamfilova (who resigned as minister after  Gaydar, Russian TV, 16 January) have left the cabinet, while the  PRES leaders remained.     Zaveryukha's retention as deputy premier for agriculture  presumably similarly reflects Chernomyrdin's support and also the  strength demonstrated by Zaveryukha's Agrarian Party in the  election and in the newly organized Duma, which elected Agrarian  leader Ivan Rybkin speaker.  Zaveryukha has been at odds with  Gaydar and Fedorov over monetary policy, attacking them for  blocking sufficient funds for agriculture.  Fedorov made  Zaveryukha's removal a condition for accepting reappointment as  finance minister, arguing that Zaveryukha was resisting reform  (Interfax, 17 January).     Implications     The cabinet announced by Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin is becoming  more of a coalition, with PRES and Agrarian leaders now having  equal weight with Russia's Choice leaders.  However, its current  composition is apparently only a temporary fix as various  factions jockey for position, and decisions still have to be  reached on the key posts of first deputy premier and finance  minister.  Chernomyrdin, strengthened by anti-reform election  returns, will probably pursue a more moderate reform course,  balancing reforms and anti-inflationary measures against demands  supported by Soskovets and Zaveryukha to protect industry and  agriculture.              Background on the Cabinet Restructuring     Yeltsin's 10 January edict cut the number of first deputy  premiers from three to two and deputy premiers from six to two,  expanded the number of ministries from 20 (two others--for press  and information and for security--had been abolished on 21 and 22  December) to 23, and cut the number of state committees from over  a dozen to nine.  The edict listed 67 ministries, state  committees, committees, services, agencies, departments, and  inspections, but did not indicate which have cabinet status  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 January).  A 30 September 1992 Yeltsin  edict had clearly specified that ministers and state committee  chairmen belong to the cabinet but heads of committees, services,  and other agencies do not (Vedomosti Syezda Narodnykh Deputatov  Rossiyskoy Federatsii i Verkhnovnogo Soveta Rossiyskoy  Federatsii, 15 October 1992).  The new constitution, however,  declares that the cabinet consists of the premier, deputy  premiers, and ministers, with no mention of state committees  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 December 1993).     Despite the constitution's definition, Yeltsin subsequently gave  Nikolay Golushko, head of the new Federal Counterintelligence  Service, the rank of minister (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 24 December  1993) and the new Federal Border Service the status of a ministry  (ITAR-TASS, 30 December 1993), and despite his own edict's  limitation of deputy premiers to two, three were appointed, as  Yeltsin insisted on Chubays' reappointment.  The 10 January  edict's lack of clarity over exactly who is in the cabinet and  who is not is producing confusion, according to commentator  Eduard Gonzalez in the 13 January Izvestiya.  He noted, for  example, that State Committee for Managing State Property  Chairman Chubays is still deputy premier but his committee is now  apparently outside the cabinet.  Gonzalez concluded that the  edict is ambiguous and "everyone can, if he wishes, interpret  provisions of the edict to his own satisfaction."     While the structure of ministries and other bodies is clear from  the 10 January edict, the precise membership of the cabinet is  not, and though the appointment of several cabinet members was  announced on 20 January, most have not been formally reappointed.  In fact, Yeltsin's 20 January edict was titled "The First  Changes" in the makeup of the cabinet (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 22  January).  Some additional ministers--such as Yuriy Kalmykov and  Viktor Danilov-Danilyan--were clearly visible in television shots  of the first post-shakeup cabinet meeting on 21 January,  indicating that they remain in the cabinet.  But the agencies and  individuals in the cabinet are still only partially clear as of  24 January.

Box                        Fedorov's Resignation     Although Fedorov announced his resignation on 17 January and  Yeltsin's 20 January edict on cabinet changes dropped him as  deputy premier (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 22 January), Fedorov's status  was not finally resolved until 26 January.  In addition to the 18  January meeting, Yeltsin held another session with Chernomyrdin  on 24 January, which news reports said was to discuss the  cabinet's makeup (Interfax, Russian TV, 24 January).  Chernomyrdin afterward denied they had discussed the cabinet  (Radio Rossii, 24 January) but indicated Fedorov's status was  still up in the air, saying that Fedorov's resignation had not  been accepted, that Fedorov still continued to hold his post "for  the time being," and that it was up to Yeltsin to decide on  Fedorov (Russian TV, ITAR-TASS, 24 January).  According to  Chernomyrdin (Radio Rossii, 24 January), Fedorov must decide  whether to join the cabinet--although presumably only as finance  minister and without attaining his demand for the removal of  Zaveryukha and Gerashchenko.  In the meantime Fedorov had  escalated his demands, insisting now that the finance minister  must have the status of first deputy premier, not just deputy  premier (Russian TV, Interfax, 24 January), apparently hoping to  gain a stronger position to use in fighting off inflationary  cabinet decisions.  Finally on 26 January Yeltsin met with  Fedorov and accepted his resignation after Fedorov declined to  join the cabinet unless his conditions were met (Ostankino TV,  ITAR-TASS, 26 January).

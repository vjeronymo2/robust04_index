			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARAGUAY'S EL TIGRE: RODRIGUEZ PROVES WILY IN THE WAYS OF POWER  </P> <P> Through much of the long night of combat that finally drove him from power,  President Alfredo Stroessner apparently believed that his second in command,  Gen. Andres Rodriguez, was also under siege by the rebel troops.  </P> <P> Only just before he surrendered did Stroessner at last accept that he was  undone not by junior officers but by Rodriguez himself, according to one  officer's account.  </P> <P> Indeed, the coup leader had proved his loyalty to Stroessner over a period of  years and had been well rewarded for doing so, becoming one of Paraguay's  richest men.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Was Unlikely Coup Target  </P> <P> Stroessner, who had been considered among the least likely coup targets in  Latin America, is suddenly in exile in Brazil. Rodriguez, whose affable,  gentlemanly manner belies a wily grasp of the ways of power, demonstrated why  his soldiers call him el tigre, the tiger.  </P> <P> Rodriguez was sworn in as provisional president a few hours after the shooting  stopped on Feb. 3 and has since made a series of bold promises in a country  ruled by military strongmen much of the time since its independence from Spain  in 1811. His pledges include multiparty democracy, human rights and the rule of  law. So far, he has earned considerable civilian and foreign good will.  </P> <P> The 65-year-old general, 11 years younger than Stroessner, comes to power in a  world far different from that of Stroessner's after his 1954 coup. Paraguay is  now surrounded by democratically ruled neighbors urging Rodriguez to make  changes.  </P> <P> The United States, more worried in the 1950s about finding anti-communist  allies, now says it seeks to entrench democracy as a bulwark against communism.  Moreover, Washington is obsessed with the narcotics trade and is well aware of  news reports linking Rodriguez to drugs moving through Paraguay. Rodriguez  calls the reports lies planted by his enemies to ruin him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unprecedented Challenge  </P> <P> The provisional president has set himself an unprecedented challenge for a  Paraguayan ruler: to draw the opposition into a newly democratic system, giving  the government legitimacy at home and abroad without losing the loyalty of his  -- and Stroessner's -- two pillars of support, the powerful Colorado Party and  the armed forces.  </P> <P> Most Paraguayans have found it hard not to conclude that Rodriguez seized power  because his own position was threatened. Stroessner had been maneuvering to  place his son, air force Col. Gustavo Stroessner, in line to succeed him as  armed forces commander -- and perhaps president as well. Rodriguez, commander  of the 1st Army Corps in the capital region, is thought to have counterattacked  when Stroessner tried to push him into a ceremonial position.  </P> <P> Yet the coup would not have succeeded if the political environment had not been  changing, knowledgeable Paraguayans and diplomats agree.  </P> <P> Stroessner had expanded the reach of the 110-year-old Colorado Party into every  village, trade union and school, while banning the main opposition force, the  Liberals. He elevated supporters to key military posts, making it unlikely that  either the party or the military would revolt. Stroessner realized that the way  to preserve power was to keep each group wary of -- and dependent on -- the  other, to prevent a repeat of the bloody Paraguayan civil war of 1947.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Support Began to Erode  </P> <P> In August, 1987, Stroessner's party support began to erode when his most  fanatical supporters seized the party leadership and ousted the  Traditionalists, who opposed a dynastic, corrupt order. Some of the most  venerable party figures, such as elderly Chairman Juan Ramon Chaves and Supreme  Court Justice Luis Maria Argana, were driven into the political wilderness.  </P> <P> Rodriguez judged that these disaffected forces would welcome him if he turned  on Stroessner, and Argana acknowledged Tuesday that he and Rodriguez had spoken  before the coup.  </P> <P> One of Rodriguez's first moves as provisional president was a call to restore  unity and integrity in the Colorado Party. In the first days, Stroessner's  backers were purged from party posts. Chaves was renamed to the party  presidency.  </P> <P> Rodriguez said he would be willing to serve as president if the party wanted  him, and Colorado supporters quickly endorsed his candidacy in an election  hurriedly scheduled for May 1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ended Ban on Opposition Party  </P> <P> He agreed to allow all parties to compete -- ending Stroessner's ban on the  Liberals -- the other significant political force for more than a century --  and smaller groups. But he has stood firm on the election date despite  opposition complaints that reorganizing would be impossible in such a short  time.  </P> <P> Rafael Saguier, a leader of the Liberals, said he suspects that Rodriguez will  adopt some of the trappings of democracy, in the hope of ending Paraguay's  pariah status, but will not permit any real competition.  </P> <P> "They are going to change what they have to change to make sure that things  stay the same," Saguier said.  </P> <P> It took a week for Rodriguez to win recognition from the United States, and it  came with this statement from U.S. Ambassador Timothy L. Towell: "Words are not  enough. . . . Their credibility will be based on following through on what they  say they are going to do."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Tough Character'  </P> <P> A foreign diplomat said of Rodriguez: "Here is a guy who has been with  Stroessner since Day 1 and is a tough character. Why would anyone believe that  he is going to be the flower of democracy in Paraguay? There is no reason to  believe that this is an instant democrat."  </P> <P> Others wondered whether Rodriguez might have recognized that the system had  become bloated, outdated and stagnant, keeping Paraguay among the poorest  countries on the continent.  </P> <P> Certainly Rodriguez has set a different tone. Receiving reporters in the  presidential palace, Rodriguez expressed his support for democracy and human  rights and free expression. He indicated that closed newspapers and radio  stations would be allowed to reopen.  </P> <P> He also declined to criticize Stroessner or discuss the coup itself, except to  assert that no more than 50 people were killed or wounded, denying diplomatic  sources' reports of about 300 dead.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Series of Promotions  </P> <P> Criticizing Stroessner would have been disingenuous. Rodriguez aligned with  Stroessner early on and stayed by his side. When there was an internal coup  attempt in 1955, Rodriguez, then a captain, played a key role in thwarting it  -- along with Argana, who was also an army captain and head of the presidential  military staff. This brought the first of a series of promotions for Rodriguez,  a cavalry officer said to be respected by his troops for his fairness and lack  of ostentation, despite his wealth.  </P> <P> To make sure that no pro-Stroessner army forces challenge him, Rodriguez has  carried out a thorough military reorganization. He has appointed Gen. Ramon  Humberto Garcete, an infantry division commander who was the first to declare  his support for the coup, to Rodriguez's former job as commander of the 1st  Army Corps. Col. Lino Cesar Oviedo Silva, who led the combat troops in the  coup, has been named commander of the 1st Cavalry Division.  </P> <P> If Paraguayan tradition holds, these men will enjoy not only more power but  more privilege as well. Stroessner offered key business posts to loyal  officers, such as presidencies of state-owned companies, and is said to have  parceled out the rights to Paraguay's No. 1 industry, contraband.  </P> <P> Rodriguez is described as an excellent businessman, with vast cattle ranches,  currency exchange houses that a diplomat estimates bring in $20,000 to $30,000  a day, and an import company the diplomat says would be a perfect channel for  smuggling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unsubstantiated Reports  </P> <P> But nothing has emerged so far to substantiate reports that Rodriguez has ties  to drug trafficking. These reports first appeared in the early 1970s, at the  time of a conflict over a U.S. request for the extradition of Auguste Ricord,  an expatriate Frenchman later convicted of being part of the Marseilles heroin  ring.  </P> <P> According to Paul H. Lewis' 1980 book, "Paraguay Under Stroessner," Rodriguez  had made available to Ricord airstrips on his ranches for smuggling drugs and  had sought to block his extradition. Rodriguez made a point of denying any  involvement, past or present, with anyone linked to drug dealing. He has not  spoken publicly on the Ricord case, or about a subsequent report linking him to  the shipment of chemicals used to refine coca leaves into cocaine.  </P> <P> Importing goods and smuggling them into neighboring countries is a tradition in  Paraguay. It accounts for more than half the country's income. After-hours  business by senior military officers is also accepted.  </P> <P> In a country of 3.1 million with a small, sleepy capital, there are few  secrets. Everyone seems to be related to someone in power. Stroessner was known  to keep a mistress. Rodriguez, by contrast, has maintained a flawless family  image and is seen frequently with his wife, Nelida. One of his three daughters,  Marta, is married to one of Stroessner's sons, Alfredo, a businessman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rumors Grew Strong Feb. 2  </P> <P> Paraguayans guess that planning for the coup began no more than 10 days  beforehand. Rodriguez reportedly sent a note to his daughter and son-in-law to  extend their vacation in Uruguay for a few more days. Rumors grew strong on  Feb. 2 that something was afoot, yet many citizens believed that the first  sounds of gunfire were fireworks celebrating the San Blas national holiday.  </P> <P> With the strength of the 1st Army Corps behind him, Rodriguez had numerical  superiority when his men burst out of corps headquarters near the airport at  9:45 p.m. Support quickly galvanized in the air force and navy, which joined  him after minor skirmishes.  </P> <P> It took more than six hours of machine gun and artillery fire before Stroessner  gave in and was taken into custody.  </P> <P> Asked three days later how it felt to have overthrown his in-law, Rodriguez  smiled, looked down for a moment and said, "I wouldn't say 'overthrown.' I  consider it to have been defending a fine and just cause."  </P></p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Fall in demand cuts Wellman to Pounds 1.05m WELLMAN, the broadly-based engineering group, saw its pre-tax profit fall almost Pounds 2m from Pounds 2.96m to Pounds 1.05m in the year ended March 31 1992, after reorganisation costs of Pounds 400,000. The dividend is again 2.2p with a proposed final of 1.4p, and is just covered by fully diluted earnings of 2.4p, compared with 6.3p. Mr Geoffrey Iley, chairman, said all parts of the group experienced lower activity levels. Wellman Process and Wellman Bibby achieved higher profits although that did not offset a significantly lower contribution from Cadogan as British Aerospace partially withdrew work from sub-contractors. Demand for furnace equipment remained depressed and Wellman Furnaces suffered a loss of Pounds 240,000 before reorganisation. The attributable profit fell from Pounds 2.17m to Pounds 262,000 after taking into account Pounds 547,000 extraordinary charges relating to costs of withdrawing from two low margin businesses. Turnover slumped from Pounds 33m to Pounds 24m. Forward order book at March 31 was similar to last year, and had since been enhanced by the acquisition of Midcast.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Travel: Preaching to the converted in Ireland - Nicholas Woodsworth samples Guinness, rain and the life of small communities on Europe's edge THERE IS something haunting and mystical about the west of Ireland. That, at least, is what they say, and I was willing to believe them. I had spent too much time in the big city. My nerves were jangled. I needed tranquility. I needed Irish whimsy and soft Celtic twilight. Hibernian at-one-ness is not achieved just like that. It has to be worked at, so as I drove westward from Dublin I filled my little rented car with the music of Irish harp and pipe. Hardly had I left the Liffey than my soul began to stir. As I whizzed past green cow pasture and midge-infested bog it lightened and took to the air. By the time I scented the salt air of Galway Bay I was feeling transcendent. Fifteen minutes later, at the end of a two-mile tailback into Galway town, it all came crashing down. There is one week in the year when tranquility flees the west of Ireland. It is the week of the Galway races. Half of Dublin empties and comes out for 'the crack' - that whiskey-, music- and blarney-driven gregariousness which makes up the larger part of the Irish genius. But it does have its drawbacks. In Galway there is not a bed to be had, a parking space to be found, a bar stool to be sat on. Had the crowds that filled the town been white-haired Irish biddies and soft-spoken country gentlemen in tweeds, it might have been different. But there were back-pack armies on the streets of Galway wearing combat boots, Mohican haircuts and rings in their noses. And those were just the women. It was all too much. Off I drove, in search of a gentler kind of crack. The Aran Islands - now there was a place, I thought, where one could leave it all behind. As I dawdled north and west along the coast of Galway Bay, hardy little men in hand-stitched pullovers paddled doughnut-shaped fishing boats through my imagination. But half-an-hour later I was on my way again: the ferry landing where the Aran boats depart was a jam of tour buses, bright nylon camping gear and gesticulating Frenchmen in new, Aran pullovers. At peak holiday season the islands so renowned for isolation and a quiet way of life were choking on their own reputation. I motored northwards into the stark hills and treeless bogs of Connemara. This, at last, seemed more like it - suddenly, I felt peacefully alone in a great space on the farthest edge of Europe. Mauve fuchsia blooms hung heavy on roadside hedges. Miniature haystacks sat marooned in a jigsaw puzzle of rock-walled fields. Piles of turf lay stacked on the bog beside deep cuts filled with tea-coloured water. Down by the shore austere, white-washed cottages sat brooding under a fine drizzle. The west of Ireland is the only place I know that looks good in the rain. There is an integrity about the countryside, a harmony of gentle colours of earth and sea - greens and greys, duns and heathers, shaley blues and peaty browns - that is profoundly peaceful. By Letterfrack I stopped in a thin Irish mist to watch two local teams savage each other in the game of Gaelic football. It is such an odd, exotic sport I found it hard to belive I was still in Europe. A few miles on I stopped again to ask directions from a group of girls. The reply was in Gaelic, and they had to point the way to Roundstone. Was the lovely little coastal village of Roundstone, with its grey sea wall and bobbing fishing boats, its single sloping street and brightly painted houses, to be the end of my road? Alas, no. So well known as a lovely coastal village has it become that there was not a B &amp; B room vacant. As I arrived, a BBC film crew was preparing to video-tape an evening of quaint Irish set-dancing in a quaint Irish pub. I fled. The situation was grave. The west of Ireland seemed over-run by Dubliners seeking the crack and foreigners seeking the twee. Every second town between Kerry and Donegal had a traditional music festival, a lobster festival, a country fair, a beauty contest, a medieval pageant, a smoked-salmon celebration or a re-enactment of the foundering of the Armada. Such festivals are the only things that keep the depressed towns of the west afloat these days. But they were not what I wanted. Where, I began asking around, feeling a complete fool, was there absolutely nothing going on? On Clare Island in County Mayo, I was told, nothing has happened for years. Immediately I made tracks up the coast and abandoned my car at Roonah Quay, the little port that sits opposite Clare Island at the mouth of Clew Bay. The reports were right. The most exciting thing that happens around this part of mainland Mayo is the procession of bare-footed penitents up Croagh Patrick, Ireland's holy mountain. On Clare Island itself things are even quieter. Four hundred years ago Clare was the domain of Grace O'Malley, a pirate queen who terrorised the Irish coast. These days the excitement is not quite as great, but the income is more regular. Like most of the 150 souls on the island, the O'Malleys - still the largest clan here - have discovered that EC subsidy payments to sheep-farmers are a surer bet than piracy. This does not mean that the island has lost any of its local flavour; Brussels has a long way to go before it standardises life on Clare. When I stepped off the ferry at Clare's tiny port (one pub, one stone castle, three houses, one telephone box) I saw an old black London taxi ticking over at the end of the quay. How civilised, I thought, and prepared to climb aboard. But no, on Clare only lobsters travel by taxi. The vehicle belongs to a local fisherman who prizes it for its capacious interior; inside were piled half-a-dozen large lobster traps. My own transport, a muddy great tractor driven by my charming young B &amp; B proprietress, Maureen O'Grady, arrived a few minutes later. What does one do on a small, isolated island that sits exposed to the full force of the Atlantic? Often one does nothing. I spent my first day drinking tea beside a coal fire and looking out at the gale that swept in from the open sea. The wind moaned, the rain surged down the window-pane. It was the kind of weather that not even sheep enjoy. Further, along the shore-line, waves smashed into the high rocks, sending white spume flying. But isolation has its benefits: it makes people sociable. Later the wind dropped, the rain let up, and I walked the half-hour back to the pub by the port. It seemed that every villager on the island was crowded into its smoky bar. There was the usual chit-chat and gossip of small communities. I talked with Seamus, Maureen's burly red-haired brother, about raising salmon on the off-shore fish farm where he works. But sometime after 11pm, when most pubs have closed their doors, the band struck up and everyone under the age of 80 settled down to a proper session. Clare islanders like a bit of music, even Father Peter Gannon, whose impromptu late-night pub appearances have resulted in local fame and a cassette you can buy at the bar. I did not stay hooting and dancing and emptying glasses of Guinness until 5am as Maureen and Seamus did, but I stayed long enough to talk to Michael Moran, retired island postman. With 30 years of professional island cycling behind him, he is sceptical of today's technology. 'I met a German on a cycle tour the other day,' he shouted at me over the pub din. 'He told me his bike had 21 gears. I couldn't see the need. Mine went fine, and it had just two legs.' I should not have been surprised at his reply when I asked how best to get to know the island; I took his advice and the next day began walking around on my own two legs. I walked to the beach by the port and paddled about in glacial waters. I hiked over to the Bay View, the island's only hotel, ate fresh salmon and gazed across the water at Croagh Patrick. On Sunday morning, like all the islanders, I made my way past the island abbey and a cemetery full of long-gone O'Malleys, O'Gradys and Morans, and went to mass. Father Gannon had abandoned the accordion for the cassock, and delivered a sermon on the need for spiritual contemplation. As far as I was concerned he was preaching to the converted. My spirit had never felt more contemplative. My nerves were slowly unjangling, my senses no longer so jaded. I did not want to leave. I wondered if I could trade it in for 100 sheep, marry Maureen O'Grady and settle down by the sea. Perhaps there was an opening for a postman. Or a lighthouse keeper. I could, with a bit of learning, play spoons for the musical priest. What they say is true. There is something soul-stirring about the west of Ireland.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Basque co-op changes its culture  -Mondragon is preparing to tap financial markets The Basque country's co-operative movement, centred on the town of Mondragon, is preparing to tap the international financial markets, marking a change to its 40-year-old history of worker-ownership. 'We are talking about a new culture for us,' said Mr Miguel Angel Laspiur, chief financial officer of Mondragon Corporacion Cooperativa (MCC), the corporate umbrella of 102 individual co-operatives which has assets of Pta991bn (Dollars 7.2bn) and posted combined sales of Pta424bn last year. Mr Laspiur plans to create a financial holding company later this year, funded principally by foreign institutions, that will invest in some existing MCC co-operative units, such as Fagor Ederlan, the car component producer, and provide additional capital for new ventures. These will be set up as limited companies, as opposed to co-operatives owned by their employees, and will be controlled by MCC. 'We are not talking big figures (for the holding company) right now and will only be seeking Pta10bn-Pta15bn but this is just the begining and the numbers could multiply fast,' said Mr Laspiur. The development, which bears comparisons with the 1989 conversion and flotation of the UK's Abbey National building society and with the venture capital attracted by Australia's Westralian Farmers Co-operative, has attracted considerable interest. Mr Javier Salaverri, managing director in Spain of Schroders, the UK merchant bank, says the offer was 'a very exciting prospect and very sensible move by MCC which will enable it to compete for capital'. Mr Santiago Eguidazu, head of corporate finance at the Madrid securities firm AB Asesores agrees: 'The Mondragon group is a great generator of industrial initiatives and it has long proved itself to be a high-quality industrial manager,' he says. Mr Laspiur concedes that it may be difficult to bring in the funds. 'There is no precedent for an industrial corporation of our size, which is owned by co-operatives and run from the bottom up, going to the markets and there could be problems in explaining what Mondragon is all about.' The most visible aspect of Mondragon is the output of machine tools, car components and electrical white household goods of its industrial division which had combined export sales of Pta61.8bn last year, 35 per cent of total sales and 19 per cent up on the 1992 export figure. In spite of the recession, MCC posted good results last year with pre-tax profits of Pta28.9bn, a 28 per cent increase on 1992, and it expects to lift this year's gross income by a further 15 per cent to 33.5bn on sales of about Pta500bn. MCC has benefited from diversification into three broad divisions: industrial production, distribution and finance and financial services. The strong export business generated by the corporation's car component manufacturing units helped to raise the industrial division's earnings and offset dampened results posted by the co-operatives dedicated to manufacturing capital goods, machine tools and electronic products. Increased profits in the financial division meanwhile helped to finance investments totalling Pta33bn last year in MCC's spreading network of hypermarkets. There could be a problem explaining the capital markets to MCC's 25,000 employees who, as owners of the co-operatives, control the corporate decision making through elected councils and are intensely proud of their industrial democracy. The less visible part of Mondragon is the close-knit manner in which the co-operatives have organised themselves into a cradle-to-grave welfare society hidden away among the narrow, lushly green and wooded valleys of the Basque Country. It was founded by a far-seeing local priest, Fr Jose Mara Arrizmendiarrieta, in 1956. The Mondragon co-operative movement, as it was originally known, has grown into a worker-ownership empire that embraces a large technical school, a highly-regarded applied research centre and a financial division built around its own savings bank and its healthcare, life insurance and pensions group. In a research paper for Bristol University, sociologist Dr Martin Fairclough noted that Mondragon has been 'like a shrine and a wholly writ' for co-operative undertakings elsewhere in the world. The chief executives of MCC, such as Mr Laspiur, who are elected by their fellow employees, are confident they will win round their colleagues and the fund managers. Outside capital will soon be urgently required because the growth of the corporation, particularly in the distribution sector where it has ambitious shopping centre projects, can no longer be self-financed in a satisfactory way. A degree of degeneration from the worker-owner and industrial democracy ideal has taken place. MCC has since 1991 been buying local engineering companies and turning them round into profitability although not into co-operatives. In an even more drastic departure from its traditional approach to business, MCC is planning to open a white electrical goods plant outside Casablanca in a joint venture with a Moroccan investment group. 'Just like the Swedish multinational Electrolux came south and set up shop on Spain, we're going south into Morocco,' said Mr Laspiur. One difference is that MCC's Mr Laspiur, as a member of a co-operative organisation, earns at best 55 per cent of the salary that the chief finance officer of a rival multinational might command. Mr Laspiur and his fellow senior executives want to keep it that way and they believe that tapping the markets will not change the essential ethos of the Mondragon group. However, some international fund managers might be surprised to hear Mr Laspiur admitting that he and his fellow top worker-owners are 'a bit like monks'.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories cheered by Nellist's act of defiance - The impending battle for the Coventry South East constituency COVENTRY Conservatives can scarcely believe their luck. Militant Mr Dave Nellist is to stand as an Independent in South East, a seat they would never otherwise have expected to win. The Labour vote is split. Hold the 1987 vote and Martine Hyams, a first-time candidate, might just squeak in, the Tories argue. And for good measure, some of the heat might come off Mr John Butcher's marginal seat in neighbouring South West. Mr Ken Taylor, the Conservative organiser, said: 'This is the first time we have had an opportunity of winning this seat.' Indeed, Mr Nellist in 1983 succeeded Mr William Wilson, who had been a Coventry Labour MP for 20 years. His critics say that he nearly lost the seat for Labour in 1983. In 1987, however, Mr Nellist pushed his majority up to a comfortable 17.6 per cent, or 6,653 votes. Coventry South East is not a natural Conservative seat, especially not in a recession. Although the proportion of home ownership is high, there are extensive council estates and rundown areas with, in one ward, a high ethnic population. Unemployment, in a population largely of skilled workers, has been rising. The Conservative campaign will be energetic but discreet. Mrs Hyams will avoid direct confrontation with Mr Nellist. She will be a standard Conservative. The aim will be to get the vote out - greater than the total of more than 11,000 last time. The real struggle of the campaign will be for the Labour vote. The conundrum is calculating the portion that will remain loyal to Mr Nellist. Now the outcast, Mr Nellist maintains that it is not he who has lost the way but the Labour party itself. To the extent that he will address the broad issues, it will be from a 1970s and early 1980s hard-left viewpoint 'in defence of the socialist ideas the Labour Party was built on'. That means unashamedly arguing for defence cuts, socialist planning and democracy, he said. Only he can keep the Conservatives out, he argues, not, as he puts it, 'somebody imposed from the outside.' He grants that the record of independents in general elections is not encouraging, but is quick to add: 'The historical trend can be bucked.' Such arguments drive orthodox Labour supporters to apoplexy. It is not only that the electorate has spent the last decade voting against hard-left political solutions. It is not only because they believe he has frightened Labour supporters away. It is also that they feel he identifies with trouble. Mr Duncan Simpson, divisional organiser of the Amalgamated Engineering Union snorted: 'If anything, he thrives on stress. A good MP seeks to avoid it happening.' Mr Simpson added: 'We need an MP who is going to help Coventry regain its manufacturing profile.' Coventry is the centre of the motor industry, the argument runs, and yet investors like the Japanese go elsewhere. For the next week or two, until an official Labour candidate emerges, Mr Nellist has the field to himself. By operating a more democratic selection procedure, Labour is seeking to destroy the accusation that its candidate will be imposed. Nomination papers went out last Monday. A shortlist will be drawn up by the Labour national executive committee and there will then be a postal vote among local party members to select a candidate. So far, there is no obvious choice, certainly nobody with the local profile of Mr Nellist. Meanwhile, Nellist supporters are out and about, canvassing. They claim promises of support from 33.4 per cent of 13,400 people interviewed. Mr Nellist said he was 'on target to win the seat'. He agreed, however, that the returns needed to be treated with some caution because they tended to understate the number of abstentions. The Conservatives think returns need to be treated with caution because the sort of people doing the canvassing are not the sort of people to whom you would want to say 'no'. General Election 1987: DJ Nellist (Lab), 17,969; A. Grant (C), 11,316; F. Devine (SDP/All), 8,095; N. Hutchinson (Grn), 479. Lab Majority 6,653.</p>

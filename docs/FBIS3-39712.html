"Our mission is not over," Admiral Jeremy Boorda said. "Any  weapons found that are not under control will be subject to air  strike. Any shelling of Sarajevo will be cause for a strike  recommendation against the party doing the shelling," he also  said.    Meanwhile verification by UN forces on the ground and NATO  reconnaissance aircraft continued Monday, the admiral said.    The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said all heavy  weapons  had to be withdrawn 20 kilometres (12.5 mile) from the center of  Sarajevo or placed under UN control.</p>

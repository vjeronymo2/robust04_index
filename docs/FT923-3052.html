			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Relief and anxiety jostle for supremacy CONTRASTING reactions of shock, relief and anxiety were apparent yesterday from the German business, banking and economics communities to the Bundesbank's modest interest rate reduction. It was clear that the size of the cut was not in question, so much as its manner and direction. On the one hand, there was obvious relief from the business community, and from economists who have been warning of imminent recession in Germany, that for the first time in four years the central bank has cut its leading interest rates, however marginally. On the other, many bankers expressed the fear that the Bundesbank had seriously damaged its credibility, by being seen to bow to political pressure and relax its monetary targets, at a moment when the German economy did not justify the move. Mr Edzard Reuter, the chief executive of Daimler Benz, Germany's largest industrial company, said the cut would provide welcome relief at the current stage of feeble economic growth in Germany. It was a necessary correction in terms of interest rate policy, he said, which should give the other European economies 'significant room for man-oeuvre'. He warned, however, that further cuts in interest rates would depend on consolidation of public sector spending, and responsible behaviour by industry and trade unions in future wage negotiations. Mr Peter Pietsch of Commerzbank said that the move was 'a good message from Germany for Europe', pointing out that this was the first time that the German central bank had taken the financial and economic considerations of another country into account. 'But if you want to assess the situation properly, you must realise that we still have very high interest rates in Germany - and we will have them for a long, long time.' In Bonn the mood was divided. While politicians, from the government and opposition benches, welcomed the move as a boost to the ailing economy - and a help for investment in east Germany - spokesmen for the savings banks, and for German industry, were more doubtful. Mr Helmut Geiger, chairman of the savings bank federation, said the move was premature in domestic economic terms. The Bundesbank had raised interest rates in July because of the deteriorating budget deficit, and that situation had not changed. Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the move was impossible to understand, because the inflationary tendency in the German economy was still apparent. The August figure for the cost of living index rose 3.5 per cent compared with the previous August, against only 3.3 per cent in July. Mr Stihl said that German industry must watch acutely 'to see if the independence of the Bundesbank is properly protected'. A number of economists also claimed that the cut - and the way in which the bank appeared to have been bounced into the decision in the wake of political pressures - had dealt a serious blow to the central bank's anti-inflation credibility and that this would, in time, lead to an erosion of the D-Mark's role as anchor currency of the EMS. 'I was surprised and shocked,' said Mr Thomas Mayer at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. 'The Bundesbank has changed its course, reducing the importance of monetary targeting. The interest rate cut shows the Bundesbank reacting in a way more befitting a future European Central Bank, reacting to political pressures, to tensions in the ERM and to pressure on the lira. 'It is a relief for the markets because the stranglehold of German policy has been eased. But if we believe the Bundesbank's arguments that inflationary developments in Germany are worrisome - and the rate cut does nothing to change that - the move may undermine the D-Mark's status as anchor of the ERM. The D-Mark was the anchor because the Bundesbank always directed its monetary policy at German fundamentals, but this has now changed.' Mr Lothar Weniger at Salomon Brothers in Frankfurt said: 'The Bundesbank was forced into this, reacting to pure political pressure, with very serious consequences on how the the central bank will be perceived and how it will be able to operate in the future. It will contribute to the image of a seriously weakened Bundesbank.' At Hamburgische Landesbank, Mr Konrad Kentmann, chief economist, said: 'They could have done it earlier, and then again they needn't have done it now.' 'It raises all sorts of questions about the Bundesbank's credibility. Autonomy has always been one of the Bundesbank's most important assets but now doubts about this will intensify. 'In this respect it is not a good omen for European monetary union, lending weight to the arguments of those sceptics who argue that Europe's central bank will have no real authority.' The cut showed that the Bundesbank move to increase interest rates earlier this summer was misguided, Mr Kentmann said.</p>

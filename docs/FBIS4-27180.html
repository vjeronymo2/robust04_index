			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan may halt all  remittances to North Korea and take other measures if the United  Nations decides to slap sanctions against Pyongyang in protest  over its continued resistance to the inspection of spent fuel  rods, government sources said Monday [30 May].    If the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) adopts economic  embargoes  against North Korea, the Japanese Government is expected to  follow with curbs on trade and transport between the two  countries.    The possibility of sanctions has grown since the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Saturday its  negotiations with North Korea over the fuel rod issue failed.    The U.N. nuclear watchdog has been asking to be allowed to  examine the spent fuel rods to determine if plutonium had been  siphoned off to make nuclear bombs.    The failure of the nuclear negotiations has put Japan in a  quandary, leaving the country sandwiched between international  calls for action against its neighbor and the fear of angering  China.    The sources said the government will make a final decision  after taking into account the moves not only by the UNSC but  also by China, which maintains close ties with Pyongyang.    For the possible sanctions, the Ministry of Finance is  considering suspending all remittances to the country, which  amount to 60 billion yen a year.    Private banks have already voluntarily refrained from  sending  dollars to North Korea.    On the trade front, the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) is thinking of the possibility of a virtual halt  in North Korea-bound exports by requiring all shipments to be  approved by the MITI chief.    Two-way trade amounted to 50 billion yen worth last year.    Furthermore, the Transport Ministry, for its part, can  reduce  the number of charter flights between the two countries -- there  are about 80 a year at present -- and curb tourism.    Japan imposes similar sanctions against Libya and Iraq.    The sources said such steps would likely put a serious  strain  on the bilateral ties and may damage Japan's business with China.</p>

			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Thanksgiving week starts in modest style Wall Street US SHARE prices were mixed in modest trading yesterday as the Thanksgiving holiday week opened in subdued fashion, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.32 at 3,233.04, having spent most of the day only a few points either side of opening values. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.53 lower at 425.12, while the Amex composite eased 1.45 to 390.74. The Nasdaq composite index, which rose close to its all-time high last week, ran into profit-taking and dropped 3.77 to 638.83. Turnover on the New York SE was light by recent standards at 191m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 949 to 808. After last Friday, when most of the market's gains were earned from technical buying related to the monthly expiration of stock index and individual stock futures contracts, observers predicted that prices would open lower. They did, with the Dow dropping more than 10 points in the first 30 minutes. The market gradually recovered, aided by news of a Dollars 3bn merger deal in the aerospace industry and a major corporate restructuring. Sentiment, however, was not positive enough to lift shares to strong gains, and in active two-way trading primarily biased to the sell side, prices fell into a tight range either side of opening values. The level of trading activity yesterday was well below recent days, which was to be expected at the start of what is traditionally one of the year's slowest weeks. Thanksgiving Day is on Thursday, and many market participants extend the holiday weekend by taking Wednesday and Friday off. Among individual stocks, Martin Marietta jumped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 63 1/4 in turnover of 1.2m shares after the company announced it had signed a definitive pact to merge with General Electric's aerospace business. The deal, valued at Dollars 3.05bn, will see Martin Marietta's annual revenues nearly double to about Dollars 11bn. The news left GE Dollars 23 1/8 higher at Dollars 82 1/8 in turnover of 1.8m shares. The big restructuring announced yesterday was Westinghouse, which climbed Dollars 2 3/8 , or 24 per cent, higher at 12 1/8 in turnover of 5m shares after the company unveiled changes that included a withdrawal from the financial services business, the divestiture of some non-core units, a reduction in debt by more than Dollars 5bn over two years, and an after-tax charge of Dollars 1.13bn. Eastman Kodak firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 41 1/4 on the news that the company is selling its Atex subsidiary, which makes computers for the newspaper industry. ADRs in BET plunged Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 5 7/8 after the company unveiled a 43 per cent drop six-month profits. Canada TORONTO STOCKs ended lower in light volume, shadowing Wall Street and pressured by steadily rising Canadian credit rates, dealers said. 'We followed New York for most of today, but volumes up here were fairly lackluster,' one broker said. The TSE-300 Index eased 5.56 points or 0.17 per cent to 3,258.3 on volume of 33.4m, compared to Friday's turnover of 37.7m.  Declining shares led those advancing 329 to 270.</p>

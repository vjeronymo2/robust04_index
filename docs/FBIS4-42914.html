			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux report: "Inter-Army, </F> Inter-Allied Defense -- A French-Style Pentagon"]    [Text] Who could honestly state that the Armed Forces are  not continually trying to adapt to the new strategic challenges,  threats, risks, and conflicts resulting from the current  post-Cold War times? Assuredly not the military, who have seen  new reforms introduced year after year. For example, the Army  has been through Mr. Chevenement's "Army 2000" plan, then Mr.  Joxe's "Format 1997" plan, before recently embarking on project  "21," where "21" stands for 21st century.    There is not always time to implement such reforms in their  original format as changes are routinely introduced beforehand.  The most recent example is the creation of two joint commands  (EMIA's), one for "European Operations" planning, and the other  for "Foreign Operations" planning. Established by a ministerial  decree signed Pierre Joxe and dated 10 February 1993, they were  scheduled to become gradually operational between July 1993 and  the summer of 1994. However, even before this deadline expired,  a new ministerial decree signed Francois Leotard and published  in the 1 June JOURNAL OFFICIEL has merged them into a single  "Joint Command for Operational Planning" (EMIAPO).  <H5>  Better Management </H5>   Substance-wise, the difference is hardly noticeable, as it  was decided from the start that both EMIA's would work side by  side in the same building located in an Air Force base in Creil  (Oise). Officially handed over to the Armed Forces on Friday [3  June], the specially designed building is in the shape of a  cross, with each EMIA being allocated two of its arms, while  their respective chiefs occupy the central area. A single  Operational Planning Command headed by Major General Bernard  Janvier: This attempt at simplification will lead to better  management. Such a move had been envisioned from the start, but  had been deferred in order to smooth out the transition and  avoid ruffling a few feathers. However, it will not entail  reduced personnel costs. By summer, the total human resource  figure will reach 200 individuals (four senior officers, 83  officers, 53 non-commissioned officers, 14 volunteers, and 45  draftees). Fifty percent of the officers belong to the Army.    However, it will lead to better coordination between the  "European Operations" and "Foreign Operations" teams, whose  deputy chiefs are Air Force Major General Jean-Pierre Job and  Rear Admiral Francois de Longueau Saint Michel.    The main change, which goes way beyond this 1994 amendment  to  the Joxe plan of 1993, is that the establishment of this  Inter-Army Command (twin-headed, then single-headed) has brought  together two already existing planning commands, which  previously operated independently, one from Metz, under the  chief of the First Army (now broken up), and the other from  Maisons-Laffite, controlled by the Rapid Intervention Force  (FAR) commanding officer. Worse, neither of these was an  "inter-army" command.    The Gulf War and subsequent UN operations in Cambodia,  Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia showed that the participation  of our Armed Forces required increasing coordination among the  services. Indeed, the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the  Military Police, and the health and fuel services must plan such  operations together, as they must carry them out together.    The reform that established EMIAPO was designed and actively  implemented by Admiral Jacques Lanxade in his capacity as chief  of staff. It must be viewed as one of the aspects of a  reorganization that affects the whole range of means needed to  carry out an operation.    A few months ago [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard, who  noted that in the past his ministry had been called "War  Ministry," then "Ministry of the Armed Forces," before becoming  "National Defense Ministry" and, more recently, "Defense  Ministry," mentioned the (rather remote) possibility of a future  "Peace Ministry." In the meantime and parallel to this  evolution, however, as new crises and conflicts crop up at an  increasing rate, functions such as "military intervention,"  "operations", "crisis management," and "warfare" become ever  more concentrated in the hands of the chief of staff.    True, the chief of staff controls the Joint Operations  Center  (COIA) in charge of all national or international operations  involving French soldiers. And to perform such "real-time",  24-hours monitoring, the chief of staff/COIA tandem needs as  much firsthand information as possible.    Thus, in three years time, a sort of French-style "Pentagon"  has been created. Not in the field, as this would be too  costly, but at the conceptual and decisionmaking level. In  addition to the EMIAPO, it places the Military Intelligence  Command (DRM) and the Special Operations Command (COS) under the  control of the Armed Forces Chief of Staff. Of course, it  maintains close contacts with the "force reserves" of the three  armies.    This structure would not be fully operational without a NATO  dimension being added to the integration of the services. While  General de Gaulle's 1966 decision of leaving NATO's Integrated  Command remains valid, close relations have been developing with  NATO commands. Either between the Armed Forces Chief of Staff  and NATO commands through French military missions, or between  EMIAPO and the planning groups of the various NATO commands.  Such relations are not exclusive. The Inter-Army Command  includes liaison officers sent by our NATO partners. It also  exchanges information with the WEU [Western European Union]  Planning Group. Thus, in times of peace, networks are being  woven that prepare the potential participation of Inter-Army  Command components in NATO or WEU operations.</p>

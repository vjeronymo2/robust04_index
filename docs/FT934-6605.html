			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / People: Stapleton to chair Hundred Group Nigel Stapleton, 47, has been appointed chairman of the Hundred Group of finance directors from January 1. Stapleton was recently appointed chief financial officer of Reed Elsevier, and has been the chairman of the technical committee of the Hundred Group for three years. His new appointment follows the announcement earlier this month that Michael Lawrence, finance director of Prudential and the current chairman of the Hundred Group, is to become chief executive of the London Stock Exchange. From its creation in the early 1970s, the Hundred Group has grown into an important forum on a wide range of issues of importance to finance directors  -notably accounting and auditing matters. It has been influential over the past few months in delaying and bringing about more co-ordination in the implementation of the Cadbury code of corporate governance. Stapleton worked at Unilever, becoming vice president, finance, before moving to Reed International in 1986 as finance director and also became chief financial officer following the merger with Elsevier earlier this year. He is a non-executive director of Allied-Lyons. His successor as technical committee chairman will be Christopher Pearce, finance director of Rentokil Group.</p>

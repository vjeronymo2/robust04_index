			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Swiss government has launched a campaign to  persuade voters to back its plans for Swiss participation in  United Nations peacekeeping missions. It says sending  peacekeepers would be in line with the national tradition of  supporting peaceful solutions to political conflicts. A  nationwide vote on the issue has been called by rightwing  opponents of the scheme. This report from our parliamentary  corrrespondent, Pierre Andre Tschanz:    [Tschanz] Opponents of Swiss participation, who have now  collected the 50,000 signatures needed to force a nationwide  vote, share a very limited view of what neutrality means. As  they see it, it not only precludes Swiss membership of the  United Nations, it also prevents Bern sending troops to take  part in peacekeeping operations. Eight years ago this viewpoint  was still prevalent in Switzerland. Three out of four voters  said "No" to joining the UN in a nationwide vote. This time,  though, the government is not letting the grass grow under its  feet, hence the launch of a publicity offensive two and half  months before the vote.    Its argument is simple: Switzerland has always done its best  to contribute to peace and security worldwide. It has done so  by sending mediators and observers to conflict zones and by  offering financial support and personnel.    For Mr. Cotti [president], sending peacekeeping troops to  such areas is a logical continuation of traditional policy. Mr.  Villiger [defense minister] puts it even more bluntly -- for  him, not to do so would risk endangering the credibility of the  government's foreign and security policy.    What is more, says the government, there's no real conflict  between participating in such missions and maintaining Swiss  neutrality. Swiss troops would not be taking part in what is  termed peace enforcement. Participation would be limited to  peacekeeping missions which have been approved by all parties to  the conflict. And the government would always be free to choose  on a case by case basis which operations it takes part in. If  the nature of the mission changed during its course, troops  could be withdrawn at any stage. To take a practical example,  Switzerland would not send troops to areas such as Somalia or  Sarajevo.    The government, it's plain to see, is doing its best to  reassure nervous voters. It has two and half months to succeed.</p>

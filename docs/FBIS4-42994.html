			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg -- According to Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union), the states in Central and  East Europe might become NATO members by the year 2000. He is  convinced that the alliance will be enlarged by that time, even  though not all countries may be accepted at the same time, Ruehe  stated today on the occasion of the renaming of the General  Schwarzkopf Barracks in Hamburg as Lieutenant General Count von  Baudissin Barracks. Ruehe unveiled the new nameplate in front  of the new Bundeswehr staff college, which is named after the  father of the "inner leadership" of the Bundeswehr and peace  researcher Wolf Count von Baudissin. Baudissin died in Hamburg a  year ago.    Russia, however, will be integrated neither in the European  Union nor in NATO, but must be included in a partnership that  corresponds to its size, responsibility, and significance, Ruehe  pointed out. The integration of the neighboring countries in the  East must be accompanied by intensified cooperation and a  dialogue with Russia on nuclear security and the  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. "However, it is clear that  Russia will not have a right of veto concerning the enlargement  of the alliance. It is also clear that there is no hierarchy  among the European institutions." Otherwise, the foundations of  security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic region would fall  apart.    Hamburg Mayor Hennig Voscherau (Social Democratic Party of  Germany) stressed that the new tasks of the Bundeswehr and the  acceptance of more responsibility must take place on the basis  of a political consensus in Germany. "The current insecurity  has a negative impact on the motivation of the soldiers and  officers." According to Ruehe, the peacetime strength of the  Bundeswehr should include 340,000 soldiers on a long-term basis.</p>

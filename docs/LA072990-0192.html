			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH SURELOCK;  </P> <P> THE SILICON SLEUTH  </P> <P> Dancinginthepark joined SURELOCK's growing list of turf front-runners who have  faded at Del Mar, but at least she managed to finish second ($7.20) for a $64  profit in the fifth race. However, all but $4 of that profit evaporated in the  eighth when two of its exacta picks, Stylish Star and Nikishka, ran 2-3 behind  $47.20 longshot Jabalina Brown.  </P> <P> SURELOCK's bets for today are $40 to win on Exclusive Partner in the seventh  race and a $20 late double of Sunny Blossom in the eighth race to Horsche in  the ninth.  </P> <P> SURELOCK's Sat. Bankroll $1,740  </P> <P> Saturday's Profit $4  </P> <P> Current Bankroll $1,744  </P> <P> Janice Goldinger's $5 exacta box paid a handsome $82.20 on $2 in the fifth  race. She lost her flat bets on Belle Poitrine in the fifth and D'Or Ruckus in  the sixth, but still cleared $146.25 for the day.  </P> <P> Janice will bet $100 to win and place on My Prayer in the ninth race today.  </P> <P> Janice's Sat. Bankroll $1,900  </P> <P> Saturday's Profit $146.25  </P> <P> Current Bankroll $2,046.25  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Technical Specifications, Administrative Controls, Limiting Conditions for Operation, and Surveillance Requirements  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are as defined in 10 CFR 50.36.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General Requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All licensees must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Provide reasonable assurance that uncontrolled changes in reactivity, uncontrolled changes in reactor coolant inventory, and loss of subcooled state in the reactor coolant system when subcooled conditions are normally being maintained will not occur when the plant is in either a shutdown or low power condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Assure that containment integrity is maintained or can be reestablished in a timely manner as needed to prevent releases in excess of the guidelines of 10 CFR part 100 when the plant is in a shutdown or low power condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)(i) Identify that equipment (including electric power and compressed air) necessary to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Make the reactor subcritical or critical in a controlled manner and maintain it subcritical in a shutdown condition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Maintain reactor coolant system inventory and capability to add makeup water to the reactor vessel;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Remove decay heat from the reactor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Monitor water level in the reactor vessel; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) Maintain or reestablish containment integrity when the plant is in a shutdown or low power condition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Establish controls for the equipment identified in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section such that they will perform their safety function when the plant is in a shutdown or low power condition. The controls must reflect sufficient redundancy in systems, subsystems, components, and features to ensure that, for the onsite electric power system in operation (assuming offsite power is not available), safety functions can be accomplished, assuming a single failure, for all conditions except refueling operations (with water level above the reactor in excess of a lower limit established in applicable technical specifications or plant procedures); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The controls required by paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section must be included in either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36(c) (2) and (3), or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)(i) Prior to (and throughout the shutdown refueling outage as necessary to accommodate unforeseen contingencies) entering cold shutdown or a refueling condition, evaluate realistically available fire protection features and the outage plan for possible fires stemming from activities conducted during cold shutdown or refueling conditions, and determine realistically whether such fires could prevent accomplishment of normal decay heat removal capability during cold shutdown or refueling conditions. If the evaluation shows that such fires would prevent accomplishment of normal decay heat removal capability, the licensee must either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Take measures to prevent the loss of normal decay heat removal by such fires during cold shutdown or a refueling condition; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Have a contingency plan in place that will ensure an alternate decay heat removal capability exists and that will describe the general steps to connect the alternate decay heat removal system to the RCS. Plant staff must be trained in the implementation of the contingency plan.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

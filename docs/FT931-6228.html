			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Grafton ahead 9% to IPounds 3.87m GRAFTON GROUP, the Dublin-based builders' merchant and DIY concern, reported a 9 per cent advance in pre-tax profits from IPounds 3.55m to IPounds 3.87m (Pounds 3.96m) in the year to end-December. The outcome was achieved on turnover up by IPounds 1.98m to IPounds 96.4m. Mr Michael Chadwick, chairman, said that trading during the nine months to September had been strong but the impact of lower construction activity, as a result of higher interest rates and reduced confidence, had been felt in the last quarter. However, the overall financial position remained healthy, he added, with cash of IPounds 2.6m being generated during the year. Gearing was cut from 31 per cent to 22 per cent. Earnings per share worked through at 18.6p (17.1p). A maintained final dividend of 3.75p raises the total for the year to 6.5p (6.25p).</p>

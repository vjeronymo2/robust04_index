			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / The European Market: Hopes for east-west electricity trade may be dashed - Austria's deal with the Ukraine is unlikely to herald similar energy barter deals AN imaginative electricity deal concluded a few days ago between Austria and the Ukraine has once again raised hopes about the potential for large-scale trade in electricity between eastern and western Europe. The Austrian electrical utility, Oesterreichische Elektrizitaetswirtshafts (OEL), is to buy up to 800m kW hours annually from Interenergo in Kiev for 15 years. The total value of the contract could rise to ASch7bn Pounds 347.5m). In return, the Ukrainian power authority has agreed to use part of the proceeds from the sale to buy Austrian equipment and know-how to improve control of emissions at three of its coal-fired power stations. It will also buy gas turbines to increase their efficiency. This deal echoes another a year ago between Czechoslovakia and Germany. Then, Bayernwerk, a Munich utility, agreed to buy about 1,400MW of electricity from the Mochovce nuclear power station being built in western Slovakia. Czechoslovakia has agreed to use the revenue from its sale to instal instruments and control systems supplied by Siemens to bring the plant up to western safety standards. Once the new plant is running, two older and more dangerous nuclear plants elsewhere in the country will be shut down, much to the relief of Germany and Austria. These quasi-barter deals could become models for several others. It is generally agreed that all the nuclear power plants in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe are in poor condition. Many are beyond repair and must be shut down and others will require massive investment to bring them up to western safety standards. Mr Adolf Huttl, head of the KWU energy division of Siemens, said recently that it would cost DM12bn (Pounds 4.1bn) to renovate all of the 63 pressurised water reactors in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. This excludes the 16 Chernobyl type reactors. Like most experts, Mr Huttl believes they are too badly designed to be worth repairing. However, there are a number of practical obstacles to further large-scale barter deals. For one thing, most eastern European countries are net importers of electricity, and do not have surplus power to sell. Some analysts have even raised their eyebrows over the Austria-Ukraine deal on these grounds. The Ukraine would appear to be in a worse supply position than some other east European countries because it faces the prospect of having to shut down the two remaining 1000MW units at Chernobyl. The Austrians say they are confident of power deliveries under the contract because the Ukraine has so much other generating capacity, including four less dangerous pressurised water reactor (PWR) nuclear stations. Privately, they say they are counting on a substantial decline in domestic demand for power in the Ukraine in the next few years as industrial output there falls sharply. There would also seem to be little potential for sales of electricity from western European countries to eastern ones, even assuming that the eastern countries could to pay for it. Except for France, most western European countries have inadequate generating capacity for their own needs. Moreover, environmental lobbies would be strong enough to block or slow construction of new power stations, especially those where output was designed largely for export. Another obstacle to trade is the lack of transmission capacity between eastern and western Europe. Western European utilities do not want to connect their grid to the Comecon grid because its voltage is not stabilised. The alternative is to move power on high voltage direct current lines. However at the moment, there is only one such line, of limited capacity, connecting east and west, between Austria and Hungary. Austria will have to expand this capacity to get all the power it wants from the Ukraine, and it remains to be seen if OEL can overcome opposition to new power line construction from the substantial number of people in the country who believe high voltage lines cause cancer. Even if it does, it will not be able to take the volumes foreseen in its contract with the Ukraine until at least 1996. There is, of course, an even more fundamental obstacle to substantial east-west trade in electricity. Both parts of Europe have virtually identical weather and seasonal patterns, which severely limits the opportunity for offsetting each other's demand peaks and troughs. Perhaps the greatest prospects for energy trade between east and west are still along the lines developed during the cold war, with the west buying the east's oil and gas in return for hard currency.</p>

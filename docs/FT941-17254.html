			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: EFM to establish new US venture Edinburgh Fund Managers, the fund management company, is establishing a new venture based in Atlanta, Georgia, to market its investment services to the North American market. EFM is one of a number of UK fund management companies which have achieved success in attracting international fund management mandates from US pension funds seeking to diversify investment outside the US. According to InterSec Research Corporation, which specialises in pension fund research, the value of US pension assets invested overseas rose by nearly Dollars 50bn (Pounds 34bn) in the first six months of 1993. A recent survey from the Institutional Fund Managers Association, a UK-based trade group, found that overseas assets managed by its members increased by 41.9 per cent in 1992 while the value of UK client assets rose by a more modest 17.7 per cent. The survey found that North America and east Asia were by far a larger market for non-UK business than Europe. EFM said it was already managing more than Dollars 200m for US clients and now 'feels it has the necessary critical mass to merit a greater presence.' EFM had an American partnership, dissolved last month, with Wilmington Trust Company. EFM will continue to manage the partnership funds under management and will also be responsible for the client service support. Actual fund management activities will continue to be based in Edinburgh.</p>

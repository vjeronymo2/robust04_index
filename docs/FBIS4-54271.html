			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 27 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Regarding the Office of U.S. Trade Representative's  (USTR) including the "slowness of Japanese import procedures" as  a new trade barrier in the "1994 Report on Foreign Trade  Barriers," the Ministry of Finance [MOF] strongly refutes this  as an "opinion based on misunderstanding." MOF claims that the  report compares time needed for import procedures in Japan and  the United States by different standards. It argues that "in  terms of customs procedures, there is practically no disparity  [in time needed] between Japan and the United States."    According to a survey conducted by the MOF in 1993, the  average time needed for sea cargo to pass customs (obtain import  permit) after the shipment arrives was 4.8 days, and for air  cargo, 1.9 days. The USTR report claims that in the United  States, "the average time needed to get import permit is around  one minute," urging Japan to shorten time needed for import  procedures. However, MOF contends that the fact is, "there is a  gap in the idea of processing time."    In Japan, import declarations are filed and customs  procedures started only after passing inspections required by  laws not under MOF jurisdiction, such as food inspection or  animal and plant quarantine (so-called non-customs procedures).  In the United States, such non-customs procedures are taken  after going through customs based on advance import  declarations. That is, the difference between Japan and the  United States is that non-customs procedures are taken before  and after customs procedures, respectively.    Therefore, what the United States claims to take only "one  minute" refers only to customs procedures not including the non-  customs requirements. If the latter category is included, "the  entire process can easily take more than two weeks," (according  to a major Japanese trading firm). On the other hand, the  United States questions the total time needed for both  non-customs and customs procedures for imports in Japan. MOF  takes the position that "this is an argument neglecting the  disparity in definition."</p>

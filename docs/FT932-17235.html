			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Toronto share trading reaches record levels SURGING demand for the shares of resource companies helped push trading on the Toronto stock exchange to record levels in March. The TSE, which is second only to New York in trading volume in North America, said yesterday that 1.24bn shares changed hands in the first 30 days of last month, up 28 per cent from February and double the volume of March 1993. Trading values were set to reach about CDollars 12bn (USDollars 9.6bn) for March as a whole, almost double the levels of a year earlier. At the close yesterday, the TSE 300 index stood at 3,602, a gain of more than 7 per cent so far this year, but still well below its August 1987 record of 4,112. Like other North American exchanges, Toronto has benefited from the shift from fixed-income to equity investments as the slide in interest rates appears to be nearing an end. But investors have also been attracted to the resource-based Canadian market by signs of an upturn in commodity prices. Mr Greg Mills, head of liabilities trading at Burns Fry, a Toronto-based securities firm, said that 'a lot of the stocks people are looking to buy right now are commodity-based cyclicals.' Timber producers have performed especially well this year as North American lumber prices soared to record levels. Canadian gold mining shares have risen sharply in recent days, reflecting higher bullion prices.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS -- The leadership of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) examines the issue of  withdrawing from the Public Accord Treaty, LDPR leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy told a news conference at the Russian parliament  lower house on Friday.    According to Zhirinovskiy, the LDPR is forced to do this "by  the present course of the Russian leadership" which "does not  justify the hopes" of Liberal Democrats for resolving problems  facing the country.    Speaking about policy towards former Soviet republics and  other foreign countries, Zhirinovskiy called for closing down  some sections of the state border and for expelling from Russia  those who have no entry visas. He demanded that Russian troops  be pulled out of all "flash points".    "No contacts with NATO and no joint war games," thundered  the  LDPR leader.    Turning to domestic problems, he favoured an immediate  suspension of "privatisation a la Chubays". Zhirinovskiy said  that the LDPR parliamentary group did not vote on Friday for the  1994 federal budget which, in the group's opinion, is "an  anti-social budget".    Zhirinovskiy disfavoured proposals on extending powers of  the  president and parliament. "We cannot adopt this version," the  LDPR leader said at the lower house, giving, however, no  explanations why his group favours this position.</p>

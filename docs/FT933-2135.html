			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Japanese carmakers are showing strain over trade friction with US JAPANESE carmakers are showing increasing signs of the strains of trade friction with the US. Mitsubishi Motors said yesterday it was studying the possibility of selling in Japan a new car developed by Chrysler, called the Neon, reflecting the pressure on manufacturers to help the cause of the US car industry there. The US wants Japanese carmakers to buy more US-manufactured parts and help sell US cars in Japan. Vehicle trade comprises about 37 per cent of Japan's trade surplus with the US, according to the US Department of Commerce. As part of voluntary efforts to help rectify this imbalance the Japanese manufacturers have indicated they are willing to buy Dollars 19bn (Pounds 12.3bn) worth of US car parts in fiscal 1994. Mitsubishi, which is also considering the possibility of selling Chrysler's popular LH car in Japan, has said it would import 6,000 cars from the US in fiscal 1995. This compares with 540 cars it imported from its Diamond Star Motors facility in the US, which was a joint venture with Chrysler until the US company pulled out in October 1991. Mitsubishi said it was studying what the target market for the Neon might be and which of its distribution channels it might sell the car through. The Neon, which was launched by Chrysler in Frankfurt earlier this month and is scheduled to go on sale in the US in January, was developed by the US company to compete in style, size, quality and price against Japanese vehicles. Its planned US price tag of less than Dollars 10,000 is already sending tremors through the Japanese car industry. If the Neon lives up to its reputation it could deliver a heavy blow to the Japanese car industry, already reeling under the effects of the rapid surge in the yen's value against the dollar. This is hurting the competitiveness of Japanese carmakers and forcing them to review global strategies, from manufacturing to exports and pricing. The currency movement is also forcing most Japanese car manufacturers to raise prices in the US, with Mitsubishi vehicles increasing by an average 8.4 per cent, Nissan by 5.2 per cent and Toyota by 3.9 per cent for 1994 models. Meanwhile, Honda has decided to shift manufacturing of most of its popular Civic and Accord models sold in the US to North America. The company said manufacturing of the Civic, which sells about 20,000 models in North America, would be shifted from next spring and that of the Accord, which sells 60,000 vehicles, from April 1996. The move is part of the company's plans to strengthen manufacturing in North America to avoid the worst effects of currency fluctuations. The US is already a significant export base for Honda; last year it exported 55,000 cars from the US to the rest of the world. While other Japanese carmakers would like to follow Honda's lead, most are constrained by domestic considerations, such as the need to use capacity at new facilities in Japan, maintenance of ties with domestic suppliers and the difficulty of reducing employee levels. But with Toyota, the largest Japanese carmaker, warning it could make a loss if the yen stays at its current level, Honda could indeed be setting an industry trend.</p>

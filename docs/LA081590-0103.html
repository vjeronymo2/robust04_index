			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA BARBARA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO PURSUE DESALINATION PLANT  </P> <P> After reviewing dozens of proposals for providing the city with emergency water  supplies, the Santa Barbara City Council has decided on desalination to cope  with the drought. The city will begin negotiating with a Massachusetts company  that has proposed building the nation's largest seawater desalination plant in  Santa Barbara, a facility expected to provide about 5,000 acre-feet of water a  year, about one-third of the city's normal demand. If the contract with Ionics  Inc. is approved, the city could receive water by February, 1992, said Sandra  Lizarraga, coordinator of the city drought response programs.  </P></p>

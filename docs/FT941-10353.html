			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Socialists clear way to buy Awacs Japan's Social Democratic Party yesterday lifted its objection to the government purchase of two US Airborne Early Warning and Control System aircraft at Y55.4bn (Pounds 344m) each. This will double the number of Boeing-made Awacs in the Japanese airforce and improve its ability to detect an attack. The purchase comes when North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons programme has created intense public anxiety. The proposed Awacs purchase was already part of the 1991-1995 defence programme. The Socialists' change of heart removes a potential block to the government's 1994 draft budget, due to be unveiled today after being delayed for two months by the difficulties over political and tax reform. Another big US purchase, on top of Japan Airlines' decision last week to buy Dollars 400m-worth of Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, provides Premier Morihiro Hosokawa with some ammunition against US criticisms of his recent economic pump-priming package, when he meets President Bill Clinton tomorrow. The Socialist party, the biggest partner in the seven-party coalition, opposed the Awacs purchase for pacifist reasons, but lifted its embargo on grounds that the increase in defence spending will be curbed sharply this year. The need to pay 'due attention to Japan-US ties' also played a part, a Socialist official conceded. The defence ministry has asked for a 1.95 per cent budget increase to Y4,730bn, the smallest rise in 36 years. The finance ministry is understood to be pushing for an even lower figure, to the Socialists' satisfaction.</p>

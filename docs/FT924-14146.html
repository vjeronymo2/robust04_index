			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Pandora's box or a panacea: EC members are pinning their hopes on subsidiarity to calm fears about European integration Subsidiarity is an unlovely word of uncertain meaning. Yet virtually all EC leaders profess to believe it contains magic potent enough to bring European integration out of arguably the worst crisis of confidence it has faced. But when European Commission president Jacques Delors, as much as his erstwhile foe Lady Thatcher, President Francois Mitterrand of France, no less than UK prime minister John Major, all discern extraordinary properties in subsidiarity, there is a prima facie case for wondering whether it is more snake oil than silver bullet. Although subsidiarity in essence means that the EC should act only when measures taken nationally or locally would be ineffectual, it is being sold as an all-purpose remedy: To recapture Danish voters' support for Maastricht, which they narrowly rejected in June; To persuade Europhobes in the UK that national governments will be - as British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd put it last week - 'firmly in the driving seat' in the European Union blueprinted by Maastricht; To clip the wings of the Commission in Brussels, which has been demonised as a Eurocracy hungry for power and out of control; To proclaim that EC decisions will be brought closer to the people - although this impression is frequently given by coating the principle of subsidiarity with the more subversive ideas of open decision-making and strengthened democratic accountability. And it is not clear more democracy is on offer. Last week in Luxembourg, foreign ministers of the 12 had a first stab at agreeing on the procedures through which to apply subsidiarity, while postponing substantive discussion on what it means until the emergency summit of EC heads of government at Birmingham on Friday. After then, it should become clear whether subsidiarity is anything more than a turf battle, with national governments trying to soothe public opinion into believing that if they rein in an interfering, pettifogging Brussels bureaucracy, all will be well. 'National and European bureaucrats can clearly mark out their territory,' as one Dutch diplomat put it, 'but that doesn't tell you where the people come in.' On the evidence so far, moreover, subsidiarity may end up causing as many Euro-headaches as it cures. Already there is concern that it could: undermine the single market, due to be completed by the end of 1992; roll back achievements in EC-wide environmental, regional and social policy; and upset the balance between big and small states which is part of the basic chemistry of the Community's post-war success. Most EC governments, however, facing a backlash against 'Europe' at home, have reached for the easiest scapegoat - the Commission in Brussels. While understandable, and not altogether unmerited, this is disingenuous. The Commission is peopled by true believers. A senior official admits it has 'tended to conduct itself like a commando operation'. Like most bureaucracies it has stretched its powers. But it has not usurped them. The EC's basic power mechanism is that the Commission, nominated by member governments, proposes, the directly-elected European Parliament advises and can sometimes amend, but only the Council of Ministers - the elected, national ministers of the 12 - can decide EC law. Most EC measures are taken at the behest of member states, even though the Commission has sole right to propose. This monopoly right bestows power but also vulnerability. Governments regularly pass the buck to 'Brussels' for unpopular or misfired measures, and evade opprobrium for suggestions they make, which if they came from the Commission, would be seen as interference. In the last year for instance, the Commission has twice refused Council invitations to formulate an EC dietary policy - an idea at least as intrusive as the apocryphal Euro-condom Brussels supposedly advocated. Some governments agitate for measures their partners regard as intrusive. The UK, a leading belligerent for subsidiarity, wants strict enforcement of EC competition rules which frustrate French efforts to operate an industrial policy. The British government has had bruising encounters with Brussels on EC environment regulations, but still wants an EC inspectorate to ensure countries like Italy and Portugal observe the rules. Denmark, for its part, fears EC environment policy might dilute its high green standards, and wants it strengthened. The outlook could be worse, paradoxically, for regional and social policy, two rare areas in which the EC partly practises the 'bottom-up' approach subsidiarity supposedly calls for. EC regional funding in backward and industrially stricken areas elicits decision-making and initiative by regional and even municipal governments, which put forward the projects and help finance them. This has irked national governments in the UK and even federal Germany, because the Commission is to an extent by-passing them. As main budgetary contributors to this EC spending, the biggest after agriculture, they increasingly question its validity. But a much more fundamental issue was raised by last month's attempt by the most powerful member states, Germany, the UK and France, to dilute the Commission's sole right to propose. As ambassadors of the 12 worked out how subsidiarity could be applied, these 'big three' pushed for a formula whereby the Commission would have to submit its proposals to member states for scrutiny at the draft stage. Their nine partners - even the discreet minutes of these meetings show  - saw this as a naked power-grab. Given that subsidiarity is partly a sop to the Danes, it was ironically the smaller countries which were particularly concerned their bigger partners would get a lockhold on the Commission, and tilt legislation in their favour. The fear is that Brussels would have to clear its ideas with the big countries because they hold nearly two-thirds of Council votes. 'The smaller countries rely on us to defend their interests,' said one senior Commission official. 'Without a Commission which performs, their stake in Europe is devalued.' The ambassadors' compromise, likely to go to Birmingham, is that any state can object to Brussels proposals by invoking subsidiarity, but would need the support of six of its partners to block them. This would 'force the Commission to think twice before coming up with something', said a Dutch diplomat, 'but member states will not be able to force their opinions on the Commission'. Mr Delors himself partly regained the initiative at the Lisbon summit in June. Since then, the Commission has been screening its activity in the light of subsidiarity, and attaching a 'recital' to its proposals explaining why action at Community level is needed. Member states should now have to justify any complaints of interference in the same terms. This is still a recipe for squabbles, rather than a clear division of powers on the federal model. It is not the 10th Amendment to the US Constitution, which reserves all powers not delegated to the federal government to the states, much less Germany's constitution, which vests all power in the Lander except as prescribed in Article 30 of the federation's Basic Law. 'You could give the US constitution to a 10-year old,' says one senior Commission official, 'and they would understand it; whereas the Maastricht treaty is understood only by those who have been to a French law school.' Unlike the US or Germany, the EC (and European Union foreseen by Maastricht) is only a quasi-federation. Moreover, unlike a real federal system, it was put together back-to-front. Until now the Community has often preoccupied itself with the little, niggling things - allowable levels of lawnmower noise and pig manure, or quality standards for headed cabbages, for instance  -while the heart of any federation, economic and monetary policy, and foreign and defence policy, has been jealously reserved to national governments. The EC action may be answering requests from member governments, which do not trust each other to flatten their part of the level playing field called for by the barrier-free single market. Yet the measures often look at first glance like what a local council, let alone a national government, should be doing, rather than a remote, and moreover 'foreign' bureaucracy. Much of the opposition to Maastricht has been to the often intrusive 282 directives creating the single market, rather than the contents of the treaty. Nevertheless, the Commission and member governments have done precious little to dispel people's fears that Maastricht means greater centralisation and loss of national identity. There would seem not to be enough either in the treaty or the tricky notion of subsidiarity to reassure them. Maastricht gives the European Parliament in Strasbourg the right to veto laws passed by majority vote in Council, partly to compensate for the loss of national veto, partly to bolster the role of directly elected legislators. But Europe's parliament has yet to convince citizens it is of use to them. The main extensions of EC powers in the treaty, furthermore, could reduce accountability and make decisions more opaque. The two new 'pillars' to the main EC treaty - a common foreign and eventually defence policy, and co-operation on justice and internal security issues ranging from drugs to immigration - are inter-governmental, outside the EC remit. Member states will act jointly, but on present arrangements outside effective oversight of either national parliaments or Strasbourg. The Danes, whose Folketing keeps the closest watch on the EC but also wants more powers for the European Parliament, have a point. Unless subsidiarity turns out to mean more democracy, the treaty is not democratic enough. Ideas to staunch the leakage of accountability, ranging from opening up Council law-making to public scrutiny, and a greater role for national parliaments, are getting a hearing but not yet hardening. The debate is still stuck on subsidiarity - at the moment not much more than a piece of molten plastic on which EC leaders otherwise at cross-purposes can stamp their own political seal. But this does not deny the force of Mr Delors' recent, partly self-critical observation to an audience of businessmen, that 'Europe began as an elitist project (in which it was) believed that all that was required was to convince the decision-makers. That phase of benign despotism is over.'</p>

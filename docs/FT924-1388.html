			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / The Property Market: Little movement The total return from commercial property in 1992 will probably be close to zero - about half a point better than the total return for the previous year, according to Investment Property Databank, an independent research company. In the year to November, total returns were 0.3 per cent, while rental values fell by 9 per cent and capital values fell by 8 per cent. The IPD monthly index recorded little movement in November. The overall equivalent yield remained at 9.9 per cent and the total return for the month showed only a slight improvement, rising to 0.1 per cent. Both rental and capital values continued to fall, by -0.9 per cent and -0.7 per cent respectively. Retails posted the best results of the three sectors, both in terms of the monthly and year-on-year total returns. The retail sector remains the preferred investment area. In November, retail yields edged downwards from 9 per cent to 8.9 per cent, while capital values fell by 0.3 per cent and rental values by 0.5 per cent. Office returns have remained relatively stable, albeit low, over the year. The current year-on-year total return is -6.3 per cent.</p>

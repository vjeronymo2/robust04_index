			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Reorganised Manders up 45% to more than Pounds 10m Manders, the Wolverhampton-based specialty chemicals group which is in the middle of a substantial reoganisation, yesterday reported a 45 per cent increase in 1993 profits. The pre-tax figure was Pounds 10.3m compared with the Pounds 7.11m reported in 1992 after charging defence costs of Pounds 1.87m incurred in the hostile Pounds 106.1m bid repelled from Kalon. Turnover grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 112.3m (Pounds 110.3m.) Since the end of the year the decorative paints division was sold for Pounds 55m and the group announced the sale to Prudential of the Mander Centre, its Wolverhampton shopping centre and sole investment property interest, for Pounds 82m. At the same time the group has augmented its remaining inks business with the Pounds 27m acquisition of certain coatings and printing inks operations of Croda International for Pounds 27m. The moves mean that Manders is left with a focused business with turnover of about Pounds 85m a year. Mr Roy Amos, chairman, explaining the group's new strategy, described 1994 as a 'transition' year. He said the group planned to use the proceeds of its property sale, which will be completed in June, to build a worldwide specialty chemicals business emphasising coatings and printing inks. Turnover in existing coatings and inks division rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 45.6m (Pounds 41.7m) last year while turnover in the discontinued operations fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 61.1m (Pounds 63.3m). Overall operating profits from continuing operations increased to Pounds 9.05m (Pounds 8.42m) with coatings and inks contributing Pounds 3.89m (Pounds 3.61m) and further growth in rental income at the Mander Centre generating property profits of Pounds 5.16m (Pounds 4.81m). The discontinued decorative operations generated profits of Pounds 3.11m (Pounds 3.39m). Net interest costs fell to Pounds 1.86m (Pounds 3.37m) mainly reflecting lower interest rates. Earnings per share increased by 64 per cent to 18.99p (11.56p) and the board is recommending a final dividend of 7.1p (6.4) making a total for the year up 11 per cent to 10p (9p).</p>

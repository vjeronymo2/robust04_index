			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Yeltsin wins deal to pursue economic reforms THE RUSSIAN government expects to press on with its economic and democratic reforms following President Boris Yeltsin's compromise at the weekend with the Congress of People's Deputies, the conservative-dominated parliament. The deal with Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the conservative chairman of parliament, extends Mr Yeltsin's special powers, enabling him to select his prime minister from a Congress shortlist. Hailed by supporters as a victory, it also fixes a date for a referendum on constitutional change, paving the way for the first fully elected Russian parliament. Where the government was previously expected to survive at most until next April, it is now Congress and the Supreme Soviet, its smaller permanent body, which are under notice, since a new constitution would call for fresh elections to a new parliamentary body. Father Gleb Yakunin, a prominent liberal deputy, said 'the president now has a big advantage'. The long-term survival of Mr Yegor Gaidar, acting prime minister and guardian of economic reform, is still uncertain, but Mr Yeltsin could confirm him in the post for a further three months if he is rejected in a Congress vote, as he was narrowly last week. Deputies will vote, probably today, on a slate of candidates to select a shortlist of three from which Mr Yeltsin will choose a prime minister. Many deputies, even Mr Gaidar's opponents, expect him to win at least a temporary continuation of his post. But the government is also discussing the idea that Mr Gaidar could move to head economic reform, something to which he has been unable to give his full attention since becoming prime minister. Senior ministers and advisers said over the weekend that they believed the deal, which fixed the date for a referendum on a new constitution on April 11, had raised the perspective for a new era in Russian politics - with a modern democratic constitution underpinning an elected parliament with its powers clearly defined. One said: 'In effect, the Congress were persuaded to vote themselves out of existence.' The Congress, with the Supreme Soviet, is a holdover from the Soviet era - as is the much amended constitution. However, there is concern the new government may have too little support to push through a tougher line on credits and money supply to crack down on rising inflation and a large budget deficit. Mr Yeltsin emerged from his meeting with Mr Khasbulatov with: A constitutional referendum, with the right to frame his own question if he cannot agree it with Congress. An extension of his special powers, allowing him to appoint a prime minister, who must be confirmed by Congress, and issue decrees. The commitment from the Congress not to change the power balance between it, the president and the judiciary by changing the constitution, or the referendum law, or elect judges to the two vacant seats on the Constitutional Court. The Congress won nothing on economic reform, with its gains confined to personnel changes. It achieved: The right to nominate and vote for alternative candidates for prime minister. The right, won earlier last week, to vote on the ministers of foreign affairs, security, defence and interior. The sacking of Mr Gennady Burbulis, closest aide to Mr Yeltsin, who has had several changes of title in the past. Seeking to bolster aid, Page 4</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Pub beer still flat while food and leisure thrive - Whitbread/Allied-Lyons/Bass The brewers' results season gets into full swing this week, with full-year figures from Whitbread today and Allied-Lyons tomorrow, and interims from Bass on Wednesday. So far, the season has produced only one real upset: Grand Metropolitan's statement that de-stocking in the US wines and spirits market was likely to cost it Pounds 40m in the full year. The big question is therefore how far Allied, also a big player in the US market, will confirm GrandMet's experience. For the UK, a common theme is likely to be that brewing and old-fashioned basic pubs are still doing badly, while pubs relying more on food and leisure are thriving. The worst figures from the trio are therefore likely to come from Bass, the UK's biggest brewer and also a significant pub operator. Against Pounds 229m last year, pre-tax profits this time could be flat or even slightly down, though there should be some improvement from the Holiday Inns hotel chain. Whitbread is expected to do better, with pre-tax of perhaps Pounds 232m against Pounds 220m before exceptionals last time. Again, profits from beer and tenanted pubs should be down, but Whitbread is particularly strong on more up-market, restaurant-type outlets. Allied's figures will take a little interpreting, since this will be the first full year to show the effects of its brewing joint venture with Carlsberg. While stated brewing profits may be slightly up on the enlarged business, the underlying position remains weak. The market will be alert for any suggestions that Allied is closer to extricating itself from the venture, which it has already hinted does not fit its overall strategy. The actual pre-tax figure is not a matter of debate, since it was forecast by Allied at Pounds 630m at the time of its deal with Domecq in March. This compares with Pounds 542m - again before exceptionals - the year before.</p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT: A FEW GEMS MAY STILL BE ON THE TAKEOVER LIST  </P> <P> Don't be surprised if the few mass-market jewelry retailers that haven't been  acquired wind up getting bought now that Ratners Group PLC has bought  Seattle-based Weisfield's. Charles LaLoggia, who publishes Special Situations  Report in Rochester, N.Y., puts jewelry chain acquisitions at the top of his  takeover list.  </P> <P> The most likely targets, he says, are the 225-store Duarte-based Barry's  Jewelers chain and Reeds Jewelers, a 67-store chain based in Wilmington, N.C.  The third and largest of the publicly owned mass-market jewelry chains, Kay  Jewelers of Alexandria, Va., with 488 stores, also is vulnerable, LaLoggia  says.  </P> <P> "My bet is that within the next 12 to 24 months, none of these companies will  be public," he said. But in the near term, he bets that Kay is more likely to  be an acquirer, since it was believed to be ready to launch a bid for  Weisfield's before Ratners moved in. If Kay does go shopping, LaLoggia's guess  is that it will go after Reeds, whose size is most similar to Weisfield's.  </P> <P> Insiders and officers of Reeds control 84% of its stock, and the company hasn't  indicated a desire to be sold. On the other hand, analyst Sarah Stack of  Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards says she believes that closely held Barry's is  receptive to a takeover and could fetch upward of $20 an share, or about twice  its current NASDAQ price.  </P> <P> And Kay? Based on what Ratners is paying for Weisfield's, LaLoggia pegs it at  $35. The stock closed Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.25.  </P> <P> Queasy About Drug Stocks  </P> <P> Drug stocks historically have been low risk. Not only do sick people need drugs  in good economic times and bad, but profit growth has been sustained by  longstanding patents.  </P> <P> But Morgan Stanley analyst Paul Brooke told me that he's advising clients to  start thinking about getting out of certain major drug companies that will lose  the "annuity feature" that comes with patents. In 1992 and 1993, he cautions,  patent coverage for a variety of major products will expire, and the  sustainable growth rate of some companies "will be materially changed." That  would ultimately translate to lower stock prices. Brooke's concern is that many  investors aren't thinking that far ahead.  </P> <P> The so-called ethical drug firms that sell directly to doctors -- such as  Syntex, Upjohn and Marion -- could be hurt the most, Brooke says. On the other  hand, proprietary companies whose products are sold directly to consumers --  such as Schering-Plough, Warner-Lambert and Bristol-Myers Squibb -- offer  strong prospects. So do companies with what Brooke calls "unappreciated  technology bases," such as Medtronic (heart pacemakers), Acuson (ultrasound)  and Eli Lilly, whose products cover all bases.  </P> <P> Short Selling First Executive  </P> <P> Two of this country's smartest investors -- the Templeton group of funds and  Fidelity Investments -- are big holders of First Executive Corp., a  controversial Los Angeles life insurer whose stock has plunged 40% in the past  two months. But the stock is also a target of some very smart short sellers.  They are believed to include some folks who were aggressively shorting  high-flying Integrated Resources before its recent financial troubles surfaced  and Baldwin-United before it collapsed.  </P> <P> The shorts are betting on the demise of First Exec in part because of its junk  bond portfolio. What's puzzling is how smart people on both sides can have such  strong and differing convictions and how the shorts can bet against such  heavyweights as Templeton and Fidelity. As one veteran short seller pointed  out, though, Templeton and Fidelity also held big stakes in Integrated  Resources.  </P> <P> A Difference of Opinion  </P> <P> From the fair-and-equal-treatment department: A spokeswoman for Businessland  (who had been dodging my queries) called to dispute last week's item that Apple  Computer had rescinded a 3% discount that it had supposedly granted to  Businessland. But she declined to explain why it was wrong.  </P> <P> "The problem is that I can't comment on details of our business arrangement,"  she said. "However, it certainly was inaccurate. We have a good relationship  with them, and nothing has changed."  </P> <P> Palo Alto consultant Seymour Merrin, who first told me the story, sticks by it.  </P></p>

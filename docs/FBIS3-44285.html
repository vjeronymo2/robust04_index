The meeting was called by Director-General Huang Yen-chao of  the Board of Foreign Trade on Monday. Huang said he will invite  officials from the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration  Department, Council of Agriculture, and the Industrial  Development Bureau to work out guidelines for tariff concessions  and discuss rates for import tariff cuts.    On Nov. 24, 1993, the United States demanded ROC authorities  slash tariffs on 699 U.S. imports. The ROC could not meet the  U.S. deadline, and officials from the two sides agreed to meet  in Washington on Jan. 19-20 for tariff negotiations.    Meanwhile, Economics Minister P.K. Chiang plans to convene  an  intra-ministerial meeting on Jan. 13 to discuss protection of  intellectual proierty rights (IPR).    Chiang said the U.S. might hold unofficial discussions on  the  IPR issue with ROC delegates during the Washington negotiations.  He hopes that the ROC delegation can convince their American  counterparts about the ROC's determination to guarantee IPR  protection in Taiwan.</p>

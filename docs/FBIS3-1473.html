			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M Schnehage] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg Mar 28 SAPA -- The African National  Congress [ANC] on Monday blamed the earlier killing of Zulu  marchers outside the ANC's head office, Shell House in  Johannesburg, the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the South  African Police [SAP].    Thousands of Zulus surged through Johannesburg's streets on  Monday and eight marchers were shot dead outside the ANC's head  office.    The ANC claimed at a press conference the police had been  told armed marchers planned to advance on the ANC's offices.    A statement issued at the conference said Police  Commissioner  Gen Johan van der Merwe had been told on March 27 "of the  dangers, and he undertook to ensure adequate measures were taken  to protect life and property".    The ANC said agreement had also been reached with Gen Koos  Calitz who had agreed to erect roadblocks to prevent armed  marchers from entering the central business district.    ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Chairman  Tokyo  Sexwale said the failure to erect these roadblocks had allowed  armed people to enter the city, which ultimately led to violence  and loss of life.    The ANC said police were deployed outside Shell House before  the shootings but had "disappeared" by the time firing started.    The organisation denied claims its members shot at marchers  from high-rise buildings in the central business district.  Journalists, peace monitors and witnesses claimed throughout  the day that marchers frequently came under sniper fire from  tall buildings.    The ANC said its regional offices in Jeppe Street had come  under fire early on Monday and security personnel had returned  fire. It claimed its Shell House head office came under fire  several times from Zulu marchers.    ANC officials said their security personnel initially fired  warning shots and then shot at a group of armed marchers when it  became evident they planned to attack the building. The ANC's  security personnel said they saw other Zulu marchers remove the  weapons of the slain men in full view of the police.    The ANC defended its security personnel's actions and said  although it regretted the shootings "our security personnel  behaved with impeccable forebearance and patience in the face of  extreme provocation".    The organisation claimed Monday's incident was part of a  "general campaign to destabilise the PWV region and to revive  the climate of terror and violence that plagued this region over  the past four years".    It claimed the "purpose of its perpetrators are crystal  clear  -- to make it impossible to hold free and fair elections which  will clearly demonstrate whom the people of South Africa want as  their government".    The ANC also questioned the "timing of this fresh campaign  of  violence" which it said followed closely on the heels of the  exposure of the so-called "third force". It also suggested the  role played by the IFP's regional leadership in the day's events  could not be seen as "accidental".</p>

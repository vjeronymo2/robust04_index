			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Egypt and Syria oppose renewed war PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Mr Hafez al Assad, his Syrian counterpart, yesterday said they opposed renewed military action against Iraq, in an apparent signal to the US and its allies to cool talk of such a step. Mr Assad, long at loggerheads with Iraq said after several rounds of talks with his Egyptian counterpart: 'We are not prepared to support military action against Iraq.' Mr Mubarak echoed his words, saying: 'Supporting the use of force, we are against it.' Syria and Egypt both sent ground forces to join the coalition which ousted Iraq from Kuwait, but are now cautioning restraint because of fears that renewed conflict might fuel instability in the region. The five permanent members of the Security Council have become increasingly frustrated over Iraq's tardiness in complying with Gulf war ceasefire terms which require the destruction of its nuclear, chemical and ballistic missile facilities. The US and Britain have revived talk of military action in order to exert additional pressure on Baghdad. Mr Assad said, meanwhile, that Syria would continue to participate in Middle East peace talks with Israel, but he doubted Israel's sincerity. Damascus had been threatening to withdraw over what it claims is Israeli intransigence.</p>

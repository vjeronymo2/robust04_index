			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> ROBERT ADAMS: A ROMANTIC COMES TO GRIPS WITH ECOLOGY  </P> <P> In the mid 1800s, the arts lauded nature's innocence with images of exotic  retreats and land unaltered by man. It's hard to imagine how the brooding  idealism of the Romantic Age might have reconciled contemporary realities like  Three Mile Island or Yosemite peppered with plastic foam instead of summer  snow.  </P> <P> In the works of nationally acclaimed photographer Robert Adams, romanticism  comes to grips with ecology. The 200 photographs that make up Adams'  retrospective exhibition, "To Make It Home: Photos of the American West," show  a sublime and still nature in an uneasy truce with mankind's often ungraceful  presence. The national traveling show, at the County Museum of Art (to July  16), surveys works from the mid-'60s to the mid-'80s, organized by the Alfred  Stieglitz Center at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.  </P> <P> Adams was born in 1937, fought polio and asthma as a child and became a college  English professor. He took up the camera in 1965 as a way to record his  frustration as the natural beauty of his hometown Denver fell prey to suburban  progress. His earliest images recorded what he calls "prairie structures,"  desolate churches and motels isolated against billowing expanses of western sky  and open terrain.  </P> <P> By 1969 his prints were in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New  York; by the early '70s Adams was included in important landscape photography  shows at MOMA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Today he is considered among  the foremost chroniclers of the American West.  </P> <P> Adams' ancestors were among the first to settle and explore the West, so in the  late '60s he set out to photograph the so-called First Range of the Rocky  Mountains. Majestic and forbidding like most of Adams' imagery, these peaks  were the first obstacle met by early pioneers moving west. These were the peaks  that inspired Kathryn Lee Bates to write "America the Beautiful," but Adams'  perverse lens captures the slapdash track homes that greedy speculators put up  by the hundreds just below them. An excellent work depicts a huge canopy of  crystalline sky and a low slung horizon where we make out an empty drive-in  theater dwarfed and made banal by the spectacular walls of granite looming just  behind.  </P> <P> Works from the subsequent "Denver" suite capture resilient cottonwood trees,  wild shrubs or airborne geese surviving in the midst of burgeoning city life.  One of the most compelling images in the exhibition depicts a rural expanse  roughly titled "Burning Oil Sludge."  </P> <P> Adamantly anti-nuclear and pro-environment, Adams' politics lie heavy in the  1979 collection "Our Lives and Our Children: Photographs Taken Near the Rocky  Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant." Skewed camera angles and selective cropping seem  to distort the faces of pregnant mothers and romping children, giving the  candid photos a quiet desperation one also senses in Adams' writings about  nuclear threat.  </P> <P> The sweeping, poetic images in the series "Summer Nights," "Prairie" and "From  the Missouri River West" are not so placard-toting. Their ideological stand  comes from soothing, tender vistas of bucolic western sites that look coaxed  from nature. A lovely atmospheric view of the undulating Missouri River,  moonlit farm houses and a sharp, linear shot of a Nebraska school house reveal  that Adams' stance is ultimately hopeful and that he is, above all, a sensitive  technician, respectful of light as the revealer of photographic form and  structure.  </P></p>

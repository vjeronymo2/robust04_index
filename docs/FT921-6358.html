			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Eight former Soviet republics join UN: International recognition cited as most important proof of independent statehood EIGHT former Soviet republics today take their seats at the United Nations, sensitive to the fact that they have few other attributes of full statehood. Bright republican flags - the most colourful symbol of statehood - were on proud display at a Moscow hotel yesterday for a meeting of parliamentary deputies from the Commonwealth of Independent States. Most delegates, speaking the fluent Russian which remains their lingua franca, cited recognition by other countries as the most important proof of their newly won independence. 'A process of independence has begun and through international recognition a republic gains self confidence,' explained Mr Ashot Dzhazovian, from the Armenian embassy in Moscow (few republics have embassies further afield). Indeed, the eight - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - still share many of the features of a unitary state. They have no formal borders, although they have lots of informal trade barriers. They have no armies, although Armenia and Azerbaijan are virtually at war over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Together with the other seven republics, they share a currency which carries the name of an extinct country - the Soviet Union. Although richer organisations such as the European Community see a common currency as desirable, some of the former republics, led by Ukraine, see a separate currency as the sine qua non of independence. Others, such as Kazakhstan, are willing to give the rouble a chance, but are taking steps to build up their currencies, gold reserves and central banks. Some, such as Armenia, are too poor to establish their own financial systems. Few can afford their own armies. Ironically, the only state without a UN seat after today will be Georgia, which, despite its strong national identity, has no legitimate government following the overthrow of its dictatorial president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The three republics which already have UN seats are among those with the greatest problems in adjusting to statehood. Ukraine has been busily promoting symbols of independence, but its haste in creating its own army may yet split the commonwealth, while plans to issue its own banknotes may trigger a currency war. Belarus remains the least plausible of the independent states, simply because it has no national tradition. Russia, with its centuries-old history, is having trouble extracting a new identity from the ruins of the Soviet Union, whose UN seat it now occupies.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Coal fund allows managers to choose 'sweet equity' CIN Management, the company set up to manage the pension scheme of the coal industry, allows the managers of its venture capital fund CIN Venture to invest in projects alongside pensioners while choosing only the most lucrative part of each deal. The practice is approved by the trustees of the pension scheme, including representatives of the National Union of Miners and is not uncommon among venture capital fund managers, according to industry experts. It emerges in a document circulated by one of CINVEN's rivals. CIN's venture capital managers are permitted to use their own money to invest in the same deals as pensioners but may restrict their funds to the highest yielding 'sweet equity' of each deal, avoiding the lower yielding loan stock. Advisers who help investors find venture capital funds frown on the practise. 'Taking just the sweet equity has its dangers and it reduces the returns to investors. On the good deals, it bites in a lot,' said one venture capital adviser. 'But the worst is the double-dip, where the manager gets sweet equity plus carried interest.' CINVEN, unlike most other venture capital fund managers, does not allow its managers to profit from so-called 'carried interest'. That represents a share, usually 20 per cent, of all profits earned once a certain rate of return is achieved, and is usually even more lucrative than co-investment arrangements. CINVEN, the UK's second largest venture capital investor, with roughly Pounds 800m under management, is a bellwether of the industry. It handles roughly 4 per cent or Pounds 600m of the Coal Board's pension scheme. It also manages Pounds 120m of British Rail Pension Scheme assets and roughly Pounds 75m of Barclays Bank Pension Scheme assets. At CINVEN, fund managers are required to invest along with pensioners in each deal in equal proportion to pensioners and may not pick and choose among deals, a CINVEN spokesman said. Fund managers borrow from a single bank at commercial rates and pledge their shares as collateral. While fund managers have earned spectacular returns on some deals, such as the recent management buyout of Taunton Cider, there have been other deals where the investment has been lost completely.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (15): Group C - Germany The German squad has the look of a World Cup winner: the 1990 World Cup winner. Only two of the regulars from Italy - Pierre Littbarski and Klaus Augenthaler, both effectively retired - are missing. Manager Berti Vogts could field an entire team of Italy veterans. This may be a sensible policy of persevering with a settled winning side or it could be soccer sclerosis. The 1990 final team contained only four of the 13 men who lost the 1986 final against Argentina. All four are again in the German squad for the US. Three - Lothar Matth us (Bayern Munich), Andreas Brehme (Kaiserslautern) and Rudi Voller (Marseille) are 33 or older. The fourth is Thomas Berthold (29) of VfB Stuttgart. Indeed one might reasonably have expected more change. Since 1990 Vogts has had his pick of the experienced East German internationals. Only two - Matthias Sammer (Borussia Dortmund) and Ulf Kirsten (Bayer Leverkusen) - are in his squad. The attack will depend heavily on Jurgen Klinsmann (Monaco) who scored both goals in a recent win over Italy. His likely partner is Karlheinz Riedle (Borussia Dortmund) whose form has dipped in the last couple of years. The youngest of the five strikers Vogts named in his original squad is Kirsten and he is 28 and has only a handful of caps. Stefan Kuntz (Kaiserslautern) is 31 and did not win his first cap until this season. He offers age without experience. Perhaps, after three consecutive final appearances expectations are so high that Vogts dare not experiment with youth. On the other hand his selection could be a pragmatic reaction to a lack of young German talent. Germany never rose above the general awfulness of 1992's European championships but still reached the final. Since then they have played only friendlies so it is difficult to establish a form line. But they continue to achieve results, apart from a blip against Ireland. They were ripped apart by Brazil in Los Angeles last June but salvaged a 3-3 draw. Even though they lack pazzazz, the Germans know how to get results. Most of all they believe in themselves. Franz Beckenbauer, coach of the 1990 team, said recently: I don't really see much real competition for our team.' They could be back in LA in July.</p>

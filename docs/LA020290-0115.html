			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH FLEEING COPTER SHOT BY POLICE OFFICER  </P> <P> An unarmed 15-year-old was shot and wounded early Thursday by a Los Angeles  police officer in a confusing incident that began when the youth fled after  mistakenly thinking a police helicopter was chasing him. The youth ignored  commands to halt and then appeared to rush at an officer, officials said.  </P> <P> The youth was identified as Eric Davis, who was shot once in the lower body. He  underwent surgery at UCLA Medical Center and was in serious condition, a  hospital spokesman said.  </P> <P> The shooting took place at 12:25 a.m. near the Mid-City apartment building  where Davis lives, shortly after police responded to a report of a car being  burglarized on Venice Boulevard near Rimpau Boulevard, authorities said. Police  said Davis and a 15-year-old companion heard the helicopter and mistakenly  believed it was after them for selling cocaine.  </P> <P> Officers Theodore McHenry, 31, and Alicia Handy, 26, who were searching for car  burglars, both fired shots when the youth came toward them "with both hands  near his front waist band area," LAPD spokesman Don Lawrence said.  Investigators were not sure Thursday which officer shot Davis.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Kurayshan from Tunis] </F>   [Text] At a meeting this afternoon in Tunis, the PLO  Executive Committee approved a program for the National  Authority that will run the self-rule areas. The PLO Executive  Committee is the party to which this authority reports.  However, according to a Palestinian official, it is not  expected that the Executive Committee will be consulted on every  small and significant affair as long as operations go on  according to the program that was endorsed.    A new name was added today to the 14 ministerial portfolios  announced at a late hour yesterday evening. The new figure is  Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad, who was assigned the portfolio  of transportation and communications.    The final decision of Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, who was offered  the  portfolio of information, is not known yet. Dr. Samir Ghawshah,  member of the Executive Committee and the National Authority,  said the final reply of Mrs. 'Ashrawi may be given after her  return to Jerusalem.    Abu-Nidal Musallami, member of the Central Committee of the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who is currently  in Tunisia, denied categorically to us that it is possible for  him to join the National Authority, as was rumored here in the  past two days. He said this news was baseless.    This evening's session of the National Authority is expected  to be the last. This session is expected to distribute the rest  of the ministerial portfolios, which are 22, and to form the  Authority, in which 20 out of 24 members, under 'Arafat's  leadership, have been appointed so far.</p>

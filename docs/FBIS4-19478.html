			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by Yalcin Ozer: "A Policy Goes Bankrupt"] </F>   [Excerpts] Cem Boyner, a leading young businessman, has  said the following about the economic stability package  announced by Ciller: "With this package our politicians are  telling the people that they were not able to run the country  properly."    It is true. However, there is a positive aspect to this. In  previous years, it was military regimes that imposed such heavy  measures. This time, a civilian government is trying to correct  a bankrupt policy it took over from other civilian politicians.  [passage omitted]    Another thing our country can be pleased about is that the  citizens no longer trust politicians who lie. The citizens are  more able to grasp the truth now. They will no longer vote for  any politician promising everyone "two keys" [for a house and a  car, as promised by Demirel when he was True Path Party leader].    Tansu Ciller said: "I will definitely defeat terrorism in  the  economy. I am preparing a bitter medicine for you." And she  won the elections.    We believe that this is a good sign and a guarantee for the  future of democracy in Turkey as well. Our democracy seems to  have matured to a point where the civilians clean up the mess  made by other civilians.    We must not forget that another mature element is the Social  Democratic Populist Party. Displaying maturity, the party set  aside social policies and bowed before economic rules.    However, we still want to remind our readers to beware of  lying politicians. They might influence innocent citizens.  Their remarks might be effective given the fact that the  livelihood of many will be disturbed.    We want the government to be just, however. The Turkish  people are extremely sensitive about this. The sacrifices must  be distributed evenly. The package is a good opportunity to  correct the salary injustices that have been going on for years.  For example, while the package foresees that many workers will  be laid off, Central Bank employees receive double salaries  every two months. That is not fair.    If the government implements them justly and vigorously,  there is no reason why the measures should not succeed.</p>

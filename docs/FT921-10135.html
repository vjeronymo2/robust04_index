			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Europe-wide union mergers forecast MR BILL JORDAN, president of the AEU engineering union, yesterday predicted that mergers between unions of different European countries were likely following the creation of the single market, Michael Smith writes. Mr Jordan said 1992 had set in motion an unstoppable process. He predicted that mergers of European unions would happen within his lifetime. Mr Jordan was speaking before holding talks in Dusseldorf with Mr Franz Steinkuhler, president of IG Metall, the German manufacturing union. They were discussing the merger of the AEU and the EETPU electricians' union, likely to take place within three months, and the relationship between the merged union and IG Metall. In a recent campaign to win shorter hours, the UK unions drew lessons from a similar drive by West German unions in the mid 1980s. Mr Jordan said he saw the merged union of 1m members working even more closely with IG Metall. He said: 'Together we will forge a partnership that will meet and match the growing power of multi-national companies. 'But there is a positive message for Europe's employers; that the aims of this engineering union alliance are simply the best pay, conditions and products in the world.' Letters, Page 13</p>

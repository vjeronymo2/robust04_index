			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Tan Jianrong: "Japan's Ruling Coalition Moving </F> To Heal Rift"]    [Text] Tokyo, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The eight-month-old  seven- party ruling coalition, which was on the brink of  collapse over the selection of a successor to departing Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, is moving to grope for ways to keep  the alliance intact, political sources said today.    The coalition has reportedly arrived at a consensus on  continuing consultations on the premise that Deputy Prime  Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata be jointly supported  as the single candidate for the premiership which Hosokawa  abruptly quit last Friday [8 April].    After days of infighting since last Friday, the two rival  camps -- one led by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the  other led by Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) -- voiced their  wishes yesterday to restore their unity and to agree to nominate  Hata to succeed Hosokawa, the sources said.    The SDP-led caucus also includes the new party Sakigake  (Harbinger) and the Democratic Socialist Party. It is pitted  against the Shinseito-led bloc that includes Komeito (Clean  Government Party), the Japan New Party (JNP) and the United  Social Democratic Party.    The move toward reconciliation apparently reflects the  failure of either coalition camp to find a prime ministerial  candidate who could gain enough votes from the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to emerge on top.    "I'm pretty sure we can resolve our problems and maintain  our  coalition government," SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo said  yesterday.    Kubo's Shinseito counterpart, Ichiro Ozawa, told reporters,  "everything is going in the right direction," indicating the  bikering among the coalition partners over the choice of  Hosokawa's successor was ending.    Because of this new development, chances slimmed markedly  for  senior LDP member Michio Watanabe to run for the office of the  new prime minister.    Watanabe, a former deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, was tipped one of the most promising contenders for  the premiership if he bolted from the LDP with enough followers  to join hands with the Shinseito-led camp.    However, the Shinseito camp began yesterday to abandon their  plans to back Watanabe in view of the slim possibility of his  leaving the largest opposition party to team up with them.    Inside the coalition, the two rival camps had separately  tried to woo members of the LDP, which lost power last summer  after an uninterrupted 38 years of single-party rule.    None of the three groups -- the two coalition camps and the  LDP -- has the parliamentary majority necessary to choose the  next prime minister on its own.    The Shinseito-led faction only has 157 members in the  511-seat House of Representatives. So a reneging Watanabe would  have had to persuade at least 95 LDP members to vote for him to  add to the support from the Shinseito-led camp.    But Watanabe had reportedly collected only some 20  signatories willing to defect by the time he gave up his bid for  the top government post.    Despite the broad agreement in the ruling coalition,  differences reportedly remain over the procedures for settling  the successor issue. It has not been decided yet whether the  matter will be addressed in a forum of secretaries general of  the coalition parties, or through direct talks among the leaders  of all the seven ruling parties.    The SDP-led block abhors Shinseito's Ozawa, the main  strategist in the Hosokawa administration. It has been  insisting on a meeting of all coalition leaders, apparently in  an attempt to prevent shinseito's Ozawa and his main political  ally, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa from taking the  lead in the picking of a replacement for Hosokawa.    Shinseito and Komeito, for their part, remain adamant  contending for a secretaries general-level caucus to discuss the  matter first.</p>

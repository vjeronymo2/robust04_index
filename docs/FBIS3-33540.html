			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economist Julio Carranza by mobile unit </F> reporter Mariela Diaz; place not given -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Diaz] Carranza, do you think a change in Cuban  money would solve the excess currency problem? I would also like  to know your opinion concerning the possible creation of a Cuban  hard currency certificate, at an exchange rate still to be  determined, and if this is possible, would it the exchange rate  be adequate?    [Carranza] You are asking two complex questions. And first  of  all, these are my personal opinions. I think any of these  measures you mentioned would be valid but only to the extent  that they come within a context of measures and are part of a  sufficiently coherent strategy. As I had said before, the  economy is a system, and the economy does not operate on  singular measures, but on well-prepared strategies within which  the different measures are interconnected, playing a  supplementary role, and this is what makes the decisions within  the economic policy effective in the medium- and long-term, and  also in the short-term. Thus, concerning the question about a  change in currency, or about the freeze of bank accounts, my  answer is that it depends on the manner in which the measure is  implemented; it depends on the context of the strategy adopted.    Taking this into consideration, whether it is part of an  adequate strategy, surely a change in currency could be one of  the measures that would help restore the country's financial  balance. However, this very answer leads me to a second  consideration: that there can be different types of hard  currency exchange systems. There are different ways of  exchanging currency. It has to do with the amount of money, and  the way to handle the future hard currency certificate. There  are also a set of technical matters that must be considered, and  they would also depend on the set of measures to be adopted.    The same thing would happen concerning a freeze of bank  accounts during a given period. I would say that discussions on  a well-prepared proposal, concerning the strategy for the  country's economic feasibility, contemplate these measures, but  in a general manner and not as a specific singular measure.    [Diaz] Would you say the same thing on the possible creation  of a convertible Cuban hard currency certificate?    [Carranza] Monetary problems of the economy are the most  complex of any economic system. As a consequence of the  necessary measures adopted over the past few years to  counterbalance the current crisis, Cuba has in fact authorized  the circulation of two different currencies in the country.  That is, the peso and the rest of the other currencies, which  are convertible currencies, the most common of which is the  dollar, as you know. This brings into the economy an abnormal  situation which has been necessary because of the crisis  situation as we have already explained it on different occasions.    I think that, concerning money circulation, the strategic  idea would be to recover normalcy within the country's monetary  structure, and to achieve this, we must seek the reestablishment  of a single currency in the country. This is my opinion. And  when I say a single currency, I am saying it in strategic terms,  referring to a a single money, a Cuban currency that will have  no other parallel. This does not mean, in strategic terms, that  possession of currency will be penalized. Possession of currency  is one thing, while circulation of currency is quite another  thing. One thing is that a citizen can legally have a given  amount of currency, but it is a different thing to have this  money to use as a means of exchange in the economy. This money,  or the circulation of it, is what I believe must be changed into  a single currency. Between these currencies, there is the  possibility of creating this Cuban currency you mentioned, which  would create a better situation than what we have now, because  it would be a Cuban currency which would be under better  control. But in a more strategic context, I think we must strive  for a single currency that would deal with the exchange rate of  the Cuban peso, and which will comply with Cuba's true economic  demands and its relations with other countries.    [Diaz] But Julio, suppose the money is collected one way or  another. I think nothing will be achieved with the money that  remains and which has no commercial value. That is, we must  necessarily try to increase production, to increase supply. How  can the current economic situation be improved when there is a  scarcity of resources and inefficiency prevails. And how long  would this recovery take place? Could it be achieved this year?    [Carranza] Look, every time this subject is brought up, many  people rightly say that ultimately the crisis will be solved by  increasing production. And I believe this is a correct opinion.  But before that we must ask a question, which I think is a key  question: How are we going to create the conditions to increase  production? That is the problem. If production could be  increased by decree, then the crisis would obviously be solved  because the problem after all is a production problem. But what  the economy must do is to restore the conditions for promoting  production. And here is where all the discussions must focus on  the measures to be adopted, either short- or long-term measures.  I think in a first stage -- which will begin when the National  Assembly of the People's Government adopts the appropriate  measures -- the objective will not be and could not be to  increase production, but to restore the balance. What do we have  within the current situation of financial imbalance? The  economic upturn process is a very complex task. Under a given  condition of greater economic balance, where salaries will  regain their purchasing power and where other conditions will be  created, we would be creating better conditions -- not just  conditions, but the best situation for a recovery process. Then,  this is the first condition I mentioned. We must restore the  financial balance and create the conditions to increase  production.    Everything that can be done, small actions that can allow us  to take small steps to increase production, especially the  efforts being made by workers following their revolutionary  awareness, is very important. But in general terms, we must  recover the balance to push national production forward. This is  the first point, and I am going to the second point.    Concerning financial recovery, in order to make an  evaluation  of a possible recovery of the economy, we need, among other  things, statistical data which I do not have at hand at this  moment. Had I known some details perhaps I could give you a more  authoritative analysis, but I need some statistical data. But  what I can say is that under current conditions production  recovery is a complex and complicated problem. It demands much  effort. I must also say that although the objective is to grow,  we must focus on the recovery of the financial balance.    I also think that we must also take into account the fact  that the Cuban economy has dropped considerably over the past  few years. I can say that it dropped approximately 40 percent,  and so the economy is already experiencing a tremendous  downswing, and going lower than that will be very difficult.  That is, we are experiencing the lowest level, and for this  reason I believe that a new process could begin in a  medium-term, a process of change in the economic policy, of a  slow upturn until, to the extent that the conditions are  created, production is increased in a more effective manner in  the medium term.    I want to add something which I consider important. It has  been said that the Cuban international situation is very  complicated because of the blockade, and because of the  severance of relations we used to have with the socialist block,  therefore Cuba depends on a recovery of its production. I want  to say that these factors are very important, but as I said the  first day, regardless of the different forms of internal  production, despite the different economic policies, and despite  the difficult international relations, the country can give a  different productive answer. And this is the effort I believe we  must make, because the economic policy and the organization of  the productive areas depend on us and not on the world  situation, although the latter might be very important.</p>

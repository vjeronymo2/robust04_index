			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA RESIDENTS ASSAIL NEW DUMP PLANS;  </P> <P> SANITATION: CRITICS SAY THE COUNTY IS IGNORING RECYCLING AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES  BY PROPOSING LANDFILLS IN NEARBY CANYONS.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County sanitation officials are misguidedly planning new garbage  dumps in the Santa Clarita Valley instead of encouraging recycling and other  alternatives to landfills in scenic mountain canyons, valley residents charged  Wednesday night.  </P> <P> At a public hearing attended by more than 200 people, public officials and  private citizens denounced the draft of an environmental impact report which  said landfills could be safely operated in Towsley Canyon and Elsmere Canyon,  both just outside the city of Santa Clarita.  </P> <P> State Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), in a letter read by aide Mark Matta,  noted that a new study found that Towsley Canyon was located within a rich  forest worthy of being a state park. The study by the Department of Parks and  Recreation, released Tuesday, concluded that 8,000 acres of the Santa Susana  Mountains west of Santa Clarita deserve protection because of their abundant  and unusual plants and wildlife.  </P> <P> The draft environmental impact report prepared by the Los Angeles County  Sanitation Districts, does not address the impact of a garbage dump on the  canyon, Davis said.  </P> <P> Officials of the Sanitation Districts have billed the report as a comprehensive  plan to reduce and dispose of garbage in the county.  </P> <P> But Santa Clarita City Councilwoman Jill Klajic and other speakers said the  report gives scant attention to recycling and innovative concepts in handling  garbage, such as hauling it by rail to remote desert locations. "Instead, you  rely on stale concepts and dangerous proposals," Klajic said.  </P> <P> Wednesday night's meeting at the William S. Hart High School auditorium, the  fifth public hearing on the draft, was scheduled after Santa Clarita officials  and County Supervisor Mike Antonovich complained that the first four hearings  were held outside the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> The environmental impact report, which could be completed early next year, also  said landfills could be located in Blind Canyon above Chatsworth and in three  canyons -- Mission, Rustic and Sullivan -- in the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P></p>

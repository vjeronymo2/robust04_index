			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Green light for Cariplo in Rolo bid The Bank of Italy has given the go-ahead for the L3,291bn (Dollars 2bn) bid for Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the Bologna-based commercial bank, launched by a consortium headed by Cariplo, Italy's largest savings bank. The bid still requires the approval of Consob, the stock exchange watchdog, but this is unlikely to be withheld. The main issue is whether Credito Italiano, the recently-privatised bank that initiated a takeover battle for Rolo, will raise the stakes. Credito has already improved its original offer, but it is still 18 per cent below that of Cariplo. The consortium led by Cariplo is made up of IMI, the partly privatised banking institution; Carisbo, the regional savings bank covering the Emilia Romagna region; and Reale Mutua, the insurance group. The bid, launched just before Christmas, is for 70 per cent of Rolo's equity and would leave Cariplo with 52 per cent of the shares at an anticipated cost of L2,400bn. The official prospectus is likely to be released early next week, probably on January 3. Analysts believe Credito would find it difficult to improve the Cariplo offer on its own. However, they consider it still possible for allies to be brought in to help capture the prize of one of Italy's most profitable regional banks.</p>

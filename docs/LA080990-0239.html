Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ISRAEL TESTS U.S.-BACKED ROCKET  </P> <P> In a dramatic response to Iraqi threats, Israel today launched the first test  of the U.S.-financed Arrow missile that is being developed to combat  short-range ballistic missiles.  </P> <P> Israel radio said the missile was launched at 3:40 p.m. at an undisclosed  location.  </P> <P> It left a short trail of fire and a small ring of smoke, said a radio reporter.  </P> <P> The radio report said the launch was a direct response to Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein's threat on Wednesday to launch a missile attack on Israel.  Saddam made the threat after alleging that Israeli warplanes had been painted  with American colors in preparation for an attack on Iraq.  </P> <P> Today's missile launching was attended by officials from Israel Aircraft  Industries, which is developing the Arrow, and by American representatives, the  report said.  </P> <P> Washington provided 80% of the $158-million cost of the first phase of the  project.  </P></p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Daimler faces cultural upheaval  -Schrempp's Dasa initiatives could follow him When Mr Jurgen Schrempp walks through the front door of Daimler-Benz's Stuttgart headquarters next May to take over as chairman, he is likely to provoke a cultural revolution inside Germany's biggest industrial group, as he has done during the past five years at its aerospace subsidiary, Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa). The chain-smoking, 49-year-old head of Dasa was always seen as a front runner in the race to succeed Mr Edzard Reuter as chairman of Daimler. He was regarded as Mr Reuter's favourite since he was chosen in 1989 to lead Daimler's risky expansion into the aerospace business. The only other serious contender for the top job was Mr Helmut Werner, 57, the head of Mercedes-Benz, the vehicle subsidiary. From the beginning, Mr Schrempp brought to Dasa a tough, no-nonsense US management style coupled with a high political profile. This helped him negotiate concessions from unions, lobby his country's political establishment at a time of growing uncertainty over Germany's commitment to new military programmes, and launch a series of international alliances, joint ventures and acquisitions to restore Dasa, and Germany, to the forefront of the international aerospace industry. Unlike many Stuttgart-based Daimler top executives, he has made a point of communicating with his workforce and outsiders in a frank and open way. On Tuesday, he managed to win union agreement for another 10,300 job cuts and six plant closures at Dasa. Mr Schrempp has never been frightened to speak his mind. At Dasa he would regularly discuss the problems of the industry and his group with his workers over a beer. Before he was asked by Mr Reuter to lead Daimler's role in restructuring the German aerospace industry, he ruffled feathers at Stuttgart when, as head of Daimler's South African operations, he opposed the company's discriminatory employment policies. Mr Schrempp has always regarded his time in South Africa as one of his most successful achievements at Daimler, which he joined in 1967. Before being given the daunting task of running Dasa, he had spent his career in the group's motor vehicle operations, rising to become number two at the truck division. He also had a stint in the US in charge of a Daimler commercial vehicle subsidiary in Cleveland, Ohio, which he restructured and sold off. But Dasa has undoubtedly been both Mr Schrempp's and Mr Reuter's biggest industrial gamble. In five years, Mr Schrempp managed to restructure at breakneck speed the various components of the German aerospace industry absorbed by Daimler into a coherent group which is Europe's biggest aerospace company and the world's number three. Convinced that collaboration and consolidation was the only way ahead for the aerospace industry, Mr Schrempp forged a strategic alliance with Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US in the aero-engine sector. He also combined his helicopter business with those of Aerospatiale of France to create Eurocopter, brought some Airbus final assembly to Hamburg, and acquired a majority in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, to give Dasa leadership in the European regional jet business. He is now discussing space and missiles alliances with Aerospatiale. Mr Schrempp was instrumental in getting the Airbus partners to open discussions with Boeing on jointly developing a superjumbo airliner capable of carrying 800 passengers or more. But Daimler's drive into the aerospace business to turn Germany, in Mr Schrempp's own words, into 'an equal partner with the world leaders and no longer a junior partner,' has come at a high cost. When he took over at Dasa, the aerospace industry was flying high with record orders for commercial aircraft and a strong defence market. But within a year, both the civil and defence markets slumped into the worst downturn in the industry since the second world war. Mr Schrempp found himself in the hot seat. Not only did he have to pursue Germany's expansionary ambitions in aerospace, but also restructure the business to adapt to the new difficult circumstances facing the industry. If there has been a reassessment in Germany and within Daimler of its adventure into aerospace, it has not changed both Mr Reuter's and Mr Schrempp's long-term strategic vision. 'I am comfortable with the strategy but the market is very difficult,' Mr Schrempp said a few months ago. Lex, Page 28</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 10 (AFP) -- The leaders of the 16 NATO  countries on Monday [10 January] signed a document inviting  former communist states to join the so-called Partnership for  Peace as a possible precursor to full NATO membership.    The invitation and framework agreement is to serve as the  basis for bilateral accords to be offered to Russia and its  ex-satellites allowing cooperation in military planning,  training and other activities.    It also provides for consultations in a crisis, but stops  short of giving security guarantees or promising full membership  eagerly sought by countries such as Poland, Hungary and the  Czech Republic.    "We reaffirm that the alliance...remains open to the  membership of other European states in a position to further the  principles of the treaty and to contribute to the security of  the North Atlantic area," the document said.    "We expect and would welcome NATO expansion that would reach  to democratic states to our east, as part of an evolutionary  process, taking into account political and security developments  in the whole of Europe.    "We therefore invite the other states participating in the  NACC and other CSCE countries able and willing to contribute to  this programme, to join with us in this partnership," it said,  referring to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council.    The document sets out broad principles with which all  members  must comply -- including respect for democracy, and transparency  in budget and defence policymaking.    Individual countries can then negotiate bilateral accords  with NATO on how and to what extent they will participate in the  Partnership's activities.    Participation can include joint military operations from  next  year, and sending permanent representatives to NATO headquarters  here to take part in military planning.    The document added: "Active participation in the Partnership  for Peace will play an important role in the evolutionary  process of the expansion of NATO."</p>

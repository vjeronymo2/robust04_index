			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Leading Article: Europe and the Maghreb Europe's leaders need urgently to cast their eyes southward. The virtual civil war in Algeria and the threat that similar struggles could take place in neighbouring north African countries are matters of concern not just for Europe's Mediterranean states, but for the whole continent. The European Union has a strong interest in ensuring that the Maghreb region retains a pro-western orientation, reinforced by commitment to democracy and open economies. All three principles are put at risk by the increasingly brutal confrontation between Islamic extremists and secular forces in Algeria. Close to 4,000 lives have been lost in the past two years. France recently advised its remaining 2,000 citizens in Algeria to leave. In January 1992, the Algerian army denied power to the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) by suspending elections it was expected to win. There is a pressing requirement for a solution under which the FIS is allowed to participate in the democratic process in exchange for a renunciation of terrorism. Otherwise, the danger will grow of instability spilling over into Morocco and Tunisia - and possibly beyond. The disorder in Algeria, a particular anxiety for France, the former colonial power, could have repercussions on Italy, Spain and Portugal, which rely on Algeria for natural gas. On a wider scale, the twin dangers of large-scale emigration from north Africa and the spread of regional disturbances to immigrant communities abroad have worrying implications throughout the Union. This turbulence brings another trial for the EU's nascent common foreign and security policy, already found wanting in the fires of the former Yugoslavia. The EU can do little about the root causes of Islamic fundamentalism. But it can turn some of its attention away from eastern Europe and seek some coherence among the fragmented initiatives of its member states. The EU's main message should be the urgency of linking economic and political reforms. The EU says it wants elections in Algeria within two years, but the possibility cannot be ignored that the FIS may take power sooner. This strengthens the case for speedy steps to restructure the economy, which the army-backed regime has put in abeyance. An accord between Algeria and the International Monetary Fund is now in prospect which should pave the way for rescheduling the country's Dollars 26bn foreign debt and for a balance of payments loan from the EU to offset this year's shortfall in Algeria's oil revenues. The EU should make sure that this IMF process is not delayed or undermined. In parallel, the Union must give fresh impetus to attempts started five years ago to open up trade with north Africa. This drive has lost momentum as a result of the European recession, Spanish anxiety about competition for its fishermen and farmers, and the emphasis on trying to liberalise trade with eastern Europe. Ultimately, the Union's efforts to ensure a stable, peaceful and prosperous Maghreb will succeed only if the people there see direct rewards from closer ties with Europe. If the EU fails to number north Africa among its most pressing priorities, it will lose its chance - perhaps for a very long time - of influencing events in a region whose destiny will remain closely linked to its own.</p>

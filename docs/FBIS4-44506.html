According to preliminary estimates, the GDP broke the  major 3 trillion yuan barrier. Fixed asset investments in the  whole society broke approximately 11.5 quadrillion yuan. The  fixed asset investment rate was about 37 percent. If we discount  the factor that investment item prices were higher than overall  prices and the factor of foreign firm investment, the fixed  asset investment rate for the entire society (hereinafter the  investment rate) still was as high as about 33 percent, 4-5  percentage points higher than the previous year's investment  rate. The obvious increase in the investment rate raised the  concern of several sectors. This brings up an acute problem:  Could two successive years of high investment rates lead to an  overheating of the overall economy and form serous inflation and  cause us once again to have to conduct overall improvement and  rectification and postpone reform? Comprehensive study of the  domestic and foreign situation could lead to this conclusion: As  China begins to enter the period of high investment before  economic takeoff, a high rate of investment is an inevitable  result of the current stage of economic development. Its  essential basis is:    I. Overcoming Bottlenecks Requires Added Investment    From 1980 to 1992, China's investment rate went from low to  high. To counter some years in which the investment rate reached  30-32 percent creating economic overheating and setting off  inflation, beginning from actual experience, people arrived at  the awareness that it is appropriate for China's investment rate  not to exceed 30 percent. We should say that holding it within  these limits for a very long period of time has been  fundamentally reasonable. Looking back on a year in which an  excessively high investment rate touched off serious economic  problems, it was all from excessive investment in some  government buildings and processing industries squeezing out  normal consumer demands causing inflation in both consumption  and investment and allocation of funds exceeding the total  amount that could be allocated to production. After more than a  decade of arduous efforts, the scale of China's processing  industry production generally reached the capability of  satisfying normal consumer demand and in certain industries it  generally reached saturation. But possible development in fund  [as written; basic?] industry and infrastructure did not  correspondingly keep pace and bottlenecks in transportation,  energy, and raw materials development restricted economic  development and progress in reform and opening up. It is idle  talk to speak of wanting to promote further economic growth  without developing the infrastructure and overcoming short-term  restrictions. Because the time limit on basic industries and  infrastructure is long, the investment of a large amount cannot  be put into operation in a short period of time like processing  industries. Generally it requires five to seven years of  development. So, to get by infrastructure barriers, it is  necessary to go through a stage of high investment. There is not  a second way that can be chosen.    II. Savings Have Clearly Rebounded, Providing Sources  of Funding for Investment    Statistical data reveal that the overall savings rate for  the  whole society in 1980 was 35.6 percent. By 1992 it had risen to  43.3 percent, rising nearly 8 percentage points. The ratio of  residents' savings in the broad sense to expendable income also  rose from 4.5 percent in 1978 to 32 percent in 1992. The  constant increase in the savings rate has provided investment  with a considerable source of funds.    Since the 1980s, changing trends in the overall consumption  rate (including social consumption and residential consumption)  more clearly confirm this problem. In the 1980s, the overall  consumption rate was rather high, averaging 60 percent and  above. After entering the 1990s, the overall consumption rate  declined to 60 percent and below and declined from year to year.  Contrary to this, the fixed asset investment rate for the whole  society rose straight up. According to preliminary 1993  calculations, the overall consumption rate declined to 55.4  percent and the overall investment rate rose to 37.8 percent.    The situation described above indicates that in the next  stage the overall consumption rate can be essentially maintained  at about 56-58 percent. If we take out the factor for reserves  and the balance of payments, the investment rate can be  maintained at about 35 percent, forming a high investment rate  stage. This also is a requirement for China's present launching  of international competition, preserving the advantage of cheap  labor, and maintaining a rather low consumption rate and high  investment rate.    III. To Realize 1994 Economic Growth Targets, It Is  Necessary To Maintain a High Investment Rate    It is forecast that 1994 will still be a year of rapid  economic growth. According to actual inherent economic forces,  the economic growth rate could be about 9 percent. At the same  time, with the push of demand and the pull of costs, prices also  will go up by about 10 percent. Calculated by the indicators  described above, the 1994 GDP could reach about 3.65 trillion  yuan. As regards use, because of the current stable growth of  consumption, calculating the consumption rate at 57 percent, the  total consumption could reach about 2.08 trillion yuan. With the  balance of payments maintained, after its use for consumption  and normal reserves, the GDP arranged for fixed asset investment  should be about 1.39 trillion yuan. According to these  calculations, an investment rate as high as 38 percent is the  inevitable result of an overall balance. If in a definite  production situation, the scale of fixed asset investment is  pushed down artificially low, it will inevitably lead to serious  overstocking and an aggravation of three sided debts, leading to  a slide in enterprise economic efficiency and treasury  difficulties. If fixed asset investments are forced down and we  want to guard against large increases in reserves, either there  will be a favorable trade balance or the rate of growth of 1994  production will decline. But a decline in the economic growth  rate also could forfeit the opportunity for rapid development,  and a large increase in exports and reducing imports also is  very difficult. So, the high investment rate is irreversible.  This is a result produced by conditions in several sectors.    Because the 1993 fixed asset investment base was too large,  even if the actual amount in 1994 remains the same as 1993, at  current values the investment scale will reach 1.265 trillion  yuan and the investment rate still will be as high as about 35  percent.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Letter: Competitive pricing Sir, In your story, 'OFT life insurance proposals,' (March 19) it is stated that the Office of Fair Trading said life companies should be obliged to allow low-cost sales outlets, such as building societies, to price their products more cheaply than other higher cost agents. Perhaps the OFT should have looked at what has happened to house and contents insurance, which is nearly always far more expensive if taken out through building societies than if arranged through a local insurance broker. Presumably the OFT considers the latter to be a higher cost agent. P S Leigh, BALPA Financial Services, 81 New Road, Hayes, Middlesex UB3 5BG</p>

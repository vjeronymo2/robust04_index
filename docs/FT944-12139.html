			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Russian cabinet shake-up looms: Changes in economics and justice portfolios under discussion A shake-up in the Russian cabinet was on the cards last night. Mr Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the state duma (lower house), said following a meeting with President Boris Yeltsin that a reshuffle would take place within one or two weeks. A spokesman for Mr Rybkin said after the meeting that the posts discussed included those of the economics and justice minister and 'a range of changes among the deputy prime ministers'. The economics portfolio is held by Mr Alexander Shokhin, a reformer who is now thought to be vulnerable but may retain his parallel post as deputy prime minister. The Itar-Tass news agency said the discussion took place in the context of a state duma vote of no-confidence in the government which failed by only 30 votes. Only 54 deputies from 450 actively voted for the government. It also comes after a Moscow by-election last weekend which was won by the candidate backed by the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party, and local elections in St Petersburg which saw a strong showing for the communists. Neither the nationalist nor the communist parties have any representative in the cabinet. The discussion between the duma chairman and Mr Yeltsin came after details emerged of the report on 'black Tuesday' by the Security Council commission, which is staffed wholly by military and security chiefs. On that day, October 11, the rouble plunged to Rbs4,000 to the dollar. It later recovered to around Rbs2,800 but has since declined again, if gently, to Rbs3,093. According to the presidential press service, the report accused a number of senior public servants of 'ill-timed, if not incompetent, decisions' and said that there was 'insufficient co-ordination between the federal bodies of the executive branch'. It ordered the government to take immediate control of the currency exchange rate and 'consolidate the legal backbone of the financial, including the currency, market'. The Interfax news agency, quoting 'well-informed sources', said that the Council's report named the economics and finance ministries, the central bank and several commercial banks as having 'profited directly and considerably from destabilising the national financial system'. The acting finance minister and the governor of the central bank both resigned after the collapse of the currency last month. The report says, according to Interfax's sources, that the collapse will 'entail long term and deep negative consequences for the Russian economy' because foreign investors 'now doubt the expediency of investing in Russia'. It recommended continuing investigation and, if necessary, criminal proceedings. Mr Rybkin, an increasingly authoritative figure, said that the sackings of the central bank governor and finance minister would be followed by 'bringing to book some of their deputies'. On Mr Shokhin's fate, he commented ominously that 'it will be decided by the government'. In discussions on the passage of the budget through the parliament, Mr Rybkin said that Mr Yeltsin had described as 'unconstitutional' the legal provision under which the government had to resign if the budget fell, and had called for the Constitutional Court, now being recreated after a year's non-existence, to look into the issue. The discussion appears to point to fears that the budget will not pass. Rumours abound about who would replace Mr Shokhin, but none point to his successor being a reformist figure. Since his removal would come following a report drawn up by representatives of the security services and the military, it is widely assumed that a more conservative figure would emerge  -with others of the same stripe possibly also taking their place in the cabinet. The discussion was remarkable for the absence of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin who, as prime minister, would be expected to command a cabinet apparently chosen by the president and the duma chairman.</p>

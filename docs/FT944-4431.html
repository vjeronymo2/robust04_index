			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Auditing changes aim to curb company fraud The role of the auditor faces its biggest reform for 15 years under proposals yesterday from the audit regulator to tackle fraud and improve the accuracy of company accounts. The Auditing Practices Board, which issues standards with the force of law, published measures to extend the scope of the audit in listed companies and tackle public scepticism over the effectiveness of auditors. Mr Ian Plaistowe, chairman of the board, said: 'The key to confidence in the capital markets is a sound independent audit function. The proposals in this paper set out to ensure that my profession fulfils this role to the full.' Professor Ian Percy, chairman of the task force that produced The Audit Agenda, said: 'The fundamental objective of auditing is to uphold the integrity of financial reporting and business conduct.' He said binding rules based on the report could be issued in 1996. The report follows on from the establishment of the Audit Practice Board in 1991 after a series of corporate collapses in which auditors were blamed for not detecting fraud or inherent financial difficulties. The report includes proposals to: Extend audit for listed companies to include scrutiny of the chairman's report. Order periodic special audits designed to catch fraud. Require the auditor to sign the accounts personally - not just use the name of the firm of accountants. Allow audit committees, which include non-executive directors, to appoint and set fees for auditors on behalf of the shareholders. Toughen up penalties for misleading auditors. Teach auditors how to spot fraud and fraudsters. Yesterday's report steps back from some of the more radical ideas floated in the controversial McFarlane Report of 1992. The report was immediately welcomed by Mr Gerry Acher, head of audit at KPMG Peat Marwick, who said it was more 'usable' than the earlier report. He added: 'I know that it may not be universally popular, but the suggestion that the partner should sign the audit report in his or her own name as well as in the name of the firm will help to focus minds on where responsibility really lies.' Mr Roger Davies, head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'The APB is getting into choppy waters in suggesting that audit committees of non-executive directors should have a Continental-style supervisory role in the board.'

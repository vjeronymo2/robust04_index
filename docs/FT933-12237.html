			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Israel pounds Hizbollah bases ISRAELI aircraft, artillery and gunboats were reported to have carried out fresh assaults on Arab guerrilla targets in Lebanon late last night, after two Israeli civilians died in Arab rocket attacks across the border. The mounting waves of attack and counter-attack were raising tension in the region to a new pitch. Israeli air strikes in Lebanon earlier in the day were the heaviest in more than a decade. Security officials in Beirut said Israeli gunboats fired missiles late last night at a Palestinian base at al-Bidawi camp, north of the port of Tripoli. But there was no immediate word on casualties. At the same time, Israeli aircraft and artillery were pounding guerrilla targets in southern Lebanon, they said. The night-time raids came after guerrillas had fired salvoes of Katyusha rockets at Israeli targets in retaliation for the day of Israeli air and artillery bombardment. About 150,000 residents of northern Israel were spending the night in bomb shelters for fear Arabs would fire more rockets. The army warned that hundreds more rockets could be fired at Israeli targets overnight and in the next few days. Syria confirmed last night that three of its soldiers in Lebanon had been killed and three others wounded during the daytime Israeli air attacks. Lebanese security officials earlier said six Syrians had been killed by shells or air raids, along with nine Lebanese. The Israelis made clear that their operation would continue until there was an end to attacks on northern Israel and on its self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon. They said their raids were aimed at strongholds of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Thousands of Lebanese villagers fled out of range of the attacks. The aircraft were sent in, after two weeks of threats, to avenge the killing of seven Israeli soldiers this month in the bloodiest guerrilla attacks on its forces in southern Lebanon in nearly three years. Israel accused Syria, one of its partners in Middle East peace talks, of backing the attacks on its forces in south Lebanon. It warned Damascus to curb the Hizbollah and Palestinian fighters by cutting arms supply lines from Iran. Damascus rejected the warning and said it would regard any attack on Lebanon as one on itself. In Washington, the State Department urged Middle Eastern countries to exercise utmost restraint and rely on peace negotiations to settle differences.</p>

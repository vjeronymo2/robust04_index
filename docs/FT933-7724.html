			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) Letters to the Editor: Making UK industries world class needs regular investment Correction (published 20th August 1993) appended to this article. Sir, It is encouraging at last to read an article by an economist in your paper that recognises that manufacturing industry has to expand again ('Painful adjustments', by Bill Robinson, August 17). However, Mr Robinson believes that businessmen find it difficult to understand that when oil runs down, the exchange rate weakens, and manufacturing industry expands again. Their concern - not lack of understanding - is based simply on the fact that, once you have destroyed skills, plants and subcontractors, and lost key research and development facilities and international distribution networks, it takes years to rebuild them and regain market share against competitors who may have maintained investment over a decade. The UK has some of the best companies and products in the world, but on average there is still a sizeable gap between the us and our best international competitors (the US and Japan). Recent endeavours to improve competitiveness have been extremely encouraging (productivity up 10 per cent over a decade, and 8 per cent in the last year). However, a solid manufacturing base with its supporting services able to compete with the best in the world will only happen with sustainable investment and continuous improvement year after year, and decade after decade. That is what the Treasury and economists need to believe and understand, if we want wealth and employment for the community. Mark H J Radcliffe, CBI national manufacturing council, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU CORRECTION UK productivity rose by 70 per cent over the last decade. The figure in yesterday's letter from Mr Mark H J Radcliffe was incorrectly printed.</p>

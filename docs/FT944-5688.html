			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Democracy 'threatened by quangos' The growth of the 'unelected state' - the network of quangos operating on the fringes of government - represents a direct threat to Britain's democratic system, says a newly-published report. The research shows that important decisions about the expenditure of taxpayers' money are being taken behind closed doors by government appointees. It says the accountability of quangos - quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations - to parliament is often tenuous, while their accountability to local communities is negligible. However, they are in charge of about a fifth of public expenditure. It adds: 'It is a system wide open to charges of party political influence and corruption.' The report, commissioned by the public service union Unison from Durham University's Department of Sociology and Social Policy, demands that quangos be reformed. It proposes a review by government of quangos, the publication of details of how members are chosen, an annually published register of quangos and board members including occupation details and remuneration, and the publication by each quango of a register of members' interests. Unison also intends to develop a 'Quangowatch' network to monitor quangos throughout Britain. Who Runs the North?

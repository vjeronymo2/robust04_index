He said that vanguard fighters of Hanminjon and people of  different strata in the Southern part of the country were  renewing their unshakable will to achieve the cause of national  reunification with the motive force of the nation in hearty  response to the reunification programme reclarified by the great  leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year address.    The Kim Yong-sam regime, he said, declared from the  beginning  that it would improve South-North relations, placing the nation  above anything else, but has actually committed such  anti-national acts as further aggravating the North-South  confrontation, turning away the North's broadminded proposals  such as exchange of presidential envoys and the nation's desire  for reunification and persistently resorting to the policy of  dependence on outside forces.    Hanminjon held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee  of its Central Committee in Seoul on January 2 and solemnly  vowed to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam regime, declaring its  resolute break with the regime, together with the people in the  South aspiring after independence, democracy and reunification,  Cho Il-min noted, and stated:    The time has gone to watch the "civilian" regime or to  expect  something from it.    It is the general review and will of our people in the South  that the Kim Yong-sam "regime" should no longer be left intact.    Hanminjon and patriotic people of different strata in the  South will defend the banner of national independence till they  have achieved independence, democracy and reunification.</p>

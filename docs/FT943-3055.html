			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: S&amp;U up 15% to Pounds 2.6m Correction (published 17th September 1994) appended to this article. S&amp;U, the consumer credit group, reported interim pre-tax profits up 15 per cent at Pounds 2.61m for the half year to July 31, against Pounds 2.27m last time. Mr Derek Prosser, chairman, said the general upturn in the financial services industry, together with its own organic expansion, had been behind the rise. 'We have seen a strong rise in demand from consumers which we have been able to respond to,' he said. Earnings per share increased 15 per cent to 14.24p (12.33p), while the dividend is raised from an adjusted 2.36p to 3p. Turnover improved 13 per cent to Pounds 28.69m (Pounds 25.3m). Mr Prosser said current trading was also encouraging and he was 'reasonably optimistic' about prospects for the full year. The Birmingham-based company is involved in selling financial services, predominantly small unsecured loans, to a customer base of 120,000, serviced largely by an army of door-to-door part-time sales staff. It is also involved in selling insurance and merchandise. CORRECTION Mr Derek Coombs, chairman of S&amp;U, was incorrectly named in a report on the consumer credit company's results published yesterday.</p>

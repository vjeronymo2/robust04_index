			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Terence Chapman acquires Synergo Terence Chapman Associates, a privately held management consultancy based in the City, has come to the rescue of Synergo Technology, a small software house financially damaged by the Stock Exchange Taurus fiasco. It has paid an undisclosed sum for the nine-year old London-based software house which supplies stockbroking, stock lending and settlement software products to brokers and institutional investors. A profitable company with 100 staff and revenue of Pounds 3.5m in 1992, it was hard hit by the cancellation of Taurus, the Stock Exchange's proposed automated settlement system, in which it had invested Pounds 1.8m. Despite a respectable client list, the losses on Taurus left it with a severely weakened balance sheet. The acquisition is Terence Chapman's first. For 1992-93 it had turnover in excess of Pounds 5m (Pounds 3.1m) and is planning to float within the next five years. Terence Chapman said its interest in Synergo lay in the company's expertise in open and client-server systems. The two companies would operate independently of each other under a group structure.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A briefing devoted to the Ukrainian-Russian  negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet issue was held today at the  Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. At the negotiations in Sevastopol,  the Ukrainian delegation proceeded first of all from the  Ukrainian interests, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Ivan  Bizhan said at the briefing. During this meeting, he said, it  was planned that a draft of a relevant agreement would be put  together and ratified. However, the Russian delegation refused  to discuss our proposals and failed to show up in the  negotiation room on 22 April. Over the past two and a half  years, Ivan Bizhan noted, there were five agreements concluded  on the Black Sea Fleet. Of those, only one provision was  actually implemented, the one on appointing the commander in  chief, even though Ukraine repeatedly came up with specific  proposals. It is pointless to accuse us of having torpedoed the  Sevastopol meeting, he emphasized. We were ready for  constructive talks.</p>

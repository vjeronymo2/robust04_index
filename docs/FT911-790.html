			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (12): Confidence has been enhanced - Investment HONG KONG may have little control over its political destiny. But the job of making itself attractive to the international financial community has become even more important of late. Although the colony can rightfully claim to be East Asia's leading financial centre south of Japan, the uncertainties of 1997 and growing competition from other centres like Singapore have forced it to redouble its efforts. Much of the work has centred on the stock exchange whose flaws were exposed by the 1987 market crash and the ensuing bribery scandals. The creation of a new Securities and Futures Commission has paved the way to a new regulatory structure for the investment industry. The exchange itself has been strengthened by a number of measures including a more independent-minded council to run it. The main steps have been to make the securities markets more transparent and less prone to abuse. There are new disclosure rules, and the procedures for listing companies - which was where most of the abuse occurred - have been cleaned up. More reforms will come later this year to bring the exchange in line with major exchanges elsewhere. A new law against insider trading (though not criminalising it) will come into force. Changes are also being planned to permit listed companies to buy back their own shares, and to enable dealers to engage in short selling. A new take-over code and set of conduct of business rules are in the pipeline. None of this has been particularly popular with the broking community which complains of over-regulation. But Mr Robert Owen, the SFC chairman, says: 'If you look at the international spectrum of levels of regulation, Hong Kong is still quite firmly at the light end.' Mr Francis Yuen, the chief executive of the exchange, says that the regulation phase is now virtually complete, and the next phase will be the development of new products, such as warrants, options, and securities from the newly privatised sector in China - 'we could have a big role to play there,' he says. Innovations should be helped by new electronic trading and settlement systems which the exchange hopes to introduce by the end of this year. The systems have been subjected to lengthy delays, largely because of their high cost. Although they are not vital to the numerically large number of small local brokers, they are considered to be essential if Hong Kong is to hold its place in the international investment community. Issues such as this have aggravated members of the international broking community who feel they do not have a big enough voice in the exchange's affairs. A trickier problem confronts the exchange with the steady departure of many of its listed companies for safe havens in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. About 30 per cent are now based elsewhere, or planning to go. Jardine Matheson, which led the exodus, has applied for a special form of 'exempt listing' that would enable its shares to be traded in Hong Kong, but without being fully subject to Hong Kong rules. The exchange and the SFC both know that permission in this case would set a major precedent which could seriously undermine the exchange. Yet they are keen to find a solution which would retain as many listings in Hong Kong as possible. Despite the corporate exodus, there has been little sign of a drift away among Hong Kong's financial community itself. The number of licensed brokers remains high (there are about 900 of which 700 are active), and many international firms use Hong Kong as a regional base. GT Management, for example, processes trades from as far afield as Australia and New Zealand there. The international investment community is dominated by two locally-based firms, Wardley, the merchant banking arm of the Hongkong Bank group, and Jardine Fleming, the joint venture between Robert Fleming of London and Jardine Matheson. Wardley manages about USDollars 10bn of funds worldwide, and Jardine slightly less - about USDollars 8bn. Other leading players include Schroders and Fidelity of the US. Jardine was one of the few investment banking firms in the region which increased its profits last year, despite the difficulties in the international markets. Mr Alan Smith, the managing director, points out that his firm made more money than big London-based names such as Schroders and Barings. The Japanese investment community is also growing steadily. There are now 46 Japanese securities houses in Hong Kong, twice as many as there are in London - 'it shows that worries about 1997 are much stronger in places like the US and the UK than they are in Japan', says a government official. Although Hong Kong must have lost some of its investment allure with the transfer of so much of its private wealth overseas, its importance as a regional centre has, if anything, grown with the steady opening up of the Chinese market. The Hong Kong stock market has also surprised people with its strength. It overcame political uncertainties to grow by six per cent last year, and it put on another strong surge in the early weeks of this year, pushing the Hang Seng Index close to a record high in early April. Since then, worries about the airport have pulled it back. Confidence has been helped by the consistency of the government's currency strategy, which is based on the peg to the US dollar. Now seven years old, the peg has withstood a number of political shocks as well as the pressures of Hong Kong's recent bout of inflation. The Exchange Fund, which manages the currency, has kept Hong Kong interest rates slightly higher than US as a counter to the negative forces. Among the prospects for the investment community is a new law creating the legal framework for retirement schemes, which are the moment are funded directly by employers. It is estimated that some 10,000 to 15,000 schemes will have to be launched in the years ahead, providing considerable volumes of business for the life insurance and fund management industries. The government also intends to develop a debt market to help finance a forecast budget deficit. The new pensions industry will play a role in that  -'we want to build up an appetite among investors so that when we need the money the market will be there,' says Mr David Nendick, the secretary for monetary affairs.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / PM tells water chiefs to limit pay Directors of privatised water companies should abide by the government's strict limits on pay increases for public-sector workers, Mr John Major said yesterday. During rowdy Commons exchanges the prime minister defended water privatisation against repeated attacks by Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting Labour leader. But he said directors of privatised utilities 'should follow the lead which the government has set for pay in the public sector and elsewhere'. Guidelines announced last September by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, froze the public-sector pay bill, but allowed pay increases backed by productivity improvements. Mr Major's comments reflect growing sensitivity among ministers about water bills and rising salaries, which were an important issue during the European and local elections. The question-time row followed publication by the National Consumer Council of a report saying that domestic water bills had risen by 67 per cent since privatisation. Mrs Beckett said that privatisation had turned into 'a swindle, licensed theft and legalised robbery' of British families. 'How can you defend the fact that the chairman of North West Water got Pounds 47,000 a year before privatisation and now he gets Pounds 338,000?'. Letters, Page 22</p>

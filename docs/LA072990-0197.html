			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> SPACE FULL? LET EPIPHYTES CLIMB THE WALLS;  </P> <P> PLANTS: THEY ARE IDEAL WHEN YOUR GARDEN RUNS OUT OF SPACE, BECAUSE THEY CAN  CLING TO WALLS OR FENCES. BESIDES, THEY REQUIRE LITTLE WATER.  </P> <P> There are times when a garden is so chock full that space simply can't be found  for another plant -- frustrating our desire to try something new. And, there  are places in the garden where there simply isn't room for anything in the  ground -- frustrating narrow spaces in side yards or behind buildings.  </P> <P> During those times, and in those places, consider taking to the air with any of  the plants that are called epiphytes.  </P> <P> Epiphytes are plants that take their sustenance from the air, gathering enough  water from rain or fog, using whatever falls their way for food. They are  usually attached to another plant, but they are not parasites, and some simply  attach themselves to cliffs or rocks. This is primarily what their roots are  for -- holding on; leaves do most of the gathering of water and nutrients,  though roots contribute.  </P> <P> Epiphytes are not usually grown in pots but attached to slabs of woods, tree  fern fiber or bark, and they can simply be hung on a wall, fence or patio post.  This is what makes them valuable plants in the garden, because not much else  will grow on these surfaces.  </P> <P> Epiphytes have something else going for them -- they need little water. In  general, the watering of epiphytes can hardly be called "watering" at all since  they are simply sprinkled quickly with the hose, just enough to get them wet.  The best time of the day is early in the morning, and if you want exuberant  growth and no maintenance, consider putting is a drip system that is equipped  with little mist nozzles instead of the usual emitters.  </P> <P> These provide just the right amount of water and a clock can control them.  Watering every three days is about right for most epiphytes, though inland they  might need more and close to coast, less. In a pinch, most can go for weeks  without water.  </P> <P> This is how Paul Isley waters his personal collection of epiphytic tillandsias,  the most "drought-resistant" of bromeliads. Striking in their gray foliage,  these are becoming readily available at nurseries, though at Isley's Rainforest  Flora, a nursery that specializes in tillandsias, you can pick through bins  filled with these bromeliads, most of which are raised from seed on the  premises.  </P> <P> One particularly fun use for tillandsias is on patio posts, where they can be  seen up close. A single post can hold a whole collection if it faces in the  right direction; tillandsias need full sun.  </P> <P> They need infrequent watering and you can tell when a tillandsia is too dry  because they begin to roll up their leaves. The best way to water at that point  is to drop them in a bucket of water for a few hours so they can soak up all  they need. Otherwise, water every few days with a quick blast from the hose,  followed by another when the leaves dry. One sprinkle is not enough because  they do not have time to take the water in before it evaporates.  </P> <P> Staghorn ferns are another epiphyte. Every north wall in the milder parts of  Southern California should have at least one staghorn fern, if for no other  reason than to knock the socks off of out-of-state visitors. Staghorn ferns are  simply spectacular once they get a few years behind them. The most common kinds  form clumps of shields and antler-like leaves 3 or 4 feet across. They can be  found at nurseries as small plants and should immediately be reattached to  large plaques made of several 1-by-12-inch boards, held together with  1-by-1-inch pieces nailed to the back. Tie these ferns on with plastic tree  tape.  </P> <P> In time they will outgrow even the largest boards and will begin to cling to  the walls of the house or to a fence, though they are easy to peel off if need  be.  </P> <P> Best of all, near the coast they require next to no maintenance and only  occasional watering. Though they look decidedly tropical, they are actually  quite drought-resistant where humidity is reasonably high (as far inland as  Pasadena) and when they are grown in the shade.  </P> <P> In sun or part shade, try any of the various epiphytic orchids that will grow  out-of-doors in Southern California. One of the most spectacular, and  certainly, one of the toughest is the genus Oncidium. These epiphytic orchids  need no care to speak of but bloom every summer or fall, with huge sprays of  delicate yellow flowers, marked with splotches of maroon.  </P> <P> Marilynn Cohen, of Marilynn's Garden (by appointment only: 8184 Katella Ave.,  Stanton, (714) 995-4133), thinks that the oncidiums should be on every  drought-tolerant list of plants because they need so little water, only an  occasional blast from the hose. She is one source for these exotic plants,  though they too can be found at some nurseries in summer. They begin flowering  this month, and the blooms last for weeks.  </P></p>

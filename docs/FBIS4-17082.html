According to reports from informed sources, the prospects  for  widening the use of the NATO air forces against the Bosnian  Serbs, a toughening of economic sanctions in relation to  Belgrade, and the holding of an international conference on a  Bosnian settlement, of which Russia was the initiator, were  touched upon during the course of the telephone conversation.

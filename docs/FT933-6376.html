			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London Metal Exchange traders said COPPER was yesterday struggling to hold the Dollars 1,950-a-tonne level for September delivery, after recently threatening to bring September Dollars 2,000 buying options into the money. A burst of commission house buying took the three months position up from Dollars 1,910 to Dollars 1,929 a tonne but with the New York market sluggish and the cash/three months premium easing to around Dollars 30, the buying dried-up and the price ended the afternoon kerb at Dollars 1,917 a tonne, down Dollars 16 on the day. ALUMINIUM found buying interest around the Dollars 1,160 a tonne level which underpinned a later rise to Dollars 1,168, up Dollars 6 a tonne from Tuesday. ZINC also benefited from buyers tempted by the recent dip to almost Dollars 880 and three months rallied to Dollars 887, down Dollars 2. Hedge selling, liquidation and stop-loss selling pushed TIN and NICKEL to 20-year and six-year lows of Dollars 4,720 and Dollars 4,535 respectively against their background of ample availability of refined supplies. The LEAD market was quiet and traded narrowly before ending at Dollars 396.50 a tonne in the three months position, unchanged on the day. Compiled from Reuters</p>

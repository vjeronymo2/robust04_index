			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Pensions bill prescribes inflation-linking and compensation The government's long-awaited pensions bill, launched yesterday, sets out for the first time the criteria that will have to be met by those sponsoring, administering and advising occupational pension schemes in Britain. The bill, which runs to 127 pages with 153 clauses, provides for a progressive rise in the ages at which women are eligible to earn state pension benefits and alterations to the National Insurance contribution rebates offered to those with personal pensions. All occupational pensions will have to offer some protection against inflation and, for the first time, there is an attempt to ensure that benefits of insolvent schemes are spread more equitably among members. The government estimates that the bill will increase the Department of Social Security's operational costs by Pounds 20m in the 1997-98 fiscal year and that employers' recurrent costs will rise by Pounds 165m a year as they meet the requirements of index-linking pensions. It is also estimated that new minimum solvency requirements will cost employers in aggregate between Pounds 290m and Pounds 400m in the next 12 years - although the abolition of guaranteed minimum pensions will cut their costs. The bill's main elements are: Creation of a seven-member Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority. The members will be appointed by the government, but at least one is to be suggested by the life insurance industry, one by employers' groups, one by trade unions and one by pensions professionals. There is provision that a further two will be generally knowledgeable about pensions. The authority would have power to appoint and remove trustees where appropriate, to set civil penalties, to wind up schemes, and to order restitution. It would also have the power to require scheme advisers, trustees and sponsors to hand over documentation to it on request, and would have the power to inspect premises. Its powers would be enforceable with the aid of a justice of the peace. The regulator will require a staff of 200 from 1997. All occupational schemes will be required to have some trustees elected by the members. For schemes with at least 100 members, at least one-third of the trustees must be member-elected. For smaller schemes there will be a minimum of two. These trustees could be removed only by the unanimous vote of all the other trustees. The bill does, however, allow employers to avoid having member-appointed trustees if they comply with an unspecified 'statutory consultation procedure' which results in agreement that such trustees are unnecessary. A member-appointed trustee would lose his or her post if he or she left employment voluntarily or was sacked. Trustees of schemes will have, for the first time, specific obligations and duties assigned to them. There are to be fines of up to Pounds 5,000 for certain rule breaches, with eventual disqualification. The bill proposes that trustees be responsible for ensuring that limits on self-investment in the employer or the granting of loans to the employer are followed. Trustees will be responsible for appointing actuaries and auditors for the scheme and, for the first time, they will have specific obligations towards the professional fund managers of a scheme - in that they will have a duty to set investment principles for fund managers to follow. Inflation-linking of pensions, with a requirement for annual increases in line with the retail price index up to a maximum of 5 per cent. This rule has existed since 1990 but there have never been regulations to implement it. Schemes will have to comply with a new minimum solvency requirement, although the terms of the standard are not specified in the bill. Schemes falling below certain levels of solvency will require additional injections of funds, although the bill does not specify what the time limits for such injections would be. Rules about how the assets of a scheme are to be treated if it is wound up are set out for the first time. Among other proposals, schemes whose assets are insufficient to pay all promised benefits must limit inflation-proofing for existing pensioners until there are enough assets to cover basic pension promises to the deferred pensioners. Current rules allow existing pensioners to draw index-linked pensions in full while those who may be nearing retirement could lose a significant portion of theirs. A new Pensions Compensation Board is to be created with at least three members. Compensation will be financed by a 'post-event' levy on all occupational schemes. It is intended to cover as much as 90 per cent of a scheme's shortfall in instances where 'there are reasonable grounds for believing that the reduction was attributable to an act or omission constituting a prescribed offence'. The compensation board will have the power to borrow from commercial banks or directly from the Bank of England to finance immediate payments to pensioners. A pensions ombudsman is to be appointed, with greater power than the present ombudsman to investigate complaints and adjudicate on disputes.</p>

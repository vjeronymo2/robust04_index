			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> P.V. ESTATES TAKES STEP TO STRENGTHEN LAW LIMITING HOUSE SIZES  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes Estates City Council took the initial step Tuesday to  strengthen its "neighborhood compatibility" ordinance, which restricts the size  of houses that can be built in the city.  </P> <P> The council unanimously gave approval to a revised ordinance that would ban  houses that cover more than 50% of the area of a lot. The existing ordinance  had permitted such projects, especially on the city's smaller lots. Council  members said their intention is to save neighborhoods with small lots from  being overbuilt. The council took the action because many houses on small lots  have been razed to make way for oversized homes.  </P> <P> The revised ordinance would limit the living space and garage of a house to 50%  of the lot area, or 30% of the lot area plus 1,750 square feet, whichever is  less. The existing ordinance required that the living space and garage be  limited to 30% of the lot area plus 1,750 square feet.  </P> <P> The new ordinance would take effect June 5 if adopted in two weeks as expected.  </P> <P> The ordinance would principally affect construction on lots 8,750 square feet  or less, officials said.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ruth Gralow proposed capping the size of all new homes or  remodeling projects regardless of lot size. Last year she unsuccessfully sought  a temporary ban on single-family houses larger than 15,000 square feet, and on  Tuesday she again argued for a limit on the size of homes. She also suggested  that the council should place limits on the cubic feet in a home, to address  houses with expansive, vaulted ceilings.  </P> <P> Others objected to her suggestions.  </P> <P> Councilman Raymond Mattingly said later: "There are a number of us who feel  that people still have property rights and (a cap) would go too far in  curtailing those property rights."  </P> <P> The council also approved an ordinance that sets a one-year limit on future  approvals issued under the neighborhood compatibility ordinance. The measure  would prevent builders or homeowners from getting approval for a project, then  building it years later when restrictions might have been tightened.  </P> <P> The council also introduced an ordinance that will forbid encroachment into the  five-foot side-yard setbacks.  </P></p>

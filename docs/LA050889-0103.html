			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> QUAKE JOLTS ORANGE, L.A. COUNTIES  </P> <P> A mild earthquake early this morning was more of an annoyance than anything  else to northern Orange County and Los Angeles County residents who were  awakened at 5:44 a.m. by the temblor.  </P> <P> Neither Orange nor Los Angeles County public safety officials reported any  damage or injury from the quake, which seismologists at Caltech said registered  a 2.9 in magnitude. It was centered beneath the Hacienda Heights area in Los  Angeles County.  </P> <P> The scientists said the shock was unrelated to the twin quakes in October,  1987, which devastated nearby Whittier. Two other quakes shook the area over  the weekend. A quake measuring 3.7 struck one mile northwest of Brea Saturday  night, and seismologists reported a magnitude 3.4 quake centered 27 miles  offshore from Oceanside on Friday.  </P></p>

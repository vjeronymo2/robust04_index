			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / World Trade News: 'E Europe in trouble if Uruguay Round fails' Economic reform in central and eastern Europe would be seriously undermined by a failure of the Uruguay Round of trade talks and the consequent erosion of international fair trade rules, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe says in a report published today. The commission sees the main benefits for eastern Europe of a Uruguay Round deal in strengthened rules against protectionist measures by the West, although the regions has much to gain from liberalisation of the agricultural and textile sectors in particular. 'These countries need secure market access and a stable and comprehensive international framework of rules to sustain their reform programmes,' the report says. It warns that they will be among the principal victims of arbitrary and discriminatory trade protection if the Uruguay Round fails. Non-tariff barriers, such as 'voluntary' export restraints and anti-dumping suits, have increasingly been aimed at the reforming economies, the ECE notes. Recent restrictions imposed on certain 'sensitive' products have lessened the benefits of trade accords signed by several eastern European countries with the European Union. The proposed Uruguay Round accord would outlaw voluntary export restraints and other 'grey area' measures to restrict trade outside fair trade rules, and toughen conditions for resort to safeguards (emergency import protection) and anti-dumping actions. Protectionist measures by western Europe appear 'especially petty and ungenerous' given the fact that western exporters have gained most from the liberalisation of east-west trade, the report says. Between 1989 and 1992 east European exports to OECD countries rose in value by 43 per cent, but eastern imports from the OECD soared by 67 per cent and the OECD trade balance with the east swung from a small deficit into a sizeable surplus. Though east European exports to the west fell by some 14 per cent in the first half of 1993, imports from the west, mainly from western Europe, continued to rise by 11 per cent. The commission cites estimates of a global welfare gain of Dollars 212bn (Pounds 142bn) a year from a Uruguay Round deal, equivalent to 1.1 per cent of world GDP. Of this, freer farm trade accounts for 34 per cent, liberalisation of textiles and clothing trade 40 per cent and increased market access for services 14 per cent. Former centrally planned economies (which include China as well as eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union) are among the biggest beneficiaries of freer trade in textiles and, more surprisingly, in services, mainly reflecting an opening of their protected (and underdeveloped) domestic markets. In the short term, the commission takes a sombre view of economic prospects for eastern and central Europe. Only a few countries - Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovenia - hope for growth in 1994 and these forecasts are heavily dependent on higher exports which may not materialise. On average, GDP in eastern Europe fell 28 per cent between 1989 and the first half of 1993, while output (excluding services) plunged by over 40 per cent in the Commonwealth of Independent States and even more in the Baltic nations. The commission calls on western governments to increase aid flows, offer free and secure access to western markets for eastern goods and services, and develop a more consistent and coherent approach to the region's problems. Economic failure in eastern Europe would threaten political stability throughout the continent, the report warns. Economic Bulletin for Europe, November 1993.

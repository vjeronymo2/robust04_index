			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BOARD MAY NAME NEW TRUSTEE  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach Union High School Board of Trustees will probably forgo a  special election and appoint a new member to replace President Linda  Moulton-Patterson, who was elected this week to the Huntington Beach City  Council, board members said this week.  </P> <P> Trustees are expected to take up the matter at their Dec. 11 meeting.  </P> <P> Moulton-Patterson, the top vote-getter in last week's race for four council  seats, has been on the school board since 1983. She said she will resign from  the school board early next month, when she will join the council.  </P> <P> Because a special election would cost the financially strapped district at  least $75,000, trustees Jerry Sullivan and Bonnie Bruce said Thursday that they  expect that the majority of board members would opt for appointing a  replacement.  </P> <P> The new trustee will serve the remainder of Moulton-Patterson's board term,  which expires in November, 1991. Her successor would then have to be reelected  to retain the seat.  </P> <P> If the new board member is appointed, trustees would begin accepting  applications in late December and would probably fill the vacancy by February,  Sullivan said.  </P> <P> It would be the second board appointment in six months. In August, trustees  appointed Bruce to the board, filling a vacancy created when member David  Warfield resigned two months earlier. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

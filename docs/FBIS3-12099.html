			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second of two parts of "Exclusive" interview with </F> Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez, leader of the 200 Revolutionary  Bolivarian Movement, by Carlos Fernandez in Caracas; date not  given; from the "Informer" newscast; broadcast in progress --  recorded]    [Text] [Fernandez] ...for instance, do you think that what  you called a government plan on 4 February 1992 is still valid?    [Chavez] Some components of the plan are still valid; for  example, the national constituent assembly. I repeat, we were  carrying in our combat bags all the experience gained from the  constituent assembly. One of the first measures that a  civilian-military government board was going to adopt was to  summon a constituent assembly within a reasonable period of  time. Currently, this is more valid than ever.    [Fernandez] At times you have indicated that some civilians  were going to support you, but we never knew who they were. The  purpose of this interview is not to tell us who they were, but  do these civilians continue to identify themselves with the  Bolivarian Movement in 1994?    [Chavez] I believe that some of them no longer support us. I  think that some of them had the wrong impression that the  Bolivarian military members were somewhat similar to the  military members of 1945, who were manipulated by politicians...    [Fernandez, interrupting] The politics of opportunity.    [Chavez] Exactly, the politics of opportunity. They wanted  us  to join their political organizations. This was never our  intention. I believe that some of them are still following the  same direction and ideological strategy. We have kept in  contact with them, and we will increase the communication  channels now that we are able to do it.    [Fernandez] I think that you are going to reinforce debates;  that is, the debate of ideas and specific issues that will help  the country solve the socioeconomic and, especially, the moral  crises that we are currently facing.    [Chavez] Yes, I agree.    [Fernandez] For instance, without worsening the conflict,  you  will consult with AD [Democratic Action], Copei [Social  Christian Party], MAS [Movement Toward Socialism], Radical Cause  Party, National Convergence, and a number of groups that are  part of the Venezuelan political arena.    [Chavez] I really do not know how many ideas I have proposed  so far and how many questions I answered at the lengthy news  conference. All these ideas are proposed with discussion in  mind. Not long ago, I met with some deputies of the National  Congress, and I told them let us talk. Mr. Moron, a church  representative of course, I was thinking about calling him. I  once told this government that I did not know if he was going to  accept. He replied that he refused to be with God and with the  devil at the same time. A few weeks ago, however, we met at the  Military Hospital and I asked him what the church's opinion was.  I said that priests and recently retired military officials  should hold talks. I always say that we are still active in the  people's rank and file; I cannot talk about retirement because  there is no such thing. We are moving forward with the national  situation. In short, this is the idea: to reveal our plans to  ensure that we can discuss or criticize them and reach a  national consensus.    [Fernandez] Let us close this interview with a thought.  Chavez must have listened, read, and examined a number of  assessments that have emerged in the media in the last few  weeks. Suddenly, the instability prompted by a coup is  returning. Copei President Hilarion Cardozo sparked a  controversy surrounding this issue. He said that there were  individuals involved in the 27 February or 4 November coups who  were probably hitting the streets to promote their  insurrectionist movement. He also accused certain parties of  performing illegal actions in our country and of being involved  with the Bolivarian Movement. What do you think about this?  What is this issue that has been manipulated lately that is  once more bringing instability to our country?    [Chavez] I indeed believe that the country's situation is  still unstable. Let us hope that the Caldera government and  team will be able to infuse acceptable levels of stability to  the national, economic, military, political, and social country.    [Fernandez] Are you going to contribute to this?    [Chavez] We want to talk and make proposals. In my  briefcase,  I carry a number of proposals that, as a soldier, I wanted to  make to the commander in chief, but it was impossible.    [Fernandez] When are you meeting with the commander in  chief;  that is, with the president?    [Chavez] It is unknown for the time being. We were supposed  to hold a meeting before my release, but we could not meet. We  now have to wait and see how the situation develops. We are  indeed willing to meet and we have the channels to recommend to  the president and to the Armed Forces, from which we came from,  some measures that we believe could contribute to the recovery  of the [word indistinct].    [Fernandez] What about Hilarion's coup?    [Chavez] Coups d'etat are unannounced in Latin America. It  is not that they are justifiable, but they are always the  product of a situation. I believe that at this moment -- I was  telling Jose Vicente that I cannot predict the future -- there  are no conditions to stage a coup.    [Fernandez] If I remember well, in [Interior Minister] Ramon  Escovar Salom's speech to the National Congress two weeks ago,  there was a reference to latent subversive factors that could  conspire against democratic stability because we have a very  fragile stability. There was much talk about groups linked to  the Venezuelan financial sector because the Banco Latino crisis  could inspire some people in the military ranks to embrace an  insurgency movement.    [Chavez] I do not think this is possible. I mean, it is  possible that the wish is there.    [Fernandez] Of course, some sectors are wishing this.    [Chavez] No, these sectors are definitely wishing. I believe  the military is currently tasked with finding an internal  consolidation to show the political world and the Venezuelan  nation how it is willing to defend the Constitution and to grant  a waiting period hoping that the country, Mr. Caldera, will  embark on a new era and that you will be the steering wheel that  will lead the vessel to a safe haven.</p>

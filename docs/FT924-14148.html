			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Arts: Magnificent Porgy moves into the light - Opera This magnificent production, one of the most valuable and meaningful in 20th-century British opera, arrives in London to set the seal on what has already been, by and large, a year of splendid Royal Opera achievement. It started life in 1986, at Glyndebourne. There, as the first British opera-house staging of Gershwin's opera, it proved a milestone in the history of the work - a work always highly popular since its first showing but not always equivalently highly rated. At Glyndebourne - in a Trevor Nunn production conducted by Simon Rattle, designed by John Gunter (sets) and Sue Blane (costumes), and with a cast of superlatively fine singing-actors led by Willard White and Cynthia Haymon - Porgy and Bess finally threw off the shackles of its folk-opera, enlarged-musical or what-have-you status. There it was demonstrated beyond argument as a 'real' opera, its roots in popular sources (nothing new in the long and problematic history of opera) but its branches reaching out culturally far and wide. There the notion was finally laid to rest of a work somehow demeaning of the black people who perform in it. There it was shown to be, not flawless - any more than any other significant first opera is ever flawless - but so gloriously full of 'felt life' that the flaws came to matter very little. Now the production is re-created at Covent Garden - with Nunn and most of the original principals back at their stations, but with Andrew Litton replacing Rattle as conductor. More often than not, deprived of the circumstances that brought them to birth, productions borrowed turn out to be productions diluted in their vision. This one is different. It positively demanded to be seen and heard outside the Glyndebourne hothouse; it badly needed to be given again before a wider audience (which the large number of Covent Garden performances, including two sponsored for 'non-typical' visitors to the house, plus a promised video recording thereafter, will make more possible). As Friday's performance made plain, the production has indeed been re-created, not simply reproduced. People with still-vivid memories of the Glyndebourne experience may feel, as I do, that the much larger London theatre reduces the sense of engulfment, of being sucked into an operatic world so richly stocked in melody, word and action that it was a cruel come-down to have to leave the theatre at all. (The storm prayers, though still vibrantly sung by the special Porgy chorus, fail to lift the roof off as they did in Sussex.) The length of the work and its episodic detailing seem to weigh rather more heavily in its later stages - but no doubt this is a direct result of the Royal Opera decision, badly ill-advised as it turns out, to break the three-act structure into two cumbersomely long halves separated by a single interval. On the other hand, the larger theatre gives air to Gershwin's heavily padded scoring, and renders balance with voices less of a constant trial of conductorial skills. Mr Litton, in his house debut, makes the most of the house advantages: he keeps the music light, rhythmically forward and texturally well-ventilated, finds tautly 'continuous' drama in Gershwin's format of recitative and song, and altogether proves himself a marvellously apt, idiomatically assured Porgy conductor. The added space also aids the producer in clarifying even further the fine detail of communal life. The opening scene and finale (with its controversial breaching of the Catfish Row facade as Porgy throws his sticks aside and walks into the light) particularly show the art of opera direction at its most elevated: every strand of action filled with musical point and purpose, a bounty of sharply honed (but never stagey) individual characterisations forged into an organic ensemble. The broad comic insertions, part of what were once fiercely stigmatised (by Duke Ellington) as the opera's 'lamp-black Negroisms', chime fitly with the tragedy. Awe-inspiring new insights into their roles have been discovered by all the original principals - Marietta Simpson's brilliantly tough-tender Maria, Cynthia Clarey's gauntly imposing Serena, Gregg Baker's towering Crown and Damon Evans's chillingly intelligent, witty Sporting Life are only the foremost of too many names demanding to be mentioned as exemplars of this developmental process. The young English soprano Tinuke Olafimihan, new as Clara, bursts into flower with a ravishingly pure, bright-toned 'Summertime'; Gordon Hawkins, a sturdy, attractively relaxed Jake, replaces Bruce Hubbard (who died last year tragically young). But all pale before the tendernesses and subtleties revealed, the depths sounded and heights scaled - separately and mutually - by the occupants of the title roles. Miss Haymon's Bess moves from vulgar exuberance to heartrending quiet frailty with absolute authority; Mr White's Porgy is even darker in opening-scene misanthropy, more vulnerable and candid in happiness, more gut-wrenchingly heroic at the end. (Vocally, he sounded tired by the time that Everest of a top G in 'I got to be with Bess' was reached, and no wonder.) At the centre-point of a production which makes opera seem the grandest and most ennobling of all the arts, this partnership forms an ideal pivot. Porgy and Bess, Royal Opera, Covent Garden: in repertory until November 11</p>

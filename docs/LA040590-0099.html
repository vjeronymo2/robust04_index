			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NERVE GAS  </P> <P> Morality over money! How refreshing to read (Part A, March 28) that two  chemical firms, Occidental and Mobay, have refused to sell the ingredients of  nerve gas to the mighty Pentagon itself! I hope some edict doesn't force them  to "say uncle." They are saving us from the universal opprobrium we would merit  if we resumed manufacture of chemical weapons while purportedly negotiating a  worldwide ban.  </P> <P> HELEN L.

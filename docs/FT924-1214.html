			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Financier gives Dollars 50m for Moslems Mr George Soros, the man who made a billion dollars out of sterling's retreat on Black Wednesday, yesterday turned over Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.8m) of the profits to aid organisations in war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina, saying: 'Yes, you could say I make my money in the west and spread it out in the east,' writes Sheila Jones in London. The 62-year-old financier's gift is the biggest single donation made to a humanitarian cause by a private individual. 'What is going on in Bosnia today is genocide,' he said. 'I feel it particularly strongly because as a Hungarian Jew I was myself a potential victim of the holocaust. My heart goes out to the people who are being raped, pillaged and murdered just because they are Moslems. 'I am privileged in having more money than most. I am doing what I can and everybody else should do something.' Four aid organisations - Oxfam, Save the Children, Medecins Sans Frontieres and the International Rescue Committee - will receive an initial Dollars 1m each. The rest will be divided up by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which will administer the fund.</p>

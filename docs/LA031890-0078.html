			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIMON IS TRAPPED, TOO  </P> <P> I absolutely hate that narrow-minded men such as Roger Simon totally  misunderstand the reasons why Elizabeth Morgan chose to protect her child from  the child's father even to the lengths that she was willing to spend two years  in prison.  </P> <P> Please, Mr. Simon, open your mind to the fact that there are fathers who  sexually abuse their daughters, and there are judges, prosecutors and  editorialists who simply can't believe this horror is happening. God help the  children of this country who aren't being protected.  </P> <P> JANIS BRITTENHAM, Newbury Park  </P></p>

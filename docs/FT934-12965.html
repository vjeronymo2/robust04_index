			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions EARLIER this year, Thomas Buffet, chairman and chief executive of Automated Security, sold 200,000 shares at 157p; five months later, director CD Buck also sold stock. Last week, the company gave a profits warning; however, Buffet bought 250,000 shares at 101p and now holds more than 2m shares. The last time he bought was in March 1992, when the shares were trading around 85p, so there is a lot to be said for his sense of timing. Hewden Stuart is a Scottish-based company involved in the hire and merchandising of construction equipment. Despite an optimistic statement at the announcement of interim results, the chairman, Sir Matthew Goodwin, sold 300,000 shares at 160p. His residual holding is in excess of 1m and the transaction was said to have been made for personal financial reasons. Leonard van Geest, the chairman, sold 446,993 shares in Geest, almost a third of his existing holding. The company is involved in the distribution and marketing of fresh food, including bananas. Three members of the board of Alumasc, including the chairman, sold shares following a period of relative outperformance. All three retain fairly sizable stakes.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               No of Company                       Sector      Shares   Value  directors  ------------------------------------------------------------------ SALES  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Aberdeen Trust                      OthF     200,000     126      1 Alumasc                             Misc     225,000   1,260      3 Asda Property                       Prop      25,000      31      1 Ass Brit Ports                      Tran     155,000     745      4* British Land                        Prop      18,979      76      4 Cornwell Parker A                   Misc      10,000      14      1 Faupel                              Text      60,000      49      1 Geest                               FdRe     446,993   1,670      1 Hewden Stuart                        C&amp;C     425,000     680      2* Kode                                Elns       7,500      13      1 Menzies J                           Stor       8,000      46      1 MTL                                 Elns      30,000      75      1 Persimmon                            C&amp;C       3,500      10      1 Prop Sec IT                         Prop      30,000      51      1 Prudential                          InsL     155,850     555      2* Reuters                              Med       2,232      34      1 RMC Group                           BdMa       5,000      42      1 Scholl                              Hlth      25,000      42      1* SelecTV Group                        Med   1,000,000     235      1 Shell Transport                      O&amp;G     108,000     738      1* Southern Water                      Watr       2,000      12      1  ------------------------------------------------------------------ PURCHASES  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Aberforth Smaller                   InTr      10,000      18      1 Automated Security                  BuSe     250,000     253      1 Cornwell Parker                     Misc      34,000      54      5 Coutts Consulting                   BuSe      55,000      36      3 David Lloyd Leisure                  H&amp;L      50,000     103      1 De La Rue                           Pack       3,167      21      1 Guinness                            Brew      10,000      39      2 Invesco                             OthF      10,000      17      1 Oliver Group                        Stor      50,000      18      1  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and U.S.  officials reaffirmed Monday that Washington will not hold  further high-level dialogue with North Korea unless the latter  allows satisfactory international nuclear inspections.    The inspection deadline is early May as indicated in last  month's U.N. Security Council presidential statement, Kim  Sam-hun, South Korea's ambassador on North Korean nuclear  affairs, said after meeting his U.S. counterpart Robert Gallucci  in high-level consultations here.    The two sides also reaffirmed the principle that  inter-Korean  dialogue is indispensable to fully clearing up the nuclear  problem.    "The most immediate issue is getting North Korea to accept  additional inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA)," Kim told reporters after nearly three hours of talks.    The next Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks will be the  final opportunity to resolve the nuclear dispute, the ambassador  said. "The South Korean and U.S. Governments are ready to  discuss North Korea's interests and demands in the political,  security and economic fields related to improving relations once  the nuclear obstacle is out of the way."    Kim suggested adjustments in the North Korean-U.S. "small  package deal" that included suspension of this year's "Team  Spirit" military exercise that Seoul and Washington stage  annually.    South Korea and the United States announced earlier the  maneuvers would be cancelled this year on condition that North  Korea allowed full nuclear checks.    "We can't say that the entire agreement is void, but  adjustments are inevitable," said Kim.    Gallucci, assistant secretary of State who was appointed  chairman of the newly established U.S. senior policy steering  group on Korea, flew into Seoul on Sunday.    The consultations came immediately after Seoul announced  last  week that it would no longer demand inter-Korean dialogue as a  precondition for the third round of North Korean-U.S.  high-level talks.    Kim was at pains to emphasize that Seoul has not given up on  inter-Korean channels.    "The two countries confirmed the principle that the issues  of  the Korean peninsula, including the nuclear situation, have to  be solved through inter-Korean dialogue," said Kim.    "We agreed that while South-North Korean and North  Korean-U.S. talks should be harmonized, the two channels must be  managed as complementary," he said.    But future South-North dialogue "will have to carry  substance  and be meaningful," he said. "The dialogue will be aimed  specifically at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula."    The timing and format of the dialogue are under negotiation  between Seoul and Washington, he said, citing the inter-Korean  Joint Nuclear Control Commission and prime ministers' talks as  possible examples.    The ambassador denied speculation that Washington may hold  the next high-level meeting with Pyongyang just on North Korea's  promise to permit further IAEA inspections.    "There must be full and complete additional inspections by  the IAEA," he said.    Kim referred to the March 31 statement by the Security  Council president which asked the IAEA to report back to the  council on North Korea's nuclear program in a few weeks, which  is tacitly understood as early May.    "You can assume that the period mentioned in the statement  is, in actuality, the deadline," he said.</p>

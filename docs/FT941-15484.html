			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Kelt surges ahead and dividend in sight Contributions from acquired interests in Colombia and west Africa enabled Kelt Energy, the independent oil and gas production and exploration company, to hoist pre-tax profits from Pounds 629,000 to Pounds 3.24m in the six months to September 30. Turnover more than doubled to Pounds 18.2m, against Pounds 8.9m. Earnings per share advanced from 0.4p to 1.8p. Mr Hubert Perrodo, chairman, said Kelt's prospects and position were sufficiently strong for it to return to the dividend list after an absence of several years. He said the board would recommend a dividend as soon as practicable. Daily net production in September 1993 increased to about 11,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day, against 5,430 in March 1993. Proven/probable reserves grew 68 per cent from 47.8m boe in March 1993 to 80.2m boe in September. The most significant change for the company in the period had come through its purchase of an interest in producing fields in Colombia. The interim results reflected three months' contribution from these interests. The fields, located in the prolific Llanos Basin, had added net production of some 5,000 boepd. Mr Perrodo said profitability in existing operations had been largely sustained in spite of lower oil and contract gas prices in the period. Kelt had continued to emphasise strict cost control and limit borrowing. Kelt's financial year end is reverting to December 31 in order to bring the company back into line with common practice within the upstream oil and gas industry. The next annual report will therefore cover the nine month period to December 31 1993.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Krups purchase puts Moulinex in the red MOULINEX, the French household electronics group, fell into the red in the first half of the year because of the economic slowdown and the financial impact of its acquisition of Krups of Germany. The group slipped from net profits of FFr35m in the first six months of 1991 to a net loss of FFr11m (Dollars 2.30m) this year, on turnover which rose slightly from FFr3.67bn to FFr3.7bn. Operating profits fell from FFr213m to FFr171m. A similar sluggish trend recurred in the third quarter of the year, with turnover rising slowly from FFr5.51bn to FFr5.54bn in the nine months to September 30. Moulinex acquired Krups last year for DM130m (Dollars 92.10m) in an attempt to diversify its interests. Krups specialises in coffee machines and electric mixers; Moulinex is stronger in microwave ovens and food processors. Moulinex said it planned to continue its investment programme for its production plants in Europe, Egypt and Mexico. Thomson, the French electronics group, is strengthening its presence in household electronics by taking full control of the domestic appliances division of De Dietrich, another French electronics concern. Thomson has for the past 18 months held 50 per cent of De Dietrich.</p>

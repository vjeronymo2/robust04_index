			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: A whiff of short-term optimism - London The division between optimists and pessimists among UK stock market analysts is now more sharply divided than before. On the one hand, the FT-SE 100 index starts the week solidly above the 3,000 mark which has tormented the chartists since the middle of last month. On the other, the bond markets retain their capacity to rattle equities and reverse stock market trends within minutes. For those strategists focusing on the strength of underlying equity valuations and on the evidence of economic recovery in the UK, last week brought valuable support in the powerful rise in UK industrial output reported for April. The 1.6 per cent monthly gain was well above expectations and put teeth into those equity market valuations which stand accused of over-valuation. Strauss Turnbull believes the recent business recession brought sharper falls in earnings than in the past, and the way is now open for earnings growth of 40 per cent in the next two years without generating the high inflation which lies at the heart of the bond market's worries. The most significant response to the industrial output data may prove to be the emergence of signs that equities have at least begun to shake off the influence of the gilt-edged market. Although gilts continued to unsettle shares within a narrow range, they did not seriously hinder the near 2 per cent recovery in the FT-SE index. Indeed, base rate fears are not what they were. S. G. Warburg has upgraded its base rate forecasts in the light of last week's economic data, and now looks for a rise of a full point to 6.25 per cent by this time next year. However, such expectations, once alarming, now ring no tocsins in the City of London, or at least not in the stock market, which has decided to live with them. The prime minster also did his best for the market by assuring newspaper readers that 'dividend control is a non-starter,' even if he did leave obscure the wider question of dividend taxation, which is the market's real worry. The government's political problems, including the by-elections and the European elections, have all been so widely rehearsed in the financial markets that it is difficult to see what further damage can follow. The economic side of the optimistic argument will be well tested this week. If the Footsie continues to progress against a backcloth of statistics on producer and retail prices, the retail price index and other data, then 'the equity market will have more room to manoeuvre,' as Mr Richard Jeffrey of Charterhouse Tilney puts it. But those still unwilling to take such a positive view will want to see more evidence that equities have indeed shaken off bond market influence - it was still gilts leading equities ahead at the end of the week. Prominent among them is Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research, the noted bear of the London market, who was reported to be cutting his mid-year forecast for the Footsie Index. This week could be the week to watch.</p>

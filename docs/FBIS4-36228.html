			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maher Chmaytelli] </F>   [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, June 7 (AFP) -- Artillery duels  erupted between Yemen's northern and southern forces and shells  rained down on Aden airport Tuesday [7 June] as fighting  shattered a ceasefire only six hours after it came into force.    The truce, declared unilaterally by President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih's government in the capital Sanaa, had come into effect at  midnight (2100 GMT) but firing had gone on unabated right up to  the deadline.    Salih forces and those of the southern breakaway state  declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid began shelling each other at 6:00  a.m. (0300 GMT) on a battle front just 20 kilometres (12 miles)  from this city.    The collapse of the ceasefire was followed by an intense  artillery bombardment of the area around the airport, which the  northerners have been targeting to destroy it as a base for  southern planes.    But southern fighter-bombers were still taking off on combat  missions, as a military spokesman accused Salih's troops of  launching a widespread offensive on all fronts.    He said the onslaught had begun at midnight "the very moment  he (Salih) was announcing to the world he had declared a  ceasefire."    The northerners were "lying" and had dispatched columns of  tanks to several of the war fronts shortly after the truce was  announced, he charged.    The breakaway southern state was still committed to the  ceasefire: "all we are doing is defending ourselves and  repulsing the northern offensive," he said.    As the ceasefire collapsed, Sanaa Radio broadcast messages  to  the population of Aden saying "the hour of liberation has come."    The United Nations Security Council called on June 1 for an  immediate ceasefire in the civil war which erupted on May 5  between north and south, four years after they were unified.  The former South Yemen proclaimed itself independent again on  May 21. [passage omitted]</p>

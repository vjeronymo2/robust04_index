			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Oilseed row raises fears of US-EC trade war THE US has given the European Community until noon today to agree to binding arbitration on its oilseed subsidy regime, twice condemned by a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as contrary to Gatt rules. Rejection by the EC, which has consistently refused any form of binding procedure, would bring the Community to the brink of all-out trade war with the US just as senior officials from both sides are planning a push to break the deadlock in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. Equally critical, the ultimatum shows that the US is threatening to abandon Gatt as a channel for resolving this dispute, endangering the foundations of the trade system overseen by Gatt. Trading partners have become increasingly anxious in recent years that US frustration with the Gatt system of resolving disputes will tempt it to use its might to settle them unilaterally. Mr Julius Katz, deputy US trade representative, said in Washington: 'If the proposal is rejected, that pretty much exhausts the Gatt process and we will have to draw appropriate conclusions. However, there is still the possibility of a negotiated agreement.' Washington stopped short of saying it would impose prohibitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 580m) of EC food imports if Brussels does not act swiftly to remedy the trade losses to US soyabean farmers from its subsidy regime. Mr Katz said the US might continue talks with the EC in the hope of averting a trade war. The EC has refused to change the subsidy system, offering other trade concessions which have been rejected by the US and other oilseed producers. Brussels says it will retaliate if the US imposes sanctions. Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to the Gatt, told Gatt's governing council the US was insisting on an effective procedure to determine 'once and for all' whether the EC was going to implement the panel findings on oilseeds or whether aggrieved parties had the right to retaliate. Mr Yerxa said the US could not accept EC proposals made late on Tuesday for a loosely structured working group with no powers to arbitrate. Under the original US proposal, a three-member panel would determine within 30 days how much damage the EC subsidy regime caused oilseed exporters. If the Community rejected the panel findings, trading partners would have the right to retaliate. The US has put global trading losses at Dollars 2bn a year, with its own soyabean farmers accounting for Dollars 1bn. The EC says the figure is no more than Dollars 400m. EC and US officials have recently expressed hopes that the oilseeds row could be settled this month in the context of a broader Uruguay Round deal. This would involve a separate accord on oilseeds consistent with a final overall deal on reducing farm subsidies. 'An oilseeds deal would be a nice confidence-building agreement for the Uruguay Round. I don't see how we can come up with a Uruguay Round settlement without one,' one EC trade negotiator said.

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN MEN WERE MEN AND WOMEN WERE RIVETERS;  </P> <P> THE YEAR OF THE ZINC PENNY BY RICK DEMARINIS (W. W. NORTON: $17.95; 175 PP.)  </P> <P> Someone has to tell the story, every time. Sometimes the narrator is part of  the story, in on the act, an "I." The "I" here is Trygve Soren Napoli, age 10.  His own self of a later time looks over his shoulder.  </P> <P> The adult Trygve (one can't help thinking of him as a close friend of the  author) probably was invited for his overview. He says such things as, "I was  never aware of having choices," and establishes a time-frame wider than the  story's, a future still to come, by comments like, "Years later I learned. . .  ."  </P> <P> He could have stayed home. Trygve Soren Napoli, age 10, is the hero of this  book, its center and Best Person. This is the history of his year in Los  Angeles, the wartime year the United States Mint made pennies of zinc -- 1943.  </P> <P> "The Year of the Zinc Penny" is the story of Trygve's love for his mother, a  story of unrequited love.  </P> <P> When his mother divorced his father (a man strangely absent from his son's  thoughts and life), Trygve was sent from New York to Montana, to the keeping of  his mother's rigid parents.  </P> <P> After four years, Trygve is sent for and delivered via the Great Northern and  Northern Pacific railroads to his just-remarried mother in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> His mother, a gorgeous, laconic Norwegian-American, is a woman of little  affection and little affect. To Trygve, stepping off the train to meet her  after four years' separation, she is "a radiant blond stranger." She shakes his  hand. "Well, it's been a while," she says.  </P> <P> Talk about bad beginnings. Terrified of being abandoned ("I didn't trust my  mother. She was a disappearing woman."), Trygve refuses to stay behind when his  mother and stepfather take his Uncle Gerald to Tijuana to show him a good time.  </P> <P> So Trygve is a witness when drunken Gerald punches a policeman, and his three  elders are arrested and jailed. Trygve's story begins: "My first night in the  foster home . . . "  </P> <P> Home -- a two-bedroom Westside apartment on Ridgely Drive, north of Adams --  fills with an instant family. Through the thin walls, a child can hear  grown-ups arguing.  </P> <P> Head of the house is Mitchell Selfage, theater-arts graduate, milkman and (thus  enabled) black marketeer, who acquires his 1928 Cadillac with wood-spoked  wheels in the same week he acquires his stepson.  </P> <P> Uncle Gerald is married to Ginger, Trygve's mother's sister. Part Tlingit  Indian, sometimes courtly and kind, a brutal drunk, Gerald is in the Canadian  navy. His ship loads in Long Beach, and his shore leaves mean trouble.  </P> <P> Aunt Ginger, Trygve's mother's dreamy and beautiful sister, as sweet and nutty  as a fruitcake, follows Gerald from Vancouver, probably to stay for the  duration. But duration is a relative concept for Ginger, who believes she's had  many past lives. "Long Ago and Far Away" is her favorite song; here and now  she's Gerald's punching bag. Gerald's son, William, foul-mouthed and sullen at  15, has come with her.  </P> <P> "Now then," Gerald says, when they assemble in the living room. "(Isn't) this  quite a little family situation?"  </P> <P> It's quite a Los Angeles situation, with clicking palm fronds, storm drains,  bougainvillea, waiting lists for apartments, incinerators, lawn sprinklers,  "red wind," Don the Beachcomber's, the just-renamed MacArthur Park, and a class  full of children at the Marvin Street School who don't know what to make of  Master Trygve Soren Napoli.  </P> <P> A neatly lettered sign serves notice that the apartment house is "restricted"  -- no pets, Jews or children allowed (and in 1943, no black or Latino person  would have thought of an apartment in this territory). When the landlord comes,  children run for the "fort," an earthen bunker in the lot next door. It is,  Trygve thinks, "great fun, like war itself."  </P> <P> Los Angeles at war is a city of blackout curtains (and Ken Murray's revue,  "Blackouts") and crowded skies. For the top of a cereal box and a dollar, Tryg  and his friend Malcolm receive air spotter kits -- "side-view and bottom-view  silhouettes of both Japanese and German warplanes. You also got a pair of tin  binoculars."  </P> <P> The two spend their summer days on the roof. "Test pilots from all the major  aircraft plants put their planes through the paces straight over our heads.  P-38s dove and twisted through the stratosphere. Douglas Dauntless SBDs moaned  at low level skipping imaginary bombs through the hot streets. Huge formations  of B-25 Mitchells shook the buildings. Sleek P-51 Mustangs had dogfights with  one another at altitudes so rarefied they could only be seen through the  binoculars. The high-flying B-24s left vapor trails as they crossed from west  to east on their way to England."  </P> <P> Uncle Gerald's rooftop antenna, an absurd, magnificent addition to Tryg's  two-tube shortwave radio, betrays them. The landlord discovers children in his  building, and they are evicted.  </P> <P> Tryg understands at once: "I had lost my home and there was no other." "It  isn't the end of the world," his mother says. But it is to Tryg: "William and I  didn't figure in her plans, not for the time being anyway."  </P> <P> Mother and Ginger will go north to the Kaiser Shipyards, where welders make  even more money than riveters. William (with a birth certificate made in  Tijuana) will join the Marines. Trygve will be sent to Montana on the Super  Chief.  </P> <P> But first there is a burst of sound and color. Mother and Ginger play in  Mexico. After a Margarita or two, joy enters their Norwegian souls. Tryg calls  it "tequila happiness" and helps himself to the dregs of their glasses in a  nightclub. The band leader announces a conga, and the crowd goes wild. So does  Tryg. "La conga! La conga!" he yells, just for that moment caught in ecstasy.  </P> <P> Like all good stories, "The Year of the Zinc Penny" has a shadow tale, the  story of its times. Millions of Americans, most of them men, traveled to  foreign theaters of war in the greatest movement of population the world had  ever seen. Their women moved too, in search of adventure or companionship or to  shed the past, freed from ties and responsibility by the ready money of war  work. Some of them never grew up. Their children had to.  </P></p>

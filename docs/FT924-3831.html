			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Christian Democrats attack Maastricht compromise FIVE Christian Democratic leaders in Europe last night said a British compromise to meet Danish demands for exemptions from the Maastricht treaty were not acceptable in their present form. The Christian Democrats, led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, expressed reservations about a British proposal to give Denmark a legally binding opt-out on European monetary union and exemption from a future European army. The hard line signalled tough bargaining between Denmark and its European partners ahead of next week's Edinburgh summit. Without a resolution of the Danish question, senior officials and diplomats in Brussels yesterday predicted that the summit could be derailed. The Christian Democrat leaders included Mr Kohl, Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, Greek prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis, Luxembourg prime minister Jacques Santer and a senior deputy to Dutch prime minister Mr Ruud Lubbers. Mr Wilfried Martens, president of the European Peoples Party, which groups the parties in the European parliament, and a former Belgian prime minister, said that Denmark was not entitled to a unilateral declaration or decision by the 12 opting out of monetary and political union. This was not acceptable, he said, because it could influence present and future members of the EC to make similar demands. However he was conciliatory in suggesting that the British text on the Danish question had some positive point. Also, the joint declaration by the five leaders on the Edinburgh summit was less explicit in criticising the British text. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, has linked completion of ratification to a second referendum in Denmark, probably next May. Mr Major does not attend the Christian Democrat gatherings because the Tory party is not part of the EPP, even though Conservative MEPs are allied to it.</p>

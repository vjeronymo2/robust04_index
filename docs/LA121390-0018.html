			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF YOU CAN SPARE A DIME, SPARE THE SERMON;  </P> <P> WELFARE: OUR WILLINGNESS TO BELIEVE THE WORST ABOUT PEOPLE IS A NEW IMPEDIMENT  TO CHARITY.  </P> <P> Government assaults on the living standards of low-income people have been so  common in the past nine years that they hardly rate a bulletin. Now, the threat  of recession raises anxiety that trouble will reach people who may have thought  themselves immune. So far unnoted and now even more important is the peculiarly  mean and petty quality that has crept into our way of thinking about  financially needy people.  </P> <P> Among early evidences was a change in the federal welfare program, Aid to  Families with Dependent Children. It seemed sensible to include childless but  pregnant women in AFDC; perhaps they could avoid having low-birth-weight  babies. In 1981, however, AFDC was amended to forbid payments to such women in  the first six months of pregnancy. Someone had reflected that women might  deliberately get pregnant in order to collect welfare for three or four months  and then abort. Estimates were that $1 million -- in a $10-billion program --  would be saved by delaying AFDC coverage until the seventh month. In the whole  country, how many women were thus discouraged from conceiving and planning a  late abortion in order to cheat the government? What can have occupied the  reveries of the legislator who worked out this problem and introduced it into  the discussions of a committee dealing with weighty tax issues?  </P> <P> More flagrant, because it displays the thought processes of a group of  prestigious civic leaders and scholars, was the following observation about  incentives for self-improvement as a factor in the lives of poor people; it  occurred during a discussion about how to extend prenatal care:  </P> <P> "The wonders of modern technology," a Ford Foundation report says, "may lead to  a social policy dilemma: We are increasingly able to save the lives of even the  tiniest newborns. We want people in all situations, including but not limited  to the poor, to be able to avail themselves of life-saving technologies, but we  do not want these technologies to encourage social behavior that triggers their  use."  </P> <P> It may require rereading to be certain that one has understood the logic:  Pregnant women may eat poorly and fail to see a physician, not to mention use  drugs and do other things that will injure their unborn children, because they  think that modern technology will be able to undo the damage. In short,  technology provides an incentive for neglecting one's unborn child! Do the  authors seem intoxicated with their own words? Are they out of touch with  ordinary women? Or is the problem more ominous: Are poor women in particular  seen as an alien species requiring scientific management -- say, husbandry?  </P> <P> Now comes the Emergency Food and Shelter National Board, involving people from  United Way, the American Red Cross and other major philanthropies. They are  promoting a program (pioneered in Los Angeles) that gives panhandlers food  coupons instead of cash. We are to buy coupons redeemable for food and, when  the spirit moves us, hand them out to beggars on the street. This says  implicitly that we suspect that cash might be used for alcohol or drugs (as we  do suspect, of course), and we have gone to some pains -- sent a check  somewhere, or queued up at a counter -- to make sure the $1 or $2 we give is  not misused.  </P> <P> What is involved in such tender care about trivial sums of money? For the  donor, does it not perfectly blend the pleasures of charity and righteousness?  And is the recipient warmed by the gift?  </P> <P> The United States has a long tradition of what historians call "scientific  charity." For 100 years, the term has described and justified painstakingly  measured help embedded in less-measured moral uplift. It is our privilege to be  penurious, but what does it do for us or for the needy to think and act so mean  while we are at it?  </P></p>

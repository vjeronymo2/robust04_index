			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Tennis: The year Seles ruled THE outstanding tennis player of the year in 1991 was a woman. The double-barrelled power of Monica Seles brought the 18-year-old Yugoslav left-hander ten titles including all three grand slam championships she contested (Australia, France and the US), plus the season-ending Virginia Slims. In a remarkably consistent year she reached the final of every tournament she entered and could be criticised only for the manner of her mysterious withdrawal from Wimbledon. As a result of the storm of controversy that surrounded her silence on the subject, she will be a wiser woman in 1992. Stefan Edberg's claim to top spot among the men is not so clear-cut. As in 1990, the four grand slam titles were won by four different players. Boris Becker, after winning his first Australian title, had a spell atop the computer rankings and rose briefly to that position again following his passage to the Wimbledon final. Michael Stich's victory that day was an astonishing performance for a man who had only one tournament success to his name, and the psychological damage he inflicted on Becker seemed to affect his fellow German for the rest of the year. Jim Courier, the American in Paris, whose forceful top-spin brought him victories over Edberg, Stich and Andre Agassi on the slow red clay to earn him a first grand slam crown, was also a finalist in New York, but he was crushed there by Edberg. The year had started badly for Stefan with a semi-final loss to Ivan Lendl in Australia after the Swede had served a double-fault at match point. Things did not improve in Paris where he fell to the groundstroke power of Courier, and at Wimbledon there was that frustrating semi-final loss to Stich when the German never broke his serve but won three tie-break sets after losing the first. Edberg finally stamped his authority on the year in New York. His crushing wins over Lendl and Courier in the last two rounds brought him his fourth title of 1991, a total he later extended to six with wins in Sydney and Tokyo. Only Guy Forget, one of the heroes of France's emotional Davis Cup success against the Americans in Lyon, could claim as many titles in 1991. Courier leaps from near obscurity to the No 2 spot. He was not far from dislodging Edberg from No 1. He had lost to the Swede in Melbourne but balanced that by gaining revenge in Paris, and would have overtaken him if he had won their final in New York. The 21-year-old double-hander is a gritty competitor who makes the most of his physical strength. With the help of his coach, Jose Higueras, Courier is a much more patient player and his three tournament wins, plus an appearance in the final of the ATP Tour championships in Frankfurt, gives him the edge over Becker. Stich's Wimbledon triumph alone would have given him preference over Ivan Lendl, but before that the 23-year-old newcomer had been a semi-finalist in Paris; afterwards, he claimed the titles in Stuttgart, Vienna and Schenectady, New York to underline his rising status. With a second serve the equal of most men's first delivery, a beautifully-timed backhand of great penetration and a growing awareness of his latent ability, we could see greater things from this intelligent and likeable man in 1992. After a dramatic loss to Becker in the Australian final, Lendl's year was marred by an infection on his playing hand following an operation to remove hard skin. He missed the French Open and did not recover his best form at Wimbledon or in New York. However, he did garner three tournament wins and performed better in major Championships than Forget. Below Seles there was little difficulty in rating the next four women. Steffi Graf reclaimed her Wimbledon crown in a nail-biting finish against Gabriela Sabatini and could forget the family problems that had so affected her in 1990. However, she is unlikely ever to forget the humiliation of a 6-2 6-0 loss to Arantxa Sanchez in the semi-finals in Paris, her worst defeat at a major Championship. By reaching the final at Wimbledon, the semi-finals in Paris and the last eight at the Australian and US Opens, Sabatini had a marginally better year than Martina Navratilova who did not challenge in Melbourne or Paris but did reach the final in New York. Navratilova lost her Wimbledon title at the quarter-final stage when Jennifer Capriati, belying her 15 years, produced an extraordinarily mature performance to win in two close sets. This was one of the best matches of the year but Capriati gave us an even greater thrill in New York by taking Seles to the brink of defeat in a heroic semi-final that ended in a third set tie-break of unbearable tension.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- John Barrett's 1991 world rankings (last year's rank in brackets)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  Stefan Edberg   (Swe 1)     1 Monica Seles               (Yug 2) 2  Jim Courier     (US - )     2 Steffi Graf                (Ger 1) 3  Boris Becker    (Ger 5)     3 Gabriela Sabatini          (Arg 3) 4  Michael Stich   (Ger - )    4 Martina Navratilova        (US 4) 5  Ivan Lendl      (Cze 2)     5 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario    (Sp 8) 6  Guy Forget      (Fra - )    6 Mary Joe Fernandez         (US 5) 7  Andre Agassi    (US 3)      7 Jennifer Capriati          (US 10) 8  Pete Sampras    (US 4)      8 Jana Novotna               (Cze - ) 9  Karel Novacek   (Cze - )    9 Conchita Martinez          (Sp - ) 10 Petr Korda      (Cze - )   10 Manuela Maleeva Fragniere  (Bul 9)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

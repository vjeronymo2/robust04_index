			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Moscow literati feel a sad optimism LIKE MANY of the Russian people, Moscow's intellectuals and cultural elite are trying to come to grips with the political drama in Moscow and to measure the likelihood of armed conflict or civil war. 'Bloodshed must be avoided at any cost, everything else comes second,' says Mr Mikhail Yermakov, a former space programme engineer turned entrepreneur. Mr Yermakov says he does not care too much who wins in the stand-off as long as there is no violence. But most of the intelligentsia are more politicised, with the majority siding with Mr Yeltsin. 'I am just plain happy that it has happened at last,' says Mr Bulat Okudzhava, a poet and writer. 'It's a pity that it took so long for the president to make up his mind to act decisively.' Many in Moscow see Mr Okudzhava as the 'conscience' of the Russian literary world. Now he calls himself a 'sad optimist' - understanding the depth of the problems facing the Russian people, he still believes in a positive outcome. And in Mr Yeltsin, too. 'The president and the government commit terrible blunders all the time, but at least they are the learners, at least they do understand the absolute necessity of very profound reforms, while their opponents are hopeless,' he says. Mr Okudzhava is one of an influential group of writers who, while wary of Mr Yeltsin's style, would rather see him in power than his rivals. Mr Vladlen Sirotkin, a historian and a professor at the prestigious Diplomatic Academy, says he is 'bewildered and baffled by what both sides are doing. Why, for God's sake, should Mr Khasbulatov, the speaker of the parliament, provoke Mr Yeltsin in such a way? And why should Mr Yeltsin let himself be duped by this provocation into such an illegal action?' Mr Sirotkin believes the main danger lies in the regions. 'The local councils (elected) will support the parliament and the regional administrations (appointed by Mr Yeltsin) in most cases will side with the president. Isn't it the recipe for civil war? Finally, they will all lose faith in central institutions and they will try to secede.' And what does he think of the position taken by the west? Not much. 'The only thing that matters for the west is that somebody stays in full control of the nukes. And Yeltsin suits them in this role because they are used to him and because he's been popularly elected and has won the recent referendum.' Mr Okudzhava is much more impressed with the west's support of Mr Yeltsin. 'It is absolutely wonderful that the west is so unanimous in supporting Mr Yeltsin so firmly. You could easily see on television how terribly angry those idiots in the parliament were with the western reaction.' Mrs Yelena Schelina, an engineer and a senior manager at the Institute for Patent Research, stresses that the danger of street violence is something which terrifies nearly everybody, regardless of their political beliefs. But it is more likely that Mr Yeltsin will pull it off this time, she says. But what about Mr Alexander Rutskoi? 'I used to respect him but don't any more. I think most of the Russians are disappointed in him. Khasbulatov is just using him to get backing from the army,' she says. Andrei Ostalsky is Foreign Editor of Izvestia newspaper</p>

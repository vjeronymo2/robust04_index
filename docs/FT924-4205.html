			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Dairy Crest 39% up but warns on margins DAIRY CREST, the milk and dairy products group which is to float in 1994, announced a 38.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 17.2m for the half year to September 30. The company, a subsidiary of the Milk Marketing Board, will be divested when the MMB is replaced by a co-operative in 1994. Mr Geoffrey John, chairman of Dairy Crest, said that the business was constrained by its ownership. He said the group could not issue shares for acquisitions, was strictly limited in its operations to liquid milk and milk manufacture in England and Wales, and was still regarded as 'user of last resort' for milk, putting it at a disadvantage to other buyers. He said the company's strategy was to be in a position to compete with other dairy groups by the flotation. A rationalisation programme was aimed at making Dairy Crest a low cost producer. It had also made two strategic deals. It bought half of Unigate's liquid milk activities in 1989, giving it a 17 per cent share of that market. Last year it formed a joint venture with Yoplait of France on fresh products, such as yoghurts and desserts, which is the fastest growing sector of the dairy market but one where Dairy Crest had not been represented. Mr John said that in the half year the volume of milk it was able to buy for processing fell by 5 per cent as quotas on milk began to bite. However, higher selling prices allowed turnover to rise 1.4 per cent to Pounds 574.8m. In the second half significantly higher milk prices for milk used for manufacture would put margins under pressure, he warned. Mr John Houliston, chief executive, said cost cutting, including a reduction of 1,000 in staff over the last year, helped push operating profit up 9.6 per cent to Pounds 28.5m. Operating profits per employee had risen by 21.6 per cent in the half year. Associates, mainly the joint venture with Yoplait, contributed Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 100,000). A fall in interest charges of Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 4.9m, of which about Pounds 2.8m came from lower borrowings and the rest from lower interest rates, more than offset a rise in exceptional costs from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 6.9m. Those costs related to the rationalisation programme and the cost of moving doorstep delivery milk rounds to franchises.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Business backs fight on illiteracy THE NATIONAL Literacy Trust, a new charity financed by business to co-ordinate efforts to combat illiteracy, was launched yesterday. The launch follows the finding earlier this year by the Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit that one in five adults had problems with reading and writing. Several large corporate backers, including WH Smith, the retailer, and Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, are funding the trust, which will target improvements to parents' literacy, and 'home-school' partnerships. Its council includes Lord Walker of Worcester, former Tory cabinet minister; Baroness Dean, former leader of Sogat, the printers' union; and Mr Simon Jenkins, The Times' columnist. The trust's founders have already consulted with more than 50 organisations working in the field of illiteracy, and will promote good practice and organise its own campaigns. Ms Usha Prashar, the trust's deputy chairman, said the trust would attempt to promote reading as a positive activity. A survey which was carried out for the trust found that 24 per cent of adults never read fiction books, while only 7.4 per cent described reading as 'fun'. Mr Neil McClelland, director of the trust, said: 'A lot of people start to turn off reading for pleasure at the adolescent stage, because it isn't seen as the thing to do. We will try to make a contribution towards changing that.' The survey also found that 77.4 per cent of adults felt that the ability to read was a more important skill than the ability to use computers. However, a survey of 400 businesses by Nielsen Consumer Research found that 86 per cent thought it was important for school-leavers to have experience with personal computers. The need for experience with industry-compatible computers - rather than the Apple and Acorn systems mostly used in schools - was highlighted by 83 per cent.</p>

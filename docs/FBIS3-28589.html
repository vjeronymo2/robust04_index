			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Beijing correspondent Moriyasu Okazaki] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that China wants Japan to make  the construction of a bullet train system between Beijing and  Shanghai a key project in the next yen-based loans that will  begin in 1996. During a recent visit to China by Tsutomu Hata,  deputy prime minister and foreign minister, the two countries  agreed to carry out a symbolic project of Japanese-Chinese  cooperative relations, and this project could be a suitable  project for fulfilling that agreement. But France and Germany  are reported to be pulling ahead of Japan in selling the  high-speed railway project to China. If China decides to adopt  France's TGV [le train de grande vitesse -- high-speed train]  system but to use yen-based loans, this will pose a difficult  problem for Japan.    The plan for the high-speed railway system envisages  constructing an elevated railway 1,330 km long. Its train should  be able to run at a maximum speed of 250 km an hour, thus  reducing the travel time between Beijing and Shanghai to six to  seven hours from the current 17 hours. The construction project  will cost 800 billion to 1 trillion yen. A source familiar with  Japanese-Chinese relations said that China has only presented an  unofficial list of yen-based loan projects, and that the  high-speed railway construction project is on this list.    A problem is that Japan is considered to be behind other  competitors in this project. The Chinese newspaper CHINA DAILY  has reported that competition for it is intense and that France  and Germany are ahead of other competitors. Because the  yen-based loans are untied and are provided without strings  attached, Japan in principle cannot complain even if China  decides to build a French bullet train system using funds  provided by Japan. But in Japan, there are people asking why it  should provide huge yen-based loans to China, which is  continuing its rapid economic growth, when Japan's own economy  is experiencing a serious situation. Usually, the yen-based  loan plan is prepared for a five- to six-year period. This time,  however, Japan will prepare the new yen-based loan plan for a  two- to three-year period, no doubt out of a desire to make the  amount of financial assistance look smaller this way.    But, in view of the principle of economical cooperation,  there is no way for Japan to openly ask China to choose the  Japanese bullet train system. It is possible to use a "clever  move." For example, if Japan extends China technological  cooperation from the stage of carrying out an economic  feasibility study, this will mean carrying out the study using  the specifications of the Japanese bullet train system, which in  turn may lead to China's eventually choosing the Japanese  system. In any case, Japan has no choice but to keep its  fingers crossed. Depending on how one looks at it, this can be  a good opportunity for Japan to roll back the competition. But,  it is likely to be an issue which will cause some headaches.</p>

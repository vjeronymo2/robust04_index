			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALVADOR MILITARY CALLS REBEL PEACE BID A MARXIST PLOT  </P> <P> A revised peace plan offered by Salvadoran guerrillas was described Wednesday  by the Defense Ministry as part of a "sinister strategic plan of  Marxism-Leninism," leaving only a faint hope for a negotiated end to El  Salvador's nine-year civil war.  </P> <P> The military's negative statement was seconded by a senior government official  who is a major figure in the ruling Christian Democratic Party. "The plan  obviously is fatally flawed," he said.  </P> <P> The rejections came a day after leaders of El Salvador's 13 political parties  met in Mexico with commanders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,  the umbrella organization for the five Salvadoran guerrilla groups.  </P> <P> Ending two days of talks in Mexico, the FMLN said it would accept the  legitimacy of elections, negotiate a cease-fire and ultimately disband the  7,000-man guerrilla army.  </P> <P> In exchange, the guerrillas demanded postponement until July of presidential  elections now scheduled for March 19, reorganization of the electoral process  to guarantee free participation by the FMLN and its supporters, reduction of  the army from 56,000 to 12,000 -- the level when the civil war began --  reorganization of security forces and prosecution of military personnel for  human rights violations.  </P> <P> The military and President Jose Napoleon Duarte have maintained since the FMLN  first proposed last month that the elections be delayed that any postponement  past March would be an unacceptable violation of the constitution.  </P> <P> That position, supported by the U.S. Embassy, deepened after the rebel  proposals in Mexico for cutting the army and prosecuting military personnel for  human rights abuses.  </P> <P> "While millions of Salvadorans clamor for peace and reject violence, death and  destruction," said a Defense Ministry statement, "the FMLN, represented in  Mexico by four terrorist leaders, is launching the sinister strategic plans of  Marxism-Leninism in order to obtain power."  </P> <P> Even Hector Silva, a leader of the Democratic Convergence, a coalition of  socialist and leftist parties backed by the FMLN and already taking part in the  elections, said there is no chance of delaying the vote.  </P> <P> There is a slim chance, however, that the peace process can be kept alive. The  representatives of the 13 parties who sent delegates to Mexico said they will  recommend that the Duarte government and the army meet again with the FMLN  leaders to discuss the rebel proposals.  </P> <P> The U.S.-backed government is unlikely to reject a call by more than a dozen  political parties, including the ruling Christian Democrats, for talks because  it does not want to take the blame for seeming to block peace efforts on the  eve of elections.  </P> <P> As a European diplomat put it, "The game is to get the other side to make the  final break and take the blame for restarting the killing."  </P> <P> He said the only hope is that further negotiations will develop a momentum of  their own, with neither side wanting to appear at fault for a collapse of the  peace effort.  </P> <P> The talks would be the first between the government and rebels since 1987 --  and the first to include the political parties. Duarte held three rounds of  negotiations with the guerrillas in the last five years, but none were  successful.  </P> <P> A European diplomat observing the talks said the U.S. response to the proposal  will be the key.  </P> <P> "The only thing that could make the armed forces come around would be if  Washington says, 'We want this,' " he said. "But that is difficult for them to  do."  </P> <P> The rebels, while showing flexibility at the negotiating table, flexed their  military muscle in El Salvador to show that they are not dealing out of  weakness. In recent days they have stepped up attacks and sabotage, blacking  out electricity Wednesday in 40% of the country, including nearly all of San  Salvador.  </P> <P> "The logic of the war continues while we make efforts for a peaceful solution,"  rebel commander Francisco Jovel, known as Roberto Roca, said.  </P> <P> Freed reported from San Salvador and Miller from Mexico City.  </P></p>

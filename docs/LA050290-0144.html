			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> A SPECIAL REPORT: SPRING INTO FALL;  </P> <P> 60S / 90S: FALL STYLES RECALL THE AGE OF AQUARIUS  </P> <P> If you think fashion is just supposed to be fun, fall '90 could be the party  you've been waiting for. Clothes haven't been such a hoot since Jackie O lived  in the White House and the peppermint twist was the only dance in town.  </P> <P> Some of the grandest names in the business are flirting with this giddy flame.  </P> <P> In Paris, Christian Lacroix has regaled the '90s rich hippie with cashmere  ponchos, poor boy sweaters and op-art tent dresses that collide with op-art  tights.  </P> <P> Claude Montana has the '90s answer to Beatlemania in his Sergeant Pepper  pantsuits decorated with fine gold chain. Sixties-inspired capes, halter  dresses and short, tent-shaped coats by Montana come in Andy Warhol shades of  red, yellow and violet.  </P> <P> In Italy, Gianni Versace is cutting shapes last seen at the garden party in  Federico Fellini's "Juliette of the Spirits." Fitted bodices expand into bell  skirts; shaped necklines play against shaped hemlines. And legs are veiled in  ivory hose.  </P> <P> New Yorkers Charlotte Neuville, Adrienne Vittadini and Marc Jacobs for Perry  Ellis are bringing back maxi coats with miniskirts, sleeveless skimmer dresses  to wear with elbow-length gloves and the color white as a replacement for  black.  </P> <P> Londoners have reinvented hot pants -- the shortest of the shorts -- and  fake-fur chubs -- those cropped jackets to wear day or night. Veteran  fashioneer Vivienne Westwood has the look down pat. Newcomer Rifat Ozbek goes  '60s for the first time, with his crushed-velvet bell bottoms and  midriff-baring tops.  </P> <P> Los Angeles designer Melinda Besnoin for Melivier shows '60s-chic dresses for  fall. They havejewel necklines and narrow sleeves, and go best with sturdy  pumps. Tokyo's Norihisa Ota, a trend-setter there, is styling James Bond girl  clothes inspired by '60s ski wear. The preferred color is Pucci pink.  </P></p>

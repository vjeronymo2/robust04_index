			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: President Hafiz al-Asad presented to  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher Syria's viewpoint on  the peace process and its goal. In light of this, the U.S.  secretary of state has stressed that the negotiations have  entered a new and important stage. They also agreed to resume  the talks when Christopher returns to Damascus. This means that  the United States is exerting extensive efforts and is also  eager to take steps that will help the parties involved march  together on the long road to peace.    There is no doubt that Syria welcomes the U.S. efforts and  hopes the U.S. secretary of state's tour will produce true and  constructive progress to push the peace process forward. Syria  also reaffirms the constant principles of a just and  comprehensive solution and the basic requirements and necessary  priorities of the peace process. Syria is also eager to achieve  the full goals of the peace process, and will spare no effort to  render the U.S. secretary of state's tour successful in order to  rescue the peace process from the current stalemate it is facing  as a result of the many Israeli obstacles, which have become  traps and mines threatening the peace process and pushing its  toward a deadlock.    Any fair observer will not have much difficulty in  understanding the nature of the Syrian position. Syria's  position toward the peace process is very clear, and not much  effort is needed to explain Syria's role and constant  principles. The entire world is aware of Syria's credibility  and its sound policy toward the peace process. It also  understands Syria's correct position and its principles, derived  from the resolutions of international legitimacy and from the  need to establish justice and protect the region from shocks,  trouble, and tension in order to secure a total Israeli  withdrawal, stability, security, tranquility, and peace in the  region.    Syria opened the way for a real, just, and comprehensive  peace by agreeing to the U.S. initiative based on the principle  of land for peace and the resolutions of international  legitimacy, which stipulate the withdrawal of the Israeli forces  from the occupied Arab territories. During the sixth round of  the Washington talks, Syria presented a paper of principles that  was branded as comprehensive and balanced.    Syria has formulated its clear and serious position toward  peace by adopting the principle of total withdrawal in return  for comprehensive peace. This is a practical and real  translation of the principle of returning the land to its Arab  owners. In other words, there will be no peace with occupation,  and there will be no peace other than just and comprehensive  peace based on regaining rights. This is the honorable peace to  which Syria adheres and seeks.    The necessary condition for the success of U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher's tour lies in Israel's immediate  response to carry out a total withdrawal from the Golan and  return it together with its citizens and every inch of land to  the motherland, Syria. Proceeding from this, it is Israel that  is required to show goodwill to achieve a just and comprehensive  peace.</p>

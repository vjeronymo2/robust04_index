			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Competition breaks up Nordic banking co-operation venture Increasing cross-border competition within Nordic banking has led four of the region's top banks to break up a 10-year-old co-operation deal. The four - Unibank of Denmark, Union Bank of Finland, Den norske Bank of Norway and Sweden's Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken - had handled each other's interests in their respective markets under a venture called Scandinavian Banking Partners. At the height of the accord, they opened a joint venture in London called the Scandinavian Banking Group, but this was bought out by SE-Banken in 1990 and merged with its existing London operation. Since then, the partnership has been slimmed down to focus on a small range of business areas. SE-Banken's move to open its own branches in Oslo and Helsinki, part of an increasing trend among Nordic banks to move into neighbouring markets, precipitated the decision finally to disband the partnership. SE-Banken said no financial settlement was involved in the decision.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Hubei Provincial Government Work Report Delivered by Hubei </F> Governor Jia Zhijie Before the Second Session of the Eighth  Provincial People's Congress on 26 February: "Government Work  Report"]    [Text] Fellow Deputies:    On behalf of the provincial people's government, I now  submit  the report on the work of the government for your examination  and approval, and also for suggestions and comments from members  of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and other observers.  <H5>  I. A Review of Our Work in 1993 </H5>   The year 1993 was one in which this session of the  provincial  government started its work, and also one in which the people of  the entire province strived to overfulfill tasks for national  economic development and advanced on the road of building  socialism with the Chinese characteristics. During the year,  under the leadership of the provincial party committee and with  the supervision and support of the provincial people's congress  and the provincial CPPCC, we conscientiously implemented the  spirit of the 14th party congress, put into practice all major  policy decisions made by the central authorities on  strengthening macroeconomic control and regulation in the light  of Hubei's realistic conditions, constantly deepened reform,  expanded the scale of opening up, seized favorable  opportunities, accelerated development, and attained encouraging  new achievements in reform, opening up, and the modernization  drive. The province's GDP was 108.1 billion yuan, representing a  record increase for the past eight years of 12.7 percent; the  total industrial and agricultural output value stood at 213.2  billion yuan, an increase of 17.8 percent; and financial revenue  amounted to 11.47 billion yuan, a 21.8-percent increase. The  per capita income used by urban dwellers for living expenses was  2,191 yuan, up by 516 yuan; while the per capita net income of  peasants increased by 105 yuan to 783 yuan. Our targets of  "three surpasses and one enhancement" set at the beginning of  the year were all fulfilled. A review of our work of the past  year shows that we focused our attention on the following major  issues, which has successfully brought along the development of  the whole province:    1. Vigorous efforts made on structural readjustment  helped enhance economic development and efficiency. To  achieve the goal of high yield, fine quality, and high  efficiency, the agricultural sector stepped up the intensity of  structural readjustment. As a result, the production of grain,  cotton and cooking oil remained basically stable, while the  development of the diversified economy was clearly expedited.  The total agricultural output value for the year reached 46.7  billion yuan, up by 6.7 percent, of which the output value of  the nonfarming sectors was up by 4 percentage points, accounting  for 39.7 percent of the total agricultural output value. New  strides were taken in readjusting the industrial product mix and  the enterprise structure. Our plan for new product development  was fulfilled in a comprehensive way, and 800 enterprises  adopted the share-holding system. The industrial output value  for the year amounted to 166.5 billion yuan, up by 21.3 percent.  The investment structure was further optimized. The  fixed-asset investment for the year stood at 34.88 billion yuan,  up by 44.9 percent, while investment in agriculture, energy,  transport, and telecommunications went up steadily.    2. Close attention was paid to the development of  township and town enterprises and the development of the  individual and private economies, and major breakthroughs were  made in cultivating new economic growth points. The  provincial party committee and government called separate  meetings on the work of township and town enterprises and the  work of the individual and private economies with a view to  improving and perfecting policies in these fields. A campaign  of emulating, learning from, catching up with, helping and in  turn surpassing each other was set off in all localities, giving  a great impetus to the development of township and town  enterprises and the development of the individual and private  economies. The total output value of the province's township  and town enterprises reached 90.8 billion yuan, while the sales  volume of the individual and private economies totaled 13.82  billion yuan, up by 68.8 and 71.1 percent respectively.    3. Efforts were made to step up the development of  energy, communications, and other basic industries and  facilities, thus easing "bottleneck restrictions" to a certain  extent. Encouraged by the provincial meeting on the power  industry, all localities tried to pool funds to accelerate power  construction. During the year, generating capacity increased by  1.45 million kw, thus easing the tightness of supply of  electricity. Basic transportation facilities were being  constantly improved and special attention was paid to the  construction of a number of projects, including the Yihuang  Highway, the Wuhan Tianhe Airport, the Chang Jiang Highway  Bridge, and Enshi Airport.    4. We seized the favorable opportunity of opening up  the Chang Jiang to the outside world, and further expanded and  deepened opening up. With the implementation of the  state's strategy on opening up and developing the Chang Jiang,  more foreign investors began to show interest in Hubei. In  order to seize this favorable opportunity, the provincial  government successfully held a large-scale economic and trade  fair in Hong Kong, at which a large number of contracts on  cooperative projects were signed. Meanwhile, large-scale  activities aimed at attracting foreign investment were also  carried out in all localities, thus opening up a new situation  in Hubei's introduction of foreign investment. Cities like  Wuhan and Yichang in particular have become hot investment spots  for major companies and financial groups based in foreign  countries as well as in Hong Kong and Macao. The number of  newly approved foreign- invested enterprises across the province  was 2,188, 943 more than the previous year. The total  investment amount entailed by all projects stood at $4.84  billion, up by 190 percent, of which foreign investment totaled  $1.94 billion, with $530 million already put into use,  registering a 160-percent increase. Remarkable results were  attained in foreign trade and export. The total export volume  reached $1.686 billion, representing an increase of 22 percent.    5. Strides were taken to implement major policy  decisions of the central authorities on strengthening  macroeconomic control and regulation in the light of Hubei's  realistic conditions, thus ensuring normal national economic  operation. Shortly after the central authorities issued  the No. 6 Document, the provincial party and government promptly  called a provincial meeting on financial and monetary work, at  which the guiding principle of two "unswervings" was defined and  a "Suggestion on Implementation of the No. 6 Document of the  Central Authorities to Improve and Strengthen Macroeconomic  Control and Regulation" was issued. As a result, the arbitrary  practices of granting loans, raising funds, and establishing  monetary institutions were effectively stopped. With a view to  making flexible use of capital which was already in short supply  and attaining greater progress under difficult situations,  governments and monetary departments at all levels worked in  close coordination, strengthened the collection and regulation  of funds, satisfied the demands for purchasing agricultural  products, and put an end to the practice of issuing IOUs.  Remarkable results were attained in mobilizing the masses to  deposit more savings in banks. By the end of December, the  savings deposits balance across the province reached 79.852  billion yuan, an increase of 18.042 billion yuan over the same  period of the previous year, of which the savings deposits newly  added during a four-month period from August to December  accounted for 56 percent of the total, registering an increase  of 6.573 billion yuan over the same period of the previous year.  The year-end loans balance was 116.261 billion yuan, 17.9  billion yuan more than the end of the previous year.    6. A well-coordinated development was brought to the  economy and social undertakings, and the living standards of the  people were further improved. Great headway was made in  applying scientific and technological achievements to economic  development. Of the province's 550 scientific and technological  achievements at the provincial level and above, 39 were given  national awards and the utilization rate stood at 80 percent.  Education developed in a comprehensive way. Elementary  education was further stepped up, while vocational and higher  education constantly improved. Sports were further developed.  Nine athletes from Hubei won world championships at  international meets during the year, while another three broke  world records on six occasions. Progress was also registered in  the fields of literature and art; the press and publishing;  radio, film and television; the social sciences; public health;  family planning; and environmental protection. Alongside the  development of our economy, markets flourished, enjoying brisk  buying and selling. The volume of retail sales for the year  amounted to 55.654 billion yuan, registering an increase of 21.1  percent.    7. Simultaneous attention was paid to "two types of  work" with a view to reinforcing the building of socialist  spiritual civilization, socialist democracy, and the legal  system. Education was carried out in depth on the party's  basic line, patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; while  activities were launched with the aim of cultivating new  practices in trades, emulating Lei Feng at various working  posts, and building "two civilizations" units as well as  civilized households. As a result, the ideological and ethical  qualities of the vast numbers of masses were enhanced. Through  their study of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"  in particular, the people of the entire province further  strengthened their consciousness and confidence in taking the  road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  Governments at all levels submitted regular work reports to the  standing committee of the provincial people's congress, briefed  the provincial CPPCC on recent developments, solicited opinions  of all sides on major issues, and thus further reinforced  democratic supervision and decisionmaking procedures. The  campaign of "cracking down on crime" continued. Heavy  punishments were swiftly handed down to a number of major  criminals according to the law, thus bringing a favorable turn  to social order. Strides were made in lightening the heavy  burden of peasants and protecting their legitimate interests and  rights. The anticorruption struggle was carried out in depth,  and a number of large and serious cases were cracked, bringing  about new breakthroughs in the building of clean government.    Fellow Deputies,    We attained tremendous accomplishments last year. It is the  people of all nationalities of our province who, through their  hard work and concerted efforts, have made all these  achievements possible. On behalf of the provincial people's  government, I wish to express heartfelt gratitude to the vast  numbers of cadres and masses working on all fronts across the  province as well as to the officers and men of the People's  Liberation Army and the Armed Police stationed in Hubei. I also  wish to express our sincere thanks to our compatriots in Taiwan,  Hong Kong and Macao and those residing abroad and to all our  international friends who care about and support Hubei's  construction!    While affirming our achievements, we must also recognize  with a sober mind that there have been failings and mistakes in  the work of the government and that there are still problems and  difficulties in our way ahead. These are chiefly the following:  Capital supply and demand remain imbalanced, and a considerable  number of medium-sized and small enterprises are faced with  great difficulties in their operation and plagued by heavy  losses; commodity prices have increased by a large margin,  making life more difficult for workers in enterprises in which  production has been totally or partially suspended, and also for  peasants in certain mountain areas; social order was not as good  as expected; the situation in family planning still remains  grim; and corrupt practices, formalism, and bureaucracy existing  among a minority of state workers have impaired the close ties  between the government and the masses. We need to pay close  attention to and to adopt effective measures to solve all these  problems. In reviewing our work in the past year, we believe  that earnest efforts need to be made in the following fields  this year in order to consolidate and develop the present sound  situation in reform and opening up:    First, to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy, it is imperative to regard  development as the last word. At present, Hubei is enjoying  favorable opportunities and conditions for further development.  We must seize these favorable opportunities and go all out to  accelerate economic development. We should give vigorous  support to those localities which have the conditions to speed  up construction and which have the capability to expedite  construction through arduous efforts. With a view to creating a  sound social environment wherein development is justified and  commendable, a policy should be adopted toward localities,  enterprises, and individuals of remuneration for their  outstanding contributions to economic development, thus giving  form to a unifying force in our effort to speed up economic  reform.    Second, it is necessary to continuously deepen reform  and expand opening up, and bring about a faster and better  development of the economy. Since reform and opening up  are a strong motive force to push forward economic development,  we need to step up the intensity of reform, and rely on reform  to bring along the whole situation. We must integrate economic  development with reform and opening up in an organic way, focus  our efforts on reinvigorating state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises, deepen reform in all sectors, speed up the  development pace of an export-oriented economy, and inject  greater vigor into our economy.    Third, we must put the enhancement of economic  efficiency in first place, and seek unity between speed,  efficiency, and development potential. We must put an end  to practices such as blindly seeking high output values,  engaging in overlapping construction of poor quality, and  extensive management; exert great efforts to optimize the  economic structure, push forward technological progress, and  improve operational management; and regard, in real terms, the  enhancement of economic efficiency as the focus of our economic  development.    Fourth, we must correctly handle relations between  reform, development, and social stability. Reform is a  motive force of development while development is the goal, and  social stability is the prerequisite for both.    Under the present situation wherein reform is intensified  and  development accelerated, we must take into consideration the  endurance capacity of all social sectors, and correctly handle  relations between reform, development, and social stability. We  should not stress stability to the neglect of reform and  development, nor can we only emphasize reform and development to  the neglect of social stability. What we should do is integrate  the three in an organic way and make them complementary to each  other.    Fifth, we should "pay simultaneous attention to two  types of work," attaching equal importance to both.  Efforts to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization,  socialist democracy, and the legal system with a view to  maintaining political and social stability are a fundamental  guarantee for pushing forward the building of material  civilization. To ensure smooth progress in all fields of  endeavor, we should unswervingly pay simultaneous attention to  the building of material and spiritual civilization, attaching  equal importance to reform and opening up on the one hand and to  the building of clean government and the crackdown on all crime  on the other.  <H5>  II. The Goal of Struggle and Major Tasks in Economic </H5> Development in 1994    The year 1994 is vital not only to Hubei's plan to push the  national economy onto the first new step in the nineties, but  also to our efforts to promote reform. At present, our province  is enjoying favorable opportunities and a sound situation for  further development. The national economy has joined an  "express line" of development; following Wuhan and Huangshi,  Yichang has become another open city, thus bringing a major  change to the overall setup of opening up; and preparations for  the Three Gorges project are well under way. Meanwhile, the  state has readjusted the setup of the automobile industry and  speeded up the 10-million-tonne transformation of the Wuhan Iron  and Steel Plant, thus providing us with more new opportunities.  In fact, Hubei has been pushed to the forefront of reform and  opening up in the central and western regions. The development  of the situation has set objective requirements for Hubei to  speed up its reform and construction and to play a greater role  in the country's overall economic setup. The whole province  should have a greater sense of historical responsibility and  mission as well as the sense of urgency in accelerating reform;  seize the present favorable opportunities; step up the intensity  of reform, opening up, development, and implementation; and  attain greater accomplishments in the new year. The  following is the general guiding ideology for our future  economic work: We should unswervingly follow the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics as well as the party's basic line,  conscientiously implement the spirits of the 14th party congress  and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  act in accordance with the requirements raised by the sixth  provincial party congress, seize the present favorable  opportunities, expand the scale of opening up, consolidate the  basic position of agriculture, bring into full play the pillar  role of large and medium-sized enterprises, pay close attention  to major economic growth points, do a good job in strengthening  such weak links as the light and textile industries, step up the  building of infrastructural facilities and basic industries,  promote scientific and technological progress and carry out  structural readjustment, strive to enhance the efficiency and  quality of the economy, and bring about a sustained, high-speed,  and healthy development to Hubei's national economy. The  overall goal of struggle is to "overfulfill plans, catch up with  other parts of China, mount a new step, and bring about new  breakthroughs to all industries and trades." In other  words, Hubei should overfulfill one year ahead of schedule all  tasks set out in the Eighth Five-Year Plan, strive to keep pace  with the country's average national economic growth rate, and  successfully mount its first new step in the nineties. The  following are some major targets for this year's national  economic development: GDP is expected to reach 118.4 billion  yuan, up by 9.5 percent, of which primary industry will gain an  increase of 5 percent; secondary industry, 12 percent, and  tertiary industry, 11 percent. The total industrial and  agricultural output value is forecast to be 241 billion yuan,  registering a 13.1-percent increase; and total financial revenue  to be 13.1 billion, up by 8.84 percent if calculated in terms of  comparable items. The income of workers and staff in  state-owned enterprises and the per capita net income of  peasants are expected to increase by 15 percent and 100 yuan  respectively. The total volume of retail sales will be  controlled at below the country's average level.    To fulfill or overfulfill this year's tasks of national  economic development, we must break with conventional practices,  work out new ideas and adopt new measures, and bring about new  breakthroughs. First of all, we need to have new ideas in  developing our economy. Fundamentally speaking, this means that  we should transform the economic operation from extensive  management to intensive management, and open up a development  road characterized by less input, more output, good quality,  high efficiency, and fast accumulation. Second, we need to make  new breakthroughs in policies. The most urgent task for the  time being is, in line with the usual practices of the market  economy, to promptly work out a number of concrete policies and  methods on enlivening the economy; and to give a free hand to  and encourage grass-roots units, enterprises, and the masses to  try their best to boost the economy. Third, new moves and  measures should be taken in our work. That is to say, we need  to accomplish a number of major tasks in order to bring along  the whole situation, and to base the high-speed economic  development on a solid foundation. The focus of this year's  economic work is to grasp one key issue, bring about five  large- scale breakthroughs, start three major motivation  projects, and alleviate four conspicuous contradictions.  This means that we should focus our efforts on state-owned large  and medium-sized enterprises; bring about breakthroughs in the  development of the diversified economy, township and town  enterprises, tertiary industry, the individual and private  economies, and the export-oriented economy; start as soon as  possible a number of major projects, including the 1-million  vehicle project, the 10-million-tonne steel transformation  project of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant, as well as auxiliary  projects serving the Three Gorges project; and ease the tight  supply of capital and remove bottleneck restrictions in the  fields of energy, transportation, and telecommunications.    In line with the above goals of struggle and development  plans, our economic work this year will be focused mainly on the  following issues:    1. With the aim of increasing the income of peasants,  we should stabilize the production of grain, cotton, and cooking  oil; bring about breakthroughs in the development of a  diversified economy and the development of township and town  enterprises; and enliven the rural economy in a comprehensive  way.    Since agriculture has the power to bring great order across  the land, we need to put agriculture in a primary position in  our economic work. This year's total grain and cotton outputs  are expected to reach 23.5 million and 500,000 tonnes  respectively. The total agricultural value is forecast to be  49.5 billion yuan, representing an increase of 6 percent. In  view of market demand, we will make vigorous efforts to boost  the production of fine-quality grain and cotton, as well as side  crops in high demand, such as soya beans and corn; and continue  to guide agriculture along the development road characterized by  high yields, fine quality, and high efficiency. Continued  efforts will be made to build a number of counties into major  production bases of commodity grain and cotton, as well as to  set up agricultural demonstration zones of "two highs and one  excellence"; to open up more "grain fields with a yield of one  tonne per mu," "cotton fields with a yield of 200 kg per mu,"  and "farm fields which can produce an output value of 1,000 yuan  per mu"; to vigorously spread the use of high-yielding and  highly efficient crop-raising patterns; and to enhance the  plantation efficiency of grain and cotton. We will  conscientiously implement the series of preferential policies  extended to agriculture by the party, protect the enthusiasm of  peasants in production, firmly establish the concept of fighting  natural disasters and striving for harvests, make careful  preparations for the prevention and control of all kinds of  natural disasters, and strive to reap an overall agricultural  harvest this year.    Breakthroughs should be made in the development of a  diversified economy, for it is a fundamental way for peasants to  increase their income, to get rich, and to lead a fairly  comfortable life. Efforts will be made to increase the output  value of diversifying operations to 31 billion yuan, accounting  for over 62 percent of the total agricultural output value; and  to increase the per capita net income of peasants from  diversification by more than 60 yuan. We will bring into full  play Hubei's advantages in mountain and water resources; focus  our efforts on cultivating pillar industries; and accelerate the  production of products in high demand in both the domestic and  overseas markets, including livestock and poultry, aquatic  products, tea, mulberries, Chinese medicinal herbs, and fruits.  Continued efforts will be made to tap the potential of the  aquatic industry and gain a newly increased output value of 1  billion yuan, which makes up 10 percent of the total  agricultural output value. It is necessary to expedite the  development of animal husbandry, forestry, fruits, and special  local products; and turn them into highly competitive sectors in  the shortest possible time. All localities should act in the  light of local conditions, increase input in agriculture, set up  production bases which can make use of local natural resources,  step up the processing industry in light of market demand,  develop a number of pillar industries and fist products, and  gradually achieve the goal of every township and village having  its own highly competitive industry or product. Mountain areas  are required to successfully put into effect the practice  whereby each person is responsible for one mu of cash forest.  We should take further steps to motivate the enthusiasm of all  rural households in developing a diversified economy, expand the  scale of the courtyard economy, enhance the development level,  and engage ourselves in running green enterprises.    It is imperative to make breakthroughs in the development of  township and town enterprises by reinforcing relevant measures.  This year's output value of township and town enterprises is  forecast to be 125 billion yuan, registering an increase of 37.7  percent. We should implement in a thoroughgoing way all  preferential policies which are designed to support the  development of township and town enterprises, continue to  increase input in such enterprises, raise funds through various  channels, and strive to input an additional amount of 4.5  billion yuan into township and town enterprises this year.  Vigorous efforts will be made to acquire the state's  special-purpose loans earmarked for the development of township  and town enterprises in central and western regions. We will  continue to implement the policy of providing support in terms  of working capital and loans at discount interest, and give a  stronger backing to those township and town enterprises which  enjoy "three highs" and which are engaged in earning foreign  exchange through exports and producing substitutes for imported  goods. Efforts will be accelerated to set up master files for  projects carried out by township and town enterprises, as well  as for highly competitive products; to attract more foreign  investment; and to enhance the grade and level of township and  town enterprises. It is necessary to continue deepening the  reform of township and town enterprises; vigorously develop  share-holding cooperative enterprises; facilitate the  integration of trade, industry, and agriculture; strengthen  enterprise management; and enhance the economic efficiency of  enterprises. This year, we plan to give form to a number of new  enterprises which enjoy an output value of 1 billion yuan,  organize a number of enterprise groups, build a number of small  industrial zones, and develop a number of leading enterprises in  agricultural and sideline production. Strides will be made in  closely integrating the development of township and town  enterprises with urban construction with a view to speeding up  the process of urbanization of rural areas.    It is imperative to pay simultaneous attention to the  practice of selecting the best qualified and to the work of  giving assistance to the poor, and to successfully fulfill the  "eight-seven" aid-the-poor campaign [a national campaign aimed  at giving great support to poor areas, especially old  revolutionary areas, areas inhabited by minority nationalities,  and remote border areas; helping them extricate themselves from  poverty and get rich; and providing 80 million people across the  country with sufficient food and clothing within the seven years  from the present to the year 2000]. We will conscientiously  carry out all preferential policies designed to support the  development of poor areas, continue doing a good job of the  project of "providing sufficient food and clothing," help poor  areas develop a diversified economy, and assist them in finding  more ways to get rich. Meanwhile, we will also encourage all  sectors of society to give unit-to-unit support to key areas,  thus accelerating the pace of poor areas extricating themselves  from poverty and getting rich.    2. A high-speed growth will be maintained in  industrial production on the basis of enhancing efficiency.    This year's provincial industrial output value is planned to  grow by 15 percent, with a production to sales rate of over 95  percent. To fulfill this arduous task, we must adopt powerful  and effective measures to ensure a high-speed industrial growth.    First, we should exert great efforts to run well state-owned  large and medium-sized enterprises. Because Hubei's stable  economic growth mainly relies on large and medium-sized  enterprises, we must regard the work of running well state-owned  large and medium-sized enterprises as the central issue of this  year's work: 1) Preferential measures will be adopted in  capital supply to satisfy the rational needs of large and  medium-sized enterprises in production and operation; 2) we will  step up the intensity of reform and enliven various kinds of  enterprises in different sectors. We are planning to revitalize  enterprises by transforming them into share-holding cooperative  enterprises and by shifting their production to tertiary  industry, or through introduction of foreign funds, organization  of enterprise groups, and leases and auctions; 3) with the aim  of lightening the burden of enterprises, all their irrational  burdens should be thoroughly screened. Efforts will be made to  absolutely reduce the irrational burdens of enterprises, thus  creating a sound external environment for enterprises.    Second, with a view to expanding the operational scale, we  will accelerate the building of the "giant project." To enable  key means of production to flow toward highly competitive  industries, enterprises, and products, we will mainly rely on  large and medium-sized enterprises, on joint property rights,  and on readjustment of product mix to integrate technological  transformation and development with enterprise reform;  accelerate the development of a large number of economically  strong major enterprises, companies, and groups; and greatly  enhance the level of Hubei's scale operation and improve its  competitiveness as a whole. This year, while continuing to  consolidate and improving existing enterprise groups, we will  step up our efforts to organize a number of large and  medium-sized enterprise groups which have output values  exceeding 500 million, 1 billion, and 1.5 billion yuan. We will  unremittingly carry out a product strategy, continue to do a  good job in the development of both 100 key products and 4,000  new products, and strive to push the fund rate of output value  of new products to 13 percent.    Third, we will intensify technological transformation, and  rejuvenate the light and textile industries. At present, with  relatively large stocks and a large number of employees, the  light and textile industries are generally plagued by outdated  equipment, backward technologies, products of inferior quality,  and poor competitiveness. In view of this situation, we must  regard the transformation of the light and textile industries as  a major issue in our efforts to save enterprises, stabilize  society, and bring into play Hubei's advantages in stocks.  Through updating and upgrading the light and textile  industries, we can successfully bring improvement to and enliven  industry. This year, we should put the focus of technological  transformation on motivation for the "plan to rejuvenate the  light and textile industries" and, based on highly competitive  products, select a number of state-owned enterprises to carry  out technological transformation with a high starting point.  The provincial authorities have decided to raise funds,  totaling 1 billion yuan, to set up a foundation for the  rejuvenation of the light and textile industries within this  year. All localities are also required to squeeze out more  technological transformation funds to step up the intensity of  transformation of the light and textile industries.    Fourth, we will pay close attention to newly started major  development projects with the aim of bringing about a sustained  growth in the industrial economy. For a certain period in the  future, we will focus our efforts on the following major  projects which can bring along the whole situation: We should  seize the favorable opportunity as the state is readjusting the  setup of and issuing policies on the automobile industry, and  rely on the Dongfeng Automobile Company to accelerate the  development of Hubei's automobile industry, striving to turn  Hubei within the coming decade into a major automobile-producing  province with an annual output of 1 million automobiles; based  on the "10-million-tonne" transformation project of the Wuhan  Iron and Steel Plant, we will promote joint operation and  cooperation among iron and steel plants within the province with  a view to building Hubei into a first-class major  steel-producing province; seizing opportunities provided by the  Three Gorges project, we plan to vigorously develop industries  as well as products related to the project, and bring about  greater development to a number of related industries, including  metallurgy, machinery, and building materials.    Fifth, it is imperative to reinforce the management and  enhance the economic efficiency of enterprises. Based on the  implementation of the "Law on Product Quality," we will  reinforce the basic management of enterprises in a comprehensive  way. Activities aimed at "transforming the mechanism, paying  attention to management, improving internal training, and  enhancing efficiency" will be launched in all industrial  enterprises, with a view to enabling enterprises to concentrate  their attention on their own operation and development; to  improving their economic results; to attaching equal importance  to strengthening management and to making up deficits and  increasing profits; and to striving to reduce the number of  loss-making enterprises and the total amount of losses by 10 and  15 percent respectively within this year.    3. Efforts will be made to step up the intensity of  investment, optimize the investment pattern, and pay close  attention to key construction.    This year, Hubei's society-wide fixed-asset investment will  be 45 billion yuan, an increase of 29 percent; while the  investment rate will stand at 30 percent. To optimize the  structure of fixed-asset investment, we will increase input into  technological transformation; use a small increment to  revitalize a huge stock; and strive, through several years of  hard work, to bring about a fundamental change to the  technological quality of Hubei's traditional pillar industries,  such as the light and textile industries as well as the  engineering industry. The focus of basic construction is to  continue reinforcing the building of basic industries and  facilities, including agriculture, energy, transportation, and  telecommunications; give full support to the Three Gorges  project and do a good job in the resettlement of residents in  the dam area; pay close attention to the implementation of 21  major system projects; and strive to start 54 and complete or  initially complete 19 projects within this year. To step up the  intensity of investment, we must try to raise funds through  various channels. We should seize the present opportunity as  the state is reforming its investment and fund-raising  structure; help large and medium-sized projects prepare for  state investment which the state earlier promised to inject; and  make first-phase preparations for construction projects which  plan to acquire state investment. We will try to introduce more  direct foreign funds for such large-scale projects as the Second  Phase of the Hanchuan Power Plant, the Huanglongshi Airport, the  Yihuang Highway, the Fufa Glassware Plant, and the 400,000-tonne  wax-splitting project; try hard to issue 1.3 billion yuan worth  of securities in Hubei, a task assigned by the state; and  earnestly work out measures to ensure the auxiliary supply of  local funds for key projects.    4. Breakthroughs need to be made in the development  of tertiary industry, thus giving shape to a new setup of  industrial growth.    The stagnant development of Hubei's tertiary industry is a  major factor restricting the economic development of the  province; on the other hand, it is also a field in which we can  tap potentials to accelerate economic development. Therefore, we  must adopt effective measures, and strive to bring about  breakthroughs in the development of tertiary industry. We  should focus our efforts on the development of industries and  trades which need less investment, enjoy faster returns and  better efficiency, have a capacity for absorbing more labor  power, and are closely linked with economic development and the  livelihood of the people. Moreover, we will also speed up the  development of such industries as commercial services, monetary  information, communications and telecommunications, real estate,  and tourism. Further steps will be taken to make more flexible  use of policies. The examination and approval system will be  turned into a registration system, and all social sectors will  be urged to make greater investment in and run tertiary  industries in various ways. Meanwhile, we should encourage  governmental workers as well as surplus staff of enterprises,  who are the subject of reductions during structural  readjustments, to engage themselves in tertiary industries;  encourage enterprises of tertiary industries to merge with  industrial enterprises which are closing down; support  industrial enterprises in running tertiary industries;  accelerate the development of the first batch of tertiary  industrial groups; further relax control over tertiary industry  prices, grant more loans to tertiary industries, and extend  preferential policies to newly established tertiary industries.    Breakthroughs need to be made in the development of the  individual and private economies, for they constitute a major  force for the development of tertiary industry. We will  conscientiously carry out the decision of the provincial party  and government on accelerating the development of the individual  and private economies, and take more steps to mobilize the  enthusiasm of all sides in bringing about further development.  This year, we will strive to reach the development goal of  "taking three big strides in three years" one year ahead of  schedule, pushing the total sales volume of the individual and  private economies to 30 billion yuan and the total number of  persons engaged to 2 million.    5. Efforts will be focused on key issues so as to  speed up the pace of market building.    To develop a socialist market economy, we need to have a  perfect market system and smooth circulation channels. We  should act in accordance with the requirements for the building  of general markets and circulation; continue to set up and  perfect more marketing and circulation networks; and focus our  efforts on building, in major agricultural production zones as  well as in large and medium-sized cities, a number of markets  for bulk agricultural products and wholesale markets for means  of production which enjoy effective functions and have an  influence on the entire country. We will try to set up grain  and cotton futures trading markets in Wuhan; a number of  large-scale trading markets for means of production, mainly  steel sheets, automobiles, and cement, in places like Wuhan,  Huangshi, Ezhou, Shiyan, and Xiangfan; and a number of border  trade markets in border townships and towns including Jinzhou,  Enshi, Yunyang, Xiangfan, Huanggang, and Xianning.    It is imperative to accelerate the cultivation of the  monetary market, and gradually build Hubei into a regional  monetary center. While continuing to expand the operational  scale of banks and to open more banking credit businesses, we  will expedite the development of trusted investment companies,  professional insurance companies, and urban and rural  cooperative banks; try to persuade three newly organized state  policy banks to set up representative offices in Hubei; try to  organize and build Hubei's own regional development bank; expand  international monetary business and try to have more overseas  and foreign monetary institutions set up monetary organs in  cities such as Wuhan; expand the trading scale of all kinds of  securities, and support large enterprises, including the Dongqi  Company, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant, and the Geheyan Power  Station, in listing in stock exchanges to raise funds in huge  amounts; and try to have the state set up a securities exchange  in Wuhan as soon as possible so that Hubei can become a  securities exchange center and a "pool" for capital in the  central and western regions.    Vigorous efforts will be made to develop the labor,  personnel, and technology markets with a view to rationalizing  the circulation and optimizing the allocation of means of  production. We will allow non-labor departments to set up labor  markets, accelerate the establishment of a number of  standardized and perfect employment service centers and  agencies, and open up step by step a number of windows for the  labor market in coastal areas, border areas, and areas outside  China. It is important to expedite the cultivation of the  technology and personnel markets. We will encourage all major  technology development bodies to enter the market in various  forms, build up unified and open technology information systems  and propagation networks across the province, and set up markets  for technology, patents, and personnel in a number of cities,  including Wuhan.    6. It is important to implement the strategy of  "rejuvenating Hubei through the application of science and  education," and enhance the overall quality of both the national  economy and laborers.    Conscientious efforts will be made to carry out the "Law on  Scientific and Technological Progress" with a view to closely  integrating science and technology with the economy. On the  basis of continuing to strengthen basic research and develop  high and new technologies, we will focus on spreading the use of  applied research as well as scientific and technological  results, and on accelerating the process of turning scientific  and technological results into real productive power. We will  continue to bring up leading figures in rural areas who can  guide peasants to get rich through the application of science  and technology. Efforts will be made to center scientific  research and development around pillar industries and industrial  products, and to expand channels for integrating science and  technology with economic development by using methods of the  market economy. In line with the principle of "stabilizing one  field while a giving free hand to others," we will further relax  control over the work of scientific research institutions and  personnel, so that more scientific and technological forces can  be directed toward the main battlefield of economic development.  A technological progress mechanism combining market, scientific  research, and production will be gradually set up in enterprises  with a view to turning enterprises into main bodies of  scientific and technological development.    To enhance the quality of laborers, the most essential  factor  is education. We will carry out in depth the "Outline on the  Reform and Development of China's Education," put education in a  strategic position and give priority to its development,  increase input, deepen reform, and vigorously promote the cause  of education. It is imperative to continuously readjust and  optimize the structure of education, conscientiously implement  the "Law on Compulsory Education," reinforce elementary  education, vigorously promote vocational and adult education,  steadily develop higher education, and try hard to improve  school-running conditions. It is important to conscientiously  carry out the "Law on Teachers," earnestly protect the  legitimate interests and rights of teachers, and reinforce the  building of the contingent of teachers. We will also grant  greater autonomy to schools in handling school-running affairs,  develop school-run industries, and encourage and support all  social sectors in making donations to schools and in running  nongovernmental teaching institutions.    Intellectuals are playing a specially important role in the  modernization drive. We should have full confidence in the vast  numbers of intellectuals politically, give them a free hand in  their work, take good care of their lives, cultivate in the  entire society a sound social practice of respecting knowledge  and qualified personnel, and create a favorable social  environment for intellectuals to display intelligence and wisdom  in work. Handsome rewards should be given to intellectuals who  have made outstanding contributions. We sincerely welcome  people who have studied abroad to take part in Hubei's  construction in various ways, assuring them of preferential  treatment and allowing them to come and go freely.    The final goal of economic development is to constantly  improve the material and cultural lives of the masses of people.  This year, thanks to the salary reform, workers and staff of  administrative organs have seen increases in their income, while  the income of those working in enterprises will also increase  with the development of production. Moreover, the income of  peasants has also increased as a result of the growing rural  economy and increases in the purchase prices of agricultural  products. While trying to increase incomes, we will continue to  improve the living standards of urban and rural residents, pay  attention to the "shopping basket" project and the construction  of urban facilities, accelerate the development of public  health, improve the prevention and treatment of local diseases  such as snail fever and Keding disease, vigorously promote  cultural undertakings, and bring about a fairly great  improvement to the quality of people's lives. What merits  special notice is the relatively difficult situation of the  masses who live in poor areas as well as workers working in  enterprises which are plagued by poor economic results and which  have suspended production entirely or partially. Governments at  all levels should adopt positive measures to help them solve  difficulties.    Family planning, land management, and environmental  protection are China's basic national policies. We must  conscientiously implement these policies and try to achieve  outstanding results in the work. The birth rate in our province  has exceeded the country's average level in recent years;  therefore, we must adopt effective measures to put an end to  this situation. Results in population control will constitute  an important part of the appraisal of the work results of party  and government leaders at all levels. It is imperative to  strictly implement laws, rules, and regulations on family  planning, to focus the family planning work on rural and urban  floating populations, and to firmly control the birth rate  within the scope specified by the state. We will value land  highly, strictly control land earmarked for basic construction,  put into practice the system for the basic protection of  farmland, build up a farmland compensation mechanism, and  enhance the utilization rate of land. We will unswervingly  fulfill the strategic task of "afforesting Hubei within 10  years," and basically open up all uncultivated mountains this  year. Continued efforts will be made to protect all kinds of  natural resources, prevent industrial pollution, and bring about  a well-coordinated development to environmental protection and  the economy.    III. Speed Up the Pace of Reform and Carefully Carry  Out Reform in All Fields    This year is a crucial one for making key breakthroughs in  reform and pushing forward reform as a whole. The state has  promulgated reform measures one after another on the management  structures of finance and taxation, the monetary industry,  investment, planning, and foreign trade, as well as on the  establishment of a modern enterprise system. Successful  implementation of all these reforms are of vital importance to  the establishment of the framework of a socialist market  economy. Governments at all levels should earnestly strengthen  leadership over reform, carefully organize reform in different  fields, and ensure that all reform measures put forward by the  central authorities can be smoothly carried out in Hubei.    1. Efforts will be made to actively and steadily push  forward the structural reform of macrolevel management.    First, the fiscal and taxation reform. This reform consists  of three parts, namely, reform of the taxation system, the  system whereby tax revenues are shared by central and local  authorities, and the system of enterprise profit distribution.  Reform in the above three fields is the most difficult and most  important part of the entire reform, for it has a great bearing  on the setup of interest distribution. Therefore, in order to  succeed in all these reforms, we need to make careful plans.  The general principle of the structural reform of tax division  designed for all prefectures, cities, and autonomous prefectures  by the provincial authorities is: Rationally divide revenues and  expenditures in accordance with the principle and goal set by  the central authorities concerning the local system of tax  division and in line with the principle of seeking unity between  administrative and financial powers; pay persistent attention to  both overall design and phased implementation; successfully  dovetail new structures with old ones; and gradually put the new  into effect. After the system of tax division is adopted, the  original financial structure will remain functional in  principle, with a view to safeguarding the immediate interests  of all localities. While doing a good job in the reform of the  financial and taxation structure, we need to pay close attention  to this year's financial work, ease contradictions between  revenue and expenditure, and create conditions for a smooth  implementation of other reforms. We will conscientiously carry  out the new taxation system, strengthen the collection and  management of taxes, and submit tax revenues to the state  treasury in strict accordance with the stipulations of the tax  division system. We should adhere to the principle of  restraining all financial expenditures, and strictly observe  restrictions set out in the budget. Financial departments at  all levels should be responsible for balanced revenue and  expenditure and none is allowed to go into the red.    Second, reform of the financial structure. The main tasks of  financial reform are: Further transform the functions of the  People's Bank; pay close attention to the establishment of  policy banks, and transform existing specialized banks according  to the general principles of commercial banks; actively and  steadily develop the system of cooperative banks; make  preparations for the open market operations of state treasury  bonds and foreign exchanges; do a better job in running existing  capital, securities, and foreign exchange swap markets; and  conscientiously accomplish all work relating to the adoption of  unified exchange rates. The tight supply of capital still  remains a conspicuous contradiction in Hubei's economic  development this year. Therefore, we must adopt effective  measures to ease the situation. While continuously doing a good  job in attracting savings deposits of all kinds, we will try  hard to expand bond and insurance business, run well the money-  lending market, expand sources of capital, and pool more funds  for economic development. Further efforts will be made to make  flexible use of capital in stock, accelerate the circulation of  funds, and enhance the utilization efficiency of funds. It is  necessary to continue to readjust and optimize the credit  structure; try to satisfy rational demands for the purchase of  agricultural and sideline products as well as the production and  operation of state and provincial key construction projects,  foreign trade operations, and trades and enterprises which enjoy  sound economic efficiency; and ensure the normal operation of  the national economy.    Third, reform of the investment structure. The focus of this  year's reform is: Grant greater decisionmaking power on  investment projects, and gradually build up risk  responsibilities for legal person investments and bank loans.  Enterprises are granted autonomy in making decisions concerning  competitive project investments, and are responsible for all  potential risks. Banks have the decisionmaking power on  granting loans and are responsible for their own profits and  losses. By using economic methods, we will improve control and  regulation over the overall scale and the structure of  investment; perfect the fund management of welfare investment  and set up a provincial-level welfare investment contract  system; expand the fund-raising channels as well as the  operational scope of provincial-level investment companies, and  increase their financial strength in operation; and improve the  government's financial investment methods, and turn  nonreimburasable investment into compensatory share-holding  investment.    Fourth, reform of commodity prices. This year, the state  is to appropriately readjust the prices of energy, grain, and  cotton. With the addition of the impact produced by last year's  price rises, it is an arduous task to keep price rises under  control. Governments at all levels should earnestly strengthen  leadership over price control, carefully organize the  implementation of reform measures, and strive to bring price  rises below the country's average level. To alleviate pressure  produced by price rises, we should, on the one hand, try hard to  increase effective social supply, especially the supply of  agricultural and sideline products; on the other hand, adapt  ourselves to the new situation resulting from changes in the  mechanism of price formation, set up a reserves system for a  number of consumer goods which are closely related to the basic  needs of the masses, such as grain, pork, eggs, and sugar, as  well as key means of agricultural production; and use economic  means to make timely readjustments to market prices.    2. Focus will be placed on the establishment of a  modern enterprise system, and enterprise reform will be deepened  in a comprehensive way.    Establishing a modern economic system is the goal of  enterprise reform and a fundamental method for revitalizing  state-owned enterprises. We should seize the present favorable  opportunities in reform; continue implementing the "Enterprise  Law" and "Regulations on Changing the Operational Mechanism of  State-Owned Enterprises"; do a good job in three internal  reforms on the labor, personnel, and distribution of  enterprises; have the courage to explore effective ways to  establish a modern enterprise system, and provide the high-  speed economic growth with a strong motive force. The  provincial authorities plan to carry out experiments with the  modern enterprise system in 50 selected large and medium-sized  industrial and commercial enterprises, including the Wuhan Iron  and Steel Plant, the Dongqi Company, the Jinmen 400,000-tonne  wax-splitting project, the Qingjiang Development Company, and  the Houwang Group; and allow about 10 qualified enterprises to  list on stock exchanges or to issue stocks outside China. These  influential enterprise experiments will surely bring along the  development of related enterprises. We will continue to  transform enterprises into share-holding cooperative  enterprises, and try to push the number of share-holding  enterprises to 1,000 this year, thus laying the foundation for  the adoption of the modern enterprise system in state-owned  enterprises. It is imperative to vigorously push forward the  structural reform of property rights, pay close attention to  appraising properties and funds as well as defining property  rights, settle claims and clear up debts, accelerate the  establishment of the property rights exchange market, trade-in  idle assets of state-owned enterprises and auction off  enterprises, and standardize trading behavior. The provincial  authorities will set up a supervisory committee on state-owned  assets, and experiment with the practice in 40 assigned pillar  enterprises with a view to reinforcing supervision over  state-owned assets.    3. Vigorous efforts need to be made to push forward  reforms in the social guarantee and housing systems.    The focus of reform in the social guarantee system is to  further expand the coverage of pension and medical insurance.  The pension and medical insurance of urban workers and staff  should be jointly borne by units and individuals, combining  overall social arrangements with individual accounts; while in  rural areas where conditions allow, a pension and insurance  system based on individual savings accumulations will be carried  out on the basis of the peasants' own will. It is imperative to  develop and perfect the rural cooperative medical care system;  expand the coverage of job-awaiting insurance; gradually set up  a unified job-awaiting insurance system covering workers and  staff of state-owned, collective, and private enterprises, as  well as Chinese staff in foreign-invested enterprises; improve  management services over the social insurance of retired and  job-awaiting personnel of enterprises; and gradually reach the  goal that enterprises are engaged in providing social welfare.    It is important to conscientiously implement the "Decision  of  the State Council on Accelerating Reform of the Urban Housing  System," and speed up the pace of urban housing reform. We will  adhere to the principle of "paying simultaneous attention to the  sale, lease, and construction of residential houses"; and focus  our efforts on the sales of houses, mainly public ones, in an  active and steady way. We will step up efforts in fulfilling  Hubei's housing program as part of its efforts to attain a  fairly comfortable life, expedite the construction of urban  residential houses, alleviate the tight supply of residential  houses in urban areas, and put into practice a housing provident  fund system in a comprehensive way. Housing reform is expected  to be unfolded in all counties (cities) across the province this  year.    4. Efforts will be made to speed up the pace of  institutional reform.    We should speed up the pace of institutional reform in order  to suit the needs of the economic structural reform. In line  with the general arrangements of the State Council, the  provincial authorities have put forward the general guiding  ideology and requirements for Hubei's institutional reform: In  line with the principle of separating the functions of the  government from those of an enterprise as well as the principle  of simplification, uniformity, and high efficiency, we will  focus our attention on changing the functions of the government,  strengthen the work of comprehensive departments, abolish or  merge certain specialized economic departments or organs with  overlapping functions and duties, cut down the staff and  structural levels of administrative organs, and turn them into  highly capable and highly efficient organs. In line with this  requirement, all administrative organs across the province are  expected to start the institutional reform this year and ensure  that the work can be totally accomplished next year.    IV. Step Up the Intensity of Opening Up, and  Increase the Proportion of the Export-Oriented Economy in the  Entire National Economy    The goal of struggle for Hubei this year is to realize "two  surpasses" and "four breakthroughs"; in other words, we plan to  overfulfill the task for foreign exports set out in the Eighth  Five- Year Plan one year ahead of schedule; attain a growth rate  that is higher than the country's average; earn a total of $2  billion of foreign exchange from exports, registering an  increase of 18.6 percent; set up 1,500 new foreign-invested  enterprises, pushing the total number to 5,500; utilize $1  billion of foreign investment; and attain a total output value  and sales revenue of over 4 billion yuan in foreign-invested  enterprises. To realize the above goals, we should pay special  attention to work in the following fields:    First, we should strengthen the building of export-oriented  industries and their production bases, and further arouse the  enthusiasm of all sides in developing an export-oriented  economy. 1) We are determined to develop in the coming several  years three to five major fist products which can bring about a  total export volume of over 100 million yuan, thus upgrading and  increasing the batch production of exported products. The  provincial authorities will set up a special fund for  technological renovation to give key support to the development  of export-oriented industries. 2) Relying on pillar export  enterprises, we will break barriers between regions and trades;  organize and set up a number of large-scale industry-trade,  agriculture-trade, and technology-trade enterprise groups which  are economically strong and are under intensive management;  grant them autonomy in handling foreign-related operations; and  push them directly into international markets. 3) We will  strive to persuade the state Import-Export Credit Bank to set up  a representative office in Hubei, try our best to establish  financial companies specialized in import and export businesses,  and provide powerful financial support for the development of  the export-oriented economy. 4) It is necessary to give full  play to the enthusiasm of "five contingents," vigorously open up  diversified international markets, inject greater vigor into  exports, and give shape to a setup of large-scale foreign trade  and opening up. 5) Further efforts will be made to run well  exchange-earning foreign-invested enterprises, support  state-owned and collective enterprises in developing  exchange-earning products, try hard to enable township and town  enterprises to open wider to the outside world, develop an  exchange-earning agriculture, and give shape to a number of new  exchange-earning contingents. 6) Strides will be made in  further expanding economic and technological cooperation with  foreign countries, thus bringing along Hubei's export of  complete sets of equipment, technology, and related products.  7) It is necessary to continue opening Wuhan and Huangshi Port  to foreign vessels; open ports in Yichang, Shashi, and Xiangfan  as soon as possible; and provide better services for the  development of the export-oriented economy.    Second, we will intensify the utilization of foreign  investment; and make better and greater use of foreign  resources, technologies, and markets. We will bring into full  play the leading role of Wuhan as well as the favorable  conditions of open cities including Wuhan, Huangshi, and  Yichang; make good, flexible, and sufficient use of preferential  policies specially designed for open cities; attract more  foreign businessmen to invest in our province; and bring along  the exploration and development of the Chang Jiang economic  belt. We will adapt ourselves to new situations resulting from  the taxation reform; and, based on the total capital investment  laid down in previously promulgated policies, step up efforts to  amend, perfect, and reiterate preferential policies which aim to  encourage foreign businessmen to invest in Hubei, thus setting  their minds at ease. It is necessary to introduce more foreign  investment for development zones of all kinds at different  levels, attract foreign businessmen to make concentrated  investment in large-scale development projects, establish small  development zones with various features, and develop a number of  large-scale, highly efficient, high-tech projects which can  produce foreign exchange in large amounts. Further efforts will  be made to expand the cooperative fields in which foreign  investment is utilized, guide foreign businessmen to participate  in the construction of infrastructural facilities and basic  industries, and engage ourselves in a number of large-scale  projects. We will select a number of our best enterprises and  best products to set up joint ventures with foreign investors,  and speed up the pace of utilizing foreign funds to transform  and "graft" state-owned enterprises. Vigorous efforts will be  made to consolidate already attained results in opening up, pay  close attention to the implementation of projects which use  loans of foreign governments, and do a good job in the follow-up  of contracts which were signed at the economic and trade talks  held in Hong Kong last year. Earnest efforts will be made to  run well existing foreign-invested enterprises, appropriately  solve problems cropping up during the development of  foreign-invested enterprises, and make a success of every  foreign-invested enterprise we have set up. It is necessary to  further consolidate cooperation with Hong Kong, Macao, and  Taiwan; vigorously open markets in Europe, the United States,  and Japan; and expand the scope of introduction of foreign  investment. This year, the provincial authorities are planning  to again hold large-scale economic and trade talks in France  with a view to promoting Hubei's cooperation with West European  countries. It is imperative to strengthen the building of open  windows; set up more open windows in foreign countries, areas  outside the Chinese mainland, and China's coastal areas; and  expand the development channels of the export-oriented economy.  We will give full play to the role of foreign-related  departments, such as foreign affairs offices, overseas Chinese  affairs offices, tourist agencies, and foreign-related  propaganda departments, with the aim of giving form to a unified  force for the development of the export-oriented economy. We  will step up efforts in formulating remuneration policies which  are aimed at encouraging the development of the export-oriented  economy; and give encouragement and rewards politically and  economically to individuals who have made contributions in  introducing foreign investment, to units which can earn large  amounts of foreign exchange through exports, and to foreign  trade companies and localities which have attained outstanding  results in exports. We will set up authoritative leading groups  for the work in different fields, headed by vice governors in  charge and attended by principal leaders of all relevant  departments; establish work organs to strengthen the  coordination and management of foreign-related economic and  trade work; simplify the examination and approval procedures on  foreign investment projects by adopting the practice of "one  joint office using only one chop"; and provide the development  of the export- oriented economy with a powerful organizational  guarantee.  <H5>  V. Simultaneous Attention Should Be Paid to Two Types of </H5> Work With a View To Further Strengthening the Building of  Socialist Spiritual Civilization, Democracy, and the Legal System    Strengthening the building of spiritual civilization,  democracy, and the legal system is an essential requirement for  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. During the  process of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, we  must consistently uphold the principle of "paying simultaneous  attention to two types of work, attaching equal importance to  both," and strive to enhance the building of spiritual  civilization, democracy, and the legal system to a new level.    Vigorous efforts will be made to promote the building of  spiritual civilization. An important task in the building of  spiritual civilization is to arm the people with scientific  theories, guide them with correct publicity, mold them with a  noble spirit, encourage them with fine works of literature and  art, and bring up generations of well-educated and  well-disciplined socialist new people who have high ideals and  high moral standards. To attain this goal, we need to  strengthen ideological and ethical education on patriotism,  collectivism, and socialism; vigorously advocate social and  professional ethics; and continue to carry out in-depth  activities including establishing and advocating new practices  in industries and trades, emulating Lei Feng at work posts, and  becoming advanced units and outstanding households in building  two civilizations. It is imperative to further strengthen  ideological and political work; guide the people, especially the  young people and children, to establish the correct ideals,  beliefs, outlook on life and values; advocate a healthy and  civilized lifestyle; and try hard to establish a sound general  mood in society. Cultural workers should uphold the principle  of "two serves" and the principle of "letting a hundred flowers  blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend," vigorously  promote the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation,  actively use for reference civilization results of foreign  countries, create more fine works which have both a rich flavor  of our times and special features of Hubei, and enrich and  enliven the cultural life of the masses. To promote sports, we  should bring about a coordinated development between athletic  and mass sports, and strive to enhance the physical fitness of  the people of Hubei through sports. The press and publishing  and radio and television departments should uphold the principle  of unity, stability, and encouragement; engage mainly in  positive propaganda; strengthen propagation and coverage of  reform and construction, and provide the people with a correct  guide to opinion. Centering around the establishment of a  socialist economic structure, we will strengthen social  scientific research, and provide a smooth progress of reform  with a theoretical guarantee. To promote spiritual  civilization, we should concentrate our efforts on the building  of it. We will conscientiously implement cultural and economic  policies; strengthen the building of cultural, sports, radio and  television, publishing, and audiovisual facilities; and pay  special attention to the construction of a diving pool and a  satellite up- link station.    Earnest efforts will be made to strengthen the building of  socialist democracy and the legal system. Governments at all  levels should conscientiously carry out resolutions adopted by  the people's congresses and their standing committees at the  same level, voluntarily subject themselves to supervision, give  full play to the role of the people's consultative conferences  in providing political consultation and democratic supervision,  and give rein to the bridging functions of a number of mass  organizations, such as trade unions, youth leagues, and women's  federations. Efforts should be made to open up more channels  for the people to express their views and opinions, give play to  the roles of experts and policymaking consultative organs of all  kinds, and make policy decisions in a democratic and scientific  way. Further efforts will be made to strengthen the building of  the legal system; formulate and perfect administrative rules and  regulations which aim to protect reform and opening up,  strengthen macroeconomic control and regulation, and standardize  microeconomic behavior; and work out laws and regulations for  major economic activities to follow. It is important to further  perfect the administrative system of law enforcement and  supervision; carry out official duties according to the law, and  firmly put an end to failure to act according to the law,  failure to strictly enforce the law, and failure to affix  responsibility to violators of the law.    Great efforts need to be made to improve all facets of  public security, strictly combat all kinds of criminal  activities and economic crimes according to law, and continue to  carry out the campaign of "eliminating pornographic activities"  and "stamping out six evils." Efforts will be made to launch  concentrated campaigns and special-purpose struggles on  different scales to crack down on crimes and social evils that  the masses particularly resent. We will continue to uphold the  principle of "paying simultaneous attention to cracking down on  and preventing crimes, taking both stopgap and radical measures,  and putting stress on effecting a permanent cure," strictly  implement a responsibility system among leading cares for the  comprehensive improvement of public security, mobilize the  masses to effect prevention and solving of crimes, carry through  to the grass-roots level all measures for improving public  security, and create a sound social environment for the masses  of people in which they can live and work in peace and  contentment. Meanwhile, to safeguard the stability of society,  we should attach great importance to mediating and handling  contradictions among the people, and settle problems before they  get out of hand.    Strides will be made to conduct extensive education on the  importance of national defense, increase public awareness of the  need for it, and make a success of the work with regard to the  militia and the reserve service. Continued efforts will be made  to strengthen the building of the Armed Police and public  security contingents. It is important that the Army supports  and cherishes the people while the government supports the Army  and gives preferential treatment to families of servicemen and  martyrs, with a view to consolidating unity between the Army and  the government and between the Army and the people. We should  consistently show concern for and support the building of our  Army. Efforts will be made to bring into full play the  important roles of the People's Liberation Army, the Armed  Police, the public security forces, and the vast numbers of  militiamen in maintaining social stability and promoting the  modernization drive.    It is the common responsibility of the people of the whole  province to consolidate and strengthen unity between  nationalities. We should carry out nationality policies in a  comprehensive way, uphold and perfect the regional autonomy of  minority nationalities, grant more support to areas inhabited by  minority nationalities, and bring about a common prosperity  among all nationalities.  <H5>  VI. Further Emancipate the Mind, Improve the Work Style, </H5> Pay Close Attention to Implementation, and Ensure Comprehensive  Fulfillment of This Year's Tasks of National Economic and Social  Development    This year, we are faced with arduous tasks and work in  reform. To ensure a comprehensive fulfillment of all tasks, we  must further emancipate the mind, forge ahead and open up new  paths, improve our work style, and make a success of the work in  all fields of endeavor in a creative way.    Ideology leads to action. Without emancipation of the mind,  there will not be any new ideas, new moves, or new  breakthroughs. Under the present new situation in particular, in  which the economy is being accelerated and reform is being  deepened comprehensively, there is a greater need for freeing  the mind. First, we should conscientiously study the "Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping," arm leading cadres at all levels with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, and seek unity of understanding and  action in the entire province. Through the practice of "study,  practice, restudy, and more practice," we can master the spirit  and essence of the theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, constantly acquire more knowledge about the  market economy, enhance our ability to keep a rein on the whole  situation, and improve the standards and work efficiency of the  leadership. Second, we need to firmly establish the concept of  centering around economic construction, and enhance public  awareness of the need for development. It is necessary to urge  all localities and departments to earnestly proceed in their  work with the grand goal of catching up with and surpassing the  country's average level and bringing about greater economic  development; and to encourage them to translate the goal into  their practical work by working out new ideas, arrangements, and  measures, with a view to combining the efforts of all sectors of  our province to accelerate economic development. Third, we  should further increase public awareness of the need for reform  and opening up as well as the spirit of having the initiative to  open new paths; earnestly act in line with the principle of  "three beneficials" raised by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and use it  as a standard to check and guide our ideology and actions; break  through old conventions and barriers; create a more relaxed  environment for grass-roots units and the masses to carry out  reform and development; and encourage and guide the masses to  have the courage to open up new paths, to experiment with new  ideas, and to do what our ancestors never did. Meanwhile, we  also need to be good at protecting the enthusiasm of grass-roots  units and the masses in reform and opening up, and respect the  spirit of initiative of the masses.    To fulfill all development goals set for this year, it is  vitally important to earnestly improve our work style and bring  about real improvement to our work in a down-to-earth manner.  We will continue to conduct and perfect all good practices  carried out last year, namely "the year of implementation"; and  turn them into a common practice and common system with a view  to achieving more practical results in our work. To accomplish  all major tasks in this year's reform and construction, the  provincial government has worked out a concrete work schedule,  and the governor and vice governors are to take charge of and be  personally responsible for work in different fields. All  localities and relevant departments are required to work in  close coordination, assign leading cadres to take personal  charge of specific tasks with feasible measures, check out their  work results at the end of every year, and not stop until our  goal is reached. We will reward those who have successfully  accomplished their tasks, and punish those who fail. Facing all  these arduous tasks, complicated situations, and numerous  difficulties in this year's reform and construction, leaders  must go down and carry out their work at the grass-roots in  order to make a success of it. Leaders at all levels should  take the lead to improve their work style, extricate themselves  from numerous meetings and piles of documents, reduce  unnecessary social entertainment, concentrate their attention on  handling major issues and solving practical problems, take the  initiative to go down and carry out official business in  grass-roots units and among the masses, energetically encourage  the practice of conducting investigations and studies, watch out  for and promptly discover symptoms of unhealthy tendencies, make  policy decisions in a decisive manner, and gain the initiative  over the whole situation.    It is necessary to change the functions of the government in  line with the institutional reform, simplify procedures for  handling affairs, and enhance work efficiency. It is imperative  to further straighten out administrative discipline and improve  the work style of the government, put an absolute end to  violations of previously issued orders and bans, and ensure the  smooth implementation of government decrees.    A deepened reform and opening up needs greater efforts to  combat corruption and advocate clean administration. The  provincial party committee has named this year "the year of  building clean administration," in which new clean and honest  practices are expected to be introduced. All government  workers, especially cadres at the county (department) level and  above, should be clean and well-disciplined, and act strictly in  accordance with all stipulations on maintaining clean  government. We should strengthen auditing work, give play to  supervisory functions, continue to investigate and crack serious  cases, and make public a number of typical cases so as to show  our people the determination of the party and the government and  gain their confidence. Continued efforts will be made to  absolutely put an end to unhealthy trends, such as arbitrarily  raising funds and collecting fees, traveling overseas at the  expense of the state, and purchasing luxury limousines and  building luxury houses against relevant regulations. Organs  directly affiliated to the provincial authorities should play an  exemplary role in the campaign of combating corruption and  advocating clean administration. Principal provincial leaders  and cadres in charge of organs directly under the provincial  authorities should take the lead in accomplishing whatever they  demand that their subordinates accomplish. The anticorruption  campaign is a long-term struggle, and leading cadres at all  levels must have the courage to take personal charge of this  struggle, pay consistent attention to it, and carry out the  struggle in a down-to-earth manner. We are determined to  achieve real results and make substantive headway in this  struggle this year.    Fellow Deputies,    Now is an excellent time for our province to catch up with  and surpass the country's average development level. Our  national economy has joined the "express line" of development,  and we are faced with many major opportunities to expedite  economic development. The constant deepening of reform and  opening up, in particular, will surely inject greater vigor and  life into future economic development. It is totally possible,  as well as justified, that we should and can attain major  breakthroughs in development, and we are fully confident of  realizing this goal. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and under the leadership of the provincial party  committee, let us closely rally around the party Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, emancipate our  minds, work with one heart and one mind, forge ahead to open up  new paths, carry out our work in real earnest, and strive to  achieve this year's grand goal of "overfulfilling the plan,  catching up with other parts of the country, mounting a new  step, and attaining new breakthroughs in all industries and  trades"!</p>

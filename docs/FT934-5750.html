			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Permanent interest-bearing shares Prices of Pibs have not changed greatly since the FT last published the table on October 23, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Simon Mozley, of Hoare Govett, attributes the market's relative lack of activity to investors awaiting the Budget. Pibs are fixed interest-paying instruments issued by building societies and income usually is paid twice a year. They offer higher yields than gilts because of their higher risk: societies are less secure than the government. Gains from Pibs are exempt from capital gains tax unless they are bought in a fund. Mozley believes this week's base rate cut will have a beneficial effect on Pibs: 'The prospects for greater profitability by societies was enhanced by the recent cut in interest rates. Not only should this provide an incentive to the housing market but it will also allow societies to manage their interest margins to a greater extent. This should be good news for Pibs investors as performances improve.' On balance, the higher the Pibs' yield, the riskier the society is deemed to be by the market. Thus, both Halifax building society issues have the lowest yield in the table. But since these are in denominations of Pounds 50,000, few private investors are likely to be attracted to them. Mozley believes that 'both First National and Bristol &amp; West have underperformed the market and there is scope for further improvements here.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   PERMANENT INTEREST BEARING SHARES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Mini-                              Yield*                     Coupon    mum      Issue     price   Price* (gross, Stock              (gross %) (Pounds)  date     (pence)  (pence)   %)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bradford &amp; Bingley  13.00   10,000    30/9/91   100.20   141.75    9.17 Bradford &amp; Bingley  11.63   10,000    29/6/92   100.13   127.75    9.10 Bristol &amp; West      13.38    1,000   11/12/91   101.79   136.50    9.80 Bristol &amp; West      13.38    1,000   31/10/91   100.34   136.50    9.80 Britannia (1st)     13.00    1,000    13/1/92   100.42   136.50    9.52 Britannia (2nd)     13.00    1,000    8/10/92   107.13   136.50    9.52 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs 11.75   50,000   21/10/92   100.96   128.25    9.16 Coventry**          12.13    1,000    28/5/92   100.75   128.50    9.44 First National      11.75   10,000     4/5/93   100.25   114.75   10.24 Halifax             12.00   50,000    23/1/92   100.28   135.25    8.87 Halifax              8.75   50,000     7/9/93   100.62   102.00    8.58 Leeds Permanent     13.63   50,000     3/6/91   100.00   150.00    9.08 Leeds &amp; Holbeck     13.38    1,000    31/3/92   100.23   138.00    9.69 Newcastle           12.63    1,000     8/9/92   100.45   133.50    9.46 Newcastle           10.75    1,000    15/6/93   100.32   114.00    9.43 North of England    12.63    1,000    23/6/92   100.14   131.50    9.60 Skipton             12.88    1,000    27/2/92   100.48   132.00    9.75  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hoare Govett.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Purchase price as at mid-day November 25; excludes accrued interest **includes stamp duty payable on Coventry pibs only  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

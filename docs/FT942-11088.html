			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Opposition parties vie for top battle honours - Lib Dems see biggest net gain of seats / Labour does well in London and holds firm in regions Both of the main opposition parties were entitled to wear a broad smile last night in the aftermath of a result universally seen as a disaster for the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats made by far the biggest number of net gains on the night - more than 300. But Labour did well in London - the key area for the party in terms of demonstrating its ability to win the prize that really matters: the next general election in 1996 or 1997. Labour will also have been buoyed by the remarkable extent to which its share of the vote outside London held up in comparison with the exceptionally high level of 43.8 per cent the party attained in 1990. All of this will have given chastened Conservative strategists plenty to think about. But the most immediate concern to Tories will be the unexpectedly strong Liberal Democrat showing - particularly in southern England. This augurs badly for the next electoral hurdle that the Conservatives must somehow try to stumble across - June's elections to the European parliament which will have a significant bearing on Mr John Major's prospects of remaining party leader. In this contest, the Liberal Democrats have high hopes of winning a swathe of Tory-held seats in the south-west and central southern England. Last night's results will have done nothing to dent their confidence - in spite of the fact that relatively few councils in south-west England held elections. Where elections were held in the region - such as in Mr Chris Patten's former parliamentary constituency of Bath - the Liberal Democrats performed outstandingly. While the Liberal Democrats had hoped to win control of the ancient city - which they had never previously controlled - their success surpassed all their expectations. They took seven seats from the Conservatives - previously the largest party - but also all five seats being defended by Labour, which now has an insignificant presence on the council. For Labour, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said that last night's message was that Mr Major was presiding over a government that was 'even more unpopular' than that of the Thatcher administration at the height of the poll tax debacle. 'It looks as if outside London we are going to maintain our best result ever,' he added. The country was sending the Tories a message that they 'have had enough'. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, focused on the party's success in holding Birmingham, a prime Conservative target. 'The Tories told us to judge tonight's elections by whether or not they took control of Birmingham,' she said. 'By those standards alone, tonight has been a failure for the Tories.' For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Charles Kennedy, the party president, characterised the result as 'a big thumbs-up' for the party. 'This proves we have established our position as a national party, retaining and winning control of councils and becoming the main challengers both to the Conservatives and Labour in their heartlands,' he said. Mr Archy Kirkwood, the Liberal Democrat chief whip, said that his party had 'replaced the Tories as the second party in local government'. Last night, both main opposition parties could be forgiven their self-congratulation. If in the European elections the Liberal Democrats inflict a further mauling on the Conservatives in their south-west English heartlands, they will seem to be making the running. But if Labour can resist the temptation to put the Liberal Democrats in its sights, it may ultimately win the larger prize.</p>

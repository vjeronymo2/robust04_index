			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Airlines link for Vilnius service THREE European airlines start this week regular scheduled services to Vilnius, the capital of the newly independent republic of Lithuania which is seeking to expand economic ties with the west, writes Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent. Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), Swissair and Austrian Airlines have for the first time co-ordinated services to the same city, operating a joint office and station and jointly recruiting staff. The move marks a strengthening of the so-called European Quality Alliance airline partnership which is designed to enhance the competitive position of the three medium-sized airlines against larger European rivals like British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France. The flights - from Copenhagen, Zurich and Vienna - will allow a daily service to Vilnius from one of the three cities, except on Wednesday. Lithuania is anxious to attract western investment to modernise and expand the Vilnius airport. A big problem facing western carriers setting up operations in the Baltic region is the lack of adequate ground and telecommunications infrastructure. Yesterday's launch of the first SAS flight from Copenhagen to Vilnius also marks a further expansion of the Scandinavian carrier's operations in the Baltics.</p>

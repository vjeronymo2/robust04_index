			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> 3.5% RENT INCREASE URGED  </P> <P> Rent control officials are recommending that rents be allowed to go up 3.5%  this year, slightly more than last year's increase but below the national  average of rising rents.  </P> <P> The 3.5% increase will be the subject of a public hearing tonight at 7:30 at a  Rent Control Board meeting in City Hall.  </P> <P> Under Santa Monica's strict rent control law, the board votes on an annual  increase that landlords are allowed to begin charging in September. The  increase last year was 3% and has averaged about 4% each year since rent  control was enacted a decade ago.  </P> <P> Nationally over the same period, rents have risen an average of 6.5% per year,  according to a 1987 study.  </P> <P> The average rent in Santa Monica is $480, according to the rent control agency.  </P> <P> If the 3.5% increase is approved, landlords must notify their tenants in  writing and certify that there are no outstanding citations or uncorrected  building code violations against the property.  </P></p>

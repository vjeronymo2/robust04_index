			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Beregovoy gets off to flying start in polls THE appointment of Mr Pierre Beregovoy as France's new prime minister to replace Mrs Edith Cresson seems to have achieved its most immediate objective: it has won the approval of a majority of the French electorate. A survey by the CSA institute for public radio found 66 per cent think that Mr Beregovoy may be a good prime minister, and 52 per cent think he may give a new impetus to government policy. Another poll, carried out by the SOFRES institute for the newspaper Le Figaro, said 50 per cent approved the appointment of Mr Beregovoy, and 55 per cent thought President Francois Mitterrand had learned the lessons of the government's massive setbacks in the recent regional and local elections. The new government's first task is to reverse the record-breaking decline in popularity during Mrs Cresson's 10-month premiership. The CSA institute pointed out, however, that 70 per cent thought Mrs Cresson might be a good prime minister at the time of her appointment, and 67 thought she would give new impetus to government policy. Inside the Socialist party, Mr Beregovoy's appointment has been greeted with relief by most members of parliament who hope he will restore calm and inspire confidence. Few seemed to expect, however, that he would enjoy sufficient freedom of economic manoeuvre to launch new policies for fighting unemployment or for improving the lot of the deprived inner cities. In any case, economic policy will continue to be determined by Mr Beregovoy from the prime minister's office. The appointment of Mr Michel Sapin to take charge of the Finance Ministry, after a junior post in the Justice Ministry, is a remarkable promotion for a young politician who is still not quite 40. But Mr Sapin is a lawyer by education, with no special experience of economics, and no special power base; moreover, his ministry has been reduced in rank, and now merely shares equal status with the Budget and Industry ministries. On the other hand, the overall political balance within the new government seems to indicate a clear strengthening of the position of the Socialist party faction led by Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the party, and a loss of influence of the rival faction led by Mr Lionel Jospin, the former party leader. This could lead indirectly to a strengthening of the position of Mr Michel Rocard as the party's potential candidate in the next presidential elections. Mr Beregovoy is a member of the Fabius faction, as are a disproportionate number of his ministers; whereas Mr Jospin, the former education minister, has been shut out of the new team. When Mr Fabius took over the leadership of the party in January, it was through a deal with Mr Rocard, in return for which Mr Rocard was designated the 'virtual' candidate of the party. The main significance of Mr Sapin's appointment to the Finance Ministry may be that he is a rising member of the Rocard faction. Tapie turns to politics, Page 12; Super Bere, Page 21</p>

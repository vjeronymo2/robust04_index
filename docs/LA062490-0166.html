			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIAN STUDENTS CLEARED IN RIOTING;  </P> <P> BUCHAREST: THE INTERIOR MINISTER SAYS THE YOUTHS WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THE  RECENT VIOLENCE. AUTHORITIES SEEM TO BE TRYING TO WIN OVER CRITICS.  </P> <P> A government minister said Saturday that student groups were not to blame for  the riots 10 days ago in Bucharest in which six people died.  </P> <P> In a fresh indication that Romanian authorities are trying to win over their  critics, Interior Minister Doru Ursu said: "It is more than clear that the  students of Bucharest were in no way involved in the violent events of June  13-15."  </P> <P> University buildings were ransacked and students and other people were attacked  by miners who came to the capital at the request of President Ion Iliescu to  quell anti-government riots.  </P> <P> Saturday night, a small crowd barricaded Bucharest's central boulevard on one  side of University Square, a flash point of the recent violence, in a gesture  of support for the arrested student leaders.  </P> <P> Police persuaded the protesters to dismantle their barriers and allow traffic  to pass after about 40 minutes.  </P> <P> Ion Ratiu, presidential candidate of the opposition National Peasants Party in  the May elections, denied on television that his party had anything to do with  last week's unrest.  </P> <P> Ratiu, whose party offices and home were ransacked by the miners, said his  party was not behind a seven-week demonstration that led to the violence.  </P> <P> "I have never given one penny to the people in the square," he said in reply to  allegations by the ruling National Salvation Front.  </P> <P> "I have also worked by legal methods, never by such means as those used in  University Square."  </P> <P> Three delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross are scheduled  Monday to start visiting people arrested during the unrest to check on their  health and conditions of detention.  </P> <P> The ICRC representative in Romania, Thierry Meyrat, said the mission could last  for months, depending on the timetable for any judicial proceedings against the  detainees. He declined to answer questions about the number or whereabouts of  prisoners.  </P> <P> Ursu said he could not discuss individual students but added that "in no way  can we talk about students' organizations participating in the events (last  week's violence)."  </P> <P> "I could even go further and say that the students through their calm attitude  and their whole activity in that period have acted as a factor of  stabilization."  </P></p>

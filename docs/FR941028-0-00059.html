			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Unfortunately, a regulatory authority cannot simply rely upon all applicants to supply complete ownership or control information. Some applicants may err in good faith, others may conceal information knowingly. Accordingly, the regulatory authority must look to other sources of information. The information contained in the records of State corporation commissions or taxing authorities is a good potential source of ownership or control information. Depending upon particular State requirements, such information may have been submitted under oath. Further, such information is submitted subject to the review of State corporation commissions and State taxing authorities. Thus, a State regulatory authority reviewing such information has the benefit of any efforts made by these other agencies to assure that information submitted to them is accurate and complete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, such information is important because it provides a basis for inquiry and for comparison with information submitted in the permit application. If there are discrepancies between the ownership or control information in such records and that submitted in the permit application, the applicant should be able to readily explain such discrepancies. Thus, if any information previously submitted to State taxing authorities or corporation commission has become subsequently outdated, this can be explained with minimal inconvenience to an applicant and minimal delay in the permit application process. On the other hand, if important ownership or control information has been omitted from a permit application, the State taxing and corporation commission records may be the key to identifying such omissions. In any event, the benefits of such information to the regulatory authority outweigh the risks identified by the industry commenters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter representing State regulatory authorities also asserted that these records rarely provide information not contained in previous permit applications or in AVS. This commenter also indicated that these records are difficult to obtain because tax records are not typically available for review by State agencies other than the taxing authorities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with the view that these types of records merely contain information which is duplicative of information already available to the State regulatory authorities through permit applications or AVS. While OSM makes every effort to assure that AVS contains complete and accurate information with respect to ownership or control links, OSM has never asserted that AVS is perfect. Even if AVS were a perfectly complete source of such information, new corporations are being formed and new applications to conduct surface coal mining operations are submitted. AVS must be regularly updated. It is likely that there is relevant ownership or control information contained in corporation commission and tax records of the various States which is not yet reflected on AVS. Thus, there is a need for State regulatory authorities to review such information and compare such information with permit applications to identify accurate and complete ownership or control information. Such information can then be added to the AVS database. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to commenter's concern about the availability of State tax and corporation commission records, OSM recognizes that particular State laws may limit a State regulatory authority's access to such records. The requirement of the proposed regulation was for the regulatory authority to review ``reasonably available sources.'' Thus, if a State law explicitly forbids the regulatory authority's access to State tax information, the information would not be ``reasonably available'' for review. In the absence of such explicit prohibition, however, State regulatory authorities should review such information. OSM encourages State regulatory authorities to work with their sister tax and corporation commission agencies to develop information access arrangements to the extent permissible under applicable laws. Nevertheless, OSM rejects the view that the difficulty of obtaining the information justifies withdrawing or amending the proposing regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter representing State regulatory authorities further questioned the requirement contained in paragraph (c)(2) of proposed &sect;773.22 that ``credible information,'' rather that ``credible evidence,'' support an applicant's satisfactory explanation of omissions, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies with respect to ownership or control information in an application. OSM used the term ``credible information,'' rather than ``credible evidence'' because this is a broader concept than credible evidence. This term would include credible evidence which would be admissible at trial. Nevertheless, an applicant might be able to provide a satisfactory explanation based upon information which would not necessarily be admissible at trial, but which is a reliable and believable basis to conclude that no actual omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency exists. Accordingly, the language of the proposed regulation was intended to provide flexibility to the regulatory authority to consider such information, including credible evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

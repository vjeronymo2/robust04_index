			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / International Company News: Japanese electrical group sees first loss ALPS Electric, a leading Japanese electronics parts manufacturer, expects to reveal consolidated net losses for the first time when it reports its results for the year to March 1993. Alps, which makes electronic parts for consumer electronics, data communications and other electronic equipment, forecasts net losses of Y2.3bn (Dollars 20.2m), compared with a forecast made in November of profits of Y1.5bn. The lower result will stem mainly from extraordinary losses at a subsidiary, Tohoku Alps, where it was necessary to liquidate inventory. In the year to March 1992, Alps reported consolidated net profits of Y7.3bn. The group is selling securities holdings in other companies to improve taxable profits which are forecast at Y5.6bn, compared with a previous forecast of Y4.5bn. In the year to March 1992, consolidated pre-tax profits were Y15.8bn. Consolidated sales are forecast at Y420bn, compared with a previous forecast of Y430bn and 1992 sales of Y461bn.</p>

			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Mickey Mouse lures the stars in Paris WESTERN Paris will be packed with traffic tonight as hundreds of politicians, journalists, stars, and anyone else who has laid hands on an invitation arrive at Marne La Vallee for Euro Disneyland's eve-of-opening gala. Euro Disneyland, the biggest and most expensive theme park in Europe, officially opens tomorrow. But the celebrations start this evening when guests, clad in the Mickey Mouse sweatshirts which are obligatory garb for the night, are let loose on the attractions. A string of stars - from Tina Turner to Jose Carreras - will croon for a 'musical spectacular' to be broadcast on French television. Anyone who has glanced at a French newspaper or magazine recently could be forgiven for thinking Euro Disneyland had already opened. The French press, which followed every hitch and suspected hitch in the park's construction with avid attention, has flung itself into a furore over the pros and cons of Paris's latest tourist attraction. So far the French public has heard more about the cons. Le Nouvel Observateur, the leftish weekly, has devoted four pages to whether the park was a 'cultural Chernobyl'. A group of intellectuals polled by Figaro, the right-wing daily, voted solidly against Euro Disneyland. One dismissed it as 'a construction of hardened chewing gum and idiotic folklore taken straight out of comic books written for obese Americans'. Another hoped 'with all my heart' that it would be 'burnt down'. Euro Disneyland does have some supporters. Mr Andre Glucksmann, the pop philosopher, leapt to its defence in the International Herald Tribune. 'This may come as a surprise but I don't feel attacked either by an outside enemy or a hostile foreigner,' he said. One bastion of the French media has remained loftily aloof from the debate. The venerable Michelin has devoted its latest guide to what to do in and around Euro Disneyland. The 'white knuckle' attractions - the Phantom Manor haunted house with its 999 ghosts and the runaway minetrain - come out tops with the ultimate accolade of three stars. But only one of the park's cafes and restaurants, the Lucky Nugget Saloon, was deemed worthy of a star - and that was for 'interest', not food. Mouse that Roared, Weekend FT Page IX</p>

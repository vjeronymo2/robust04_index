			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Battle of wits sways Indian equities - State-owned institutions are trying to control the market's bulls, says RC Murthy This week has seen a battle of wits in the Bombay equity market, between bullish traders on one side, and state-owned mutual funds and other institutional investors on the other. After hitting a peak on Monday, as the bull market accelerated following the budget on February 29, the BSE index took successive plunges on Tuesday and Wednesday as institutions sold heavily to cool the overheated bourse; but the bull players could not be denied yesterday, when the index recovered 78.29, or 2.5 per cent, to 3,241.97. This week's concerted action by institutional investors interrupted a four-month bull run. Acting on a warning from the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, the institutions focused on key shares such as Tata Iron and Steel, and Reliance Industries, to have the maximum psychological effect. Equities fell 10.8 per cent over Tuesday and Wednesday; Mr Hemendra Kothari, BSE president, had said that a 15 per cent correction would be healthy. However, while state-owned investment houses continued their selling yesterday, this was quickly mopped up by big bulls who renewed their buying on end-account considerations, aiming to push up prices and reduce the margin money they have to pay on long positions. The February 29 budget exempted investment in shares from wealth tax, and brought a flood of money into equities from commodities and other markets. On top of that, a win for the minority PV Narasimha Rao administration in parliament on Monday was seen as a vote of confidence for market-friendly policies. Share prices nearly trebled in local currency terms between early July, when the BSE index stood at 1,293.67, to last Monday's 3,547.60 peak. The proposed opening up of the stock market to overseas pension funds, which is part of the budgetary package, will tighten equity market liquidity even further, unless the overseas funds decide to wait till the market settles to what they see as realistic levels. They may have currency reservations. The rupee has now been devalued twice over the past eight months, by a total of nearly 28 per cent - first in July by 18.8 per cent and again last week by 9.1 per cent. A dollar fetches Rs29.32, against Rs21.14 in early July. However, this has still left Indian share values nearly doubling in dollar terms over the past eight months against a trebling in local currency terms; and the 9.1 per cent rupee depreciation last week was part of a budget package which made the rupee partly convertible, by allowing exporters to sell on the market 60 per cent of their foreign currency earnings. Under a dual rate system, the free market price is hovering around Rs29.50, against the official rate of Rs25.92 to the dollar applicable to 40 per cent of export earnings. Foreign exchange dealers expect the rupee to depreciate by another 5 to 10 per cent later this month, as importers enter the market to cover their foreign currency needs for overseas debt servicing. But this has actually helped export-oriented and other foreign currency-earning companies, and they are expected to get a further boost if the rupee depreciates further. The Birla-owned Century Textile and Industries has appreciated by Rs2,850 to Rs9,800 over the past two months; Essar Shipping has nearly doubled to Rs112.50; and Great Eastern Shipping has risen 40 per cent to Rs157.50. Meanwhile, four Indian companies - Tata Steel, Reliance Industries, Essat Gujarat and the Birla-owned Grasim Industries - plan to hit the Euro-equity market to raise Dollars 400m to Dollars 500m over the next six months. Their price-earnings ratios, which range from 15.8 for Essar Gujarat to 47.4 per cent for Tata Steel, are lower than many others. Hoechst India is on a p/e ratio of 108, Indo-Gulf Fertilisers on 65 and Colgate-Palmolive India on 59. All four companies have major expansion projects, which should enhance earnings after they become operational. Traders predict that share prices of the four will rise further. They reckon that Tata Steel, which has retreated to Rs450 after hitting Rs502 last week, will touch Rs600 later this year. Mr Kothari says a major correction should come in May or earlier when the corporate results season may not match up to expectations. 'But in the long run,' he adds, 'we are all bullish.'</p>

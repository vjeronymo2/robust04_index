			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Bunnings surges to ADollars 13m BUNNINGS, the Australian timber and building products group reported a sharp rise in net profits, to ADollars 13.12m (USDollars 9.8m) for the first half to December, from ADollars 4.04m a year earlier, Reuters reports from Sydney. Bunnings is the subject of a hostile takeover bid from Wesfarmers, the Australian agricultural services and coal group. The advance was mainly due to the sale of property. Sales moved ahead to ADollars 195.43m from ADollars 189.89m, while property sales netted income of ADollars 15.94m, against ADollars 2.23m. Earnings per share came out at 28.5 cents, compared with 9.1 cents. The dividend is being maintained at 8 cents a share. Wesfarmers already holds 44.6 of Bunnings. Last week it said BTR of the UK had accepted the bid for its 24.6 per cent stake.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tax rises and fuel duty hit drivers - Motoring The cost of motoring will rise significantly as a result of a sharp increase in fuel duties, a further rise in the cost of the car-tax disc - the vehicle excise duty - as well as the imposition of the new insurance tax which will increase the cost of car insurance. Petrol and diesel prices are set to rise well above the rate of inflation for the foreseeable future, as the government yesterday committed itself to raise road fuel duties by at least 5 per cent a year in real terms, compared with the increases of at least 3 per cent a year announced in March's Budget. Duties on road fuels were raised by 3p a litre or 14p a gallon with effect from 6pm last night. This effectively raised the price of unleaded petrol by 6.5 per cent to around Pounds 2.36 a gallon, while the price of a gallon of diesel rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 2.40 and the price of 4-star petrol rose by 5.5 per cent to around Pounds 2.59. The price of the car-tax disc is to be raised from Pounds 125 to Pounds 130, and this follows the increase of Pounds 15 from Pounds 110 in the March. The vehicle excise duty on trucks is unchanged. Motoring organisations last night attacked the increasing tax burden on motorists. 'What motorist can be happy with an annual increase in motoring taxation totalling 20 per cent ..and the prospect of paying to use the motorways?' the Automobile Association said last night. According to the AA, the Budget has given motorists an extra bill of around Pounds 44 a year on top of the tax increases in March for an average motorist covering 9,000 miles a year at 35 miles per gallon. The chancellor claimed falls in oil prices meant that petrol would still cost less in real terms than in the early 1980s. Some 80 per cent of goods are moved by roads and this cost can be expected to rise by about 1.5 per cent as a direct result of yesterday's Budget. The Road Haulage Association, which claims to be operating on wafer-thin margins, warned last night that its 10,000 member companies had every intention of passing on the cost increase in full. But with the exception of this adverse effect on the economy as a whole, the motor trade and industry was quietly breathing a sigh of relief. The increase in fuel duty was bigger than expected, but not big enough to cause any significant slowing of the recovery in new vehicle markets which is helping lift the country out of recession. Nor, most industry analysts felt last night, would any damage be done by the other small burdens Mr Clarke imposed on the business vehicle sector, the higher car excise duty and a 6 per cent rise in the taxation scale charges for fuel provided to company car drivers for their private use. In terms of the car market, the most likely impact will be further to accelerate the increase in popularity of diesel cars, which are at least 25 per cent more economical than their petrol counterparts. Mr Clarke did not even bother to mention the scale charge increase in his Budget speech. At its worst, it increases the charge for a car of over two litres from the current Pounds 1,130 to to Pounds 1,200 from next April 6 - representing an increased payment of only 34p a week to a basic rate taxpayer. The company car industry had feared greater changes, notably the possible introduction of National Insurance Contributions by employees to an entirely new company car taxation regime.</p>

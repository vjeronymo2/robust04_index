On the morning of 24 February, Vice Chairman Wang Bingqian  held talks with the provincial leaders concerned and discussed  with them issues like economic development, enterprise  ownership, narrowing economic gaps between areas, social  undertaking development, agricultural development, financial  work, people's congress work, and so on. Wang said: Fujian has  successfully quadrupled its gross national product seven years  ahead of schedule, this being a great achievement. It is now  seven years away from the end of this century. So long as all  the comrades continue to work hard, Fujian is bound to stand a  very good chance of success in respect of realizing a  comparatively well-off livelihood.    Wang Bingqian expressed the hope that leaders at all levels  in Fujian will be able to remain sober-minded, correctly analyze  domestic and global economic situations, study and work out  relevant countermeasures, enhance confidence, take the  initiative, improve overall planning, formulate feasible  development policies, focus on such key aspects as water supply,  electric energy production, and so on, readjust the fixed assets  investment scale, successfully build all types of development  zones, develop an export-oriented economy, expand economic and  trade exchanges with foreign countries and regions, successfully  carry out the Taiwan affairs work, unite with people at home and  abroad, and work hard to bring about healthy and rapid economic  growth in Fujian.    Wang Bingqian stated: In building a socialist market  economic structure, it is imperative to attach great importance  to the guiding role of the state-owned economy and mobilize all  forces to develop individually run enterprises, privately run  enterprises, and enterprises run with three types of capital,  namely, foreign capital, overseas Chinese capital, and both  Chinese and foreign capital.    Vice Chairman Wang Bingqian fully affirmed Fujian's  achievements in providing helpful assistance to poverty-stricken  areas, eradicating poverty, achieving prosperity, developing  education undertakings, developing science and technology, and  embarking on the road toward common prosperity. In the  meantime, he suggested that Fujian pay more attention to both  environmental and resources protection. To this end, he said,  leaders at all levels in Fujian should personally take charge of  work in this connection and try to enhance a sense of  environment among all people.    Wang Bingqian went on: It is imperative to increase  agricultural input, protect arable land, and integrate the urban  economy with the rural economy.

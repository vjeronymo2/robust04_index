Especially, it seems, the  Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] rebels, they finally  began turning up at the camps before Christmas but apparently  didn't like what they found or rather didn't find, in particular  basic facilities and the lack of food, water, and clothing.  Well, now, up to 600 Renamo soldiers are reported to have  walked out of camps in central Sofala Province. Renamo's  spokesman Almeida dos Santos called us up this afternoon and Dan  Isaacs asked him if it was true that the soldiers were quitting  the assembly areas.    [Begin recording] [Dos Santos] Yes, this is really true. We  have received reports that in Chiramba, one of the assembly  points, the soldiers have been leaving. Unfortunately, when  President Dhlakama recently visited one of these assembly  points, he discovered that the soldiers had no food and they had  no clothing. Not only that, the huts in which they were living  in, they were very poor, I would say sort of tents which are  just plastic [word indistinct] that have been distributed to  them, instead of giving them real tents.    [Isaacs] Mr. dos Santos, I find it a little bit difficult to  believe when I have just spoken to the United Nations who say  there are a few local problems, but on the whole, food and  clothing are getting through to the assembly areas?    [Dos Santos] Well, probably since that visit that President  Dhlakama had made to Chiramba assembly point, we have not had a  follow up to this, because the United Nations, in the name of  Dr. Aldo Ajello, had promised that it would send in a helicopter  that would carry the president to also visit the other assembly  points. If they had improved the situation, I am quite sure that  our soldiers would not have moved out of this assembly point.    [Isaacs] Afonso Dhlakama, the Renamo leader, and now you,  yourself, have been complaining about conditions in the camps  and the Renamo soldiers themselves are voting with [words  indistinct] by leaving some of these camps. What do you propose  to do? What do you plan to ask the United Nations now to do?    [Dos Santos] We have got to force the United Nations to make  sure that they actually create these conditions and in the  meantime, I think the main thing that we could do is to ask the  United Nations, jointly with our members who are in the  Cease-Fire Commission, to go round to make sure that they try to  put back the whole situation.

			<p>Trafficking   <F P=102>   PY1504003094 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese  14 Apr 94 p C1 </F>  <F P=103> PY1504003094 </F> <F P=104>  Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO </F> <F P=105>  Portuguese </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fernando Granato] </F>   [Text] A secret Army report, the details of which were  obtained by O ESTADO, establishes the precise moment at which  the Rio de Janeiro numbers game became involved with drug  trafficking. The report, which was prepared at the request of  the Eastern Military Command, mentions a 1981 meeting between  numbers game chiefs--represented by Aniz Abrahao Davi, known as  Anisio, from Beija-Flor; Ailton Guimaraes Jorge, known as  Capitao Guimaraes; and Toninho Turco, one of Rio de Janeiro's  major drug traffickers who was killed during a major police  operation in February 1988.    At the 1981 meeting--according to the Army report--it was  decided that the numbers game people would finance drug  trafficking in Rio de Janeiro, and that Turco, Anisio, and  Guimaraes would be responsible for all drug movements into and  out of the city. In addition, they also would be responsible for  the trafficking of smuggled arms.    A former Army captain who engaged in political repression as  a member of the DOI-CODI [Department of Domestic  Operations-Internal Defense Operations Center], Ailton Guimaraes  Jorge had been under investigation by the Armed Forces since  1974, when his name appeared in a military inquest in which he  was charged with smuggling and extortion. At the end of the  1970's, he left the Army and joined the numbers game.    Says the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] deputy for Rio de  Janeiro, Miro Teixeira: ``Capitao Guimaraes gave the numbers  game chiefs all the know-how in weapons and smuggling that he  learned from DOI-CODI. His joining the numbers game was  simultaneous with the appearance of the link with drug  trafficking.''    Before that, in 1976, when the progress of the federal  lotteries posed a financial threat to the numbers game, the  alliance with drug trafficking was already in design. Top Rio de  Janeiro numbers game chiefs met and decided that they had to  ``professionalize'' the business. In that year, numbers game  chiefs met for the first time with U.S. citizen Joe Conforte,  one of the entrepreneurs who controlled gambling in Las Vegas  and whose name was linked with drug trafficking.    During Carnival 1982, one year after a meeting between  Toninho Turco, Anisio, and Guimaraes, Conforte returned to Rio  de Janeiro and was welcomed in the theater box of numbers game  chief Castor de Andrade. He had Moet et Chandon champagne,  Iranian caviar, lobster, and tropical fruit as dessert. This was  the final signal that the numbers game would no longer be the  ``innocent'' activity of the 1960's and 1970's.    As of that time, Guimaraes and Castor vied for control of  operations. Guimaraes was the first game chief to control his  business with computers and to expand his activities to other  states. He also was designated president of the League of Samba  Schools--an activity that cleans up the image of game chiefs in  the eyes of the people. Despite the fact that he was arrested  one year ago at Polinter on charges of illegal association and  creation of armed gangs, he is considered the natural successor  to Castor de Andrade.    At a recent meeting in his gasoline station in Bangu, which  was also used as an accounting office for the numbers game,  Castor de Andrade reportedly said to some of his employees that  he suspected Guimaraes. A maneuver to replace him in the game  might have been under way. After the collapse of Castor de  Andrade's operation, many people in Bangu began to openly  disclose the names of the police and attorney general informers.</p>

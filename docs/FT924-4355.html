			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Danish workers count cost of No vote DENMARK'S No to the Maastricht treaty has cost the country 100,000 jobs, according to Mr Thor Petersen, economy minister. He said the vote against the treaty in the referendum in June had contributed to currency unrest, high interest rates and uncertainty about Denmark's future relationship with the European Community. Mr Petersen was commenting on a business confidence survey showing that 42 per cent of senior managers in large Danish companies expect to cut their workforce this winter. Recent unemployment figures indicate the minister's estimate of job losses may be exaggerated. Seasonally adjusted unemployment rose from 310,000 in May, the month before the referendum, to 315,000 in September, the most recent month for which the figure is available. Although Danish industrialists accept that the No vote has dampened business confidence, Mr Jorgen Hansen, director of the Federation of Danish Industries, describes the position in less drastic terms than Mr Petersen. 'There is a widespread wait-and-see attitude,' he says. Mr Birger Riisager, chief executive of FLS Industries, the world leader in supplying machinery and know-how for the cement-making industry, says his company is being cautious about making new commitments until next spring, when another referendum is expected to take place. 'If Denmark then decides to leave the Community, a new situation will arise. FLS will have to put its effort into other countries,' he says. Mr Hugo Schroeder, chief executive of Scandinavian Holding, which includes Skandinavisk Tobak, the tobacco goods group, and a large office furniture group, says that the Maastricht vote in June had not affected the group's investment decisions so far. But if Denmark voted No again, the group would have to consider whether to make more of its investments outside Denmark. If Denmark again says No, the government has admitted it would have to withdraw from the Community. 'We should then presumably have the same status as the European Economic Area countries, which means that we would be part of the internal market, but we would have no influence when the internal market's rules are made, a very unsatisfactory situation,' says Mr Hansen. If Denmark withdraws from the Community and loses access to EC markets for its agricultural products, serious consequences will arise for agriculture and related food processing industries. A recent study by the Agricultural Council, grouping the farmers' unions and other farmers' organisations, said that without the Common Agricultural Policy, agricultural exports could fall by up to DKr33bn (Dollars 3.5bn), about 14 per cent of total merchandise exports. Up to 100,000 jobs - about 4 per cent of the country's total labour force - could be lost on farms, and in abattoirs, dairies and agricultural supply industries. 'The whole rural economy is in trouble because of the current uncertainty,' says Mr HOA Kjeldsen, president of the Agricultural Council, 'not just the farms, but the suppliers, the retailers, everyone'. At MD Foods, Denmark's largest dairy business and one of the largest in Europe, the prospect of Danish withdrawal from the EC is regarded as a catastrophe of such dimensions that it just cannot happen, says Mr Peter Kjelstrup, communications manager. 'It would mean the slaughter of half the Danish dairy herd and a halving of MD Foods,' he says. For the moment, the uncertain situation means that MD Foods' investment spending would be slightly lower this year than last and a programme for acquisition of dairies abroad is being postponed.</p>

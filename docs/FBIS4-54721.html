			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 2 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic wants to  join the European Union as an individual entity, not as part of  Central Europe, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told Danish Foreign  Minister Niels Petersen today. Ivana Plechata from the  Government Office told CTK that Klaus and Petersen also agreed  that the developments in the former Yugoslavia had to be viewed  rationally, not emotionally. They noted that the conflict had  to be treated seriously, but that it was not possible to make  far-reaching political conclusions.    In a meeting with President Vaclav Havel Petersen, who  arrived for an official visit today, said he comprehended  certain impatience of people in the Czech Republic in relation  to the country's admission to the European Union (EU). He  stressed his government was ready to support small European  countries in their effort at integration into the EU.    Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said in  his  talks with Petersen that the Czech Republic was satisfied with  the development of trade with Denmark. Exports to Denmark rose  by $37.1 million in the years 1992-93. Denmark's surplus  decreased from $30 million in 1992 to a mere $3 million last  year, Dlouhy said.    Petersen also met today with Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde  and other leading parliamentary representatives.</p>

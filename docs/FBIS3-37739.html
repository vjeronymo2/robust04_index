			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent learned on 22 February  that in connection with the suspension of gas supplies from  Turkmenistan to Ukraine from 21 February, Yevhen Sukhin, first  deputy head of the State Committee for Oil and Gas, issued an  instruction according to which he has obliged Ukraine's  industrial enterprises to cut gas consumption by a total daily  amount of 90 million cubic meters (this is equal to amounts of  gas that Turkmenistan supplied to Ukraine). According to the  instruction, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of  Machine-Building and the Ministry of Energy have been  recommended to draw up by 1000 on 22 February a list of  enterprises that will have gas consumption restricted or cut.  UkrBudMaterialy [Ukrainian construction and materials  committee] and UkrTsement [Ukrainian Cement] have been  instructed to immediately prepare for production to be  suspended. The instruction has also been sent to heads of  oblast state administrations.    As a UNIAN correspondent was informed on 22 February by  UkrGazProm [Ukrainian gas industry committee], as of today the  State Oil and Gas Committee's instruction had been carried out  only by Ukraine's Ministry of Energy.    In the opinion of a UkrGazProm representative, who wished to  remain anonymous, unless the situation changed there would only  be enough gas for 2-3 days. If there is frost, there would be  restrictions for domestic consumers as well as for industrial  enterprises. The UNIAN correspondent was told that the  situation was also being made more complicated because along  with Turkmenistan, Russia had also suspended gas deliveries to  Ukraine along the Yelets Dykanka gas pipeline.    UkrGazProm also said that if the gas situation in Ukraine  became more complicated, one would have to illegally take  Russian gas, which is transported to countries of Western Europe  through Ukraine. The amounts have not yet been determined but in  the opinion of an UkrGazProm representative they would be  between 20-25 million cubic meters daily.</p>

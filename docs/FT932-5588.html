			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Lloyd's judge to expedite actions MR JUSTICE SAVILLE, the High Court judge, is to step up efforts to rationalise an increasingly complex set of legal actions involving Lloyd's Names in the face of growing congestion in the Commercial Court. Some observers believe that this could give a fillip to efforts by Lloyd's to achieve an out-of-court settlement. Mr Saville, head of the Commercial Court, will meet solicitors representing groups of Names - the individuals whose capital backs the insurance market - and their agents on June 21 and 22. It is understood that he is unwilling to set new court dates for any Lloyd's cases until he has formed an overall view of the issues. Mr David Bird, clerk to the Commercial Court, said: 'Part of the reason for the meetings is to find out the scale of the problems. We know a lot of Lloyd's cases are floating about but we do not know how many or what impact they will have.' Parties who have not yet decided to take legal action will also be invited to the meeting, which is being organised by Elborne Mitchell, the solicitors. It is also understood that Sir Michael Kerr, the former High Court judge and privy counsellor heading Lloyd's efforts to obtain an out-of-court settlement, will also attend the meeting. Mr Saville has asked permission from parties involved in the disputes to meet with Sir Michael separately. Last week Mr Saville met solicitors representing Names taking individual action. More than two dozen groups of Names have launched or are considering action against their agents as part of efforts to recover insurance losses. So far only a handful of cases has come to court, although a case by several thousand members of the Feltrim syndicates, who are applying for a summary judgment in their case against agents, is set to come to court in September. To complicate matters Mr Saville is scheduled to preside in a big non-Lloyd's case in the autumn which could last up to a year. Earlier this year Mr Saville issued a strong warning that unless more judges were appointed to the over-pressed Commercial Court Britain could lose its position as a leading centre for international litigation, costing the UK legal profession millions of pounds. In response to his demands - and obvious pressure on other parts of the High Court - the Lord Chancellor has undertaken to appoint a further 10 judges by the autumn, some of whom will take charge of Commercial Court cases.</p>

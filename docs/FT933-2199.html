			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Time Warner announces shake-up in publishing TIME WARNER, the US media group, last night announced a management shake-up of its publishing arm, Time Inc, which it said was meant to produce continued growth for the rest of the decade and initiative a process of change that would virtually 'reinvent the company'. The shake-up centres on Time Inc's New York magazine publishing operations and, in particular, its three leading titles - Time, People and Sports Illustrated. At Time and People a new position, president, is being created above that of publisher. The publisher, who previously handled a wide range of tasks, will now focus on advertising sales. At Sports Illustrated, the previously combined job of president and publisher is being split in two. This is supposed to be the start of a decentralising, cost-saving process which will involve some staff cuts, primarily through attrition. The company is also setting up a new group to handle multi-media, which it wants to grow into a third business leg, alongside magazines and books.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, 3 Apr (TANJUG) -- The murders which took  place in Prijedor between 29 March and 1 April are criminal acts  commited by hitherto unidentified perpetrators, and intensive  action is being taken to uncover those who committed them, the  interior ministry of the Srpska republic [RS] has said in a  statement.    The statement says that eight criminal acts of murder were  committed in the specified period and that 16 people, mainly  Muslims, lost their lives [as received].    Regarding claims by some foreign agencies that the murders  were part of ethnic cleansing in and around Prijedor, the  statement says that these were criminal acts by hitherto  unidentified perpetrators, against whom criminal charges have  been filed.    "Teams of Ministry of Internal Affairs and security organs  of  the Srpska republic army are working intensively on collecting  data in order to identify and arrest the perpetrators of the  crimes," the statement says and adds that all possible  preventive measures are being taken to stop any further  escalation of crime.    The interior ministry points to the fact that the events in  Prijedor took place during the Muslim spring offensive, which --  through the crimes committed -- demonstrated that the Muslims  were prepared to use all available means to achieve their goals.  This contributed to the escalation of the interethnic conflicts  in this area, where such conflicts had not occurred for a long  time.    The RS interior ministry appeals to all international  institutions "which have influence in the area" to use it to  protect the Serb population in the areas controlled by Muslims.    They particularly demand that prisoners be treated according  to international law.    In this way extremists among the Serb people can also be  opposed more effectively and better protection can be given to  the Serb people and all citizens living on the RS territory, the  statement says in conclusion.</p>

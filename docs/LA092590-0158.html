			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ARTS  </P> <P> SCR to Reconsider NEA Grant: South Coast Repertory's trustees will meet  Wednesday to decide whether to accept its $112,500 grant from the National  Endowment for the Arts. While other Orange County institutions have rejected  their NEA grants and the Newport Harbor Art Museum has sued the NEA over the  federal agency's requirement that grantees sign an anti-obscenity oath, David  Emmes, SCR's producing artistic director, would not predict what action  trustees may take.

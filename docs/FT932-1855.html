			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas The Monopolies and Mergers Commission seems unlikely to produce its report on British Gas until the end of July. That is conveniently after both the BT3 flotation and the departure of MPs for sunnier climes. By then British Gas's management will have spent a full year pleading its case, though it seems unlikely to gain much from the whole exercise. Of the three principal issues in the inquiry: industry structure, the domestic monopoly and financial returns for British Gas, the company is at its weakest in trying to maintain its exclusive grip on the domestic market. Other utilities like BT have been forced to accept competitors cherry-picking their more profitable customers, so British Gas may not get much sympathy. Indeed, the company would have appeared more forward-looking had it embraced competition. By contrast, Ofgas has not made a convincing case for British Gas to be split up. However, that will be cold comfort given that the company had hardly expected to be dismembered. Yet the make or break issue for British Gas will be the rate of return it is allowed to earn on its assets. Plenty of academic fur has flown debating the issue, but figures around 4-5 per cent for existing assets and 7-8 per cent for new investment look sensible. The RPI-5 cap also seems likely to remain. That leaves British Gas close to the status quo, though heavy cost reductions will be needed. After a year failing to get the regulatory monkey off its back, Gas's management must be wondering if it was all worthwhile.</p>

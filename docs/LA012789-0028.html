			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A deepening arctic cold wave -- which has stopped the mail, prevented grocery  deliveries and sent soldiers into retreat -- stopped oil field work, shut down  a Hollywood crew and postponed one of Alaska's top sled dog races. "It's so  cold up here the thermometer has run out of numbers," Willie (Bossman) Pitka, a  Kuskokwim 300 Sled Dog Race official, said when the southwestern Alaska town of  Kalskag hit 70 below zero. The 10th annual Kuskokwim 300, with a $50,000 purse,  was supposed to start Thursday from Bethel. Extreme cold stopped the race  before it could start, said Allen Auxier, race judge in Bethel.  </P></p>

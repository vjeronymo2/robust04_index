			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Treasury snub for PIA upgrade The government yesterday dismissed a suggestion from Sir Gordon Downey, the former chairman of the Personal Investment Authority, that it might become a designated agency accountable directly to the Treasury. In a strongly worded statement, the Treasury said that there was 'no value in pursuing the possibility that the PIA might become a designated agency'. Sir Gordon raised the prospect of putting the PIA on the same footing as the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, as a way of reducing duplication and expense in the regulatory system. Writing in The Independent newspaper yesterday, Sir Gordon argued that such a move would also help to persuade smaller firms that the PIA would not simply be a 'colonial outpost' of SIB. Last September Sir Gordon was abruptly replaced as PIA chairman by Mr Joe Palmer, former chief executive of Legal &amp; General and a director of SIB. The Treasury said that it had no sympathy with turning the PIA into a designated agency. This course would, it said, delay the introduction of higher standards, create the risk of inconsistency of standards and reduce practitioner input. 'It is certainly not clear how that would help to protect investors,' it concluded. Some of those in favour of the designated agency option have argued that it might appeal to the government because it could be achieved without new legislation. However, if the PIA were to become a designated agency that had the power to levy fines, then new legislation - which the government has set its face against - would be needed. Sir Gordon's suggestion and the response to it come against a background of continuing discontent from some elements of the retail financial services industry. Two-thirds of life companies have now applied to join the PIA. But with only about two months to go before it comes into operation, fewer than half its total potential members - including independent financial advisers and others - have so far applied to join. The most likely event to spark further applications would be an announcement by SIB confirming its inclination to recognise the PIA as protector of the private investor. Such a statement might enable some of the larger organisations which have expressed unease about the PIA to support the new regulator, as it would be seen as a stronger guarantee that the new regime would mean higher standards.</p>

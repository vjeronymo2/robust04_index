Mr Wynand Breytenbach, chairman of the Free State NP, would  automatically take over as party leader in the province until  the forthcoming provincial congress.    Mr Coetsee said he wished to thank the many people who had  congratulated him on his election as president of the Senate.    He was laying down the party leadership with the peace of  mind and knowledge that it would remain in good and strong hands.

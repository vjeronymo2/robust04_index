			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Tandem cuts workforce by 15% TANDEM Computers, the latest victim of computer industry turmoil, plans to cut its workforce by about 15 per cent in a restructuring. The company took a Dollars 451m third-quarter charge and reported an operating loss. Between 1,600 and 1,800 jobs will be lost over the next 12 months. The announcement follows Tandem's recent introduction of a new range of smaller, more powerful, parallel computer systems and servers with significantly lower prices than its previous products. The cuts were necessary 'to bring the company's cost structure in line with the new highly competitive pricing model,' Tandem maintained. 'There are two challenges in the computer industry: ongoing economic weakness in international markets, and a fiercely competitive environment created by low priced products and heavy discounting,' said Mr James Treybig, president and chief executive. 'To become a low-price provider requires that we adopt a new business model if we are going to achieve our profitability goals. This requires more than just cutting costs; it requires re-engineering the business, changing our culture, and continuously reducing our cost structure.' Since the end of the third quarter, Tandem has reduced its workforce at several locations, including its European subsidiaries. By the end of the current quarter, 700 employees will have been laid off, the company said. Tandem also cut the pay of remaining employees by 5 per cent and reduced benefits. 'This is not a temporary measure, but a permanent shift in our salary structure,' it said. Tandem recorded third-quarter net losses of Dollars 549.5m, or Dollars 4.88 a share, after the restructuring charges. Operating losses for the quarter were Dollars 44m. In the same period last year, it earned Dollars 17.4m, or 16 cents. Revenues declined to Dollars 475.6m from Dollars 503.2m a year ago, due to weak economic conditions, particularly in Europe, and customers' hesitation to purchase current products in anticipation of the recent introduction of low-cost computers, Tandem said. 'Fortunately, we have been implementing a product strategy that will take us (through) the '90s. Last week we announced new products which, coupled with our restructuring, will, we believe, lead to greatly improved earnings per share in the next fiscal year,' said Mr Treybig.</p>

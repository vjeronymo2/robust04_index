			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 2 SAPA -- Dissident members of the  Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] have plunged the movement into a  security crises by threatening the lives of bodyguards  protecting PAC members of Parliament, SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] radio new reported on Thursday [2  June].    PAC Western Cape Secretary Bathembu Lugulwana said an  anti-election faction within the movement had accused PAC  bodyguards of collaborating with the system and had threatened  to kill them.    Conflict within the security structures of the movement  started long before the elections when PAC youths, who had been  sent to Transkei for military training, returned to their  respective regions with an anti-election attitude, he said.    They had been sent for training to protect the rank and file  supporters of the movement during the elections.    Mr Lugulwana said the youths were apparently politically  indoctrinated by some influential leaders of the PAC in Transkei  who were opposed to the elections.</p>

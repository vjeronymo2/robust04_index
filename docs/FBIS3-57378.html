The Rukh believes that the acts of  terror against it are due to its political line aimed at the  building of an independent democratic state and at ridding  Ukraine of the former communist nomenklatura.    Vyacheslav Chornovil quoted a number of facts: Several  attacks, over the recent weeks, on the electoral headquarters of  the Rukh Chernivtsi regional organization; a pogrom on Christmas  night in the building of the Ternopil Rukh organization; the  beating up of the children of several leaders of rayon Rukh  organizations in Odessa Oblast. Unknown people broke into the  apartment of the chairman of the Kirovohrad organization, and on  15 January, there was an attempt to break into the apartment of  Les Tanyuk, member of the central Rukh leadership and member of  Ukraine's Supreme Council Presidium. On 17 January, in broad  daylight, Colonel Serhiy Budko was beaten up in Vinnytsya.  Finally, there is the attack on the Rukh secretariat in Kiev  and the disappearance of the head of the secretariat Mykhaylo  Boychyshyn, of whom nothing is known to this day.    Rukh demands that the president and the Supreme Council  chairman intervene in the situation and that Ukraine's Security  Service, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Procurator  General's Office investigate the criminal actions against Rukh  activists.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 Apr (MENA)--The UN Information Center in  Cairo has denied that the United Nations or Secretary General  Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali has any connection with a conference on  minorities in the Arab world scheduled to be held in Cairo on 12  May.    Hidayat 'Abd-al-Nabi, UN information official in Cairo, said  Dr. Butrus-Ghali will not address the conference, adding that  his name was associated with a conference with which he has no  connection.    In a statement to MENA, 'Abd-al-Nabi said this conference is  one among thousands of conferences held by nongovernment  organizations and research centers. She added that the  conference will be held under the joint auspices of the  Ibn-Khaldun Center for Studies in Cairo and a London-based  nongovernment organization that specializes in minority affairs.    'Abd-al-Nabi said the conference's name gives the impression  that the United Nations is involved. She said that "the United  Nations has no connection with the conference despite the title,  which refers to the UN declaration on minority rights."    She added: To clarify the uproar that exploded in the media  recently when an invitation was sent to the UN secretary  general, the invitation did not mention the Copts of Egypt.    She stressed that on 12 April the UN Secretary General's  Office declined the invitation on behalf of Butrus-Ghali.</p>

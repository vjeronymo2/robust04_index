			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hanson's restructuring of Beazer building business in US HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, yesterday said it would restructure its Beazer building business in the east coast of the US. Hanson, which acquired Beazer in 1991, is splitting its east coast operations into two units. The first, to be called Spectrum Construction Group and headquartered at Virginia Beach, will take over most of its construction and paving activities. The companies consolidated into Spectrum have aggregate annual revenues of Dollars 500m. The second unit, Benchmark Materials Company, will take in all aggregate operations including some asphalt paving 'where fully integrated with aggregates.' Benchmark - to be based in Raleigh, North Carolina - will have revenues of Dollars 325m. It will supply about 50m tons of aggregates, 3m tons of asphalt and related services to construction, railroad and agricultural industries. Mr John Wimberly, chairman and chief executive of Beazer USA, said the move 'will focus management and streamline Beazer's business on the East Coat. It will also align our operations to better fit the markets they serve.'</p>

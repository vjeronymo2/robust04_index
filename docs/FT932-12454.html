			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Further pay cut for Tesco chief A further fall in performance-related incentive payments left Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, with emoluments for the year to February 27 of Pounds 967,000. This was the second year running that the chief of the UK supermarkets chain suffered a reduction. Last time his total remuneration amounted to Pounds 1m, down from Pounds 1.48m in 1991. The figure for 1992 has been restated from Pounds 1.08m to reflect a change in accounting policy which relates the payment more closely to the results on which they are based. The 1992 annual report of Slough Estates reveals that Mr Graeme Elliot, former vice chairman, received Pounds 429,000 in compensation for loss of office.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Sacked Medway dockers hope to regain shares Former Medway Ports dockers - who recently won an industrial tribunal ruling that they were unfairly dismissed - are taking legal advice on whether they can apply for restitution of shares in the company. They were obliged to sell the shares when they lost their jobs. They hope to use Section 459 of the 1985 Companies Act - which relates to unfair treatment of minority shareholders - to apply for rectification of the shareholders' register. About 270 dockers were dismissed in November 1992 because they refused to accept new conditions of work. The company's articles obliged them to sell back shares - either given to them or purchased at Pounds 1 each at privatisation in March 1992 - to the company at Pounds 2.50, a price set by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. The company was bought by Mersey Docks and Harbour Company last September for Pounds 103m, valuing each share at Pounds 37.25. The sacked dockers won a ruling for unfair dismissal in March, and are to receive Pounds 10,000 compensation each. Many held shares they sold at the low price and are seeking advice over whether they can regain the shares. Dockers are also seeking legal advice over whether to pursue a claim that KPMG was negligent in valuing the shares at Pounds 2.50. It has been confirmed that Mr Peter Vincent, the chief executive of Medway Ports who has taken up a position on the board of Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, bought more than 100,000 ordinary shares from former directors three months before the takeover by Mersey Docks.</p>

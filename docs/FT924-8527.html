			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 2: Gut feeling guides decisions - After Black Wednesday, James Blitz looks at foreign exchange FOR UK treasury managers whose companies trade overseas, the world has suddenly become a more uncertain place. Until the autumn of this year, corporate treasurers with a large exposure to foreign currencies could afford to be relatively relaxed about the pound's exchange rate against the D-Mark and the dollar. Importers, for example, knew that sterling's membership of the exchange rate mechanism meant that the pound could not fall below DM2.7780 against the D-Mark. Europe's moves towards economic and monetary union also reduced exchange rate volatility as the continent's economies appeared set on convergence. And then there was Black Wednesday. Sterling's suspension from the ERM on September 16 was the climax of the worst currency crisis for decades, and was followed by a 19 per cent devaluation against the D-Mark. Now, a 2 or 3 pfennig fluctuation in the sterling-D-Mark rate, which would have been deemed unusual a few months ago, is seen as normal. And the forecasts for the pound's exchange rate next year look gloomy: some City economists predict a fall to Dollars 1.20 and DM2.30. According to Mr Les Halpin, a director of N P Record Treasury Management in Windsor, Berkshire, the floating pound is a hazard for companies which trade overseas. 'People are suddenly much more aware of the risks,' he says. 'The dealings and profits which a company has at any moment can be wiped out in hours, let alone days.' More and more treasury managers are now asking how they can hedge their currency exposure. A survey by the management consultants Touche Ross, showed that 85 per cent of companies had selective hedging cover last year. Interest has grown even more sharply in recent months. 'We advise 25 of the FT-SE 100 companies, and quite a large number have increased their hedging activity since Black Wednesday,' says Mr Derek Ross, a Touche Ross partner. Who should do the hedging? And how should it be carried out? Treasury managers need to consider a number of factors. First, they must decide what kind of exposure they have to currencies. Specialists divide the risks into two categories. Companies with 'transactional' exposure make sales in foreign currencies or have foreign currency borrowing or investment. These are seen as the prime candidates for currency hedging because fluctuations in exchange rates give rise to real gains and losses in cash terms, and have a direct impact on the profit and loss account. Those with 'translation' exposure have a more difficult judgment to make. The risk to these companies arises when amounts fixed in foreign currencies are given sterling equivalents for accounting purposes. This can change sterling reported values such as consolidated net wealth, altering a company's borrowing capacity or ability to make dividend payments. Second, they must decide what kind of hedging instruments to use. By taking out a forward contract, a company locks itself into exchanging cash at a given rate at a fixed moment in the future. The advantage of these contracts is that they minimise risk, and the company ignores any potential losses or gains that would be accrued if, in the meantime, sterling changes its rate. According to Mr Ross, some companies find it particularly attractive to take out these fixed contracts at the moment because UK interest rates have fallen below those in Germany. This means that companies with D-Mark payables will get more D-Marks for each pound. 'In certain cases this can prove very attractive,' says Mr Ross. Alternatively, a company buys options. This effectively allows it to place a bet on currency movements by paying a premium to a bank. If an exchange rate moves in an unfavourable direction, the bank is obliged to sell currencies at a more favourable rate. In the wake of the recent currency crisis, however, option premiums have shot up. 'We find that our customers are keener on taking out options now,' says Mr Halpin, 'but the banks have had problems with options underwriting and premiums have become more expensive.' Corporate treasurers must also decide when to manage the currency exposure themselves or farm it out to specialist advisers. In-house management gives treasurers more security over funds. But foreign exchange management is a highly technical and growing business, and analysts say that it can pose problems for the uninitiated. 'It's very important that treasury managers are not seen to be operating in a black box,' says Mr Ross. 'Decisions need to be taken in line with the changing nature of the business, and in a manner that is comprehensible to executive board members.' Whatever a corporate treasurer decides, he or she needs to bear in mind that currency hedging can only provide a short-term breather in the event that exchange rates are permanently realigned. If, as some economists believe, sterling is undervalued against the D-Mark and should rebound next year, then treasurers can happily hedge the exposure over the next few difficult months. But if sterling's recent devaluation is not reversed, and the currency stays at around DM2.40, treasurers and board members may be faced with the need to radically restructure their businesses. Companies may need to find new sales markets and new sources of capital stock. A few may have to close their businesses altogether. Unfortunately, in Britain's current political and economic climate, even the most experienced economists are uncertain where the pound will be in a month let alone a year. For treasury managers, the decision on how to respond to the pound's devaluation may be down to gut feelings as much as anything else.</p>

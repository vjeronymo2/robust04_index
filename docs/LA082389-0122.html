			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE  </P> <P> Dana Niguel Bank, a small financial institution in Dana Point, has acquired the  Laguna Hills office of Community Bank of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The purchase price has yet to be determined because of conditions that take  effect after federal regulators approve the transaction. But the price will  probably be under $200,000, said Charles W. Goodson, Dana Niguel Bank's senior  vice president.  </P> <P> The branch acquisition -- the first in the bank's seven-year existence -- will  boost the size of Dana Niguel Bank to $62 million in assets. At the end of  June, it had $52 million in assets.  </P> <P> The bank hopes to provide Small Business Administration loans to companies in  the expanding Irvine Spectrum commercial and industrial center near Laguna  Hills, Goodson said. The bank also hopes to build up its deposit base from the  residential community as well as business, he said.  </P></p>

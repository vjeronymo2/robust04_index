			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Corruption allegations against French Government Mr Jose Rossi, general secretary of France's Republican party, was yesterday appointed minister for trade and industry in the country's centre-right government, replacing Mr Gerard Longuet who resigned on Friday following growing allegations of corruption, writes John Ridding. The swift appointment and the decision not to implement a broader cabinet reshuffle, reflect Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's attempt to limit the upheaval in his government, with presidential elections little more than six months away. Mr Balladur is trying to play down the effects of the corruption scandals that have rocked the administration and which have prompted the resignation of two cabinet ministers in the past three months.</p>

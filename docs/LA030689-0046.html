			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ROAD TO MECCA' A PERSONAL JOURNEY  </P> <P> Most of the time, the deeply personal play burbles out of a playwright's  consciousness at the start of a career. In "The Road to Mecca," South Africa's  Athol Fugard breaks with that erratic tradition by offering his most personal  drama well along in his playwriting years.  </P> <P> This chamber piece for three voices, which opened Saturday at the Old Globe's  Cassius Carter Centre Stage, holds a few other surprises, not all of them good.  It's his talkiest play, his most densely and overtly symbolic, and it sets  aside anti-apartheid themes in favor of frontal attacks on a more general  Afrikaner malady: the paternalistic hypocrisy that cloaks its inherent  destructiveness in a self-ennobling mantle of rectitude.  </P> <P> The protagonists here are all white and focused on an aging artist caught in  the crossfire between the rebellious young teacher who befriends her and the  protective pastor of her church.  </P> <P> The widowed Miss Helen (Erica Rogers) lives alone in New Bethesda, a hermetic  and isolated community in the vast semi-desert of South Africa's Karoo. She's  in her 80s and has been given to creating exotic sculptures in her house and  garden ever since her husband died many years before. In the rigidly conformist  Afrikaner society around her, this has set her apart as a slightly batty  eccentric.  </P> <P> Lately, Miss Helen has been finding it harder to cope with daily living. Her  friend and pastor, Marius Byleveld (Ralph Waite), wants her to move into the  safe environment of a retirement home. If she wants to, of course. For her own  good, of course. It would mean leaving her strange, exotic statues and other  creations -- the fruit of her "hobby" as Marius calls it, which, in another day  and time, he points out, "might have been idolatry."  </P> <P> But Miss Helen's other friend, Elsa (Lynne Griffin), a radical young teacher  from Cape Town, 800 miles away, knows that these statues are "her expressions  of freedom" and that such a move away would be a sentence of death.  </P> <P> The many symbols of the "Road to Mecca" (starting with the title) lie in this  struggle among the death-defying forces of individualism and self-realization  (Miss Helen), its defenders (Elsa) and the self-righteous conformists who  oppose it (Marius).  </P> <P> This symbolism is neatly geometric, elaborately debated and made clear to the  point of becoming simplistic. Act One is spent setting up the premise and the  problem (what to do with Miss Helen), Act Two is spent working it out.  </P> <P> What started out as a seductive layering of ideas ends up being talked to  death, sometimes with a high level of passion (as in Elsa's ardent defense of  her friend's artistic freedom or Miss Helen's ultimate self-defense), but also  always with a high degree of textual and subtextual predictability.  </P> <P> We know quickly that the three symbolize not only this artist but this country  -- this South Africa torn apart by conflicts between freedom and suppression;  that the Karoo represents emotional as well as factual drought. Such  overstatement, in the end, defuses the play. The lines are clever but too  calculated, too reasoned, too over-explained, sapping the possibility of  excitement out of the piece.  </P> <P> Craig Noel's staging at the Carter falls victim to the over-symbolism and fails  to generate any serious excitement of its own (except for the inventive, Watts  Towersish designs by Joel Fontaine and Barth Ballard's lights).  </P> <P> Noel did not make his task any easier when he cast Rogers as Miss Helen, an  actress who is South African by birth and who has worked with Fugard, but who  is also too young and plays age only fitfully. The gray wig, make-up and  old-lady clothes alone don't cut it, even if the accent does.  </P> <P> Both Waite and Griffin, on the other hand, seem to have decided to play their  parts minus (or almost minus) an accent and Waite appeared uncommonly subdued  as Marius opening night. Griffin comes up with the requisite level of anger and  effrontery for Elsa, but she's swimming alone and upstream. Matters may improve  and performances coalesce in the running, but for the moment this "Road to  Mecca" is a rocky one.  </P> <P> At the Simon Edison Centre for Performing Arts in Balboa Park, Tuesdays through  Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m.; matinees Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends  April 16. Tickets: $16-$25; (619) 239-2255.  </P> <P> </P></p>

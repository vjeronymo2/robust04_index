			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Brazilian export growth relieves the gloom  -Industry, writes Christina Lamb, combats recession by concentrating on sales abroad WHENEVER Brazilian officials are asked tough questions about the country's generally gloomy economic situation, they retaliate with trade figures. This year's morale-boosting export performance is one of the few things unaffected by the country's political crisis. Despite recession in its main overseas markets, Brazil is expecting its exports to reach Dollars 36bn-38bn this year, or 10 per cent up on the last three years and second only to 1988. The surplus for the first eight months was Dollars 10.185bn, or 18.6 per cent ahead of last year, and a full-year total of Dollars 15bn is predicted. Last month's trade surplus of Dollars 1.41bn was 116.87 per cent up on 1991. 'There are two simple reasons for this,' says Mr Pedro Motta Veiga, director of the Foreign Trade Foundation (FUNCEX), 'and those are recession at home and a stable real exchange rate for the first time since 1988'. Although part of this year's export performance is due to a bumper harvest, the main push is coming from industry. Sixty per cent of Brazilian exports are manufactured goods, and, as companies struggle to survive a third year of recession and stagnant domestic sales, they are focusing increasingly overseas. Several industries such as textiles, capital goods and white goods are being sustained by foreign sales. The textile industry, which is operating with 30 per cent idle capacity, expects exports to reach a record Dollars 1.6bn, or a third up on last year. The best example of the export drive is the auto industry, which has seen exports January-to-July up 56.9 per cent on last year. Anfavea, the vehicle manufacturer's association, predicts a record 300,000 overseas sales this year. The domestic recession means that imports have been falling, belying manufacturers' fears that the tariff reduction programme begun in 1990 would destroy the long-protected Brazilian industry. Imports still represent only around 6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and this year are 2.79 per cent down and decreasing: in August, they fell 24.43 per cent. However, this has not stopped industrialists protesting against the next round of tariff reductions due on October 1, which will bring down the average from 21 per cent to 17 per cen, still the highest in Latin America. The government insists that the timetable will be kept, pointing out that Brazil is committed to meet targets laid down in the Mercosul arrangement to establish a free trade zone by 1995 with neighbouring Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Much of the increase in Brazilian exports is due to sales to Argentina, which now buys 8.13 per cent, second only to the US, which absorbs almost a fifth. While sales to the European Community, the largest bloc purchaser, and the US remained stable for the first half and those to Asia dropped, exports to Argentina increased 142 per cent. Brazil has gone from years of a small deficit with Argentina to a surplus as a result of the fewer regulations and lower tariffs of Mercosul (its products receive a 61 per cent preferential import duty reduction) and the overvalued peso. The avalanche of Brazilian products taking advantage of the cruzeiro's weakness against the peso is causing deep worry among Argentine industrialists and provoking cries of dumping. Brazilian industry is generally better equipped and structured than in Argentina and thus more likely to benefit from Mercosul. However, both sides are eager to ease tension, and Brazil is considering buying more wheat and oil from Argentina to improve the balance. Despite its belief that exports are essential for economic recovery, the government is providing little in the way of incentives and has no high-level co-ordinating body for trade. Mr Motta Veiga says the lack of a government export policy is 'unjustifiable' and argues that 'every 10 per cent increase in exports is 1 per cent of GDP, which makes a huge difference in a country like this. It is the difference between recession or not and millions of jobs.'</p>

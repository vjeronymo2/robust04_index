			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / French industrialists feel more confident CONFIDENCE among French industrialists is increasing, according to the latest official figures, fuelling hopes that the economy may recover momentum later this year. While France's economy has not suffered to the same extent as that of other countries, its growth rate has slowed over the past year, reflecting the impact of high interest rates on domestic demand and the effect on exports of recession in other countries. Insee, the state statistics institute, yesterday confirmed that the economy had grown by just 1.2 per cent in 1991, compared with 2.2 per cent in 1990 and 4.1 per cent in 1989. However, the institute's survey of industrial confidence suggests that there are already signs of improvement, particularly in export markets. Industrialists questioned expected the overall level of demand to stabilise over the next few months after falling since October 1990. Confidence was strongest on the export front, where growth of 3 per cent was predicted. The car industry and other areas of the transport sector (apart from airlines and aerospace) were also confident of recovery in the domestic market. However, respondents did not expect to see an alleviation of the financial pressures on their companies. The cost of production rose by about 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year and was expected to rise again, by 0.2 to 0.4 per cent, over the next few months.</p>

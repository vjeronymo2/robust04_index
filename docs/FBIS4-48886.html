			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video by unidentified reporter; from the </F> "National News Hookup" program]    [Text] Premier Li Peng has concluded his visits to four  central Asian nations and Mongolia. As reporters covering his  visits, we keenly realized the importance of and had to deal  with the tight schedule of the visits. A special plane took us  to various countries, and meetings, talks, delivering speeches,  and signing agreements comprised a major part of Premier Li's  daily life during the visits. Let us examine the agenda of one  day of the visit -- from this agenda we can see how busy Premier  Li was during the trip.    [Reporter begins to play a video tape on Li Peng's  activities  in Kazakhstan] On the morning of 26 April in Almaty, the  capital of Kazakhstan, Premier Li Peng presented flowers at a  monument dedicated to unknown martyrs. After that, Premier Li  held talks for three hours with Kazakh President Nazarbayev,  signed the historic Sino- Kazakh Border Agreement, and granted  an interview to reporters. In the afternoon, Premier Li met  with figures of Kazakhstan's enterprise circles, during which he  set forth six principles for developing economic and trade  cooperation between China and Central Asian nations. Following  that, Premier Li called on Chinese embassy personnel in Almaty.  In the evening, Premier Li attended a welcoming banquet hosted  by President Nazarbayev and delivered a speech at the banquet.  [as the reporter reads the report, video shows Li paying  tribute to the monument, holding talks with Nazarbayev, signing  the agreement, speaking to entrepreneurs, calling on the Chinese  Embassy, and attending and speaking at the banquet in his honor]    Hard work has turned into fruitful achievements. More than  20 meetings and talks during the trip have enhanced mutual  understanding between China and the countries we visited and  deepened the friendship between us, and two important speeches  delivered during the tour have clearly set forth the principle  for developing political and economic relations between China  and Central Asian nations. The signing of several important  agreements has laid a solid foundation for developing relations  between China and the four Central Asian countries and Mongolia.  [video shows Li Peng speaking and witnessing the signing of  documents]    If there were any light moments during the tour, they must  be  the short [words indistinct] and cheerful laughter and singing  on the special plane. [video shows Li Peng in plane, singing  through a loudspeaker as other passengers clap hands]    Dear viewers, Premier Li Peng's visits have ended and his  special plane is on the way home. But, the principle for  developing relations between China and Central Asian nations is  clearly set forth and our policy on developing economic and  trade relations with these countries has won popular support.  We hope that the flower of economic and trade relations will  blossom perpetually and the tree of friendship will remain green  forever.</p>

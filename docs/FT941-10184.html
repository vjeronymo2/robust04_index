			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Impala registers first-half gain at pre-tax level Pre-tax profit at South Africa'a Impala Platinum, the world's second-largest producer, improved 3 per cent to R153.7m (Dollars 44.7m) in the half-year to December 31, underpinned by a solid operating performance at the group's mines and almost flat rand revenue for its platinum group metal production. The rand's weakness against the dollar compensated for 55 per cent and 29 per cent lower dollar prices for rhodium and nickel respectively, which compared with 9 per cent and 45 per cent better platinum and palladium prices. The average rand price for the parcel of metals Impala sold fell to R1,960 an ounce from R2,009 an ounce. Mr Michael McMahon, managing director, said: 'The sky is falling on our heads as far as metal prices go.' Although platinum revenue increased to R734m from R524m, rhodium revenue collapsed to R146m from R318m. Overall turnover rose slightly to R1.1bn from R1.03bn. Mr McMahon said that given the 'soggy fundamental' market conditions facing platinum, with plummeting car sales in Europe and Japan, hopes rested on the metal's link with gold. On-mine operating costs were well contained as Impala started to reap the full benefit of its recent productivity drives centred on increasingly mechanised underground operations and retrenchments throughout the group's operations. Impala has shed one-third of its workforce in the past two years, but with 37,000 employees is still short of a target of 35,000. Increased capital spending and the group's revised expansion programme, in addition to lower interest receipts and share of income from Impala's stake in Lonrho's neighbouring platinum mines, took their toll. Distributable profit fell to R53m from R59.1m, equivalent to 134 cents and 136 cents a share, but a maintained 45 cents dividend is declared. Mr McMahon said Impala would match the performance in the second six months.</p>

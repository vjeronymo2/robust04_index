			<p>BFN     [Text] Hannover -- In the view of Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD] politician Egon Bahr, the United Nations is  currently neither willing nor able to intervene militarily in  Bosnia. In HANNOVERSCHE NEUE PRESSE (Wednesday [20 April]  edition), the peace researcher also warned that the helplessness  of the United Nations in Bosnia might lead to a "relapse into  the policy of strength." He demanded that the United Nations  must be strengthened and developed into a global collective  security system. At the moment, the United Nations is only a  collection of nations "whose 1945 charter has never been  implemented, because the East-West conflict interfered."    A collective security system would have been capable of  taking timely precautions against the emerging aggression of the  Serbs, Bahr says. Now the United Nations and the European Union  (EU) cannot even ensure a watertight embargo. The peace  researcher said that it is a step into the right direction that  the nations are supposed to commit themselves to providing  contingents of armed forces for blue helmet missions.</p>

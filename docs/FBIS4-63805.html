			<p>BFN     [Text] The Political Council of the National Salvation  Front (NSF) called on its supporters, the State Duma and all  public leaders and political parties to avoid moves that could  lead to the betrayal of Crimea and to work to protect the  Crimean republic and Crimean Constitution.    The NSF Political Council said a dramatic conflict was about  to erupt in Crimea and the Ukrainian leaders would be to blame  for it. The Crimeans' quest for the protection of the age-long  ties with Russia have been threatened by Kiev, the Council said.    The Russian president and government were equally  responsible  for what was happening on the peninsula. Now that Ukraine was  running up an enormous debt to Russia, the NSF Council said, the  Russian leaders could resort to absolutely reliable and peaceful  means of averting violence in Crimea.    The NSF Council declared the Crimean developments to be a  test of the patriotic declarations made by many local political  parties and movements.</p>

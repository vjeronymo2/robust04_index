			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has  stated the following:    With support and success granted by Almighty God to the  soldiers of right--the soldiers protecting unity and freedom and  safeguarding democracy and constitutional legitimacy--and under  the growing high morale of the glorious brave fighters in the  valiant Armed Forces units and their increasing confidence in  their combat capability and high efficiency in the decisive  confrontation of the gangs of apostasy and secession in the  Yemeni Socialist Party in the various axes and sectors, the  forces of unity and protection of constitutional legitimacy have  pursued their implementation of all combat missions in the  battlefields, liquidating the secessionist pockets and dens and  inflicting large losses in the weapons, vehicles, and equipment  of the gangs of the mutinous secessionist forces. Our forces  seized large quantities of military hardware at the Lahij-Abyan  axis. Combat and combing operations also achieved great  accomplishments at the Shabwah axis. The forces of unity and  protection of constitutional legitimacy purged a number of  subversive pockets in the Shabwah Governorate and seized two  Sukhoi planes at 'Ataq airport, in addition to a number of tanks  and artillery pieces and diverse military hardware.    The Faysal Rashid Brigade for air defense with missiles  joined the forces of unity and protection of constitutional  legitimacy with all its commanders, personnel, and military  hardware in an awe-inspiring situation stressing the faith of  all Yemenis in their unity and national loyalty to the  constitutional legitimacy. The Armed Forces units, the forces of  unity and protection of constitutional legitimacy, which were  advancing from al-Dali'ah and al-Mahfid at the Abyan axis,  converged with and joined the forces of unity and protection of  constitutional legitimacy in control of the Shabwah Governorate.  This reinforced the stable situation at this axis.</p>

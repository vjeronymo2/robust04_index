			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 27  January. Source is listed in parentheses following each item:    December 1993's $604 million trade surplus was the lowest in  the past six years. However, compared with 1992, the year's  surplus was positive, $13 billion. (Brasilia Radio Nacional da  Amazonia Network in Portuguese 0900 GMT 21 Jan 94)    Brazil's foreign exchange reserves at the beginning of 1994  hit a record of almost $33 billion in international liquidity.  This is an increase of more than $2 billion compared with  November 1993, when reserves stood at $31.01 billion. The surge  is due to the favorable foreign exchange rate in December 1993  resulting from the impressive flow of dollars into the country  -- $3 billion -- attracted by high interest rates and good  returns on the stock exchange. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in  Portuguese 22 Jan 94 Section 1 p 5)    According to statistics from Petrobras, Brazilian Petroleum  Corporation, national consumption of oil by-products in 1993 was  the highest in the last four years, amounting to an average  1.278 million barrels daily -- a 3.5 percent increase compared  with 1992. The highest increases were in the consumption of fuel  oil, which was up 5.7 percent, and gasoline, which rose 4.8  percent. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 24 Jan 94 p  10)</p>

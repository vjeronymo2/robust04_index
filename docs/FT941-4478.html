			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / French banks make appeal The French Association of Banks yesterday called on the government to cede control of interest rates on deposits that fund small company and home loans to the newly-independent Bank of France. The banking association said it was frustrated at the government's failure to cut these rates, and so reduce the cost of money for onward lending. Loans to small companies and house-buyers amounted to 27 per cent of all credits in the economy, it said, and were thus 'a fundamental element in the conduct of monetary policy', which was entrusted to the Bank of France in January.

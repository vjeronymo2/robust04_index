			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 29 May (PL) -- Today, the Cuban press is  spotlighting the great dangers of the illegal attempts to leave  the country through the Guantanamo naval base, which the United  States has been illegally occupying since the beginning of the  century.    In this regard, the Sunday weekly JUVENTUD REBELDE uses as  an  example the case of two people killed on 12 May while trying to  reach the U.S. military installation over land; that is, by  crossing mine fields.    According to JUVENTUD REBELDE, the bodies were found two  days  later in the area of Paraguay, a swampy area near the waters of  Guantanamo Bay where they had been led and presumably killed by  alleged guides, who, in exchange for 20,000 pesos, would  supposedly help them reach the base.    The report also adds the killers, who had already received  the money after one presented his driving license as  identification to the brother of one of the murdered  individuals, were arrested by the police and will be tried in a  court of law.    The weekly publication says Cuban authorities have  repeatedly  warned of the risk of attempting to illegally depart the country  by entering this U.S. installation, which has thousands of mines  planted around its perimeter.    The publication adds that during these illegal attempts at  emigration, the lives of those that have been lost or the bodies  that were mutilated were not only of those wishing to leave the  country but, rather, young border guards "committed more to the  safety of others than their own."    JUVENTUD REBELDE also notes that Cuban dissuasive mechanisms  will never be enough as long as the generosity with which the  United States welcomes illegal Cubans keeps boosting the  expectations of those who want to leave.    The publication goes on to explain that the legal  possibilities of leaving Cuba are limited because the U.S.  Government grants only a reduced number of visas despite an  agreement signed by the two countries in 1987 establishing the  yearly granting of 20,000 U.S. visas. In 1993, it adds, only  1,600 residents were issued U.S. immigrant visas.    According to JUVENTUD REBELDE's commentator, those same  reasons explain why, during the first months of 1994, another  1,100 Cubans left Cuba on rafts or rudimentary crafts thereby  risking their lives.</p>

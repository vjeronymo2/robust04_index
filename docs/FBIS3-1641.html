Since 1979, when Shenzhen was  authorized to become a city, the investment in capital  construction has hit 40.6 billion yuan. As a result, the urban  area has expanded to 75 square km and thousands of modern  buildings have sprung up in the urban area.    It is reported that a dozen small residential areas,  including the Yuanling, Huangmugang, Buxin, and Binsha  residential areas, have been set up in turn, with the per-capita  living space reaching 12 square meters. In 1992, residential  units measuring a total of 7.5991 million square meters were  built in Shenzhen.    Li pointed out: Shenzhen reformed the land management system  as early as 1987, and took the lead in introducing the state  land- leasing system with compensation and tenure, and in  freeing the land market. The reforms were affirmed by the  central authorities and praised by people at home and abroad.    Li maintained that the property development in Shenzhen is  relatively normal. The State Council recently sent an  inspection group to Shenzhen to find out about the property  development and the group did not make any criticism, she said.    At the seminar, Li also touched on the value-added land tax,  a matter of great public concern. All contracts signed before  promulgation of the regulations on the value-added land tax will  be implemented according to the original ordinances, she said,  adding that the Shenzhen City Government, following the  promulgation of state regulations on the value-added land tax,  will formulate detailed rules and regulations for its  implementation in accordance with state regulations and  Shenzhen's actual conditions.</p>

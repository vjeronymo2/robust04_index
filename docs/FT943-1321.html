			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Withdrawal symptoms M&amp;G is about to launch a personal equity plan with no initial charge - the second since its successful Managed Income personal equity plan in January, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Instead, M&amp;G will make its money from its annual charge of 1.5 per cent and withdrawal fees. These are intended to encourage long-term investment. You would pay 4.5 per cent for redeeming in the first year with a tapered structure of 4, 3, 2 and 1 per cent over the next four. There would be no exit charge after the fifth. The Pep is based on a new fund, Managed Growth, which will invest in other M&amp;G funds aiming for capital growth. Fidelity is aiming to go one better. From Monday, it will drop the initial charge on its Moneybuilder Pep, which does not have a withdrawal charge. Moneybuilder is also a fund of funds and is in the top five in the sector in the five, three and two years to August 1 (source: HSW; offer to bid, net income re-invested), although performance has slipped since then. Investors will have to pay an annual management fee of up to 1.75 per cent, since Fidelity is charging 0.5 per cent in addition to the annual fees of the underlying funds. Fidelity pioneered withdrawal fees in June 1992 but, along with Gartmore, dispensed with them earlier this year. But the Securities and Investments Board, the chief financial regulator, announced this week that unit trusts will be able to impose exit charges from November 1 (previously the trust had to be within a Pep to be able to do so), a move which the industry welcomes as giving it more flexibility. Unit trusts will not be able to charge more, though: a combination of initial and exit fees must not exceed more than the present maximum of 7 per cent initial charge.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Dun &amp; Bradstreet net increases to Dollars 128.8m DUN &amp; BRADSTREET, a leading US business information group, yesterday posted second-quarter net income of Dollars 128.8m, or 72 cents a share, compared with Dollars 119.1m, or 67 cents, a year ago. The company has restated its 1991 results to reflect new accounting standards and the recognition of revenue for software services. Revenues eased slightly to Dollars 1.16bn from Dollars 1.17bn, reflecting the divestiture of the communications unit of the company's IMS International division. Revenue growth for Dun &amp; Bradstreet's current portfolio of businesses rose about 3 per cent in the quarter. For the first six months, the company had net income of Dollars 227m, or Dollars 1.27, against Dollars 217.5m, or Dollars 1.22 a year earlier. Operating revenue slipped to Dollars 2.27bn from Dollars 2.29bn. The company said it texpected growth for the year to exceed that of 1991, but did not expect to 'get all the way to Dun &amp; Bradstreet's long-term goals'. It also expects second-half earnings per share to be stronger than in the first half in spite of the uncertain worldwide economic outlook.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Essence of the Accord on Afrikaner Self-Determination" </F> signed by the Freedom Front, the ANC, and the South African  Government/National Party; issued by the Ministry of  Constitutional Development and Communication on the SAPA PR Wire  Service on 23 April]    [Text] 1. Introduction    The accord must not be seen in isolation but in conjunction  with Constitutional Principle XXXIV, Chapter 11a: Volkstaat  [homeland] Council of the Constitution of the Republic of South  Africa, Act 200 of 1993, the unsigned memorandum of agreement  between the ANC and the AVF [Afrikaner National Front], dated  December 21 1993, the Guidelines for the deliberations of the  Volkstaat Council, as well as the unmandated defining statement  on the principle of self- determination.    2. The essence of this package is the following:    Constitutional provision is now made for any community  sharing a common cultural and language heritage, whether in a  territorial entity or in any other recognised way.    The final constitution may now give expression to any  particular form of self-determination provided there is  substantial proven support within the community for such a form  of self-determination.    A constitutional body, the Volkstaat Council consisting of  20  members is established. The Volkstaat Council shall serve as a  constitutional mechanism to enable proponents of the volkstaat  to constitutionally pursue the establishment of such a volkstaat.    The Volkstaat Council shall be competent to gather, process  and make available information with regards to:     -  possible boundaries,    -  powers and functions,    -  legislative, executive and other structures at national and  provincial level, and    -  any other matter directly relevant to the establishment of  such  a volkstaat.       To make feasibility and other relevant studies with regard  to  the above.    The Volkstaat Council is elected by members of Parliament  who  support the establishment of a volkstaat. The following  procedure will be followed by the Freedom Front in the  appointment of the said council:     -  the public will be invited to nominate suitable candidates  for appointment to the council.    -  a short list of possible oppointees will be drawn up by a  panel.    -  after formal hearings and interviews, twenty experts in their  fields will be appointed as councillors.       The procedures provided for in the constitution with regard  to the finalisation of present provincial boundaries shall not  be construed as precluding the establishment of a volkstaat.    Proposals for self-determination of local communities  through  community councils or structures modelled along the lines of  similar structures and processes in other parts of the world  could be considered.    A national advisory body attached to the Volkstaat Council  and constituted by twenty five representatives elected by local  communities in the different provinces, supporting the ideal of  self-determination in a volkstaat, could be established.    In the event of the realisation of a volkstaat, this body  will represent the respective communities within the volksraad  of such a volkstaat.    Citizenship intended for persons residing in a possible  volkstaat will not be racially based and shall be compatible  with internationally accepted norms.    The accord makes specific provision for the following:    The parties commit themselves to further negotiations also  after the election to address the ideal of Afrikaner  self-determination including the concept of a volkstaat.    The possibility of local and/or regional and other  expressions of such self-determination will also be considered.    Support for the ideal of self-determination in a volkstaat  will be indicated by the electoral support which parties with  a specific mandate to pursue the realisation of a volkstaat will  gain in the forthcoming election.    To facilitate the consideration of the volkstaat after the  elections, electoral support should not only be measured  nationally, but also by counting the provincial votes at the  level of:    The electoral district; and the polling station as indicated  by the parties.    The Volkstaatraad [Volkstaat Council] shall form such  advisory bodies as it may determine.    The parties further undertake to discuss and reach agreement  on matters such as stability in the agricultural sector and  indemnity as well as other outstanding issues which could  include international mediation to help resolve these matters.</p>

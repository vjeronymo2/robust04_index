			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Long View: Fighting for dividends News again. Paddy Linaker, managing director of the M &amp; G unit trust group, has sprung to their defence, alarmed at suggestions that the Treasury might be considering anti-dividend measures as a result of its review of government policies on savings and investment flows. The City must stand up and fight for high payouts, said Linaker this week. Political worries apart, he ought to be quite pleased at how the dividend flows are improving. Payouts by UK listed companies stood still for three years up to 1993, with a final blow (for pension funds, charities and holders of personal equity plans, at least) from the reduction in reclaimable dividend tax imposed in the March 1993 Budget. But over the past year dividends have risen by 6 per cent, by 2 1/2 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 alone, and hopes in the City extend as far as annual growth of 10 per cent in the next year or two. Dividends are important to financial institutions in the UK. Pension funds were badly affected by last year's tax problem, because actuaries normally value them on the basis of their current income and its expected growth. So although the market value of pension funds rose by an average 29 per cent the actuarial values may not have improved at all. As for unit trusts, groups such as Linaker's rely heavily on selling funds that offer healthily growing income. But the dividend of the average UK equity income unit trust dropped by more than 10 per cent last year. This week's rise in gilt-edged yields to 8 per cent provides a further reminder of the challenge to equity income funds. In a low inflation environment fixed interest investments will become more attractive. Certainly, there needs to be a prospect of strong dividend growth to justify the current ratio of nearly 2.2 between long-term gilt yields and the average income from equities. Inflation down to about 2.5 per cent certainly provides no excuse for big dividend rises. Profits are strongly up, but it had been expected that finance directors might be keen to rebuild their companies' dividend cover before embarking on large increases: cover was about 2.5 times on average in the mid-1980s when payouts were surging, but is now about 1.6 times. Moreover, companies no longer suffer from the takeover fears that motivated much of the generosity to shareholders at the end of the 1980s when annual dividend growth reached 15-20 per cent. So why are the corporate purse strings being loosened? Is it because executive directors are so loaded up these days with stock options? Maybe, but it is also apparent that British companies are feeling well off, having moved back into financial surplus and refinanced their excessive debt burden. In fact, argues an interesting research study from Barclays de Zoete Wedd, low inflation has raised the quality of company earnings; there is no longer a big gap between historical cost and profits. So companies can reduce their payout ratios without fear of overdistribution - that is, of the erosion of the real capital base of the company. However, high dividends do not always please. Look at the case of Glaxo, which has increased its payout by 57 per cent over the past two years but which has suffered a share price drop of 44 per cent relative to the All-Share Index over that period. If higher current dividends reflect deteriorating future growth prospects, as they do at Glaxo, which cannot see a way of investing its enormous cash flow profitably, a derating will take place. Growth, dividends and share prices are therefore linked in a complex way. If more dividends now mean less in the future, the stock market is not going to be pleased. The political debate, meanwhile, is focused on the relatively low level of capital investment in the UK. At one level the politicians want to see more investment because this will raise output and create jobs. But the government has another agenda: pressed for revenue, it will be tempted to increase the taxes on the corporate sector over the next few years. This is partly because corporate incomes have been rising at 15 per cent year-on-year against 4 per cent for personal incomes. It is also because, in the context of a general election due in 1996 or 1997, companies do not have votes. The change to dividend tax has already raised money, but rather thoughtlessly, because it has undermined the Conservative philosophy of the 1980s that tax should have a neutral impact on whether profits are retained or distributed. In fact, for dividends paid after April 5 this year and received by a 40 per cent taxpayer, the total tax paid on the underlying company profits will be 66 1/2 per cent against 33 per cent if the profits were retained. A justification for high payouts can be that they facilitate the recycling of resources from wealthy, established companies with surplus revenues, such as Glaxo, to rapidly expanding industries where investment needs are high. Plainly, tax interferes with this process of redistribution via shareholders. The dividend tax change will be worth Pounds 1bn a year, so institutional investors are worried that the Treasury might use its savings review as a smokescreen to justify further moves in the same direction, with the tax credit falling to 15 or even 10 per cent. The motive would be to raise revenue, but the excuse would be that excessive distributions should be discouraged. The circuitous excuse given by Norman Lamont last time was that companies would be helped by the change because their cash flow would benefit through the partial switch from advance corporation tax (paid early with the dividends) to mainstream tax (paid later). As it happens, companies are no longer short of cash. Linaker may see it differently, but companies just might find it politically prudent to keep their dividend rises modest this year.</p>

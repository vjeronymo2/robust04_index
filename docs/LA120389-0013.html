			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE GARDEN STATE BY GARY KRIST (VINTAGE: $7.95)  </P> <P> Fresh, wryly funny stories of life in the less fashionable stretches of the  Eastern Seaboard. A high school student who gets a job writing eulogies for  strangers becomes so enamored of his own prose, he begins recreating people's  lives in his own image in "How I Learned to Raise the Dead of Bergen County."  In "The Tribes of Northern New Jersey," another student finds himself caught in  between his divorced parents, whose behavior has become as ritualized as native  warfare in New Guinea. Absurd yet frequently poignant, "The Garden State" is an  impressive debut by a talented writer.  </P></p>

Miscellaneous Expenses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6.1&blank;Component Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Miscellaneous Expense component consists primarily of four unrelated groups of expenses:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;medical care,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;contributions (including gifts to non-family members),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;personal insurance, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;savings and investments (including pensions).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer believes that certain miscellaneous expense items should not affect living-cost measures between locations. For example, Runzheimer considers charitable contributions a personal choice, so we include this expenditure as a constant amount in all locations. Based on research into all of the expenses of this component, Runzheimer also regards expenses related to personal insurance, savings and investments, and pensions as constants, for reasons discussed in section 6.2.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To measure the miscellaneous expenses, Runzheimer constructed a pricing methodology similar to the one used in the Goods &amp; Services component. Runzheimer selected representative items for medical care, priced them in all areas, and then computed a Miscellaneous Expense component index based on the relative importance of costed items and categories held constant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6.2&blank;Miscellaneous Expense Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.2.1&blank;Expenditure Research  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> From the 1988 CES, Runzheimer tabulated the miscellaneous expense data into logical expense groupings and then determined the appropriate item weighing. The table on the following page lists the categories that Runzheimer selected to price and their weights:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L2,i1,s100,12,12,12 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Miscellaneous Expense Categories &amp; Weights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Categories <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Income Level  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Lower (percent) <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Middle (percent) <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Upper (percent) <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> Medical Care <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 43.41 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 31.56 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 22.40 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contributions (including gifts)* <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 12.38 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 14.90 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 16.85 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Personal Insurance &amp; Pensions* <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 44.21 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 53.54 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 60.75 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=4 --> Totals <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 100.00 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 100.00 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 100.00 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> *Held constant. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 6.2.2&blank;Miscellaneous Expense Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As stated in section 2.2, Runzheimer used the Laspeyres indexing methodology to compute the Miscellaneous Expense component index. For groups of items held constant, the model assumed a price ratio between the allowance area and the Washington, D.C., area equal to 100.00%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer defined personal insurance and pensions as the portion of a family's budget that was targeted for long-term financial security. This is consistent with the definitions used by the CES, the results of which are used as weights in the COLA model. In the CES, money stored in a savings or investment vehicle for future expenditures (of goods and services, housing, or transportation) is accounted for in the other component weightings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In section 6.1, we noted that expenses related to personal insurance were held constant for all locations. This was based on information received from life insurance companies and OPM officials. The life insurance companies contacted indicated that policies written (and premiums charged) to persons within the United States and its territories did not vary due to location. Runzheimer's research and discussions with OPM officials also indicated that, in general, federal employees in all areas received similar or identical benefits packages_any variations were due to personal preference. Therefore, Runzheimer believed, and OPM concurred, that holding these types of expenses constant was appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

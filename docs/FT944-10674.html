			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (1): A coming of age as a shadow is lifted  -Hugh Carnegy assesses the impact of the country's significant decision last month to vote in favour of joining the European Union On October 16, as the first snows of the long Nordic winter fell across much of the country, Finland accepted the most important change in the political alignment of the nation since it achieved independence from Russia in 1917 when the electorate voted in favour of joining the European Union. The referendum result - acceptance of membership by a margin of 56.9 per cent to 43.1 per cent - was decisive without being overwhelming. There was little sense of drama on the day and no jubilation when the outcome was announced. Indeed, there was considerable disquiet over the way the issue had divided the country between the more urbanised south, which voted heavily Yes, and the rural, remote central and northern regions, which voted No. But the decision was welcomed with satisfaction and relief by the vast majority of Finland's political establishment, the leaders of industry and the trade unions and the nation's media. After Finland's uncomfortable neutrality in the shadow of the Soviet Union since the second world war and the hardest recession since the 1930s, stepping into the EU fold is regarded by its supporters as a vital step towards long-term strategic and economic stability. 'It is a coming of age for Finland,' declared Mr Paavo Lipponen, leader of the opposition Social Democratic party and, if the opinion polls are right, the man who will be prime minister after the general election next March. For the European Union, too, Finland's entry will be a significant moment. The EU will acquire its first direct frontier with Russia in the form of the 1,270km-long Finnish-Russian border. EU territory will extend for the first time into the Arctic Circle, taking in expansive forestry resources - which will be even greater if Sweden and Norway also join. Some uncertainties persist which contributed to the subdued mood after the referendum. Finland will be deeply disappointed if its Nordic neighbours, with which it worked closely as they all pursued their EU applications last year, vote against membership in the Swedish and Norwegian referendums on November 13 and 28 respectively. Opponents of membership also mounted a tenacious filibuster to postpone this week's scheduled parliamentary vote needed to confirm accession until after Sweden's referendum in the hope that a Swedish No might swing enough MPs to form a blocking one-third minority. But if the government wins, as expected, Finland will join Austria as a new member of the EU on January 1 next year. What will membership mean for Finland? In economic terms, there are some immediate difficulties which, again, were part of the reason why the country reacted coolly to its decision. Above all, joining the EU is set to trigger a fall in incomes of up to 45 per cent over the next few years for Finland's influential farmers. Helsinki has long subsidised agriculture at levels well above those provided by the EU, partly to ensure the continued population of rural areas and partly as a political pay-off for support from rural communities. But under the terms of its accession agreement, Finland must adjust immediately to the farm price regime of the common agricultural policy. Brussels rejected Helsinki's demand that the whole country be treated as a special case for subsidies because of its harsh climate. A national package of transitional supports has been outlined, but its cost, on top of Finland's 'membership fee' will add FM10bn to government spending next year, deepening the budget deficit. As a member already of the European Economic Area agreement, Finland will not achieve any significant immediate economic benefit from membership, apart from the removal of customs barriers with the EU. But the strong belief in government and industry is that membership of the EU will serve to underpin Finland's economy just as it is pulling out of a severe recession. Between 1990 and 1993, the economy shrank by some 15 per cent following the collapse of the Soviet Union (with which Finland enjoyed lucrative trade ties), the impact of the international recession and the collapse of a credit boom at home. Unemployment neared 20 per cent of the workforce. An export-led recovery is now under way, producing growth this year of some 4 per cent and probably more than 5 per cent in 1995. The hope is that EU membership will help foster confidence in the economy both at home and abroad, ease long-term interest rates which presently stand at around 10 per cent and generate a much-needed revival of investment and consumption. On the strategic front, joining the EU is of great significance for Finland, which was ruled for centuries by Sweden and then by Czarist Russia. Finland's 77 years of independence have been marked first by conflict and subsequently by cold war tensions. Finland fought several bloody wars to preserve its independence, first a battle against the nascent Soviet Union complicated by a simultaneous virtual civil war and then, during the second world war, an awkward struggle initially against Moscow and then against Nazi Germany. In the post-war period, Helsinki adopted a neutral stance in which it maintained a delicate balance between its capitalist economic and instinctive cultural ties to the west and its pragmatic political and trading ties with the Soviets. Now, Finland is taking advantage of the changed circumstances brought about by the disappearance of the Soviet Union to move firmly into the west's political and strategic orbit as an insurance policy against future threats from Russia. 'No one can say Russia is a country of stability today. There is a certain hazard in Russia today, so it is a question of security,' says Mr Pertti Salolainen, deputy prime minister in the centre-right government of Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister. 'The mere fact of being a member of the EU will give security because then you are untouchable militarily - with out having to make any new military arrangements. The EU could never accept any aggression against one of its members,' says Mr Salolainen. Nevertheless, Finland is treading cautiously over its strategic and military future. Helsinki has joined Nato's Partnership for Peace initiative. Mr Aho says the country will take up observer status in the Western European Union. In addition, Finland will participate in the EU's move under the Maastricht Treaty towards a common foreign and security policy. But Mr Aho, mindful of Russia's continued sensibilities about the stance of a neighbour that commands the Baltic approaches to St Petersburg, says Helsinki does not intend a sudden change in Finland's military stance. 'It is in the interests of the EU that the present stability in this part of the continent be preserved. We have no intention of changing this stability and that is why we have no intention of changing our basic political orientation,' Mr Aho said last month. Instead, the prime minister likes to stress the opportunities for Finland, Russia and the EU offered by Finnish membership. He sees Finland acting as a conduit for increased trading and political links between Brussels and Moscow. 'Our skills and experience in dealing with Russia will be at the disposal of the EU for the development of the Russian economy,' he says. As for Finland's stance in the evolving debate over the future structures of the EU, both Mr Aho, leader of the rurally-based Centre party, and Mr Lipponen say Finland will play a pragmatic role. It has accepted the Maastricht Treaty with its plans for European Monetary Union and closer political co-operation. Although some way from meeting EMU convergence targets because of the size of its public debt and budget deficit, Helsinki is committed to achieving them. For the time being, however, all the main political parties are being careful not to become identified as belonging either to the federalist camp within the EU or the anti-federalist camp. Mr Lipponen accepts that if EMU occurs it will require closer political ties, but he, like the prime minister, stresses the importance of avoiding over-centralisation and, above all, of protecting the interests and influence of the smaller nations. In this approach, Finland will undoubtedly be joined by Sweden and Norway if they also become members. With Denmark, they would form a Nordic bloc, which is likely instinctively to resist federalist pressures. But Finland is not comfortable with talk of different grades of membership according to a willingness to push towards federal structures. Mr Salolainen, who as trade minister was one of Finland's negotiators with Brussels, put it thus: 'They may be onion rings in the European Union, but from the outset we do not accept a situation where certain countries constitute a core and the others are outside. There must be organic development that is not artificial or imposed.'</p>

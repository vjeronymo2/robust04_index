			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski, a leader of the </F> Democratic Left Alliance, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio  Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live]    [Excerpts] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is  Aleksander Kwasniewski, a leader of the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD]. Good morning to you, Sir.    [Kwasniewski] Good morning.    [Woyciechowski] I have read all of the press commentaries  after yesterday's historical meeting between the SLD Sejm  deputies and the president, and there are two titles: GAZETA  WYBORCZA says "Cease-Fire," whereas TRYBUNA says "Agreement,  Agreement, Agreement." Is it more like a cease-fire or more  like an agreement?    [Kwasniewski] I certainly would hesitate to say that this  was a historical meeting because I would rather reserve such  assessments for a few months from now. But what definitely did  happen was the establishment of contact between the SLD Sejm  Deputies Club and the president. Such contact was missing for a  long time, and, if there was any, it was just through the press  and in a rather sharp tone, too. I believe the meeting may be  more like a cease-fire as far as political issues are concerned  in 1994, and also the possibility of focusing on the most  important issues like preparing a constitution and necessary  economic measures. I think there is agreement on some detailed  issues. I mean we came to an agreement about the coalition's  participation in the presidential ministries and also a certain  procedure associated with the issue of the finance minister. So  I think that on these specific issues... [Kwasniewski pauses]  We also agreed on cooperation regarding constitutional issues.  So on these issues, there is agreement.    [Woyciechowski] A cease-fire is something where people shoot  at each other and then say: Why don't we stop for a moment  before we resume shooting?    [Kwasniewski] You know, I think the conversation was  important and honest because, among other things, neither side  has any illusions; by the way, I began the meeting by saying  this. The SLD is made up of a group of people and voters who  have never voted for Lech Walesa, neither in Solidarity times  nor in political times [sentence as heard]. On the other hand,  Lech Walesa, coming as he does from a different camp, has never  spared his remarks addressed at us, which were often very  critical or, I would even say, malicious. And this situation is  a fact and nobody can expect that even if very close cooperation  takes place, there will be feelings--love or falling in love.  But what is important is that, as a result of democratic  decisions after 1993, both the president, who was elected in  1990, and we, who constitute the coalition's main core after  1993, are burdened with responsibility. This was a conversation  between partners who are aware of the responsibility and who are  aware that people do not wake up in the morning to read about  new conflicts at the top of the power structure, but they would  like to wake up in the morning to good music and positive news,  then go to work in peace and return from work with a feeling of  safety. It would be good to have a job at all. [passage  omitted]    [Woyciechowski] Having seen the short pieces on the  television newscast last night--we could see a very cordial  atmosphere, laughter and relaxation--does that mean that Sejm  deputies for the SLD, those who were there and their electorate,  will vote for Lech Walesa in the next presidential election, or  will they vote for Aleksander Kwasniewski?    [Kwasniewski] You know, I think your forecasts are too  far-reaching. Let me begin with yesterday's atmosphere. I  think it was one of [hesitating] seriousness. The questions were  tough, and part of the meeting was conducted in silence, which  is hard to....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And the television did not  show that?    [Kwasniewski] I do not know what it showed. I have not seen  it. The meeting lasted almost two hours, so I do not think that  the television could have shown it in its entirety. But one  must remember that holding the audience's complete silence and  interest, where you have 200 Sejm deputies plus about 100  journalists and television teams--that is not easy to do. There  were moments of very serious conversation. [passage omitted]    As far as the presidential elections are concerned, I think  that--by the way, this was the goal behind the meeting--the  election campaign should not start too early unnecessarily. We  are condemned to it, anyway--I mean in a positive sense--in  1995, which is the scheduled time for the presidential  elections. I think it is unavoidable that, just like any other  political campaign, this one will be filled with confrontation,  disputes, and strong words. I would also like the campaign to be  about merits, but I realize that such appeals often are really  wishful thinking instead of having to do with reality. It would  be good if the campaign were to begin at a specific point in  time, not sooner than....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] It has already begun at a  certain point in time--several months ago. Who initiated the  campaign?    [Kwasniewski] I think the campaign is a result of the fact  that one person in Poland is determined, and it is no wonder. I  mean Lech Walesa, who is eager to be reelected. He spoke out  about it for quite a long time yesterday. And he spoke in a  tone of self-confidence, saying that he at least has no doubt  that he will indeed be reelected president. But he did speak  about some seven years many times, so I am not sure how to...  [Kwasniewski pauses] I think he meant seven years from today.  From time to time, he mentioned seven years, so it was clear  that he is interested in both a full implementation of his tasks  in the current term, which is quite understandable, and in  running in the 1995 election. But, like I said, the goal behind  the meeting was to have 1994....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And what about yourself?  Would you like to be president?    [Kwasniewski] I have spoken about this many times before.  On this issue, neither I nor my political party has made any  decision yet. Of course, we are not blind. We can see that  there are all sorts of opinion polls published in which my name  appears. Of course, I would be lying if I said it gives me no  satisfaction that I rank high or even in first place. But I  want to be clear on that: I have not made any decision, and I  think that a year in Poland--and this is what is needed more or  less to make a real decision on initiating the presidential  campaign--is such a long time that there will be all kinds of  events that will either increase such [hesitating] pressures on  me or will weaken them and my readiness to make the decision.  That is why I do not discuss this right now at all, and I admit  quite frankly that I go to sleep without dreaming about the  presidency, and I wake up after a good night's sleep also  without thinking about the presidency. There are simply other  issues I think are more urgent right now.    [Woyciechowski] How do you evaluate the results of the  meeting now that more than 10 hours have elapsed? Are you  satisfied with the results?    [Kwasniewski] I believe that the most important thing that  was achieved was the return to communication between the  president and....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That simply means talking,  something that has been missing for how long?    [Kwasniewski] Well, as a matter of fact, I have not had the  opportunity to talk with the president since the Sejm and the  Senate started their work. It was our last meeting. After  that, we had contacts related to all kinds of state celebrations  or other; however, these were not occasions to hold talks.  Thus, communication was established, and, in my opinion, it is  the most important thing. As I said, as a consequence of the  elections, both the president and we--participants of the  coalition--bear responsibility for the same. I have often  opposed, also here at Radio Zet, the concept, imposed by some  advisers of the president, that the president is in opposition  to the coalition. This is impossible. We are in the same  configuration of power of the very same state. Therefore, it is  impossible to... [Kwasniewski pauses] The president may  cooperate with us well or not so well. He may or may not like  the coalition. However, we are obliged by the Constitution to  cooperate with one another. Thus, in this sense, there is a  chance to improve cooperation, to make it more efficient, to  avoid conflicts.    [Woyciechowski] Yesterday afternoon, after this two-hour  meeting with the entire Parliamentary Club of the SLD, a  face-to-face meeting, as the press called it, was held between  you and the president. Was it really a face-to-face meeting,  between you and the president only, or were there also  presidential ministers and your SLD colleagues at the meeting?    [Kwasniewski] It was a meeting between only the president  and me. I think that....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Without a microphone,  without....    [Kwasniewski, interrupting] That is right. I think it was a  face-to-face meeting, that is certain. Now, I can only hope  that no one heard that, but I cannot bet on that....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] How long did the talk last?    [Kwasniewski] Probably a half-hour or so.    [Woyciechowski] Did you drink coffee, mineral water, or  something better?    [Kwasniewski] No, no, there was nothing better. There was  no coffee or mineral water, either. It was a talk during which  we tried to come to agreement on....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What was the talk about?    [Kwasniewski] First of all, about what the channels of  cooperation and information should look like. Aside from that,  there were also a few other issues that we discussed. However,  it was a face-to-face talk, with no witnesses, so I believe that  this must be borne in mind.    [Woyciechowski] It was a confidential talk, and you cannot  speak about it. Do I understand you correctly?    [Kwasniewski] Well, it was not confidential. I think that  sometimes such talks are held between people, and they want to  discuss certain issues between themselves. This is actually  what happened. Now, because it was a talk after a longer period  of not talking, the meeting was all the more important. That  is, at least I attach great importance to this talk. I believe  that such talks with the president will be held now and then. I  would really like that.    [Woyciechowski] What did Walesa really promise the SLD  yesterday afternoon, or last night?    [Kwasniewski] This was a public meeting, and we not only can  but also should discuss it. I believe that among the elements  that were agreed upon... [Kwasniewski pauses] elements about  which, one can say, there is agreement, is first of all that a  very important issue, or even the most important issue, in 1994  will be to prepare the constitution jointly.    [Woyciechowski] That means that the Small Constitution will  not be amended after all?    [Kwasniewski] No. The Small Constitution is the second  stage here, as it were. This means that we cooperate in line  with the existing law within the framework of the Constitutional  Committee of the National Assembly. Participating in it will  also be representatives of the president. They will propose  their ideas and concepts. This is their inalienable right. I  believe that we will try to....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That means that the year 1994  will be the year of the constitution?    [Kwasniewski] That is right. I would....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] When will the constitution be  adopted? In December?    [Kwasniewski] I believe that December is a good time--before  Christmas. It is a good idea to finish this year with something  very specific....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And, until that time, the  Small Constitution will not be amended?    [Kwasniewski] I will even say more. I believe--and this is  how I understand our joint decisions of yesterday--that we will  not change the Small Constitution at all, and, without any  changes, it will exist until the new constitution is adopted.  We can imagine that, because rather little time will elapse  from December, when the constitution will be adopted, to  March--that is, to the nationwide referendum--I believe that we  should not really make any experiments with the Small  Constitution. Now, all of the correct motions... [Kwasniewski  pauses] Because many motions are correct, I believe that even  the recently discussed deputies' motion is rational. I think  that these motions should be discussed during work on the big  constitution.    [Woyciechowski] As you say all this, these are all enormous  decisions, of historical importance. These decisions were made  by the president on the one hand and the SLD club on the other.  What will happen if the club of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]  does not agree to that?    [Kwasniewski] Well, I do not think we should fear that  because we happen to have identical views on the issue of the  constitution. The cooperation that we have had so far with the  PSL club has been absolutely full, and I cannot see any dangers  here. However, I think it is really important to finish the  work on the constitution after five years of talking about it.  The participation of the parliament and the president, as well  as our invitation of other, extraparliamentary groupings--all  this creates the indispensable infrastructure to finally do  this, to present it to the people. The nation should decide  whether it accepts or rejects this constitution. The point is  that we are finally discussing specifics; so far, we have been  wondering how the constitution should be prepared, but we have  not been discussing the heart of the matter--we have not been  discussing the constitution.    [Woyciechowski] What else did Walesa promise? The  presidential ministries--the Ministry of National Defense [MON]  and the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW]?    [Kwasniewski] That is right. That is....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] These will be deputy ministers  who... [Woyciechowski pauses] They will be there but they will  do nothing?    [Kwasniewski] I believe that these comments are entirely  unfounded. If there were to be ministers who dealt with  nothing, I would have to say that we are not supporters of  wasting taxpayers' money in such a silly way. We have proposed  this concept all along. It has now been most fully included in  the proposals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ]. It lies  in the following....[Kwasniewski pauses] and I believe that it  is the direction of changes in the state administration in  general. We have a group of civil servants who have signed  contracts, who cannot be removed as the government changes.  However, there is also a political group--the minister and his  deputies, who come and go as governments change. In the  presidential ministries, it would look like this: The  minister--that is, the number-one person--is a man who is agreed  upon with the president and his deputies, who deal with various  issues, but who also participate in preparing the strategy of  the ministry....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In other words, they know  everything that is happening....    [Kwasniewski, interrupting] They both know it and exert  influence on it, and they can....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] They are members of the  coalition. What will it be like? MON and the MSW. Where will a  PSL man go, and where will an SLD man go? Has this been  established?    [Kwasniewski] No, it has not. I believe that the  construction proposed in the MSZ is available to both coalition  members; this means that such representatives will be appointed  by both parties, and they will be in all three ministries.    [Woyciechowski] The last issue: Rosati. Will Rosati  certainly not be the finance minister? Will Borowski return?    [Kwasniewski] I want to say one thing. I also discussed  this with the president during a private moment in the meeting.  It would be very bad if the issue of Professor Rosati ended up  in an unclear atmosphere that is related to slander. One of the  questions was: Can decisions be based on slander? Incidentally,  the president is a man who has often been slandered himself.  Thus, caution and, first of all, protection of a good name  should be required here. I believe that, in this sense, it  should be stated clearly that Prof. Rosati is an honest and  competent person, whose abilities should be taken advantage of  in Poland. Of course, one can discuss whether today's political  configuration allows us to do this. A lot seems to suggest that  it is not this moment. However, I want to say clearly that Prof.  Rosati is an outstanding man, and I believe that we will be able  to take advantage of his talent more than once. Now, as for  filling the post in the Finance Ministry, the issue is  definitely becoming increasingly urgent. [passage omitted]    [Woyciechowski] If I understand you correctly, after  Rosati's candidacy, there will be no other candidates. For the  time being, Borowski, and then we will see. Did I get you right?    [Kwasniewski] I believe that very serious talks will be held  on this issue very soon. This should be dealt with. As the  recent developments, such as the issue of the popiwek [tax on  excessive wage increases] have shown, there must be a person  coordinating the economic issues who would make risky and  difficult decisions. It is good that the economy is working as  it is without the finance minister, but, really, we all need  real decisions, made by someone, to feel better. I often find  myself in a situation of a man who is supposed to make decisions  but who does not have the necessary information and knowledge on  a given issue.    [Woyciechowski] The last question: What will the situation  be like in Poland over the next few months? Will it be peaceful?    [Kwasniewski] I believe it will. I believe that we have  ensured at least several months of peace, concentration on  economic issues and the constitution. However, we will also have  elections on 19 June. These will be local elections, so they  will certainly not whip up great political emotions.  Nonetheless, they will make our lives more colorful until the  summer holidays.    [Woyciechowski] If there are going to be a few months of  peace, was yesterday's meeting historical or not?    [Kwasniewski] If we manage to end 1994 with the  constitution, and if we manage to avoid many disputes at a time,  I believe it was an important meeting. Now, whether this was a  historic meeting--I am rather cautious about such evaluations.  I hope it was.    [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview.    [Kwasniewski] Thank you very much.</p>

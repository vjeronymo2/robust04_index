			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S NEW BALLGAME IN BATTING CAGE DISPUTE;  </P> <P> NOISE: CITY ATTORNEYS DROP THE CHARGES BECAUSE THEY SAY THE REGULATION IS  OUTDATED. BUT THEY MAY FILE A NEW COMPLAINT AFTER THE ORDINANCE IS REVISED.  </P> <P> City attorneys on Wednesday dropped noise-level violation charges against the  owner of a Glendale batting center, saying the city's law regulating noise is  too outdated.  </P> <P> But prosecutors said they will file new charges if the batting cages violate an  updated ordinance expected to be drafted by Friday.  </P> <P> In exchange for the dismissal of the charges, David Johnson, owner of the  Glendale Batting Cage, agreed to pay $1,152 to cover some of the costs the city  incurred in the case, said Ron Braden, senior assistant city attorney.  </P> <P> Two misdemeanor counts of violating the city's noise limits were filed in  January against Johnson after apartment dwellers behind the batting center  complained to city officials. Two charges of displaying an illegal advertising  sign and operating an illegal snack bar also were filed.  </P> <P> All four charges were dropped Wednesday. Johnson acquired a permit for the sign  and closed the snack bar, Braden said. He said the noise violations were  dropped because the ordinance, enacted in the early 1960s, specified outdated  noise measurement methods.  </P> <P> Robert DePiano, Johnson's attorney, said Johnson has reduced noise by shutting  down two batting cages closest to neighbors, covering metal surfaces frequently  struck by baseballs and using quieter foam-filled bats and balls. Johnson will  also meet soon with disgruntled neighbors to discuss the conflict, DePiano  said.  </P> <P> But, he added, Johnson maintains that he never violated noise levels.  </P> <P> "I feel bad for my client in this case because he has spent thousands and  thousands of dollars showing the city they made a mistake," DePiano said.  </P> <P> Braden said it is uncertain whether those modifications brought the cages into  compliance with the current ordinance because officials have not tested the  cages since the charges were filed. But the facility most likely will be tested  again once a new ordinance is drafted and approved by the City Council, he  said.  </P> <P> Residents said Wednesday that they are upset by the agreement between Johnson  and the city. They said they are considering legal action to compel city  attorneys to enforce the current ordinance and prosecute Johnson. They also  said they will press for new noise-violation charges against the owner once an  updated ordinance is in place.  </P> <P> The dismissal of the charges "had all been agreed to privately, behind closed  doors, without any consultation with the complaining parties," said Robert  Paone, who lives in an apartment building behind the batting cages. "The noise  situation has hardly abated."  </P></p>

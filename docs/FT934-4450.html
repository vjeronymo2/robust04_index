			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Severn Trent held back by decline in demand Severn Trent, the privatised water utility, yesterday announced interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 146.9m, held back by a decline in demand from commercial and industrial customers and higher interest charges. Pre-tax profits were 4.3 per cent higher than last year's reported Pounds 140.8m. However, on a comparable basis following accounting changes last year, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 148.3m. Turnover for the six months to September 30 rose by 6.7 per cent to Pounds 489.8m. Interest charges were more than doubled at Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 11m). Mr Roderick Paul, chief executive, said the results reflected 'tight cost controls in the business'. Direct operating costs, excluding East Worcester Water, the recently acquired supplier, were 1.3 per cent lower in the first half. Mr Paul said Biffa, the waste management company acquired for Pounds 212m in 1991, had contributed operating profits 10 per cent higher at Pounds 6.6m. Turnover was 15 per cent up at Pounds 58.1m. Biffa was, however, still some way from covering interim interest costs of about Pounds 12m. The other non-regulated businesses declined at the operating level from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 600,000. Mr Paul said this was largely due to Pounds 1.2m in marketing costs for the international operation. The core UK regulated water business benefited from cost cutting and production efficiencies, contributing a 12 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 167m. Sales were 5 per cent up at Pounds 394.1m. Severn suffered an 8 per cent fall in consumption by its top 1,500 commercial customers. Capital expenditure of Pounds 470m was budgeted this year, down from Pounds 550m, with a further decline to roughly Pounds 400m next year. The interim dividend is lifted to 7.55p (7p), payable from earnings 5 per cent higher at 39.4p. COMMENT The good news came where least expected at Severn Trent. Biffa, long the focus of unhappy controversy over the price paid and onerous financing commitments, appears to have more than held its own; at least, compared with Shanks &amp; McEwan. Still, cynics argue any contribution after financing costs could be up to a decade away. The decline in operating costs was expected, but could work against Severn in the price review next year. There is a possibility that Ofwat will squeeze the efficient Severn harder to allow others with greater commitments leeway. Given such uncertainties, Severn appears fully valued. Full-year forecasts are for Pounds 275m pre-tax, with a dividend of 22.8p.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Asean free trade zone sputters into action WITH less fanfare than Europe or North America, the six members of the Association of South East Asian Nations this year began to build their own free trade zone. It was easy to see why the first steps towards the Asean free trade area, or Afta, were not exactly trumpeted abroad. Asean countries - Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei - regard Afta and its 320m inhabitants as a future counterweight to other international trade blocs and as a way to expose their domestic industries to healthy regional competition. But the reality is that they do most of their trade with Europe, Japan and the US and not with each other. If entrepot trade with Singapore is excluded, Asean countries conduct only about 5 per cent of their trade with their Asean partners. And although the Afta ideal is progressively to reduce mutual tariffs on all goods except agricultural products to between 0 and 5 per cent within 15 years, the agreement is undermined by clauses allowing each country to exclude any industries that it wants to continue to protect. The Asean members have announced lists of hundreds of products which they are exempting from the normal track of tariff reductions and from the fast track (for 15 categories of goods for which tariffs are due to fall to between 0 and 5 per cent within seven to 10 years). As expected the Philippines and Indonesia have announced the most exclusions, and Singapore, which is virtually a free port already, the least. The loose nature of the Afta agreement and the low level of intra-Asean trade mean that there is little sense of urgency about putting it into practice. An Indonesian minister, for example, said recently that it would take all of Afta's 15-year implementation period before there was a significant impact on the Indonesian economy. Indonesia has yet to release detailed lists of products to be included or excluded from the scheduled tariff reductions and economists are sceptical about how open it intends to be. When the government announced 250 tariff cuts last July it turned out that 90 per cent of them related to different types of batik cloth, an Indonesian specialty. Meanwhile, Malaysian-made Proton cars are likely to continue to be targeted at Britain, with no signs that they will be allowed to flood to the highly-protected Indonesian vehicle market. In what may be a signal of troubles to come, Mrs Rafidah Aziz, the Malaysian trade minister, says her government is pressing Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand to start tariff cuts under Afta's Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme as soon as possible. Mrs Rafidah has warned other Asean members not to take advantage of what she calls 'Malaysia's generosity'. She says: 'We will not allow our domestic industries to be out-competed.' Malaysia is not alone in fearing competition. The Philippines, for example, is excluding coconut oil because nearly a third of the Philippine population depends on coconut products for a living. Thailand's petrochemical producers have pleaded with the Thai government for state financing, for cuts in the price of the gas they use as a raw material, and even for petrochemical import quotas - precisely the kind of non-tariff barriers that the Afta agreement rejects. The loud complaints of protected industries about the dangers of Afta are an indication that the agreement is not entirely ineffective. It is also true that government desire to expose some of their domestic industries to limited competition is helping Afta's implementation. In late December, for instance, the Philippine government said it had persuaded its textile manufacturers to include another 400 products in the tariff-reduction programme. However, the lack of legally-binding obligations to cut tariffs may yet be the undoing of Afta. Professor Richard Lipsey, a Canadian economist, noted recently that the Asean tariff reduction scheme seemed piecemeal compared with the 'one big package' agreed between the US and Canada. The problem for the Asean countries is that they agreed on Afta in principle, and today are still negotiating the details. Another obstacle to harmony within Afta is the lack of any provision for the free movement of labour. Dr Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, the former Indonesian foreign minister, has raised this objection at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur last year to celebrate Asean's first 25 years. 'Singapore and Malaysia are always telling us to lower tariffs and duties and let their goods into the country,' he said. 'But in return, how about the free movement of labour? We will take your goods if you will take our surplus labour supply. When they hear this and think about all those Indonesians coming to work in their countries, then they say, 'wait a minute, maybe it's not such a good idea'.' With per capita income in Singapore 20 times as high as in Indonesia, the economic disparities within Asean make those within the EC pale into insignificance. Even if Afta is fully implemented by the year 2008, it could take a few more years before Asean becomes truly a single market.

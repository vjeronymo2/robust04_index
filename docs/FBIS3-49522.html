			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman by Beate </F> Mueller-Blattau in Bonn; date not given; questions are in  English; Tudjman answers in Serbo-Croatian, with superimposed  translation into German -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Mueller-Blattau] Mr. President, the result of the  peace negotiations is very unsatisfactory. Why was there no  better outcome?    [Tudjman] One could agree with your assessment that the  result is unsatisfactory and one could also assume that the  Croatian delegation is not satisfied with the results. But I  think that the meeting was in a certain sense a success because  it helped clarify many important questions, and in any case it  is important for people to know that Croatian policy is  consistent, not only with regard to an end to hostilities but  also with regard to all efforts at cooperation and friendship  between Muslims and Croats.    [Mueller-Blattau] Mr. President, with all due respect, the  whole world is hoping for peace because we all assume there will  soon be no more money and no more arms left. Where are you  getting the weapons?    [Tudjman] The Muslim side has of course some weapons and  munitions factories, and one has to say that they have gained a  certain advantage by having used humanitarian convoys in order  to import high-tech war material. In all wars in the world,  there are always some opportunities to gain access to weapons.  Over and above this, the Serb side is selling arms at very high  prices to every party involved in the war. And they have quite  certainly considerable quantities.    [Mueller-Blattau] Mr. President, you could probably call me  very naive if I ask why the Bosnians and the Croats don't join  forces and fight together against the main aggressor, the Serbs.    [Tudjman] At the beginning, the Croats and the Muslims not  only made common cause, but the Croats in Bosnia and in  Herzegovina defended Bosnia-Herzegovina against the Serb  aggressor with the aid of the Republic of Croatia, at a time  when the Muslims were not able to do this. If that had not been  the case, then the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina would have fallen  into the hands of the Serb aggressor. Later, however, the  understanding between the Croats and Muslims broke down because  at that time, the Serbs had conquered two-thirds of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Muslims, knowing that they could not  retake the country, turned against the Croats. That is the set  of problems. Even the talks yesterday and the day before were  concerned with this particular set of problems. And that is  probably why no agreement was reached -- to be precise,  particularly because there is the Muslim demand that they should  take over the regions inhabited by Croats.    [Mueller-Blattau] There is a rumor, Mr. President, that you  met Milosevic even before the war, in 1991, to talk even then  about the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Is that correct, Mr.  President?    [Tudjman] Yes, that's right. I did actually meet Mr.  Milosevic. Following the meeting, I also suggested that  Milosevic and I should meet Izetbegovic as well, for these are  the three most important people in relation to the fate of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We met in Split. The main topic was at  that time the prevention of a possible war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. And in Split we held the same views and  positions which we put forward right at the start on the  Petersberg.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (4): A change of direction is needed - The economy is drifting along on an old course Brazil's economy, the tenth-largest in the world, is the supertanker of Latin America's fleet. As such it is the hardest to turn around. For years steered towards import substitution, tariff protection and state intervention, it is still largely drifting on its old course, even though its helmsman long ago sought to change direction. Part of the problem is that the helmsman, disgraced former president Fernando Collor, has been removed and replaced by President Itamar Franco, who has seemed incapable of steering Brazil through choppy seas. More fundamentally, there is resistance to overhauling an economic model which, however flawed, has produced a Dollars 432bn economy and average annual growth of 7 per cent in the 40 years to 1980. There are also some very powerful interest groups. The aftermath of the debt crisis in the early 1980s, when growth stopped, spelt out the need for change. 'We had an import-substitution model of state-led growth. But this is seen as gone for good,' says Mr Eduardo Gianetti da Fonseca, a leading economist. Nonetheless, he says, Brazil is 'lagging behind' as Latin America shifts towards fiscal responsibility and market liberalisation. 'A clear indication of this is inflation, a symptom of the inability to solve these problems.' Brazil has managed to cope with inflation, which last year reached 2,500 per cent, with a highly complex system of indexation, termed 'perverse adaptation' by Mr Gianetti. Indexation creates an inflationary inertia which, unless interrupted, assures the continued escalation of prices. It is precisely to interrupt that cycle that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who resigned in March as finance minister, last December launched the most realistic attempt yet to crack inflation. The plan, partly designed to tackle the budgetary indiscipline which fuels price rises, and to remove the safety net of indexation, is judged by most economists to be technically adept. Mr Cardoso's three-stage scheme, which also launched his campaign for election as president, seeks to use public spending cuts and emergency taxes to remove the 1994 budget deficit, originally estimated at Dollars 22.2bn. If the budget is truly balanced - and uncertainty remains over whether it will be, particularly in an election year - then this would reduce the government's need to engage in high-interest, short-term borrowing which expands the money supply. Stage two, begun in March, introduced a transitional index and accounting unit, the Unidade Real de Valor (URV), a daily general price index based on a measure of current inflation which is anchored to the dollar through Brazil's foreign exchange reserves of more than Dollars 30bn. Salaries, new contracts and large purchases are now quoted in URVs, paving the way for the conversion of the index to a new currency, the Real. The Real, the fifth currency in a decade, is due to be launched on July 1 when analysts predict that inflation will drop from 45 per cent a month to less than 10 per cent. The question is, how long it will stay there? At best, Mr Gianetti says, the scheme will build a low-inflationary 'bridge' between now and presidential elections to be held in October. 'But, if things go badly wrong and indexation is disrupted, I don't discount hyperinflation. It's full indexation and then no indexation. . . It's a big gamble.' Mr Tullo Vigevani, professor of political science at Sao Paulo University, says the plan 'lacks the political base to take hold'. It cannot work in the long run, he says, without fundamental constitutional changes that would permit the routine balancing of the federal budget. The 1988 constitution obliges the federal government to hand over most of its tax revenue to state and municipal administrations without releasing it from spending obligations. The constitution thus virtually guarantees inflation-fuelling budget deficits by earmarking more than 90 per cent of revenue before a single spending decision is made. Brazil has adjusted to the illogical world of near-hyperinflation - last year, gross domestic product grew by 4.9 per cent - but its economy has been warped. Very high interest rates (more than 20 per cent a year in real terms) divert investment into government paper rather than productive capacity and add to the burden of public-sector debt. Investment last year was 16 per cent of GDP, compared with 27 per cent in Chile. Millions of poor Brazilians, without access to indexed bank accounts, are unprotected from rocketing prices. Even if Mr Cardoso's plan is initially successful, monetary policy will have to be kept tight to rein in consumer demand as prices stabilise. This could tip the economy into recession, threatening hoped-for growth in 1994 of 3-4 per cent. Notwithstanding the risks, Mr Joao Geraldo Ribeiro Filho of Banco de Boston, says: 'We have never had an opportunity like this and we don't know when we will have another one.' He points to high international reserves and April's conclusion of a Brady-style debt rescheduling agreement - named after a 1989 initiative by the then US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady - for the country's foreign debt - admittedly without IMF blessing. Most analysts agree that, largely as a result of reforms started under Collor, the economy has taken significant steps. Privatisations and reduced tariffs have stimulated exports, which grew by 8 per cent last year, and improved productivity. Foreign investment in the capital markets reached Dollars 5.5bn last year against Dollars 1.3bn in 1992, and multinational interest has been reawakened in Brazil as Latin America's potentially most dynamic economy. It is not clear whether a newly-elected government will continue in the same direction. Mr Gianetti fears that strong interest groups, such as state monopolies, will prevent further restructuring. To reform in the context of splintered political parties and a burdensome constitution will not be easy, he says. 'We have had the feast of democracy before the blood, sweat and tears of market reform.' There is uncertainty, especially among foreign investors, about what would happen if election front-runner Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party should become president. Many analysts feel, however, that his reservations about economic reforms would be cooled by the reality of government and the need to build coalitions. 'In the long term - independently of who becomes president - Brazil has no other way out,' says Mr Julius Haupt Buchenrode, director of investments at Banco Chase Manhattan. 'It needs to reduce inflation; to balance its budget; to adjust its constitution; and probably to continue privatisations. There's no magic solution.'</p>

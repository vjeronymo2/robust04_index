			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Efta states attack their EU farm terms: Austria and Finland say Brussels plan on subsidies may hit accession votes Bargaining over conditions of entry for new members of the European Union is set to intensify after objections from Austria and Finland to the Commission's proposals on farm subsidies. Austrian officials say the plan to cut agricultural subsidies could undermine public support for joining the Union. And leading Finnish politicians argue that the Commission's suggestions do not go far enough to meet the farming community's climatic and geographical difficulties. The Commission said last week it wanted to end price support for farmers from the day of accession, when local prices would drop to EU levels. Governments would be allowed to compensate farmers for the difference through state subsidies for a negotiated period, which officials in Vienna say would cost Austria Sch7bn-Sch8bn (Pounds 395m-Pounds 452m) over three to five years. The sceptical response to the proposals by all four countries belonging to the European Free Trade Association (Efta) - Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway - appears to be in part a way of persuading Brussels to put up more EU funds for their farmers. The Austrian and Finnish objections are likely to intensify negotiations with Brussels over the financing of transitional aid for farmers in remote or mountainous regions of the four Efta applicants. However, a public row over agriculture could further weaken public support for the EU in the four Efta countries, which hold referendums on entry next year. A senior official from the Austrian chancellor's office said the proposals 'were presented in an insensitive way. It had a very negative impact. They could ruin the pro-EU atmosphere in our country.' Officials said ministries were besieged last week with angry telephone calls from Austrians saying they would vote against membership. Mr Franz Fischler, the Austrian agriculture minister, said 'The Community has changed its negotiating position. This is a new situation for Austria and it is not acceptable.' The proposals were rejected by Austria's farmers' association which said they would ruin farmers and the local food industry. The government, which is grappling with recession and a budget deficit, would not have the money to pay for compensation, the association said. It threatened to advise its members to vote against membership in the referendum. Mr Heikki Haavisto, Finland's foreign minister and former president of the Central Union of Agricultural Producers, said the proposals represented 'a correct analysis', but produced 'wholly wrong conclusions and solutions'. Finland has made regional aid and agriculture the key issues in its EU membership discussions. It is disappointed that only four regions have been designated as eligible for the highest level of structural aid, with so-called Objective 1 status. It had asked for five to be brought into the bracket. In Sweden, the reaction has been more positive. A source close to Sweden's EU negotiations said: 'This is definitely a step in the right direction, but it is far from a final agreement.' There is satisfaction that Norrbotten, the country's northernmost province, has been awarded Objective 1 status, despite disappointment that other regions have not been classified similarly. The Norwegian government has welcomed the Commission's plans to grant northern regions Objective 1 status. However, Norway is concerned that its food processing industry could be adversely affected by the Commission's proposals to lift trade barriers immediately membership comes into effect. The strong negative reaction from Austria seems to counter the Brussels view that handling the needs of Austria's alpine farmers would present less difficulty than dealing with agriculture in the three Nordic countries.</p>

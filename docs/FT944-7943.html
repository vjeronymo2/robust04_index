			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ciba boosts Chiron stake to 49.9% Ciba, the Swiss drug company, yesterday made the biggest corporate acquisition in biotechnology for almost five years with a deal which lifts its stake in California-based Chiron to 49.9 per cent. The deal, which values Chiron at Dollars 4.2bn, gives Ciba access to Chiron's strong research and development programme and a range of products in areas including diagnostics and ophthalmology. It strengthens Chiron's finances and marks the end of an era for the 13-year-old company, one of the most successful in biotechnology and the only large one in the sector with its founding management still in place. The deal, finalised over the weekend, 'is our response to fundamental changes in healthcare', said Mr Heini Lippuner, Ciba's chief operating officer. He said drug company profits were under pressure from governments keen to cut healthcare costs. Other companies had responded by purchasing drug-maker or distribution networks. However, Ciba had found no suitable candidates in its areas of expertise and had therefore chosen the Chiron deal. Mr Dennis Winger, Chiron's chief financial officer, said the deal 'brought financial stability' to his company, in which Ciba already had a stake of about 4 per cent. Chiron's product sales for the first nine months of 1994 were Dollars 187.7m, compared with Dollars 147.9m for the whole of 1993 and less than Dollars 40m in 1988. Under the terms of the deal, Ciba will make a tender offer for 11.9m Chiron shares - 37.3 per cent of the company - at Dollars 117 each. The price is above the Dollars 100 a share that analysts last week suggested Ciba would be prepared to pay. Chiron's share price rose Dollars 2 to close at Dollars 80 1/4 . Chiron will also issue 6.6m new shares to Ciba in return for the Ciba Corning Diagnostics business and the half of Biocine, a vaccine joint venture set up between the two companies in 1986, that it does not own. Ciba will guarantee Dollars 425m of new debt for Chiron and invest up to Dollars 250m, repayable in cash or shares, in research and development over five years. Chiron's president, Mr Bill Rutter, will be invited to join Ciba's main board of directors. Mr Sam Isaly of New York researchers Mehta and Isaly said the transaction would reduce Ciba's earnings per share by 4 per cent in 1995. The deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions of US assets by Swiss drugs companies. Earlier this year Roche paid Dollars 5.3bn for Californian pharmaceuticals company Syntex, while Sandoz paid Dollars 3.7bn for food company Gerber. The US biotechnology sector has seen a lot of activity this year. A series of small deals culminated last week with the Dollars 258m acquisition by Amgen, the world's largest bio-technology company, of Colorado's Synergen. Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Bombay Securities Scandal: Economy emerges largely unscathed THE 43 per cent drop in the Bombay stock market after the scandal erupted in April prompted concern that the affair might damage the economy as a whole and deflect the government from its aim of opening and deregulating the economy. But the market's subsequent recovery is a sign that the impact may not be as bad as expected: Indian investors seem to believe the government will weather this storm and not be diverted from the road of reform. Opposition politicians who had hoped to use the affair to embarrass the government have so far had only modest success. Mr P Chidambaram, the commerce minister, is the only minister to have resigned over the affair. The decision of Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to establish a joint parliamentary committee to examine the scandal has created a useful political lightning rod. It will also win time, since the committee may not complete its work until next summer. Nevertheless, the scandal's impact on the economy and on the economic reform programme is not negligible. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has just returned from a visit to the UK and the US, where investors told him that the scandal has highlighted the risks of investing in India, especially in financial instruments. Indian investors too are worried. Mr N Sankar, president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, said this week: 'The scam and the unprecedented closure of stock exchanges for long periods have shaken the confidence of the investing public.' Such concerns may prove short-lived if underlying market conditions are attractive enough to persuade investors to set aside scandal-generated fears. However, delays in investment of even a few months could slow growth and harm public faith in the economic reform programme. Although the government had approved some Dollars 600m (Pounds 350m) of foreign investment plans by the end of March, little of this money has in fact been invested. The scandal has made banks wary of infringing Reserve Bank of India guidelines. Sticking to the letter of the law has squeezed the supply of bank credit, which was already tight because of the central bank's efforts to restrict the money supply to slow inflation. Mr F A Mehta, a director of Tata Sons, the controlling company of the Tata industrial group, says: 'The scam has not started the squeeze on credit but it has aggravated it.' Indian officials say the best way to restore confidence is to take prompt action to punish offenders and implement specific reforms. The authorities have shown their resolve by pillorying suspects such as Mr Harshad Mehta, who spent 111 days being interrogated in custody before release on bail last week. The Reserve Bank of India has reminded banks to abide by the rules in the inter-bank market, including a ban on paying cheques payable to a bank into the account of a third party, such as a broker - one of the abuses which surfaced in the scandal. The central bank has also started a more wide-ranging study of bank management practices - including standards for book-keeping. The authorities want to put the scandal behind them. As Mr Salman Khurshid, junior minister for commerce, puts it: 'The scandal had to happen, and now that it has, we believe the economy will emerge the stronger for it.' That may be too much to hope for. But neither, it seems, will the affair leave the economy significantly weaker.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Hold the Front Page!" </F> rubric: "Military Ruse"]    [Text] The Russian Defense Ministry's General Staff has  decided to carry out plans for its own reduction in its own  manner.    It has become known to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS from reliable  sources that not a single officer will be discharged from the  General Staff. There will be a reduction nevertheless. Several  subunits will be detached from General Staff directorates and  transformed into several sectors [napravleniya]. All the  officers will remain in their positions and will not lose even a  kopeck of their salaries. Defense Ministry chiefs will be able  to report a 30-percent personnel cut.    This is not the first time the military has resorted to such  a ruse. At one time, the Central Command Post was withdrawn  from the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff.  Those at the top were told about a 50-percent cut. Several  months after, part of the subunits were taken back. The same  will happen now too.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TRETTIN TO RUN AGAINST WOLFSHEIMER FOR COUNCIL  </P> <P> Citing his decade of experience on northern San Diego issues, former county  supervisorial aide Bob Trettin on Wednesday announced that he intends to oppose  1st District San Diego City Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer this fall in the  city's first district-only council election.  </P> <P> At a news conference outside City Hall, Trettin argued that his seven years on  the staff of former 1st District Councilman Bill Mitchell and three years as  the chief policy aide to Supervisor Susan Golding would enable him to  "effectively serve . . . the first day I am in office."  </P> <P> "No other candidate for this office, including the incumbent . . . has a  comparable record of identifying problems and finding solutions for the people  of the 1st District," said Trettin, a 34-year-old Rancho Penasquitos resident  who recently left Golding's staff to run for the council.  </P> <P> Although Wolfsheimer will begin her reelection campaign much better-known and  financed, Trettin suggested that San Diego voters' approval last fall of  district-only races -- a shift from the current system of district primaries  and citywide runoffs -- will enable him to overcome the incumbent's advantages  through aggressive grass-roots campaigning. Trettin added that he already has  commitments for nearly $100,000 in campaign contributions.  </P> <P> When Wolfsheimer defeated Mitchell in 1985, Trettin noted, she was outpolled by  Mitchell in the 1st District in both the primary and general election.  </P> <P> "Abbe Wolfsheimer has already lost two elections in the 1st District," Trettin  said. "Had district elections been in effect in 1985, (she) would not be a  council member today."  </P> <P> Trettin also charged that, during her tenure at City Hall, Wolfsheimer has been  ineffective in communicating with 1st District community leaders and has a poor  rapport with council colleagues.  </P> <P> "Abbe has acted as if I-5 created an impenetrable barrier to communication and  citizen involvement," he said. "That's got to change. Once I am elected, it  will change."  </P></p>

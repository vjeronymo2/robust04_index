			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 21 May (AFP) -- Honduras is willing to  contribute to a multinational military force to restore  democracy in Haiti, said Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz  Aguilar on Saturday.    "The Honduran position has always been to unconditionally  support the reinstatement of democracy in Haiti, a brother  country which suffers an ignominious military dictatorship," Paz  stated when recalling the military coup perpetrated against the  Caribbean island's president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on 30  September 1991.    During an interview with a local radio station, Paz said  eventual Honduran participation in a multinational military  force would have to occur within the framework of UN or OAS  peace-keeping operations.    The foreign minister said, "Honduras is currently  participating in a similar operation in the Western Sahara" at  the request of the UN.    The head of Honduran foreign affairs emphasized Honduras has  been "firm and categorical" when defending democracy in Haiti  and in all countries where human rights are being violated.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN BITES TOWN: IN DEFENSE OF DIRT;  </P> <P> CODE OF ETHICS? WE DON'T NEED NO STINKING CODE OF ETHICS  </P> <P> I don't remember who said it, and one of the perks of being a columnist is that  you don't have to retain petty journalistic details, but an L.A. City Council  member made this comment just before that body thoroughly deveined the most  recent attempt at a code of ethics for city officials:  </P> <P> "Just because Mayor Bradley made a mistake in judgment, that doesn't make all  of us crooks."  </P> <P> Now, obviously, it doesn't make Mayor Bradley a crook either, unless his  mistake in judgment involved violating a criminal statute or two. But there's a  larger point here. The councilman -- and I really wish I could remember who it  was, but they all kind of blend together -- was saying, I think, that just  because we elect a person to hold power over us; agree to be forced to fork  over the money that goes for, among other things, his salary; and empower him  to render decisions that can make other people very rich, there's no particular  reason why strictures against accepting bribes should apply to that person any  more than to you and me.  </P> <P> In other words, in the eyes of the law, the odds should be assumed to be equal  that Occidental Petroleum would pay you, or somebody at City Hall, to undergo a  sudden attitude change about oil drilling in the Palisades. And, really, that's  only basic fairness.  </P> <P> The real problem here is that, as another council member pointed out, L.A. is  the cleanest city in the nation. He wasn't referring to the sidewalks or the  bookstores; he meant his and his colleagues' particular nest. An ethics code  would only make matters worse.  </P> <P> Because what makes other cities' politics so vibrant, so interesting, so  capable of competing for air time with grisly serial killings, is dirt. Think  about it. How many of us would spend a substantial part of our waking lives  paying attention to show business if the real scoop were that it's the cleanest  industry on the planet? This, in fact, is the reason celebrities telling us  about their recoveries from addiction to disgusting habits are such thorough  bores. They seem to miss the crucial point: It was their disgusting habits that  made us love them, or at least remember who they were.  </P> <P> People in New York or Chicago can tell one city councilman or alderman from  another. They know exactly who's on the take from whom, which guy or gal is in  the pocket of which developer, union or mobster. Only in Lake Woebegon is the  public's consciousness sufficiently becalmed that one pol can be distinguished  from another by which church he chooses to favor with his faith.  </P> <P> So it's not accidental that the cleanest city in the nation also has the fewest  people who know or care about what goes on downtown. Being the cleanest means  being the most boring, which in turn means we pay so little attention that even  if it weren't the cleanest, we wouldn't know. It's what the computer people  call synergy, or telesis, or something.  </P> <P> This was why hopes were raised so high last year when the mayor had his little,  you know, mistake in judgment. But even after we learned that possible  indications of culpability had been whited out, we weren't so much roused to  indignation as nudged into the kind of tolerant disappointment you feel when an  expensive, old bottle of wine, upon opening, turns out to be headed around the  vinegar bend. "It's too bad," we thought as we opened a bottle of younger stuff  and turned our thoughts to "Batman's" grosses.  </P> <P> So the watering down of the code of ethics is a promising first step. In  conjunction with the yawns that greeted the mayor's, you know, mistake in  judgment, it may embolden our city fathers and mothers to more provocatively  flagrant misbehavior. But high public awareness of local politics depends on  another development: the arrival in town of an ambitious egotist with a catchy  moniker who figures that a hot new way to make a name for himself in local TV  news is to know, and say, where the bodies are buried. Is there a Geraldo Jr.?  How could there not be?  </P> <P> It's probably fortunate, though, that he hasn't hit town yet. If, let's say,  the airline pilots who live around here had heard the councilman's "crooks"  remark, they might get carried away and refuse to take random urine tests.  "Just because the captain of the Exxon Valdez made a mistake in judgment, that  doesn't make all of us drunks or dope fiends." And where would that leave the  War on Drugs?  </P></p>

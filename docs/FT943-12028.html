			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Dalepak declines to Pounds 514,000 Dalepak Foods, the maker of frozen and chilled products, recorded a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 514,000 in the year to April 30. Turnover declined from Pounds 42.2m to Pounds 36.9m. The dividend is cut from 6p to 1.5p, with a final of 1p. The result, which was foreshadowed in profits warnings, stemmed from a fall in the main frozen foods division. However, directors said that measures implemented following a review of that business had ensured that the division returned to profit in the second half. Earnings per share dropped to 3.71p (13p).</p>

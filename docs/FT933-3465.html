			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Growing optimism over prospects - In A Nutshell Small businesses have become more optimistic about their prospects and one in four is now planning to expand over the next six months, according to a survey of more than 1,200 businesses by National Westminster Bank. The findings of this survey, carried out in July, showed an improvement on January 1993, when only one in five small firms had plans to expand. Closer analysis showed that the 'smaller' small firms were more cautious, with only 20 per cent of those with turnover of less than Pounds 50,000 planning to expand, while 37 per cent of those with sales between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m had similar plans. Optimism was highest in London and the east Midlands where just over one third of small firms planned to grow and lowest in Yorkshire (18 per cent) and Lancashire and the north-west (21 per cent each).

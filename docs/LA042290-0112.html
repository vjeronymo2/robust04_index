			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MYERS IS WELCOME ADDITION TO REDS  </P> <P> When Randy Myers was traded for the Reds' John Franco, Mets executives noted  that one of their intentions was to improve team chemistry. They thought Myers  was more interested in weight lifting than the good of the team. That view  seems especially ironic after what Myers has become here in less than two weeks  of the season: a popular player in the clubhouse who is giving the bullpen --  if not the entire club -- a new identity.  </P> <P> The Reds are amused, and some of them encouraged, by Myers' macho act, which  includes camouflage gear, plastic grenades and Soldier of Fortune magazine. He  has given nicknames to Norm Charlton ("The Genius"), Rob Dibble ("The  Officer"), himself ("Mr. Mellow") and the entire bullpen ("The Nasty Boys,"  which he said he arrived at after watching Tim Layana throw a nasty  knuckle-curve) and has instituted a strikeout competition between the starters  and relievers (his side leads, 37-21).  </P> <P> More important, the Reds are impressed by his tenacity and his pitching, which  produced one win and three saves in Cincinnati's 7-0 start.  </P> <P> "John Franco is a great pitcher," Charlton said. "But if there were bases  loaded and John was behind 3-0 on a hitter with a one-run lead, he'd be ice  cold out there. Randy has a totally different personality. You can see fire  coming out of his head.  </P> <P> "Randy brings out the best -- or the worst, whatever you want to call it -- in  Rob and me. All three of us are adrenaline pitchers. We go on a full tank all  the time."  </P> <P> Myers, who complained in New York that Davey Johnson didn't use him enough, is  elated to be here because Lou Piniella has promised to use him "short and  often." He also seems to enjoy being on a team where it is more important to  have fun than to be cool. You've probably noticed that the Mets have eliminated  their eccentric types (Wally Backman, Lenny Dykstra, Roger McDowell, Myers) and  put together more of a vanilla-flavored team.  </P> <P> "If they want to make me the scapegoat, fine, let them go ahead and do it,"  Myers said. "I don't care. I'm not a goody two-shoes. If that's what they  wanted, that's not me. I'm just not that kind of guy."  </P> <P> The first "Nasty Boys" banner of the season was hung at Riverfront Stadium  Tuesday. It included the uniform numbers of Myers, Dibble and Charlton. Myers  was upset that it did not include those of Layana and Tim Birtsas, who also  have membership in the club.  </P> <P> For all of their shenanigans, these guys provide serious relief. If it is not  the best bullpen, it certainly is the hardest-throwing one. Myers, Dibble and  Charlton have fanned 30 of the 77 batters they have faced this year.  </P> <P> After the Padres swept the Giants in San Francisco last weekend, catcher Mark  Parent was feeling pretty good. "What we did this weekend was send a message to  the Giants: 'You guys aren't even going to be competing with us this year,"'  Parent told reporters. "And pretty soon, we'll be sending the same message to  the Reds."  </P> <P> So what happened Tuesday? Cincinnati beat San Diego, 2-1, in a game in which  Parent struck out with the tying and winning runs on base in the ninth inning.  The lesson: It's fine to be confident, but career .184 hitters like Parent have  no business running their mouths off like that.  </P> <P> The Reds also beat the Padres Wednesday, 11-7.  </P> <P> The Padres and Reds have the makings of a good rivalry. Not only are they the  premier teams in the division, but their managers don't appear to like each  other.  </P> <P> Piniella, who played for Padres Manager Jack McKeon in 1973 in Kansas City,  wrote in his 1986 autobiography that McKeon is "a champion second-guesser. I  didn't like his manner, his tone of voice, his sarcasm, and the feeling was  mutual. He didn't like me very much. I just couldn't play for the man."  </P> <P> Two years later, McKeon wrote in his book that Piniella was "the most selfish  player I've ever seen. In my first spring training, I lectured them every  morning on baseball. A couple of veterans thought it was a waste, but mainly it  was Lou Piniella. He's the one who undermined me."  </P> <P> Both tried to douse those fires Tuesday. Piniella said he likes and respects  McKeon, who said, "We don't have any problems. I'd like to think we can see  past whatever happened 17, 18 years ago."  </P> <P> Joe Carter is having a terrible start with the Padres. Though he expected to  see more fastballs in the National League, Carter is getting a regular dose of  breaking pitches, and will until he proves he can hit them. It's bad enough  that he is not hitting (5-for-32, .156, no homers), but Carter also is giving  credence to the notion that he is a poor clutch hitter. He has batted with 27  runners on this year and driven in three of them -- one with a bases-loaded  walk.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, with the bases loaded and his team down 2-0, he made the mistake of  not knowing how many outs there were. Carter thought there was one out so he  jumped at a high, first-pitch fastball. "I said, 'Just drive it. Sacrifice  fly,"' Carter said.  </P> <P> But in fact his fly ball resulted in the third out of the inning. Carter came  up with a weak explanation for his mistake. He blamed it on his transition to  the National League. He said he is not accustomed to the whereabouts of  National League scoreboards.  </P> <P> Friday the 13th turned out to be a scary night for McDowell, who wears No. 13  for the Phillies. In one-third of an inning, he gave up three hits, walked two  batters and permitted six earned runs. And the four players who wear No. 13 who  batted that night -- Lance Parrish, Alvaro Espinoza, Glenn Wilson and Jose Lind  -- were a combined 3-for-15.  </P> <P> The Red Sox, who have Marty Barrett and Lee Smith to trade, had better find  some starting pitching fast.  </P> <P> The Athletics' Scott Sanderson may turn out to be a fine replacement for Storm  Davis, who won 19 games for them last year with the generous support of 5.61  runs per game. In Sanderson's first start, Oakland scored 15 runs for him. The  Royals provided Davis with one run in his first start, a 3-1 loss.  </P> <P> The umpires didn't have enough time to prepare for the season because of the  lockout and their strike. Their work, particularly on balls and strikes, has  been noticeably off.  </P> <P> The right side of the Mets' infield is a danger zone. Gregg Jefferies, while a  better hitter, hasn't improved his fielding or his ability to cope with  mistakes. And Mike Marshall is the most awkward first baseman in the league.  </P> <P> Frank Viola, who has regained the pop on his fastball, is going to have a huge  year.  </P> <P> Don Mattingly appears to have licked his April hitting troubles, which means he  probably will win the batting title.  </P> <P> John Smoltz is a mystery. He was 11-6 at the break last year and is 1-7 since.  </P></p>

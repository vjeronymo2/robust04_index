			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Beating pension costs The shortcomings of personal pensions have been reported widely, especially the high commission charges which lead to lower transfer values or future pay-outs. For equity-based schemes, fund management charges also can be substantial. When I left a public sector scheme in December 1985, I took a lump sum transfer into a unit-linked personal pension. The transfer took effect in mid-1989; soon afterwards, the insurance company involved increased its management fees. It claimed it needed to cover extra costs imposed by the Financial Services Act of 1986, which was implemented in 1988. The annual charge went up from 0.5 to 0.75 per cent on the company's building society deposit fund, while the increase for other funds was from 0.75 to 1 per cent. Thus, a pension valued at Pounds 100,000 incurred fund management charges of up to Pounds 1,000 a year. I decided this could be avoided by investing directly in deposit accounts and in investment trusts which had lower management costs. After investigating several options, I transferred the personal pension into a small self-administered scheme (SSAS) in December 1992. The costs (for the insurance company's administrative fees and auditing) were lower than the fund management charges for the personal pension. Since I had a considerable time to retirement, I hoped the performance of the SSAS would match that of fund managers, who are constrained by monthly comparisons. As a professional economist, I reasoned that my strengths lay in assessing economic trends and sectoral prospects but that others might be better at selecting companies. So, I decided investment trusts could be used to complement my skills. Acting as my own investment manager, I use Fidelity Brokerage on an execution-only basis. I monitor the portfolio weekly, using Fairshares software, and prepare the accounts on Sage Accountant. These tasks can be fitted in with other activities, but a SASS would be less attractive if it had to be charged at market rates. Late in 1992, the property sector was identified by investment managers as due for a substantial re-rating so I bought Artesian Commercial, an unquoted company; TR's Property Investment trust; and Mucklow Group, the property investor and developer. Since a marked reduction in medium-term interest rates also was expected, this increased the attraction of the income shares of split capital investment trusts. These provide a geared return under such circumstances and, as a bonus, they offer excellent yields. Most of the SSAS equity fund was invested during the early months of 1993 and, since it has now been operating for a full year, its initial performance can be assessed. The property recovery and reduction in interest rates have been more rapid than expected: the portfolio valuation is 59 per cent above its starting value a year ago. This compares with a 23 per cent increase in the FT-A index and poorer performance in my executive unit-linked pension schemes. The equity fund consists of 14 companies plus a money market bank account. Individual returns range from an increase of 197 per cent in Sphere IT Income shares to a likely loss of 100 per cent in Queens Moat 7.5 per cent Convertible Preference shares (see chart). Pentos has proved a big disappointment, but good profits were made during the year on Japanese and emerging market investment trusts warrants. Only 4 per cent of the fund was in cash at the year-end. Was the 59 per cent return beginner's luck? I think not, since the changes were foreseen but happened more rapidly than expected. In the coming year, I plan to consolidate my gains as interest rates bottom out. Most of the investment trust income shares are still giving very good yields, but the portfolio is vulnerable to a rise in inflation and higher interest rates. I will also continue to look for sectors with recovery potential - property development, construction and oil exploration are possibilities. Leslie McClements is an economic consultant.</p>

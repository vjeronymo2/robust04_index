			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Whitehall's secrecy rules to be eased The government is to classify fewer documents 'top secret' in a shake-up of its security system, and it claims that less information will be kept from the public. The move, which follows a review, could lead to substantial savings in the annual Pounds 300m bill for Whitehall security. Mr John Major announced yesterday that he had approved more detailed definitions of the four categories by which sensitive documents are classified. These are: top secret, secret, confidential and restricted. The new system may help the government to allay criticisms of over-secretive Whitehall practices that could emerge from the Scott inquiry into arms for Iraq and which are at the heart of the investigation into the Pergau dam aid deal with Malaysia. The prime minister said the overhaul would 'allow fewer government documents to be classified, particularly at the higher levels'. He also claimed that the definitions and recent review of security measures would permit 'substantial cost savings' in vetting procedures. At present, the 'top secret' classification is defined as 'causing exceptionally grave damage to the interests of the nation'. It is to be replaced by a longer definition which says that such information, if leaked, would 'lead directly to widespread loss of life' or 'threaten directly the internal stability of the UK or friendly countries'. But pressure groups and opposition MPs were sceptical about whether the changes would lead to more disclosure. Campaigners against official secrecy said the reform would merely give Whitehall departments more elaborate reasons to withhold information when a new Code of Practice on Government is introduced in the next few days. The code is being hailed by ministers as a breakthrough in freedom of information, giving the public the right to request information on any Whitehall department's activities.

He emphasised that a department's decision not to release information could not be challenged in the courts. Mr Michael Meacher, shadow civil service minister, said: 'Not a single document will be released or be more directly available as a result of this feeble review.'</p>

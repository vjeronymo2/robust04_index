			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zambian copper group pulls back from brink, says Credit Lyonnais Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the country's biggest export earner and once one of the world's biggest copper producers, has in the past few weeks pulled back from threatened collapse, caused by a cash-flow crisis, and 1994 could provide ideal conditions for the state-owned group 'to turn positively to the task of renewal and revival,' according to Credit Lyonnais Laing, part of the French banking group. CLL suggests that a weakening copper price and a strong local currency swept ZCCM's profits away in the second half of the financial year that ends next March. 'The fall in the copper price in the second half of 1993 exposed the high-cost nature of the operations on the (African) copper belt and also exposed the problems of a reactive management which has done too little to cut long-term costs and which has yet to come to terms with new hardline government policy on industrial support,' says analyst Mr Michael Coulson in CLL's latest International Mining Monitor. He suggests that at present ZCCM is not generating enough cash to service repayments on its near-USDollars 900m of debt or to maintain output at present operations, let alone to allow investment in the development of new mines to secure its future. 'If nothing is done, the best ZCCM could hope for would be a future of steady decline with the occasional metal price surge enabling the company to undertake some new project development but on a much smaller scale than originally envisaged,' says Mr Coulson. This would mean annual output of 200,000 tonnes for 15 to 20 years whereas the present USDollars 2bn, 14-year plan would continue output at about 450,000 tonnes for 50 years. He calls for the Zambian government to move forward with privatisation of ZCCM, something donors of the country's USDollars 7bn debt believe would strengthen Zambia's economic performance. Mr Coulson dismisses, however, the idea that ZCCM - which has a present stock market value of about USDollars 300m - is worth billions. This idea harks back to the early 1980s when the oil groups were bidding up the price of mining companies and the Japanese offered USDollars 2bn for Zambia's copper mines. He says that, ideally, an additional big mining group should get involved with ZCCM alongside the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, which owns 27.3 per cent. Anglo will have a great deal to do in 'courting the new ANC-dominated (South African) government.' It would be healthy for a big group such as RTZ Corporation of the UK, Phelps Dodge of the US or BHP of Australia to enter the picture, perhaps by taking a majority stake in the USDollars 550m, Konkola Deep mine venture that is vital to ZCCM's long-term plans. Mr Coulson concludes: 'We do not think disaster for ZCCM is inevitable. The reconstruction and refinancing of the company swiftly undertaken can secure its competitive position in the international copper market and underpin its long-term future as a substantial and low-cost producer'. ZCCM is threatening Zambia's budget and economic reform programme by failing to pay taxes and debts, according to a senior government mining official, reports Reuter from Lusaka.</p>

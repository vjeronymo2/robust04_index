			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Coplex withdraws bid for Tuskar Coplex, the Australian exploration company, has withdrawn its all-share bid for Tuskar Resources, the Irish oil exploration group, having received acceptances of 47.6 per cent by the closing date. Earlier this month Tuskar recommended acceptance of the offer. A statement made on behalf of Coplex said given the likely time needed to reach the objective of acquiring 80 per cent of Tuskar, it had decided to allow the offer to lapse. Since the offer was made in March, Coplex has acquired a derived 54 per cent interest in Tuskar's exploration licences in Colombia, its principal asset. The interest was acquired in exchange for 10m Coplex shares and an undertaking to carry out drilling obligations in the licence areas over the coming year. Tuskar was in danger of losing the licences by June, as it was unable to raise the necessary finance to continue the drilling programme.</p>

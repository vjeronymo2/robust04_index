This is the opinion of private sector experts, who feel this  situation cannot be sustained and that this apparent improvement  is a double-edged sword. The situation is really disturbing, for  the quality of jobs has deteriorated, underemployment has risen,  and the decline in earnings is obvious.    The president of Andi [National Association of  Industrialists], Carlos Arturo Angel, said the number of people  out of work has apparently declined, but in reality, while  informal employment throughout Latin America averages 31  percent, in Colombia it provides 56 percent of the total number  of jobs. Twenty percent are temporary jobs, and now the number  of persons working for salaries below the minimum wage is very  high.    In 1993 employment rates in the formal sector declined 1.2  percent, and now the guerrillas are providing a labor pool.  These remarks show that while euphoria is being generated by the  latest unemployment figures, barely a glimpse of the tip of the  iceberg of unemployment in Colombia can be seen.    Unemployment in industry seems to have declined, but not as  the result of any official policy. This makes the nation's  stability in the next few years precarious.    Jobs are being created in construction, services, and  through  increased government spending, but formal employment in  industry, agriculture, and exports shows a steep decline.    Angel said that in an open economy a development model is  needed that takes the jobs strategy into account; we need to  choose between moving the economy toward more of a service-based  economy, or a policy of real industrial development.    These remarks were made at the "Apertura" [Trade  Liberalization] and Employment Forum held in Medellin, at which  presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano presented his  proposals for generating 1.5 million productive jobs.    The goal is to achieve economic growth above 6 percent,  which  would allow the unemployment rate to be brought down to 5  percent by the end of this century.    According to Angel, if Colombia does not grow and expand its  industrial development, it will not be able to provide jobs for  labor, and the "apertura" will just bring in more imports,  leading to a real collapse of our exports.    In the opinion of the director of Fedesarrollo [Federation  for Development], Eduardo Lora, the strategy the government has  used to reduce unemployment is a double-edged sword, and the  improved employment rates are the result of a macroeconomic  policy that needs to be corrected, as it is detrimental to the  possibility of developing better and long-term jobs.    In his view, basing this strategy on promoting government  spending and construction is a mistake, as such a policy cannot  be sustained on a macroeconomic and long-term level.    The rural problem was called the worst heritage this  government is leaving behind, for the agricultural worker is  worse off now than in 1950, as his real earnings have declined  15 percent.    The dean of the School of Economics of the University of the  Andes, Eduardo Sarmiento, suggested that the "apertura" policy  in agriculture needs to be revamped. Agriculture today faces the  most serious crisis of the past 20 years. Only livestock, milk,  and soybeans have escaped this crisis, as these products are  excluded from the "apertura."    He added that similar results are seen in industry, the  result of the declining production of high value-added goods.  Even though there has been a great expansion in construction,  government services, and profit margins in the financial sector,  it is unwise to sacrifice industry, agriculture, and exports for  such gains.    On the issue of jobs, he noted that in the past two years  not  a single job has been created in industry and agriculture, but  jobs have been found in construction, for cabdrivers, and for  Dane [National Administrative Department of Statistics]  bureaucrats.    Sarmiento called for a shift from the "apertura" policy of  replacing limited and low wage jobs to a complementary policy in  which jobs would be generated in modern sectors of the economy.    In general, the persons attending this forum representing a  variety of views did reach consensus on a number of matters: the  importance of centering economic and social policy on jobs,  because despite the present drop in unemployment to 7.8 percent,  it is by no means certain that this rate can be maintained, and  the unemployment rate reveals barely the tip of the iceberg. The  most serious problems are underemployment and unstable and  low-wage jobs.    Other vital issues are the key role of the exchange rate and  the need to avoid revaluation, which has thwarted the potential  of the "apertura."</p>

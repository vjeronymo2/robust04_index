Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposal. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal will limit or eliminate the potential monetary liability of MSTC directors under certain circumstances. The proposed change is based on Section 2.10(b)(3) of the Illinois Business Corporation Act, under which MSTC is organized, which allows corporations to adopt provisions in their articles of incorporation that limit or eliminate the potential monetary liability of directors under certain circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General corporate law imposes a fiduciary duty of care upon each corporate director. This duty of care requires a director to exercise informed business judgment in good faith and to act with an honest believe that the action taken is in the best interest of the corporation. The proposal will not eliminate an MSTC's director's duty of care but will limit the personal liability of an MSTC director to MSTC or its shareholders should the director fail through negligence or gross negligence to satisfy his or her duty of care. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Under Illinois law, such limitations of personal liability do not apply in certain situations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> MSTC's proposal will limit a director's liability even if that director had been grossly negligent provided that the director exercised informed business judgment in good faith and acted with an honest belief that the action taken was in the best interest of the corporation. Because there has been no judicial interpretation on the scope of the applicable Illinois legislation, it is possible that an Illinois court may find as a matter of law that a director cannot act in a manner that is both grossly negligent and in good faith. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal will prohibit limitation of a director's liability in instances where liability arises directly or indirectly as a result of a violation of federal securities laws. The proposal will not eliminate equitable remedies such as rescission or injunctive actions. Moreover, it will not eliminate the liability of an officer of MSTC for actions taken in that capacity even if the officer is also a director. Finally, the proposal will not affect the liability of a director for acts or omissions that occurred prior to approval of the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Limiting or eliminating directors' liability will help to ensure that MSTC will be able to recruit and retain competent directors. Due to the increased number and magnitude of lawsuits against directors, many other corporations from various states already have adopted provisions similar to those in MSTC's proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act because it will remove an impediment to attracting competent directors and thus will help assure the fair representation of shareholders and participants in the selection of directors and in the administration of MSTC's affairs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Schofield will steer MTM MTM, the specialist chemicals company which saw its share price plunge in March, yesterday appointed Mr Ken Schofield as chief executive in a board shake-up involving the resignation of all non-executive directors. The shares gained 7p to 64p yesterday. It followed a boardroom battle between two camps. On one side, the executive directors and institutional shareholders led by Gartmore, and on the other, Postern, the corporate management specialists, Robert Fleming, MTM's adviser, and the non-executive directors. Mr Schofield was chief executive at Hickson International, the chemical company, but announced in March that he would be leaving in May, having turned the business around. MTM's non-executive directors failed on Wednesday to persuade the board on the merits of a Postern-backed plan to revive the group's fortunes which involved selling key assets to reduce debt. The non-executives, Mr Stuart Wamsley, Lord Tordoff and Mr Don Mackay, resigned yesterday, along with Fleming as adviser. The executive directors, backed by Gartmore which controls 5 per cent of MTM, supported the appointment of Mr Schofield and his plan to trade the company out of difficulty rather than break it up. 'I am a great one for trying to retain what is good in a company and reluctant to sell what are the crown jewels in a depressed market,' Mr Schofield said. MTM's share price slumped from 286p to 26p in March after it failed to convince Binder Hamlyn, its auditors, to sign off its 1991 accounts and warned of profits well below expectations. The announcements triggered concern about last year's accounts, which the auditors are now reviewing. Mr Richard Lines later resigned as chairman and Mr Tom Baxter left the finance director post. Mr Lines retains a 7 per cent stake in the company, which he founded in 1979 after a career with ICI, MTM declined to comment yesterday on whether the company would have to adjust earlier years' profits and balance sheets as a result of the review by Binder Hamlyn. The board meeting held last Wednesday is understood to have discussed a draft report on the company's accounting and underlying transactions. Some details are likely to be included when MTM reports its 1991 profits next week, more than seven weeks after they were due. During his 18 months as chief executive at Hickson, Mr Schofield is widely credited with sorting out eight years of less than successful acquisitions. Mr Schofield is now seeking new non-executive directors and a new chairman. Postern, which was brought in as consultant after the resignation of Mr Lines and Mr Baxter, is to continue helping with the financial management at MTM which still lacks a finance director.

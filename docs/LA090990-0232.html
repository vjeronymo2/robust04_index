			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME 'CURES' FOR 'HOME SICK' SUFFERERS  </P> <P> We sympathize with the present generation on their predicament on the housing  situation. This family has several couples with the same problem.  </P> <P> However, we of The Older Generation, also had our "Classic Stress Syndrome" in  the '30s, '40s and '50s: very few jobs, coming out of the Depression into a war  where our lives and plans were put on hold for a long, long time, and if  youmade a salary of $90 per month, you were "King of the Mountain."  </P> <P> Yes, we did get a wonderful break from Uncle Sam -- G.I. loans at 4% -- if you  qualified. This was a pay-back for putting your life on the line for your  country.  </P> <P> Yes, and we certainly count our blessings every day of our lives.  </P> <P> So, please give The Older Generation a little TLC.  </P> <P> SIBYL SILVERTHORNE  </P> <P> La Canada  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Guangru (2621 0342 5423)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- After spending two days  in discussion meetings with directors of some areas' textile  industry departments and bureaus, and with representatives of  the textile industry, State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing  stressed, at a forum of the textile industry held on 6 April,  that if we want to solve the problems existing in the textile  industry, we must rely partly on the efforts of the industry  itself to enhance vigor, practice plain living, and work hard;  and partly on understanding and support from all quarters. He  urged all departments in all areas to take appropriate measures  to expedite the textile industry's embarking on a road of  healthy development as soon as possible.    The textile industry had made tremendous contributions to  the  motherland and her people. In his speech, Li Lanqing fully  affirmed these contributions. He said: The textile industry is  the mainstay of China's industries now and will remain so in the  future. This is because it not only meets the Chinese people's  increasing need for clothes but it also holds first place among  all of China's industries in generating foreign exchange from  exports. It is also impossible that the industry's superior  export performance will disappear in the future. Therefore,  China's textile industry has bright prospects.    The textile industry, however, faces unprecedented  challenges  and tests in the course of shifting our track from a planned  economy to a market economy. Li Lanqing said: The following  new problems have cropped up in the textile industry since early  this year. Cotton is in short supply; cotton prices have gotten  out of control; only about 42 percent of the tasks for the  allocation and transfer of cotton have been fulfilled; there has  been too sharp an increase in the prices of cotton yarn and  cotton cloth; an increasing number of enterprises have been  forced to stop production; the contradiction of a drop in the  industry's economic efficiency is very conspicuous; and the  state of the industry's exports is grim.    The supply of and demand for cotton has a direct bearing  on the normal production order of the textile industry. Because  of this, Li Lanqing pointed out: State-owned enterprises must  take control of cotton purchased by the state. It should be  allocated according to the state plan and the prices for  different grades of cotton. First of all, reselling at high  prices by state-owned enterprises to seek exorbitant profits  should be strictly prohibited. The State Planning Commission  and departments in charge of prices should work with the  relevant departments to draw up a list of prices for different  grades of cotton and have it published in newspapers. The  industrial and commercial administrative departments and other  law-enforcement departments should strengthen the management of  the markets for cotton and crack down on lawbreakers or  speculators trying to resell cotton for exorbitant profits.    To maintain the normal order in purchasing cotton, Li  Lanqing  stressed: Because cotton and hemp companies have been entrusted  by the state to purchase cotton and allocate it to various  departments, it must be allocated according to the plan.  Governments at all levels should be responsible for checking on  compliance; they should check whether provinces, cities, and  districts have fulfilled their allocation tasks. Provincial  authorities should also check compliance in the counties.  Counties which have not fulfilled their allocation tasks should  be made accountable for the missing cotton. Units or individuals  who seek profits by reselling state-distributed cotton, or who  divert it for private use must be severely punished.    Li Lanqing said: At present, it is necessary to see to it  that key export enterprises are supplied with cotton. At the  same time, it is necessary to prevent low-quality,  low-technology, and low-efficiency small cotton-weaving  enterprises from using state-allocated cotton, and also to  prevent speculation by cotton dealers. An effective measure to  ensure this is to extend loans to support key enterprises while  suspending loans to low-quality small cotton- weaving plants and  to cotton speculators. It is necessary to get to the root of  the problem by giving play to the macroeconomic regulatory role  of the money policy. Banks should quickly make arrangements to  implement the money policy.    Turning to the reform of the system for the circulation of  cotton, Li Lanqing said: Cotton is a special commodity having a  bearing on the national economy and people's lives. In the  future, neither should we follow the past method of unified  state purchasing and marketing, nor should we adopt a  laissez-faire attitude toward this matter. We should explore a  new path. We can try setting up state-owned spot wholesale  markets combining internal and foreign trade and combining  purchasing, stockpiling, and marketing. Such markets will  become the main channels for cotton purchasing, marketing, and  wholesale business, which will play the role of controlling  markets, reducing intermediate links, and ensuring supplies. In  the area of prices, we should introduce a reasonable  price-protection system in accordance with the principle of  relative interests so as to encourage cotton growers to grow  cotton and thus to ensure a balance between supply and demand.    On how to help the textile industry extricate itself from  its difficult position, Li Lanqing expressed the following  views: The first step is to "give emergency treatment and  stabilize the illness," the second step is to "treat the  illness," and the third step is to "convalesce and get better  and better." He said: The three steps are not completely  separated from one another, and they are designed to "deal with  both the root cause and the symptoms."    Analyzing the existing deep-seated problems of the textile  industry, Li Lanqing explained: During the shift from the  planned economy to the socialist market economy, the problems of  the old system will be clearly demonstrated because we can no  longer rely on a state-controlled low-price supply of raw  materials from the place of origin, because production tasks are  no longer assigned by higher-level departments, and because the  marketing of products is no longer guaranteed by the commercial  department. The existing difficulties and problems of the  textile industry are part of those problems. The textile  industry is ill in terms of its "structure," "operational  mechanisms," and "technology." For this reason, while we are  adopting measures to help the textile industry overcome  difficulties, we should also pay great attention to the  structural readjustment, enterprise reorganization, and  technological transformation of the textile industry.    Li Lanqing said: On the one hand, the current problems mean  difficulties. On the other hand, they also are an opportunity  for us to readjust the structure. First, we must vigorously  carry out a spindle-reduction transformation. In particular, we  should pay attention to the technological transformation of post  printing-and-dyeing processing to ensure a large quantity, good  quality, and high efficiency in the production of yarn and  cotton fabrics. The post printing-and-dyeing processing should  yield more patterns and designs and high added value. During  the course of the structural readjustment, some cotton-fabric  plants should be gradually relocated to cotton-producing regions  through corporations, the shareholding system, or joint  operations. In other words, we should carry out a structural  readjustment of industrial zones. This is also a measure to  narrow the gap between coastal regions and interior regions.    After explaining the concrete concept and measures for the  readjustment and reform of the textile industry, Li Lanqing  discussed enterprise reorganization. He said: We should learn  from the experience of the Beijing First Light Industry  Corporation in comprehensive and coordinated reform; should  readjust industrial structures, reorganize enterprises, improve  their operational mechanisms, resettle surplus personnel, and  arouse enthusiasm among enterprise workers and staff members.  If conditions permit, we should form joint-stock  technology-industry-trade enterprise groups, with either  industry or foreign trade as their main business, so as to take  advantage of the strength of joint operations to enhance market  competitive power.    On the export of textile goods, Li Lanqing said: We should  further the reform to improve the quality and increase the  economic returns of export goods. The Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation and the China Textile Council should  jointly formulate procedures for inviting public bids for  textile export quotas in accordance with the principle of  efficiency, fairness, and openness. The import-export chamber of  commerce should play a coordinating and guiding role. He said  that enterprises with export quotas and export permits may  engage in the production of the "two kinds of yarn and cotton  fabrics" [not further specified] by processing materials  supplied by overseas clients.    Li Lanqing especially emphasized in his speech: We should  step up the making of policies for the textile industry. They  should include the consumption policy, technology policy,  industrial organization policy, import-export policy, marketing  policy, foreign capital utilization policy, and geographic  distribution policy, as well as measures to guarantee the  implementation of these policies.    It is reported that the State Council attaches great  importance to the operations of the textile industry. Since it  was briefed by the China Textile Council in December 1993, the  State Council has issued a document based on a thorough  investigation and study. At present, all localities are  actively carrying out the 21 measures listed in the document.  The State Planning Commission, in cooperation with other  commissions and ministries, is stepping up the formulation of  the industrial policies for the textile industry. This forum,  which began a few days ago, was held in Beijing by the China  Textile Council. Present at the meeting were representatives of  some provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional textile  management departments, directors of some enterprises, and  responsible persons of some ministries and commissions  concerned. They discussed the best policies for the development  of the textile industry.</p>

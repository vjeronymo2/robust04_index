			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAWSUIT BLAMES HOSPITALS FOR INDIGENT MAN'S DEATH  </P> <P> In a case that highlights the crisis in medical care for the indigent, a  4-year-old boy sued nine hospitals -- including four in San Diego County --  Thursday, contending that his father was illegally denied medical treatment  when he was dying because he lacked private health insurance.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Patrick Jimenez in Imperial County Superior  Court, alleges that the nine hospitals violated Juan Jimenez's civil rights  when they refused to permit his transfer from Pioneers Memorial Hospital in  Brawley several days after he was critically injured by a hit-and-run driver on  May 30, 1989.  </P> <P> Jimenez, 43, a former boxer from Westminster, died of gangrene and widespread  infection at Pioneers on June 18. Believing Jimenez needed more specialized  care, administrators at Pioneers contacted nine better-equipped hospitals in  San Diego, Los Angeles and Orange counties, but none reportedly would take him,  even after his admission had been authorized by Medi-Cal.  </P> <P> Some hospitals said they could not accept him because they were full or lacked  an attending physician to accept the transfer. Others said they were not in the  Medi-Cal program or that they could not take patients from other counties.  </P> <P> Investigators from the University of California and the state Department of  Health Services determined that the nine hospitals did nothing wrong. The state  health officials' report said that Jimenez was too ill to be moved. But Daniel  H. Amos, the attorney who filed the suit, criticized those findings.  </P> <P> "The results of those investigations were wrong," he said. "This civil suit  will prove that what they did was not only reprehensible but against the law."  </P> <P> Amos said the hospitals violated a section of the state Health and Safety Code  that requires hospitals to provide life-saving services to patients regardless  of their insurance status or ability to pay.  </P> <P> Justin Clouser, general counsel for Santa Ana's Poverty Law Center, said the  case exemplifies the growing problem of hospitals "dumping" indigent patients  onto other facilities or refusing to accept them. Hospitals say they are being  pinched by rising medical costs and Medi-Cal, which reimburses them only a  small percentage of indigent patients' care.  </P> <P> Patrick's mother, Maria Chinkin, lived with Jimenez for about two years but  continued to help support their son until the father died, Amos said.  </P> <P> Jimenez's widow, Leticia Jimenez, is also planning to sue the hospitals over  her husband's death. Her lawyer, Leo J. Moriarty Jr., said he intends to file a  similar suit in Orange County Superior Court next week, and another in U.S.  District Court within a month.  </P> <P> Hospitals usually agree that they are obliged to accept emergency patients off  the street, but say that they are under no such duty to accept transfer of  patients from other facilities, Moriarty said. In his federal lawsuit, Moriarty  hopes to establish that hospitals must treat any patient in a life-threatening  condition.  </P> <P> The nine hospitals named in the lawsuit are the medical centers at UC Irvine,  UC San Diego and UCLA; Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center,  Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, St. Joseph Hospital in Orange and three  others in San Diego County: Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, Grossmont  District Hospital and Donald N. Sharp Memorial Hospital.  </P> <P> Pioneers is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, but Amos said he will not  take action against the hospital unless he discovers that it did not do enough  to facilitate Jimenez's transfer.  </P> <P> Most of the hospitals or their lawyers refused to comment on the lawsuit.  Officials at UCLA Medical Center and UC San Diego Medical Center said those  institutions acted properly in refusing the transfer.  </P> <P> Laura Avallone, a spokeswoman for Mercy Hospital, said that Mercy did not  refuse to accept Jimenez. Mercy's trauma surgeon simply failed to follow  through on the plans for the transfer, she said.  </P></p>

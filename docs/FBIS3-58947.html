This was announced by CSU  Chairman Theo Waigel on Monday evening [24 January] after a  meeting of the CDU and CSU Presidiums in Munich. The current  president of the Federal Constitutional Court, Roman Herzog, is  to be nominated as joint candidate for the office of president.    CDU Chairman Helmut Kohl decisively rejected speculation  about a grand coalition. The chancellor said that the intention  was to continue the coalition with the FDP [Free Democratic  Party]. Moreover, the voters had a right to know who the SPD  [Social Democratic Party] would work with after the elections.  Kohl conceded that there had been mutual criticism at the  strategy summit of the Union parties [CDU and CSU]. "We are not  a mutual admiration society in which everyone adores everyone  else," he said. Waigel stressed before the summit that the  Union parties see the SPD as their main opponent. [passage  omitted]    Talking about the issue of Europe, the chancellor stressed  that the CDU wanted to remain the "classical party for Europe."  There were no ifs and buts in its support for European  integration. In the European elections it had to be made clear  to the citizen that peace and freedom could only be lastingly  secured on the basis of the Maastricht Treaty.</p>

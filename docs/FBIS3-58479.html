			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Maria Joao Rocha report: "PSP and Platform in Harmony"] </F>   [Excerpt] Antonio Guterres, Jose Lamego, Jorge Lacao, and  Jorge Coelho received Barros Moura, Pina Moura, and Raimundo  Narciso at the Largo do Rato [Socialist party headquarters]  yesterday. The aim of the the meeting between the Socialists  and the Left-Wing Platform was to extend political cooperation  to the main PSP [Portuguese Socialist Party] initiatives and  challenges.    It was also the first in a series of meetings following the  local elections. The meetings will culminate in a new agreement  protocol for the European elections, to be signed probably  within two months.    Barros Moura reaffirmed his willingness to be an independent  candidate on the PSP lists, a euphemistic way of confirming his  presence in an eligible position. The matter is uncontentious.    It is more difficult for [PSP Secretary General] Antonio  Guterres to succeed in placing all the available candidates in  the first 10 places on the list. The placements are being left  until after the congress.    At the end of yesterday's meeting, Barros Moura and Guterres  were in perfect harmony on the philosophy of the States General  for a new majority.    "It is not a left-wing majority. It has been proved that it  is not sufficient to combine the left-wing votes in order to  defeat the PSD [Social Democratic Party]," the Platform leader  asserted. The PSP leader did not improve on that.  <H5>  Differences Between Congress and States General </H5>   Guterres does not seem to be losing any sleep over the  "Portugal: What Future?" congress, promoted by the president of  the republic, being now more concerned about the convention and  the placements on the list for the European Parliament.    The PSP secretary general asserts that the congress and the  "States General for a new majority" are initiatives of a  different nature made at different times.    The holding of the "Portugal: What Future?" congress in May  could undermine one of the actions which the Socialists had  planned in order to create a political dynamic following the  European elections; that is, at the decisive starting point for  the parliamentary elections.    The timing would not be the only disruptive element. Mario  Soares' stance in favor of a rapprochement between the PSP and  the PCP [Portuguese Communist Party] in a left-wing front in  order to defeat the PSD is well known.    During the congress, the matter will still be on the agenda,  and this will force Antonio Guterres to dot the i's and cross  the t's.    Yesterday, the PSP leader reaffirmed that the party will  "discuss its own government blueprint as widely as possible.  Hence to form an alliance with the PCP would be to cheat the  electorate." These are statements which he will certainly have  to reaffirm until May.    The Socialist leader declined to comment on the presidential  initiative's intentions, deemed it an important event involving  civil society, but explained that "our concern is not just to  unite the left; it is to find a coherent political majority for  the country."

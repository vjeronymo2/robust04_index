			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Police investigate pension scheme FRAUD SQUAD detectives are trying to trace about Pounds 1m missing from the pension scheme of Peak Design, the collapsed Derbyshire furniture manufacture. Derbyshire police said yesterday that the investigation had been launched after a complaint from Bradstock Trustee Services, the independent trustees of the scheme. The Derbyshire fraud squad investigation centres on pension fund assets of between Pounds 900,000 and Pounds 1m which the trustees have been unable to trace. The detectives are trying to contact the company's chairman, Mr Ted Hunter. Peak Design went into receivership on January 24. Halifax Property Services said yesterday that before then they had been asked by Mr Hunter to handle the sale of his home which is valued at Pounds 595,000. The home was vacated earlier this month. Bradstock said that since March 2 it had taken control of assets worth just over Pounds 100,000, but that assets of 'around Pounds 1m are missing'. Mr Tim Culverstone, a director of Bradstock, said the records were not complete, but about Pounds 980,000 appeared to be missing including: Pounds 50,000 in purchases of shares in the company which were now worthless. A Pounds 330,000 loan to the company plus interest which now seemed unlikely to be repaid. A Pounds 300,000 loan to another pension scheme involving Mr Hunter. Pounds 300,000 spent buying property on the south coast from Weybridge Consultants, a company which was controlled by Mr Hunter. Mr Culverstone said a company search by the solicitors Evershed Wells &amp; Hind on behalf of the independent trustees revealed that the south coast properties had recently been transferred to Wynston Investments, registered in Gibraltar. The address of that company, 28 Irish Town, Gibraltar, is that of a firm of lawyers, Triay &amp; Triay. Mr Giles Orton of Evershed said his firm was still investigating possible links between Mr Hunter and the Gibraltar company and 'may have to sort out who owns the property.' Mr Culverstone said he was 'very concerned' about the position of the 83 members of the pension scheme. Peak Design closed its plant at Alfreton, Derbyshire, last month with the loss of 106 jobs. Touche Ross, administrative receivers for the company, said last night that since the pension scheme had been terminated in April 1990 beneficiaries had been engaged in discussions with the company on what they claimed was money owing to them. Touche Ross confirmed that Mr Hunter was one of two former trustees of the company.</p>

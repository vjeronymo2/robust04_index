			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Wei (0491 0251): "Tibet Scores Notable Results in </F> Establishing Lateral Economic Ties With Other Localities of  China"]    [Text] Lhasa, 5 June (RENMIN RIBAO) -- Tibet has scored  results in establishing lateral economic ties with many  provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the  hinterland. At present, there are 240 wholly owned, joint  venture, or partnership enterprises in Tibet. In the last eight  years, contracts on 600 economic coordination projects have been  signed involving an investment of 700 million yuan.    In establishing lateral economic ties with the hinterland,  Tibet has upheld the principle of combining giving play to  superior local natural resources with the introduction of new  techniques. The Lhasa Cement Plant succeeded in raising its  cement quality to state standards and eliminated its  long-standing losses by establishing a joint venture with the  Sichuan Emei Cement Plant, which helped import an advanced  production line. The Lhasa Farm Machinery Gypsum Plant overcame  difficulties by introducing new techniques for producing gypsum  from the Hunan Zhuzhou New Building Materials Factory and the  Zhengzhou Design Institute. Last year Tibet approved 41 joint  venture projects ranging from transportation to light industry,  textiles, commerce, and trade.    Tibet has also invested in other localities to make money.  Since 1991, Tibet has set up 39 productive and operating  enterprises in 18 provinces and autonomous regions in the  hinterland involving an investment of 170 million yuan. Out of  39 projects, 25 are profitable, with annual earnings amounting  to 46 million yuan, while certain enterprises recovered their  investment in the same year they made the investment.</p>

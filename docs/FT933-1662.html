			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Worner wary on Bosnia Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, yesterday met Nato officials in Brussels to gather support for a Nato peacekeeping force in Bosnia, writes Gillian Tett. But after meeting the mediators, Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, insisted that Nato would not send troops to Bosnia indefinitely and would need clear military goals before any deployment. His comments came as the mediators warned that the peacekeepers could become involved in the fighting. Although Nato has said it could deploy 50,000 peacekeepers, on top of the 15,000 UN protection forces already in the former Yugoslavia, no firm decision has been taken, and some alliance officials remain wary of engaging in a conflict which could potentially undermine Nato's credibility.</p>

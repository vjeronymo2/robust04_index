			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The stage is set for a volatile few days in the bund market ahead of two significant events later this week. On Thursday, the Bundesbank's policy-making council holds its traditional 'out of town' meeting, this year in the east German city of Potsdam, near Berlin. As usual, the meeting will be followed by a press conference in which Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, is likely to comment on the state of the German economy and field questions on the course of monetary policy. At around the same time - perhaps at the press conference itself - the Bundesbank is set to unveil details of M3 money supply in May. After growth of more than 15 per cent on an annualised, seasonally adjusted basis in the previous two months, the consensus forecast is for a modest reduction in the rate of growth to about 14.5 per cent. Any more than that and the market will be disappointed. Evidence of a slowdown in bank lending or a pick-up in long-term capital formation will be deemed positive. For the past two years the out of town meeting has gone hand-in-hand with a piece of good news. Last year in Leipzig, the Bundesbank cut the discount rate. This is unlikely to be repeated on Thursday but the central bank may have other surprises up its sleeve.</p>

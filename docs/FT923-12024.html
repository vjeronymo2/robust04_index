			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Merck shows second-quarter growth MERCK, the world's biggest drugs company, said sales growth from new products contributed to its 18 per cent increase in second-quarter net profits, to Dollars 653.4m. The results, a continuation of the US company's first-quarter performance, were struck on the back of a 12 per cent rise in sales for the second quarter, to Dollars 2.38bn. Merck's earnings per share were 57 cents, against 48 cents in the second quarter of last year. Although the Merck results represented a continuing improvement, Wall Street marked the company's share price Dollars  5/8 lower, to Dollars 49 3/8 . Second-quarter results from American Cyanamid, the US pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals group, were also encouraging. Net earnings rose 11.9 per cent to Dollars 147.5m - on a per-share basis the improvement was 14.9 per cent, to Dollars 1.62. American Cyanamid's second-quarter sales were 4 per cent improved at Dollars 1.48bn. The company's share price was unchanged at Dollars 58 in late trading. Commenting on the Merck results, Dr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, said both domestic and international operations reported solid unit volume gains. Sales outside the US accounted for 46 per cent of first-half 1992 total revenues of Dollars 4.6bn. Dr Vagelos said excluding foreign exchange adjustments, second-quarter sales were 11 per cent higher. Among the products helping to boost Merck's performance was the recently introduced Proscar drug, designed to treat prostate enlargement. Vasotec, which reduces high blood pressure and treats heart failure, also did well, as did Vaseretic and Prinivil, two other blood pressure drugs. The New Jersey-based American Cyanamid said increased crop protection chemicals sales helped its agricultural division earnings. Ethical drugs and medical devices led the improved performance in the group's medical division. But higher promotional costs associated with the introduction of the group's anti-smoking nicotine patch affected earnings. Chemical division sales and operating earnings were down in the second quarter because of lower military demand for chemical light products and higher manufacturing costs for that line. Bristol-Myers Squibb, the world's third biggest pharmaceuticals company, yesterday unveiled slightly lower second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 488m, against Dollars 489.5m a year ago, after taking a special charge to settle legal and federal regulatory actions. The company, which recorded five per cent higher second-quarter revenues of Dollars 2.88bn, took a Dollars 46m pre-tax charge as a result of its agreement to settle an anti-trust lawsuit involving claims that the company conspired to rig the prices of infant formula. Mead Johnson, the Bristol-Myers infant formula division, also recently agreed to a settlement of charges by the Federal Trade Commission that the company, together with two other infant formula makers - Abbott Laboratories and American Home Products - engaged in price rigging and other improper trading practices. Mr Richard Gelb, chairman of Bristol-Myers Squibb, said US sales were unchanged while international sales were 14 per cent higher in the quarter, with foreign exchange fluctuations helping sales by one per cent. Earnings per share were unchanged at 94 cents. On Wall Street, the company's share price was marked Dollars 1 higher to Dollars 66. Eli Lilly, the US pharmaceuticals company, yesterday unveiled a 7 per cent increase in second-quarter net earnings to Dollars 338.2m, or Dollars 1.16, from Dollars 317.5m, or Dollars 1.08 a year earlier. Sales also rose 7 per cent, to Dollars 1.48bn from Dollars 1.38bn, writes Karen Zagor in New York. For the first six months of 1992, Lilly's net earnings advanced 11 per cent to Dollars 780.8m, or Dollars 2.67 from Dollars 706.1m, or Dollars 2.43 in the same period of last year. Sales were 8 per cent higher at Dollars 3.04bn from Dollars 2.81bn.</p>

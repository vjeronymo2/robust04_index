			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 6 (AFP) -- A convoy of French UN  peacekeepers has been held up for a week by around 100 Serb  women in a village near Sarajevo, a spokesman for UN Protection  Forces [UNPROFOR] said here Wednesday [6 April].    The women who have blocked 34 military staff and 16 army  vehicles since March 31 in the village of Hadzici are demanding  the release of their husbands, held captive by mainly Moslem  Bosnian government troops.    The convoy from the French Second Battalion was travelling  from Sarajevo to Split when it was held up in Hadzici, 20  kilometers (12 miles) west of the Bosnian capital.    "They are in constant contact with their unit, either in  person or by radio, the situation is very calm and they are not  at risk," Lieutenant Colonel Richard Pernod, spokesman for  UNPROFOR in Sarajevo, told AFP.    Top-level negotiations to free the convoy were continuing  Wednesday after a week of fruitless talks.    UNPROFOR civil affairs chief for former Yugoslavia Sergio  Vieira de Mello tried to find a breakthrough Tuesday when he met  Nikola Koljevic, deputy leader of the Bosnian Serbs, in the Serb  headquarters at Pale near Sarajevo.    But Koljevic said the Pale authorities had no real control  over Serbs in Hadzici, UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said  Wednesday, adding that Mello believed the convoy would be  released soon.</p>

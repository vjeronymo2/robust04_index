Hojjat ol-Eslam Moqasiyeh, supervisor of the Antinarcotics  Public Prosecutor's Office, gave a speech in which he said in  this regard: Last year was a year in which much work was done at  the public prosecutor's office and by the police, and everywhere  there were more narcotics seizures, more arrests of addicts and  smugglers, and more narcotics procurement and distribution gangs  were destroyed. New changes also began in this regard. The  increased seizure statistics in the country show the greater  efficiency and activity of antinarcotics agents, while in some  countries where there are more addicts, smugglers and narcotics,  the statistics on seizures and arrests are much lower.    He added: In the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]  19,713 cases were filed and investigated, and 71.6 metric tons  of seized narcotics in the country were delivered to factories  for conversion in the pharmaceutical industries.    He also added: In view of the fact that the antinarcotics  campaign is a sacred struggle, sacred procedures, methods, and  individuals must also be employed in this regard, and sound  individuals must be used.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (2): Market reserves its judgment - The economy / There are still clouds on the horizon LATE LAST year, when Mr Suleyman Demirel's coalition government took office, many Turkish businessmen made little secret of their misgivings. For Mr Demirel was last in power 12 years earlier, when inflation soared to three-digit figures, Turkey suffered its worst-ever balance of payments deficit and industry was paralysed. Nearly six months on, the market is still reserving its judgment, but it is clear that times have changed. The Suleyman Demirel of the 1990s believes in privatisation, realistic exchange rates and - in theory at least - fiscal reform. Turkey does not look as if it is about to be plunged into a fresh economic crisis. That said, there are still plenty of clouds on the horizon. Though Turkey is managing to keep its external payments under control and last year ran a surplus of Dollars 272m on its current account, the economy failed to shake off a recession which began with the Gulf War. Gross National Product grew by only 0.3 per cent in 1991 in an economy where growth has averaged between 5 and 6 per cent a year over the past three decades. Worse still, inflation went up to 71.1 per cent from 60.4 per cent in 1990 and from the middle of the year, monetary disciplines were abandoned as it became clear that there would be a general election. Six months on, monetary self-restraint has not returned. Consumer prices jumped by an alarming 9 per cent in January, by 5.4 per cent in February and 4.9 per cent in March, taking inflation to 78.7 per cent for the previous 12-month period. Does this mean that Turkey is on the way to triple-digit inflation? Probably not, says Mr Deniz Gokce, professor of economics at the Bosphorus University in Istanbul. He predicts that inflation will slacken this year though probably not as sharply as official forecasts, but that GNP growth will also be relatively disappointing. On the other hand, Turkey's balance of payments seems to be under control despite a foreign debt burden of around Dollars 43bn. Turkey's trade deficit fell by 20 per cent in 1991, largely because demand for imports was very slack. Exports rose by 4.9 per cent to Dollars 13.6bn (1990: Dollars 12.96bn) while imports dropped by 5.7 per cent from Dollars 22.3bn to Dollars 21.04bn. As a result, the trade deficit was down from Dollars 9.3bn in 1990 to Dollars 7.4bn. Despite this improvement, foreign currency reserves held by the central bank have slipped by about Dollars 1bn from Dollars 5.1bn at the start of the year to Dollars 4.08bn, mainly because Turks are selling Turkish liras and buying foreign currency as the local currency plummets ever further and faster against the US dollar and the Deutschemark. The main reason for the currency's ever-faster decline appears to be the widening public sector deficit. The 1992 budget has been set at TL208 trillion, and an unchanged TL32 trillion deficit is planned, a target which bankers drily describe as 'implausible' since it would mean a reduction of about a third in the deficit in real terms at a time when government spending is shooting upwards and public revenues are languishing. Official projections are that tax revenues should be TL175.9bn, or about four-fifths of total government revenues. Around TL3.5 trillion will be raised from privatisations. Whether things will work out quite like this is another matter. There are few candidates for quick, profitable privatisations and the government does not seem to have the stomach to introduce unpopular new taxes in what may, after all, turn out to be another election year. The government announced a new package of tax reforms and other economic measures on January 17. The main feature appears to be a sharp increase in indirect taxation. It has also launched a controversial tax amnesty, intended to enable the Treasury to get at least part of the unpaid taxes it is owed. Both sets of measures have yet to prove their effectiveness. The government wants to press ahead with privatisation operations, but five agencies will not be sold off: TMO (the state grain organisation); TEK (the electricity authority); PTT; TCDD (state railways); and Tekel, the alcohol and tobacco monopoly. The trouble is that this list includes the main loss-makers. If these cannot be privatised, perhaps some of them at least - for example, the Zonguldak coal mines - could be shut down. That solution would please international agencies such as the World Bank, but it is probably too radical for Mr Demirel to contemplate. The burden of public sector losses is a heavy one. Most of Turkey's larger industrial enterprises were set up by the state between the 1930s and 1950s and were never designed to run at a profit. More than TL11,997bn was lost by 18 state industries in 1991. The top loss-makers were TEK (the electricity authority) which lost TL4,326bn, TCDD (state railways) TL3,269bn; and the Turkish Coal board (TL3,264bn) and the TD (iron and steel works which lost TL2,619bn). But not all the public sector industries make a loss. Eight state industries made money: Tekel, the state alcoholic beverages and tobacco monopoly made a profit of TL1,378bn, while TPAO, the petroleum prospecting agency made profits of TL1,289bn and the Post Office made TL1,229bn. The complaint most generally heard is that Mr Demirel's economics team makes grandiose promises but is short on a focused economy strategy. Mrs Tansu Ciller, minister of state in charge of the economy, does not seem to have the clout (or familiarity with the labyrinthine ways of the Turkish bureaucracy) to match the men who dominated the Turkish economy in the Ozal era. Instead she seems to be losing ground to Mr Cavit Caglar, another minister of state and president of the High Council on Credit and Mr Tevfik Altinok, the undersecretary of the treasury and foreign trade, a veteran treasury official who has spent most of the past decade working in Istanbul with Koc, Turkey's largest industrial conglomerate. Few of the new appointees have the international whizz-kid touch which distinguished the top economic officials in the Ozal era and though statism is out of fashion as an economic philosophy in Ankara, there also seems to be little enthusiasm for exposing the economy to more competition, particularly from the outside world, though on the foreign trade front, Turkey is pledged to achieving a customs union with both the European Community and Efta by 1996. Only one of Mr Ozal's men, Mr Rusdu Saracaoglu, the 43-year old central bank governor, has survived and his prospects look uncertain. The hardest choices probably still lie ahead. If Mr Demirel truly wants to stabilise the economy, he is going to have to turn a deaf ear to the pleas of state employees and farmers for more pay. A fresh round of public sector pay negotiations got under way this spring and the coalition government's social democratic minister of labour is planning changes to the law which would give unions much more power than they have enjoyed in the past. Agricultural support prices may prove an even trickier issue. Mr Demirel's main power base is the farming population of western Turkey. Once upon a time, Turkish farmers could count on the government to hold agricultural support prices high, allowing (untaxed) rural incomes to rise. The military and Mr Ozal put a stop to that way of doing things after the 1980 coup. If Mr Demirel reverses that trend this summer to please the farmers, Mr Altinok and the Treasury will face a gruelling time in 1993. But there is no way that the main reforms of the 1980s can be reversed, even if there is still plenty of scope for opening up the economy to genuine market competition.</p>

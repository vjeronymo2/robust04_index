			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 17 KYODO -- A team of three inspectors  from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Beijing  for Pyongyang on Tuesday [17 May] to undertake inspections of a  North Korean nuclear power station at Yongbyon.    The team is expected to monitor the refueling of a  5-megawatt  experimental nuclear reactor and inspect a nuclear laboratory  suspected of producing nuclear weapons at Yongbyon near  Pyongyang.    Team leader Olli Heinonen disclosed little to journalists  about his mission as he prepared to leave Beijing's capital  airport.    "You know our rules are such that we have to evaluate the  results, and we take samples and we analyze them and after that  we tell what we think. So there will be no comment whatsoever,"  he said.    Heinonen said the inspections will last about a week.    The (North) KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA) said Saturday  the fuel rod replacement has begun and the seals on the  reactor's fuel rods have been broken.    Such moves would be in violation of agreements between the  IAEA and North Korea, an IAEA official in Vienna said, and could  signal the recall of the inspectors.    Removal of the seals would make it impossible to determine  whether plutonium has been diverted to North Korea's suspected  nuclear weapons program, experts said.    The inspection team has been sent "to see for ourselves,"  Heinonen said.    The IAEA and the United States have been involved in 15  months of drawn-out negotiations with North Korea to verify the  extent of its nuclear program and to confirm whether or not the  Stalinist state has developed a nuclear weapon.    An IAEA inspection group also led by Heinonen were refused  entry into the Yongbyon Laboratory during an inspection tour  last March, which led to further calls for UN sanctions against  the North.</p>

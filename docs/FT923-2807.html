			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Arts: Today's Television There is a large amount of drama tonight, most of it clashing as usual. The 2-hour Inspector Morse on Channel 4 (8.30) shown previously on ITV, is, once again, set in Oxford, this time in the university. Morse is called in when an environmentalist is murdered just before he is due to give a lecture. The fashionable subject of child abuse is well to the fore. The even more trendy subject of transvestism is at the heart of BBC2's 'ScreenPlay', A Little Bit Of Lippy (9.00). When Marian finds women's knickers in husband Rick's laundry she goes back to mum, only to discover that there is no other woman but that Rick likes wearing the underwear himself. Obsession (10.40 ITV) is a 1976 Hitchcock-type movie about a man who meets the double of his dead wife. But a lot of people will be watching BBC1's Inside Story (10.00) about today's white slave trade. Thousands of women from poor countries are lured into the stripping and prostitution business. Using hidden cameras it follows the trade from the Caribbean to sex syndicates in Europe run by a 'Dutch based' gang who work the women for as much as 15 hours a day.</p>

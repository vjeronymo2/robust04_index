			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Report by NAEWOE News Agency"] </F>   [Text] North Korea stressed that in preparation for  economic sanctions against the North as a result of its refusal  of nuclear inspections, it will strengthen independence in its  economy so that its economy can be self-reliant in the future  under any situation.    In yesterday's special article [nonsol], North Korean  Central  Broadcast Radio [chungang pangsong] reported that North Korea  will win a brilliant victory in implementing new economic  strategies under the leadership of Kim Chong-il, and that the  economic tasks promoted by North Korea can be carried out as  long as there is a revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.</p>

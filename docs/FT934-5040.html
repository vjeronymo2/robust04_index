			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Insurance tax set at 3% Liability to pay and account for the new insurance premium tax of 3 per cent will rest with the insurance company, which will be required to register with, and make monthly returns to, Customs &amp; Excise, the Treasury said. The new tax, which takes effect from October 1 1994, will apply to most general insurance where the insured risk is located in the UK. It will not apply to long-term insurance such as life insurance or pensions - much of which, says the government, is essentially investment. Insurers not established in the UK will be required to appoint a representative to account for the tax on their behalf. Policy-holders may be liable if they insure direct with non-UK insurers which do not have a fiscal representative. Tax will be due on all monies received by the insurance company (or a third party) in respect of the insurance contract, but will not apply to brokers' commission. Customs and Excise said it would discuss implementation and operation of the tax with the insurance industry. The tax is expected to yield Pounds 295m in 1994-95, Pounds 775m in 1995-96 and Pounds 840m in 1996-97.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Caution on Steel results THE STOCK market's concern over the climate for corporate dividend payments faced its first test yesterday when British Steel disclosed its results. The shares retreated 6 to 61p, recording the day's sharpest fall among FT-SE 100 stocks, mostly in reaction to analysts' disappointment at the meeting with the directors following the release of the figures. The Pounds 55m loss reported was better than market forecasts and, as predicted, the company cut the dividend payout, making a total of 4.5p against 8.75p last year. At the analysts meeting, however, the company warned that future dividend payments would depend on steel prices. With prices currently weak and forecast to remain so, analysts took the board's comments as potential for further dividend cuts. Smith New Court was reported to have been a big seller yesterday afternoon and turnover in British Steel shares reached 18m by the close. The broker now expects a current year loss of Pounds 125m, against a previous estimate of Pounds 135m. Charterhouse Tilney forecasts a deficit of Pounds 140m. No respite for BP There was no respite for British Petroleum shares from the selling prompted by last week's dramatic boardroom developments. The stock market is steeling itself for news on the dividend from the company's presentation to oil sector analysts in London at lunchtime today. Suggestions that at least one big Japanese institution had decided to sharply reduce its holding in BP triggered another big sell-off. The shares came under heavy pressure within minutes of the opening and closed at 200p, a fall of 10. Last week the stock lost almost 17 per cent of its value. The Japanese institution was said to have sold 10m shares during the morning and then returned as a big seller during the afternoon. Mr Alan Marshall, oil sector analyst at Nomura, the Japanese-owned stockbroker, said he expected BP to halve the dividend and said the shares 'are a sell down to 160p'. There was, however, evidence of good buying interest as the shares moved towards the 200p mark. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was believed to be a keen supporter of the shares. And County NatWest shifted its stance from 'long term underperform' to 'neutral', saying the stock is starting to look reasonable value against other oil shares. Fisons wanted Renewed rumours that Fisons might attract the attentions of a predator ensured that the pharmaceuticals company held up in a generally weak sector. Press comment at the weekend suggesting that the company might prove vulnerable to a takeover following the recent drop in its share price - after an interim profits warning - prompted the stock to rise 13 at one stage. The shares slipped back with the market but managed to remain one of the strongest performers among the FT-SE 100 constituents with a net gain of 5 at 200p. Mooted bidder ICI eased 2 to 1221p. Arjo weakens Paper group Arjo Wiggins Appleton dropped 17 to 226p after the company broker and one agency broker cut profits forecasts. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, Arjo's broker, adjusted this year's figure by Pounds 8m to Pounds 205m and the 1993 estimate by Pounds 30m to Pounds 235m. At the same time, James Capel moved down to Pounds 210m for this year and Pounds 245m for 1993. Capel's Mr Jonathan Helliwell said he had adjusted his figures because: 'The pulp price is starting to move up and paper prices are not yet following, so margins are being squeezed.' It is believed that UBS had the same rationale. However, Credit Lyonnais Laing believes the shares are a buy at these levels and was, last night, preparing a note recommending the stock. Worries that British Gas could face a strike by 45,000 white collar workers who rejected a 4.3 per cent pay offer unsettled the shares, which dipped 1 1/2 to 242 1/2 p. Lasmo closed 4 higher at 181p, after 183p, with most sector specialists disregarding stories that a bid for the group is in the offing. A successful presentation to big investment institutions in Japan last week helped Thames Water to maintain its recent momentum, the stock closing 5 higher at 435p on good turnover of 2.5m. North West Water, which has also visited Japanese institutions, climbed 12 to 437p. Insurance issues remained weak as analysts pondered the possibility of dividend cuts and the effect of the latest hurricane damage in California. General Accident fell 14 to 477p, Royal 12 to 226p and Sun Alliance 14 to 293p. Amber Day jumped 13 to 51p on strong turnover of 2.2m shares after retail and office property management group In Shops confirmed recent speculation that 'a bid approach is being considered'. In Shops slipped 10 to 74p after the company said it would approach Midland Montagu, its financial adviser, this week to discuss an offer. Reports of a disappointing presentation at the base of Holiday Inns in Atlanta, Georgia, hurt the shares of parent company Bass on the London market, but analysts suggested the retreat of 16 to 581p may have been overdone. Internationally traded Glaxo and Wellcome fell 18 to 675p and 15 to 872p respectively, reflecting a weak dollar and poor defensive stocks in the US. Glaxo was further affected by a downgrading from US investment house Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Wellcome also suffered from doubts raised in the weekend press about its forthcoming share flotation. Hotel group Forte dipped 3 to 206p as the lack of a conclusion to the sale of its Gardner Merchant catering subsidiary to Compass Group and US competitor ARA continued to hang over the stock. After the recent good run in Thorn-EMI, County NatWest moved from a buy to a hold on the stock, which weakened 12 to 818p. A warning that first-half profits at Heywood Williams, the building products group, could fall prompted an immediate slide of 43 to 288p. BM Group plummeted 83 to 150p, the worst fall of the day, on talk of accounting worries. There were also reports that Kleinwort Benson had cut profits expectations following a meeting with the company. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (17).

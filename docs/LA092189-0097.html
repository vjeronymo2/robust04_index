			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUTURE IFFY ON BILL TO CONTROL ILLEGAL ROADS IN SANTA MONICAS  </P> <P> As Santa Monica Mountains preservationists urged its approval, Gov. George  Deukmejian is expected to act soon on a bill that would enable the California  Coastal Commission to crack down faster on illegal bulldozing and  road-building.  </P> <P> But commission officials are prepared for the governor to veto the legislation,  sponsored by state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia). Deukmejian is a longtime  antagonist of the coastal protection agency and has cut its budget in five of  the last six years.  </P> <P> Coastal Commission officials asked Davis to carry the bill on the theory that,  as a conservative Republican, he would get a sympathetic hearing from  Deukmejian.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Restraining Order  </P> <P> Davis' legislation would give Coastal Commission officials power to issue  immediate stop-work orders against developers who break state coastal  preservation laws. It also provides for fines of up to $6,000 a day against  developers who ignore such orders.  </P> <P> The commission must now ask the state attorney general to get a judge to issue  a temporary restraining order to halt alleged violations. If a restraining  order is violated, the court can impose fines of as much as $5,000 per day.  </P> <P> Nancy Cave, the commission's only statewide enforcement officer, said that  process often takes a week, a period that is often sufficient for developers to  complete their illegal work.  </P> <P> Illegal grading and road construction have become problems in the Santa Monica  Mountains and along the Malibu coast, where the lure of enormous profits to be  made from building expensive homes far exceeds the threat of state fines for  developers who build roads or landscape illegally, officials say.  </P> <P> A staff shortage has left the commission with a backlog of more than 600 such  alleged violations statewide, more than half of them in Los Angeles and Orange  counties, Cave said Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 20% in Mountains  </P> <P> Cave, who supervises five part-time enforcement officers, said the commission  is able to pursue only about 75 of the most serious violations at any one time.  About 20% of those cases have occurred in the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> The Davis bill would authorize the commission to issue a stop-work order in a  single day, quickly halting further environmental damage, she said. "We'd be  taken more seriously by the community of alleged violators," Cave said.  </P> <P> Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains  Conservancy, a state agency that buys land for the Santa Monica Mountains  National Recreation Area, said the bill, if enacted, would provide an effective  weapon against "midnight bulldozing operations."  </P> <P> He cited a fire road in upper Ramirez Canyon behind Malibu that state officials  say was paved recently without permits. He said that the road was completed  over a weekend and that coastal officials should have had the authority to halt  such a project immediately.  </P> <P> The legislation is opposed by the California Chamber of Commerce and the  California Farm Bureau Federation, which argue that it infringes on property  owners' rights.  </P> <P> John Gamper, a farm bureau spokesman, said the bill damages owners' due-process  rights by giving blanket authority to state bureaucrats to order construction  projects stopped immediately, rather than turning disputes over to a judge, who  would make a decision after hearing both sides.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Issue of Time  </P> <P> But commission officials noted that the bill would require them to notify  developers before issuing a 60-day stop-work order and that the order could be  challenged in court.  </P> <P> Davis, a former Los Angeles police chief who has sharply criticized the Coastal  Commission, said his bill is a law-and-order issue.  </P> <P> "There's absolutely no reason to obey the law now because of the law of  economics," he said. "We shouldn't sanction these kinds of criminals."  </P> <P> Davis said he will press Deukmejian Administration officials to support his  bill, but a Deukmejian spokesman said the governor "is not expected to look  favorably on the bill."  </P></p>

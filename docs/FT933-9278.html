			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Advertising upturn lifts CIA CIA GROUP, the independent advertising media buyer, yesterday announced pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 1.87m to Pounds 1.89m in the six months to June 30, as clients returned to more normal budget patterns. Mr Chris Ingram, chairman, said: 'Half year comparisons with 1992 have been adversely affected by a shift in our business towards the second half of the year, after an unusually even split last year.' He said all companies in the group would show increased sales in the full-year. Turnover rose to Pounds 122.9m (Pounds 116.3m) on the back of increased spending by clients and new business. Mr Ingram said: 'There are some small signs of the recession ending in the UK, but we are seeing recessionary patterns in continental Europe.' Operating and administration costs increased to Pounds 5.57m (Pounds 4.94m), reflecting investment in new senior management and start-up costs of the Billett Consultancy business. Investment income was lower at Pounds 310,000 (Pounds 753,000) as UK interest rates fell and cash decreased to Pounds 7m (Pounds 8m), mainly because of CIA's purchase of a 45 per cent stake in Blufin of Italy. The interim dividend goes up to 1.46p (1.32p), payable from earnings of 8.3p (8.59p) per share.</p>

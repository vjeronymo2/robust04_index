			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLUE LINE OPENS FOR LOS ANGELES AREA COMMUTERS  </P> <P> Permit me to describe my day, July 18. I am a lawyer with a fairly busy  appointment calendar. I had an appointment at the Compton Courthouse at 8:30  a.m., but then a light day back at the office on Wilshire Boulevard. I live in  Granada Hills.  </P> <P> I drove to the office with my law partner. We arrived at 7:15 a.m. I then  walked one block to catch an air-conditioned bus, which transported me to  Wilshire and Figueroa. Upon my arrival, I walked one block to Figueroa and 7th  Street. I jumped on a sleek, air-conditioned shuttle bus for a short trip to  Pico and Flower. To these eyes, which were born in Santa Monica, raised and  strained in a car on a freeway, the sight of a Bay Area-type transit terminal,  with gleaming signs, freshly painted fences and smiling transit workers was  something for the ages. I approached the new train car, found an empty seat and  thanked the heavens again for air-conditioning. It was just 7:45 a.m.  </P> <P> As we proceeded along the tracks, I saw the jealousy written on the faces of  already weary motorists along Washington Boulevard. We passed through some  areas of town I rarely see. I had never seen the Watts Towers before. At  precisely 8:30 a.m. we rolled into the Compton Station. I walked to the  courthouse and 1 hour later, business completed, I made my way back to the  train station. I waited just 5 minutes, caught an amazingly full train, and  proceeded in comfort back to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> I got back to Pico and Flower, feeling refreshed and relaxed. My limo (I'm  sorry, shuttle) was waiting to take me to Figueroa and 7th, and to my Wilshire  bus for the trip back to the office. I put in a usual day at the office, then  proceeded to take a freeway flyer bus to the Valley where I made a smooth  connection to a bus that dropped me off 650 feet from my home.  </P> <P> No, I cannot take public transit every day. For the sake of all of us in this  urban soup, I ask but one small favor of my fellow city or suburban dwellers. I  did my part on July 18, and yes, I even rather enjoyed it. When I rejoin the  mad freeway rush, won't someone else take my place on the bus or train. Who  knows, maybe someday we will once again see 35 miles per hour on the Hollywood  Freeway between 7 and 9 a.m.  </P> <P> GARY N. STERN  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

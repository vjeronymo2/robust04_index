Winai called for Chamlong, the  party founder who is known to have the final say on party  policies, to make a decision once and for all as to whether the  Phalang Tham would remain within the coalition or not.    In an interview with THE NATION on Saturday, Winai did not  mention Chamlong by name but he was apparently referring to the  party founder, who has come out to attack the coalition on  several issues and occasions. "If (Chamlong and the religious  wing) feel that the Phalang Tham stands to lose from remaining  in the coalition, they should discuss it inside the party,"  Winai said. "It's okay if they announce a pullout from the  government. I won't object to it. But we should not be a cry  baby in public."    Winai said the Phalang Tham members who were not happy  working with the government should have proposed a pull-out to a  party meeting. "So far, no one has proposed it to any party  meeting. You can check with any deputy party leader...had this  proposal been made in a party meeting, everything would have  ended," Winai said.    Winai's comments indicated serious rifts in the Phalang Tham  between the religious wing and those who hold Cabinet posts.  Earlier reports had it that the religious wing would like to  pull out of the coalition, but Phalang Tham's Cabinet members  resisted. Several Phalang Tham leaders have denied the reports.    Winai was being interviewed by THE NATION shortly after a  member of the religious wing, Chaiwat Sinsuwong, quit as deputy  Bangkok governor. Chaiwat, known to be loyal to Chamlong,  called on the party to review its role as a coalition partner  after Phalang Tham lost local elections in Bangkok on March 6.  "Don't shout outside the party. Don't act as somebody's  follower or somebody else's mouthpiece," Winai said, apparently  referring to Chaiwat and Chamlong. The communications minister  said it would be "justified" for the Phalang Tham to criticize  the government if it was an opposition party.    "I worry that what has happened will affect the  government('s  stability). One party should not be allowed to sink a boat  that's being rowed by five parties." Winai said the Phalang Tham  was acting like it was rocking the coalition boat instead of  trying to learn to work with other government partners. "To work  in a five-partner coalition, we must not put our foot in the  water while others are rowing.    "I am sure that we and our friends in the government feel  uneasy about our criticizing our own coalition every night and  day. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai must be very frustrated to  see the coalition criticized by its own members."    Winai said he feared "internal enemies", not rivals from the  outside. He said Phalang Tham secretaries general had always  been "battered, chased, harassed," by the religious wing.</p>

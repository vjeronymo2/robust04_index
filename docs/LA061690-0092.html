			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Omar, the first Asian elephant born at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, made his  first public appearance Friday afternoon.  </P> <P> "For about a half an hour he was allowed into a small yard behind his  quarters," park spokesman Tom Hanscom said.  </P> <P> "He tested his feet on the dirt. He's been on concrete since he was born."  </P> <P> Omar wobbled for a crowd of about 40. Hanscom said he is scheduled to make  public appearances Saturday and Sunday, from noon to 3 p.m. Omar will also be  visible from the monorail that runs through the park.  </P> <P> Park officials said they separated the 265-pound calf from his mother when he  was born early Tuesday morning because she rejected him and tried to kill him.  </P> <P> Hanscom said the park will raise the calf, which is now being bottle-fed on a  human infant formula. Although the milk of his mother, Connie, is important to  develop the calf's immune system, Hanscom said park officials are optimistic  and are giving Omar better than a 50% chance of surviving.  </P></p>

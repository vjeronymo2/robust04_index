			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India set for bumper cotton crop INDIA, which accounts for nearly 22 per cent of the world area under cotton, is expected to harvest a bumper crop of between 13m and 13.5m bales (170 kg each) in the 1992-93 season, provided the September rains are adequate. This is in spite of a delay in sowing because of the late arrival of the monsoon. Crop reports from big cotton producing states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, which suffered production setbacks in 1991-92 in terms of both quantity and quality, are highly encouraging this time. The 1991-92 crop was about 12m bales. Unlike last year, the quality of the crop in the current season will be good. Federal officials do not rule out the possibility of a glut and a consequent collapse in prices in the coming months. To make matters worse, India is opening the 1992-93 season with stocks of 3.4m bales, up from 2.27m bales at the start of the 1991-92 season. Government procurement agencies will have to conduct price support operations on a large scale to protect the interest of farmers. According to officials, while there will be considerable surplus of cotton after meeting the mill requirement of about 10.5m bales, exporting will not be easy in view of the low international prices and the recession in the world textile industry. In the past, India had exported up to 1.2m bales a year, but last year sales abroad amounted to only about 75,000 bales, including 65,000 bales of Bangladeshi cotton used mainly for making surgical grade cloth. According to trade representatives, India must export cotton during 1992-93, even at a loss, in order to maintain prices in the domestic market. More often than not in recent years, Indian cotton growers have received less than remunerative prices. The large-scale diversion of land from cotton to other crops is not ruled out if distress selling becomes general this season. The textile industry, which is generally held responsible for the woes of growers, contends that the returns from cotton cultivation will improve if productivity is brought up to the international level. Indian productivity of 260 kg a hectare (105 kg an acre) is less than half the world average of 550 kg a hectare, points out Mr Anil Jain, spokesman for the cotton spinning industry. India is keen to adopt the techniques that have enabled Israeli cotton farming farmers to achieve an average yield of of 1,500 kg a hectare and itrecently sent a team of experts, including the chairman of the Cotton Corporation of India, to study that country's cultivation methods.</p>

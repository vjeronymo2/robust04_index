			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Move to resolve flexitime row Officials of MSF, the manufacturing, science and finance union, said last night that they were trying to 'avoid confrontation' with Refuge Assurance following deadlock over the company's demands to change the way it operates flexitime working. The changes were tied to a 1.8 per cent pay rise in June. Staff working fixed hours got the money, as did those on flexitime who agreed individually to the changes after MSF had refused to do so. Those who kept to the union line have not had the pay rise. MSF has asked to meet Mr John Cudworth, Refuge chairman, to discuss what it says is a 'deteriorating' situation.</p>

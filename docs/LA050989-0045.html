			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council on Monday postponed enacting a ban on the sale and  possession of semiautomatic weapons, but vowed to approve legislation to do so  in two weeks.  </P> <P> The postponement was the third since the council voted, 7 to 2, on Feb. 27 to  regulate the weapons. Final approval requires a second council vote.  </P> <P> The council has agreed to the delays while awaiting the outcome of the  Legislature's deliberations on two bills regulating the weapons. Final action  on the bills, which together are not as strict as the proposed local ordinance,  should be completed within two weeks.  </P> <P> Monday, the council ordered Deputy City Atty. John Kaheny to draft a local  version of the pending Senate bill for consideration in two weeks along with  the council ordinance.  </P> <P> Deputy Mayor Judy McCarty vowed that one of the measures will be passed then.  "This council has run out of patience. . . . Whether they've signed it or not,  something is going to be passed here," McCarty said.  </P> <P> A locally approved ordinance would be in effect only until Jan. 1, 1990, when  the state laws would take effect and preempt it.  </P></p>

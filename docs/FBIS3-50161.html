			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, January 22 (TANJUG)--The Yugoslav national  currency might soon join convertible currencies on the world  money market because the new dinar will be fully convertible,  Professor Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, the author of the programme  for the country's monetary reconstruction, has said in an  interview to TANJUG. The new currency will have 100 percent  backing in hard currency and gold. At the very onset of the  programme, it will be backed by half a billion dollars, he said.    The implementation of the programme for the monetary  reconstruction will begin on Monday, January 24, and its primary  objective will be to curb the world record hyperinflation, which  amounted to one million percent in December. The old dinar will  remain in circulation in parallel with the convertible dinar,  but the government has decided to stop the issue of money which  has no backing.    The author of the idea of a "super dinar" said that the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), in spite  of being under severe international sanctions for 20 months, has  managed to secure a hard currency backing for the reconstruction  of its monetary and fiscal system. The state should stimulate  the return of capital which entrepreneurs, private banks and  firms took out of the country in the past few years, since this  could be the most substantial "outside" support to the new  programme at the present time because of the financial blockade,  Avramovic said.    The exact amount of this capital is not clear--an estimated  five billion dollars or more--but it would be a significant  financial backing for the programme in its entirety for a  long-term period, especially to the convertibility of the dinar.    Experts of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week  turned down a Yugoslav Government request to join in the  formulation of the stabilization programme.    The United Nations (U.N.) Sanctions Committee has not  answered Yugoslavia's request of December last year to thaw at  least part of its hard currency reserves in foreign banks, which  were frozen 20 months ago when the implementation of the U.N.  sanctions began. Under the government programme, these funds  would serve as a backing for the new sound national currency.</p>

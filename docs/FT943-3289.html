			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Major puts UK view to Santer Mr Jacques Santer, the federalist president-designate of the European Commission, got his first formal lecture on the importance of the nation state yesterday from Mr John Major, the British prime minister. Mr Santer, who takes over from Mr Jacques Delors in the New Year, spent a couple of hours absorbing the British view in the third of a series of meetings with EU heads of government. The meeting was described as 'friendly,' but the tone was markedly different to that during Mr Santer's earlier stopovers in Ireland and France. Mr Major emerged from the meeting at his country retreat to stress Britain's long objection to moves towards a single currency at the next inter-governmental conference in 1996. 'I don't think the IGC in 1996 has anything to do with a single currency,' Mr Major said, confirming the British view that the issue of monetary union was settled in the Maastricht treaty. Mr Major won some support from Mr Santer for his objection, forcefully expressed in a speech in The Netherlands last week, to proposals floated by the German CDU party for a core union of five or six member states, excluding Britain. Mr Santer said it was important for all 12 member states to move forward together. However, he also said that all 12 should achieve the objectives set out by the Maastricht treaty, which include economic and monetary union. This would conflict with Britain's preference for a union of 'variable geometry', in which the member states would be free to reject developments outside core areas such as the single market. British officials said that Mr Major had made clear Britain's view that the union should concentrate on subsidiarity, deregulation, free trade and enlargement rather than the destruction of the nation state.</p>

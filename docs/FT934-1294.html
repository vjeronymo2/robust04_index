			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pensions, reform only answer to problems (1) Sir, Barry Riley (The Long View, December 11) is to be congratulated on his pragmatic assessment of the 'personal pension blues'. As he points out, there are no implicit flaws in the personal pensions concept - it is the product design, distribution and regulatory framework which have caused the problems. The Financial Services Act has only belatedly caught up with the post-1988 pensions regime. Even now anomalies exist - for example, rights under an occupational scheme are outside of the FSA. The legislative framework for pensions is unnecessarily complex - the Goode review team acknowledged this but was unable to suggest any real simplifications. Many of the complications are a consequence of conflicting tax and social security constraints - not least because of the inconsistencies of contracting-out arrangements. Personal pension providers have exacerbated matters by designing products with obscure charging structures, partially to facilitate disproportionate commission payments - with acquiescence of the regulators. The investment and interest rate risks associated with any 'money purchase' provision are real but can be minimised through judicious use of a variety of investment instruments, including derivatives - and a more flexible approach to annuity provision - as highlighted by William Burrows ('Escaping the annuity trap', December 11). Regrettably future changes will not redress matters for those who have been ill-advised in the past. However, what is needed is a creative and radical reform of the whole pension provision infrastructure - not tinkering with the existing framework and the introduction of further tiers of bureaucracy. A new style, employer-sponsored personal pension with tax relief dependent on compulsory employer contributions and limited commission and overall expense loadings would be a stop forward. The personal pensions golden goose may not be dead - but it is in desperate need of some swift intensive care.

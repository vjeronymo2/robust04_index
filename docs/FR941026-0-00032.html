This notice is, in part, in response to a Petition for reconsideration of EPA's final facility response plan rule (Final Rule), (59 FR 34070, July 1, 1994), submitted to EPA by seven agricultural organizations. The Petition asserts that EPA does not adequately treat these oils differently from petroleum and toxic non-petroleum oils in the Final Rule. In support of their Petition, these organizations rely on studies that draw several conclusions concerning the physical, toxicological, and chemical properties of animal fats and vegetable oils compared with other types of oil. This notice summarizes the Petition, and asks for data and comment to assist EPA in determining whether and how the differences in properties of various oils warrant further different treatment, including possibly creating separate facility response plan regulatory regimes for these oils beyond the regime established in the July 1, 1994 Final Rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit written comments on this notice on or before January 24, 1995.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Address comments on this notice to the docket clerk at the following address: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, SPCC&hyph;3, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 1, 1994, EPA published its Final Rule amending the Oil Pollution Prevention regulation (40 CFR part 112) to incorporate new requirements to implement section 4202(a)(6) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), amending section 311(j)(5) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). (See 33 U.S.C. 1321(j)(5).) (Oil Pollution Prevention; Non-Transportation-Related Onshore Facilities; Final Rule, 59 FR 34070, July 1, 1994.) The Final Rule directs certain facility owners and operators to prepare plans for responding to a worst case discharge of oil, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge. Under authority of section 311(j)(1)(C) of the CWA, the Final Rule requires planning for a small and medium discharge of oil, as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 4202(a)(6) of the OPA, these planning requirements apply to owners and operators of all offshore facilities and any onshore facility that, ``because of its location, could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or the exclusive economic zone.'' OPA directs owners and operators of these facilities to prepare a plan for responding ``to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge of oil or a hazardous substance.'' The July 1, 1994, Final Rule establishes requirements for plans for responding to discharges of oil from certain onshore facilities within EPA's jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA published the proposed facility response plan rule on February 17, 1993 (58 FR 8824). One of the issues on which the Agency received comment was whether EPA should establish separate response plan requirements and selection criteria for owners or operators of facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils. Among other things, some commenters argued that fundamental chemical and physical differences between petroleum and non-petroleum oils indicate the necessity for different response techniques and equipment. At least two comments on the proposed rule asserted that lack of toxicity was a property distinguishing some non-petroleum oils both from petroleum and other non-petroleum oils. (See letters commenting on the February 17, 1993, proposed rule from the National Renderers Association [SPCC&hyph;2P&hyph;2&hyph;1248]; and on behalf of the American Soybean Association, the Corn Refiners Association, the National Corn Growers Association, the Institute of Shortening &amp; Edible Oils, the National Cotton Council, the National Cottonseed Products Association, and the National Oilseed Processors Association, [SPCC&hyph;2P&hyph;2&hyph;L34].) The letter on behalf of the seven agricultural organizations [SPCC&hyph;2P&hyph;2&hyph;L34] asked EPA to ``provide for a different approach to response and removal methodologies for these substances than that required for petroleum oil.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's Final Rule for non-transportation-related facility response plans provides a strategy for petroleum oils and non-petroleum oils that gives a considerably greater degree of flexibility to owners and operators of non-petroleum oil facilities than to owners and operators of petroleum oil facilities in designing their plans. The Petitioners contend that EPA should avoid treating the category animal fats and vegetable oils with the category toxic, non-petroleum oils. EPA addressed the likely differences in responding to petroleum oil as opposed to non-petroleum oil, and created an approach that allows owners or operators of facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils flexibility to determine appropriate response equipment levels within the framework established by the regulation (See Section 7.7 of Appendix E to 40 CFR part 112). The Agency provided further flexibility by allowing the Regional Administrators (RA) to assess the adequacy of response plans including those for non-petroleum facilities, recognizing the greater knowledge RAs have about facilities and geographic-specific environmental areas within their Regions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

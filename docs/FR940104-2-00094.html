Matching Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Planning grants. A Federal grant for the planning of a public telecommunications facility shall be in an amount determined by the Agency and set forth in the award document and the attachments thereto. The Agency may provide up to 100 percent of the funds necessary for the planning of a public telecommunications construction project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Construction grants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A Federal grant award for the construction of a public telecommunications facility shall be an amount determined by the Agency and set forth in the award document. Such amount may not exceed 75 percent of the amount determined by the Agency to be the reasonable and necessary cost of such project. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Special Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As originally stated in the August 20, 1987, PTFP Final Rules, and as reaffirmed and clarified in a November 22, 1991, PTFP Policy Statement, NTIA has established a policy which is intended to encourage stations to increase from 25% to 50% the matching percentage in their proposals for equipment replacement, improvement, and augmentation. The Agency has emphasized that applicants proposing to provide first service to a geographic area encounter considerable ineligible costs, including construction or renovation of buildings or other similar expenses. NTIA, therefore, expects to continue funding projects to extend service at up to 75% of the total project cost. Applicants from small community-licensed stations, or those who can show that a station licensed to a large institution cannot obtain direct or in-kind support from the larger institution, also will not be subject to this preference. Otherwise, a showing of extraordinary need or an emergency situation will be taken into consideration as justification for grants of up to 75% of the project cost, but the presumption of 50% funding will be the general rule for applications calling for the replacement, improvement, or augmentation of equipment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) No part of the grantee's matching share of the eligible project costs may be met with funds paid by the Federal government, except where the use of such funds to meet a Federal matching requirement is specifically and expressly authorized by Federal statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Funds supplied to an applicant by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting may not be used for the required non-Federal matching purposes, except upon a clear and compelling showing of need. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The expenditure of any local matching funds prior to the Closing Date will be disallowed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Applicants should note that expenditure of local matching funds prior to the award of a grant is at the applicant's own risk.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The exact amount of the match will not be known with certainty until the final award agreement is negotiated. Therefore, should the applicant's expenditure of non-Federal funds exceed the non-Federal share which will be established in the final award agreement, then either the Federal share of the total project cost may be reduced by a corresponding amount, or no Federal award may be offered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Selection Process and Project Period <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PTFP grants are awarded on the basis of a competitive review process. This includes several grant review panels, which apply the Funding Criteria listed in section V above. The Agency determines the selection of grantees according to the Priorities listed in section III above and the evaluation of the applications by the various review panels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Planning grant award periods customarily do not exceed one year, whereas construction grant award periods commonly range up to two years. Although these time frames are generally applied to the award of all PTFP grants, variances in project periods may be based on specific circumstances of an individual proposal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Public Telecommunications Financing Act of 1978, Pub.

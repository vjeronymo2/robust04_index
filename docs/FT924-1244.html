			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Italo-Franco cruise venture formed COSTA CROCIERE, the stock market listed Italian cruise group, has reached an agreement with Chargeurs and Accor of France to create Europe's first cross-border cruise venture. The two French companies, which jointly own the Compagnie Francaise des Croisieres, the parent of the Croisieres Paquet company, will buy a stake of 23 per cent in Costa Crociere through a reserved rights issue worth L80bn. The combined cruise group will have 11 liners, offering almost 9,000 beds, and annual sales of around L600bn (Dollars 429m). The deal, which is expected to be concluded by the end of next month, is a further step in Costa Crociere's shift away from the US market towards the Mediterranean and northern Europe. Istituto Finanziaria Italiano (IFI), the financial holding company of Italy's Agnelli family, suffered a sharp drop in net profits to L146bn (Dollars 104m) in the six months to September 30 from L212bn in the same period the previous year. The fall stemmed from the steep decline in dividends received from the Fiat cars group, in which IFI has a stake of around 45 per cent both directly and through subsidiaries. IFI's Fiat dividends fell to L91bn from L147bn.</p>

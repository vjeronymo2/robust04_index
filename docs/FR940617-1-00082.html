			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has evaluated standard textbooks and published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data on the effectiveness of isopropyl alcohol used topically on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the area prior to an injection (Refs. 3, 4, and 5). The minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective concentration of isopropyl alcohol for this use is 70  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent. Further, the agency is not aware of any information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the use of isopropyl alcohol below 70 percent for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indication. Therefore, the agency is proposing to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> isopropyl alcohol 70 to 91.3 percent in Category I for use as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient preoperative skin preparation for the limited indication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``for the preparation of the skin prior to an injection''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Miscellaneous External Panel recommended that drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products containing alcohol and isopropyl alcohol bear the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following warning: ``Flammable, keep away from fire or flame,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (47 FR 22324 at 22330). The agency concurs with the Panel's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended warning and is proposing this warning in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;333.450(c)(4) of this tentative final monograph. In order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure the warning's prominence, the agency is further proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it appear in boldface type and as the first warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately following the heading ``WARNINGS''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is aware of ten reports (Refs. 6 and 7) of first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and second degree burns occurring in patients undergoing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electrocautery procedures. The burns were caused by the ignition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the isopropyl alcohol in patient preoperative skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparations containing chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iodine in 70 percent isopropyl alcohol. The reports indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these incidents have occurred despite the presence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detailed warnings in the products' labeling cautioning that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products are flammable until dry and should not be allowed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pool on body surfaces or should not be used in conjunction with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electrocautery procedures until dry (Refs. 8 and 9). Based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these reports, the agency tentatively concludes that patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preoperative skin preparations containing isopropyl alcohol in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of 70 percent or more cannot be adequately labeled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to allow the safe use of these drug products in conjunction with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electrocautery procedures. Therefore, the agency is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that patient preoperative skin preparations containing isopropyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohol in concentrations of 70 percent or more bear the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following label warning: ``Do not use with electrocautery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures.'' The agency is further proposing that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning immediately follow the flammable warning being proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;333.450(c)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is not currently aware of any similar incidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurring with other nonemollient patient preoperative skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparations containing alcohol in similar concentrations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, at this time the agency is not proposing that patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preoperative skin preparations containing alcohol identified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;333.412(a) bear a warning concerning the use of these products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in conjunction with electrocautery procedures. However, the agency will consider extending the warning to patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preoperative skin preparations containing alcohol if new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information indicates that this is necessary. The agency invites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific comment and data on the safety of both alcohol and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> isopropyl alcohol containing patient preoperative skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparations in conjunction with electrocautery procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> References  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Comment No. C00148, Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) OTC Vol. 160251.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Lee, S., I.

However, in the first aid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antiseptic segment of this rulemaking these alcohol ingredients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were reclassified from Category II to Category III for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness as first aid antiseptic ingredients. (See 56 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 33644 at 33673.) Because no comments, data, or information were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received, and because the agency is not aware of any health-care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antiseptic uses for these ingredients, benzyl alcohol and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chlorobutanol are not being classified in this rulemaking for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care antiseptic drug products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency published an advance notice of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking for mercury-containing drug products on January 5, 1982 (47 FR 436). That notice, based upon the recommendations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Miscellaneous External Panel, proposed to classify OTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mercury-containing drug products for topical antimicrobial use as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not generally recognized as safe and effective and as being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misbranded. The agency received no comments. The Panel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified the mercurial ingredients, as a group, in Category II;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some for lack of safety, some for lack of efficacy, and others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to a lack of both safety and efficacy. However, in the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aid antiseptic segment of this amended tentative final monograph,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several mercury-containing OTC topical antimicrobials have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassified from Category II to Category III for effectiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mercurial ingredients placed in Category II for safety were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassified. The ingredients reclassified are calomel,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> merbromin, mercufenol chloride, and phenylmercuric nitrate. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change was made in keeping with the revised effectiveness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria for the drug product category ``first aid antiseptic,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which were not available at the time the Miscellaneous External  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panel evaluated the effectiveness of mercurial ingredients. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 56 FR 33644 at 33672.) The agency is unaware of any clinical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data or marketing history for the use of mercury-containing drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products as health-care antiseptics. Consequently, these drugs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have not been classified as health-care antiseptics. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the agency has reviewed submitted data on two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combinations containing mercurial ingredients and proposes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Category II classification for these combinations. (See section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I.M., comments 24 and 25.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

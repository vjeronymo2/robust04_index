			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Zharinov: "We Have 34 Deputies, We Shall </F> Elect the Rest in the Fall"]    [Text] The overall results of the elections to the  Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies were made public by the  chairman of the oblast electoral commission, L.N. Ustinova, on  Wednesday at a news conference.    She reminded the journalists that 202 candidates had been  registered for 49 deputy positions. On 27 March 662,996 voters,  or 33.6 percent of those included on the lists, expressed their  attitude toward the contenders for the deputy mandate. In the  rayons of the oblast 47 percent of the voters voted, and in the  cities under oblast jurisdiction (Berdsk, Iskitim, Kuybyshev,  Tatarsk, and Barabinsk)--31.6 percent, including  Novosibirsk--25.1 percent.    The overall number of invalid ballots (incorrectly filled  out, damaged, etc.) was 54,697. A total of 69,113 people voted  against all the candidates.    Where were the elections held and who earned the confidence  of the voters? The elections were declared to have been  conducted in 34 single-mandate districts. These were mainly  rural districts. In 15 districts of Novosibirsk the elections  were not held because of low voter turnout. Let us mention these  districts: Nos. 22 and 25 (Dzerzhinskiy Rayon), No. 28  (Zheleznodorozhnyy Rayon), No. 33 (Kalininskiy Rayon), Nos. 35,  36, and 37 (Kirovskiy Rayon), Nos. 38, 39, 40, 41, and 49  (Leninskiy Rayon), Nos. 42 and 44 (Oktyabrskiy Rayon), and No.  47 (Sovetskiy Rayon). Repeat elections were scheduled for 30  October in these rayons.    And so, the new representative power in the oblast is  embodied by 34 deputies so far. What is the social, political,  and occupational portrait of the new deputy corps? They are  mature people who have learned from life's experience. As can be  seen from an official questionnaire, they are "up to 55 years of  age." Undoubtedly there are young ones as well. But the fact  that altogether they are "up to 55" inspires hope and promise.  Incidentally, of those who were elected, 11 are former people's  deputies of the oblast soviet, which creates continuity in the  activity of the representative organ.    The elections confirmed the misgivings on the part of  political parties and public movements concerning the desire of  representatives of executive structures to enter the oblast  soviet. Twelve heads of local administrations became deputies  (almost one- third of the deputy mandates) and, naturally, they  will basically determine the fate of any particular resolution  considered by the soviet. Added to them are 10 leaders of  industrial and agricultural enterprises who will probably defend  departmental interests in the soviet.    Among the other deputies, one represents public health and  four-- public education, VUZ's [higher educational  institutions], and scientific institutions. Notice that there is  not a single worker, kolkhoz worker, or construction worker  here. Just as there is not a single specialist with a higher  legal education or representative of culture or business. This  could cause some harm to the composition of the deputy corps,  which may not represent the interests of many social groups.  Suffice it to say that among the 34 deputies there is only one  woman--chief engineer of the Suzunskaya Furniture Factory, V.  Usova. There were considerably more of them in the last soviet.    And, finally, about the political preferences of the voters.  Only three representatives of political parties and movements  earned deputy mandates: two (V. Kuznetsov and V. Karpov)--from  the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], and one  (N. Krasnikov)--from Russia's Choice. It turns out that it makes  no difference to the voter whether the candidate is "red" or  "white." As long as he is a good person.    But still the main thing should be emphasized: Elections to  the oblast soviet of deputies did take place. And in keeping  with the law on the kray and oblast soviets, the kray and oblast  administration: "The soviet shall function if two-thirds of the  deputies have been elected to it." We have that number of  deputies and they can hold a session at which they will elect a  chairman and a deputy, working organs, and commissions.  Apparently this will take place in the near future.    More detailed information about the results of the voting  and  the elected deputies will be published in the next few issues of  SOVETSKAYA SIBIR.</p>

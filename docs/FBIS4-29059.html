			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii vowed Tuesday [14 Jun] to continue taking measures to make  the recent bright signs in the economy spread but remained  cautious over the economic outlook, citing currency rate  directions.    "Bright signs are certainly appearing," Fujii told a news  conference after a morning cabinet meeting.    He was referring to improvements for the first time in five  years mentioned Friday in the Bank of Japan's quarterly "Tankan"  survey of business confidence for May.    But he refused otherwise to offer his assessment and outlook  on the economy, saying, "overall assessment is done by the Bank  of Japan and the Economic Planning Agency."    "My job is to pin utmost efforts to put those bright signs  on  a steady path," Fujii said, particularly calling for early  passage of the fiscal 1994 budget.    The delayed budget for the current fiscal year that began  April 1 is under deliberation at the House of Councillors after  passing the House of Representatives last week. The government  is now running with a stopgap budget.    Concerning the yen's resurgence against the dollar these  past  few days, Fujii said the currency rate direction is a problem as  he and Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno have been saying.    "We are closely watching the currency rate movements from  the  standpoint of the economy," he said.    He reiterated that Japan is in close contact with other  Group  of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations to cooperate in  stemming "undesirable volatility" as the G-7 finance ministers  and central bankers reaffirmed at their April meeting in  Washington.    Mieno told a House of Councillors Budget Committee meeting  Monday that it looks like the economy has moved "one step"  toward recovery but noted that various uncertainties prevent him  from describing the economy as having gone "two or three steps  forward."    Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio Terasawa  told reporters after the Tuesday cabinet meeting, "I can't say  yet the economy has turned around although I feel more  optimistic."    Both Mieno and Terasawa cited lingering concern over the  yen's rise and sluggish corporate capital investment as the  major factors for the cautiousness.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1425 GMT on 18 March carries in its  regular 22-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in  the republic.    The Gradacac Information Center says that "after a very  quiet  morning, practically without a single bullet being fired, the  [Serbian] enemy suddenly opened fire at a vehicle carrying the  Nordic battalion of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. At 1020  the enemy fired several 120-mm mortars from Skugric at the  peacekeeping forces on regular patrol of the region of Vida. The  vehicle went up in flames but the soldiers managed to escape in  time, so that -- at least according to the latest information --  there are no wounded." The report says that "at the moment NATO  planes are constantly flying over Gradacac."    Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac that "the Serb aggressor  has continued his attacks on the defense lines on the  Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, Hasin Vrh, and Barakovac, and the  members of the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa  autonomy have also stepped up their attacks on the free part of  the Bihac region. After continuous artillery and tank attacks  overnight, this morning Karadzic's terrorists again tried  another infantry breakthrough on Hasin Vrh. In collusion with  the chetniks, the so-called autonomy army continued to attack in  the area of Krivaja in the Cazin commune. Several of our  fighters were wounded in these attacks, and three were  unfortunately killed. More of our fighters were killed in the  bestial chetnik pounding of the defense positions." He said  that "according to incomplete information, nine people were  killed and several dozen wounded overnight and today."    Reporting from Bugojno, Atif Agic says that "this is the  third day that the general alarm is constantly in force to warn  civilians of the chetnik shells. Five people have been wounded  so far as the town has been subjected to sudden shellings."</p>

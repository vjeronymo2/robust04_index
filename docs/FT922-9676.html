			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Hooper sells offshoot to management Clarke Hooper, the UK's only quoted sales promotion company, has sold Schmidt-Cannon, a US subsidiary, to its management for Pounds 1.12m. The group said the disposal was part of its rationalisation programme. Proceeds will be used to reduce debt of some Pounds 6m with its two banks, Robert Fleming and National Westminster. The buy-out was concluded on April 30 without prior shareholder approval. The company said that as the deadline for the disposal was April 30, contacting shareholders in advance and the resulting delay 'would have put the transaction in jeopardy and would have a serious impact on the group'.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: IT WAS AN ERA IN WHICH HONESTY WASN'T ALWAYS THE BEST POLICY  </P> <P> Discussing the New York Jets' victory over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl  III, which he "guaranteed" victory before the game, former Jet quarterback Joe  Namath told Mike Lupica in Esquire magazine that such boldness was more  extraordinary then than it is now.  </P> <P> "It was the times," Namath said. "I can remember when (Muhammad) Ali told  everybody he was going to beat (Sonny) Liston that first fight, and everybody  thought he was nuts. We can laugh about it now, but at the time I came along,  honesty was unheard of in sports. You gave your honest opinion about things,  and it just automatically rubbed people the wrong way."  </P> <P> Add honesty: Football coaches always have been reluctant to praise the ability  of their teams, lest they inspire an opponent to greater effort. But Bob  Shannon, coach at East St. Louis (Ill.) High, believes if you've got the  talent, flaunt it.  </P> <P> "Last year's team wasn't very good," Shannon said of a 13-1 squad that was  runner-up in the state playoffs. And this year's team? "This is a typical  championship-caliber East St. Louis team," he said before the playoffs began.  </P> <P> The Flyers beat Thornton, 55-8, to win the Class 6-A championship. They  finished 14-0.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Since baseball's most-valuable-player awards began in 1931, each  winner has been back with his club the next year. Three MVPs were with new  clubs two years after winning the award. Who were they?  </P> <P> Nadia's theme: The story of Nadia Comaneci's romance with Konstantin Panait,  the married man who helped her defect from Romania, was good fodder for New  York's tabloids Wednesday. The Daily News played it on Page 1 with the  headline: "Naughty Nadia, Romanian gymnast flips for married roofer." The New  York Post put the story on its gossip page under the heading: "Nadia leaps into  arms of married man."  </P> <P> Greasing the skids?In an attempt to display a light touch, Mike Lynn, general  manager of the Minnesota Vikings, recently showed up in the locker room wearing  a Popeye hat. He served the players fried chicken, saying it was a substitute  for spinach. "One of the things players have mentioned to me is that the only  time they see me is when I'm disciplining them or negotiating a contract," Lynn  said. "So I am going to be more visible when we're not in confrontational  situations."  </P> <P> Into the frying pan: Dave Gavitt, commissioner of the Big East, on the genesis  of the ACC-Big East Challenge this week: "Look, basketball needs sizzle in  December, too. And the teams need it. They don't like to play the U.S.  Internationals all the time leading up to the league schedule."  </P> <P> Add ACC: From Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Evening Sun: "If all his  indiscretions in the handling of the basketball program at North Carolina State  didn't get Jim Valvano canned, the slapdash show the coach hosts on ESPN  should."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Orlando Cepeda, MVP with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1967, played  for the Braves in 1969; Chuck Klein of the Philadelphia Phillies was the MVP in  1932 and joined the Cubs in 1934; Rod Carew was MVP with the Minnesota Twins in  1977 and played for the Angels in 1979.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Gary Burbank of WLW radio in Cincinnati, on the new candy bar named  for Bengal quarterback Boomer Esiason: "I think it comes in a sack."

			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO REVIVES A TRADITIONAL 'BUTTERFLY'  </P> <P> Traditional opera doesn't have to be careless opera. Take, for example, the  revival of "Madama Butterfly" that opened Saturday night at the San Diego  Opera.  </P> <P> There were no theatrical shocks here, and few musical surprises. Everyone  involved, from lofty protagonist to lowly chorister, took Puccini at his  seasoned word. Luckily, no one took that word for granted.  </P> <P> Kees Bakels of Amsterdam conducted with emotive force that respected both the  light and the shade in the score yet avoided sentimental excesses. Adelaide  Bishop, a splendid singing actress in her time, staged the proceedings with a  loving eye for detail and steadfast avoidance of expressive cliches.  </P> <P> John Scheffler's hand-me-down picture-post-card set proved eminently  functional, and it was sensitively illuminated by Peter Kaczorowski. Zack  Brown's costumes, borrowed from the Washington Opera, accentuated the positive,  even to the point of disguising Lt. Pinkerton's portly physique with a dark  off-season uniform.  </P> <P> All this still would have meant relatively little had the cast been  perfunctory. This cast wasn't.  </P> <P> Admittedly, the singing actress confronting the rigors of the title role  encountered some problems. But singing actresses encounter problems in this  elusive challenge everywhere these days. San Diego holds no monopoly.  </P> <P> Hiroko Nishida, a Japanese native with considerable experience in Germany, was  making her American debut on this occasion. She proved more effective  dramatically than vocally.  </P> <P> Tiny and fragile, she exuded vulnerable innocence at her first appearance.  Cio-Cio-San's tragedy became all the more poignant as the evening progressed  because it was conveyed with such open simplicity.  </P> <P> Her lyric soprano sounded bright and lovely so long as it stayed at mid-range  and mid-volume. Unfortunately, in moments requiring climactic stress, the tone  became unsteady and the pitch flat. When it came to the cresting D-flat of the  entrance aria, she chose the safe anticlimax of Puccini's lower option. Perhaps  it was a matter of nerves.  </P> <P> Jonathan Welch, another popular import on German stages, returned to his home  territory as an exceptionally ardent, golden-voiced Pinkerton. At the final  cadence of the first act, incidentally, he chose Puccini's upper option and  rose to a ringing, effortless high C. Remember the name.  </P> <P> Although Harlan Foss sounded like a modest Yamadori impersonating the American  consul, his sympathetic characterization compensated for any baritonal  shortcomings. Here was a Sharpless who conveyed stern exasperation with his  caddish countryman and lavished pained, courtly deference upon the abandoned  geisha. Even as the ultimate crisis beckoned, he wouldn't enter her home  without taking off his shoes.  </P> <P> The generally strong supporting ensemble included Robynne Redmon as a robust,  attentive Suzuki; Joseph Frank as a clever, unexaggerated Goro; Stephen West as  a gruff, formidable Bonze, and William Nolan as a pleasant, stolid Yamadori.  </P> <P> Predictably, the Civic Theatre was flooded with cheers and tears at the end.  Old "Butterfly" soared and scored again.  </P></p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Abiola protests grow in Nigeria Strikes and violent protests against the detention of Mr Moshood Abiola by Nigeria's military regime spread across the country yesterday, while in Abuja's high court Mr Abiola's trial for treason stalled over technicalities and was adjourned until next Tuesday. Mr Abiola, widely regarded as winner of last year's annulled presidential election, was arrested by General Sani Abacha's regime last month for declaring himself president. Yesterday the prosecution at the high court hearing changed one of its charges, the defence asked for them all to be struck out and both sides argued over legal procedures until the adjournment. Half the seats in the tiny court were taken up by the two teams of lawyers, one of whom told the judge 'democracy is on trial'. Outside the court, protesters set fire to a barricade of tyres and clashed with hundreds of armed police who had cordoned-off the streets. Many came from the Yoruba-speaking south-west, Mr Abiola's stronghold. Mr Jesse Jackson, the US envoy despatched to convey President Bill Clinton's concern over the military's refusal to hand power to a civilian government, met Gen Abacha and Mr Abiola, diplomats said. Details of his discussions were not known. In the commercial capital, Lagos, protests were marred by violence and looting. Lagos has been almost at a standstill since a three-week-long oil workers' strike halted fuel distribution. The protest has been backed by other unions, closing factories and offices. Many banks are shut and the number remaining in the clearing system is falling. Bankers predict cash shortages in the near future. Shell Nigeria yesterday confirmed that its oil production, which accounts for half of Nigeria's 2m barrels a day, had been cut by roughly 300,000 b/d as a result of the oil workers' strike. This has prompted a declaration of force majeure on loadings of crude oil by Shell. The company stressed its adherence to 'business principles', a reference to its unwillingness to maintain operations if a military guard were needed. Yesterday, air traffic controllers went on strike. All international flights were cancelled as the military failed to replace civilians in the control tower at Lagos airport.</p>

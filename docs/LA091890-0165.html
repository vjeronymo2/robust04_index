Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> AIDS MEMORIAL QUILT VANDALIZED  </P> <P> Part of the national AIDS Memorial Quilt was vandalized after members of a  singles club meeting at a Miami hotel asked that it be removed from display  because it was "ugly."  </P> <P> Two teddy bears were cut from quilt panels during the weekend and were later  found in boxes headed for the garbage, the display organizer and a hotel  manager said.  </P> <P> "It's like going to a cemetery and kicking over tombstones," said Jerry Suarez,  chairman of the South Florida Names Project, which set up the quilt display.  </P></p>

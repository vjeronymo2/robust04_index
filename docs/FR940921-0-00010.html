Although the additive itself has not been shown to cause cancer, it may contain minute amounts of unreacted 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide, carcinogenic impurities, resulting from the manufacture of the additive. Residual amounts of reactants and manufacturing aids, such as 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide, are commonly found as contaminants in chemical products, including food additives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Determination of Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called ``general safety clause'' of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular use unless a fair evaluation of the evidence available to FDA establishes that the additive is safe for that use. FDA's food additive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)) define safe as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The food additives anticancer, or Delaney, clause (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act) provides that no food additive shall be deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Importantly, however, the Delaney clause applies to the additive itself and not constituents of the additive. That is, where an additive itself has not been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly evaluated under the general safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use of the additive,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scott <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Safety of the Petitioned Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA estimates that the petitioned use of the additive,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> N,N,N <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;,N <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;,N <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;,N <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -hexakis(methoxymethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine polymer with stearyl alcohol,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0024 unknown -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -octadecenyl- <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 --> V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -hydroxypoly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), and alkyl (C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> +) alcohols, will result in levels of exposure to the additive of no greater than 19 parts per billion in the daily diet (Ref. 1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic toxicological testing to be necessary to determine the safety of an additive whose use will result in such low exposure levels (Ref. 2), and the agency has not required such testing here. However, the agency has reviewed the available toxicological data from acute toxicity studies on the additive. No adverse effects were reported in these studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause, considering all available data and using risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limits of risk presented by the carcinogenic chemicals that may be present as impurities in the additive, 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide. This risk evaluation of 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the worst-case exposure to the impurities from the proposed use of the additive, and (2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable exposure to humans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. 1,4-Dioxane <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA has estimated the hypothetical worst-case exposure to 1,4-dioxane from the petitioned use of the additive in the manufacture of paper and paperboard to be 11 nanograms per person per day (ng/person/day) (Ref. 1). The agency used data from a carcinogenesis bioassay on 1,4-dioxane, conducted for the National Cancer Institute (Ref. 3), to estimate the upper-bound limits of lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming from the proposed use of the additive (Ref. 3). The results of the bioassay on 1,4-dioxane demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for female rats under the conditions of the study. The test material caused significantly increased incidence of squamous cell carcinomas and hepatocellular tumors in female rats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a potential exposure of 11 ng/person/day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limits of individual lifetime risk from the potential exposure to 1,4-dioxane from the use of the subject additive is 4x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , or less than 4 in 10 billion (Ref. 4). Because of the numerous conservative assumptions used in calculating the exposure estimate, actual lifetime averaged individual exposure to 1,4-dioxane is likely to be substantially less than the worst-case exposure, and therefore, the calculated upper-bound limits of risk would be less. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the exposure to 1,4-dioxane that might result from the proposed use of the additive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Ethylene Oxide <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA estimated that the hypothetical worst-case exposure to ethylene oxide from the petitioned use of the additive in the manufacture of paper and paperboard is 11 ng/person/day (Ref. 1). The agency used data from a carcinogenesis bioassay on ethylene oxide conducted for the Institute of Hygiene, University of Mainz, Germany, to estimate the upper-bound level of lifetime human risk from exposure to ethylene oxide stemming from the proposed use of the additive (Ref. 5). The results of the bioassay on ethylene oxide demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for female rats under the conditions of the study. The test material caused significantly increased incidence of squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach and carcinoma in situ of the glandular stomach. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a potential exposure of 11 ng/person/day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limits of individual lifetime risk from the potential exposure to ethylene oxide from the use of the subject additive is 2x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , or less than 2 in 100 million (Ref. 4). Because of the numerous conservative assumptions used in calculating the exposure estimate, actual lifetime-averaged individual exposure to ethylene oxide is likely to be substantially less than the worst-case exposure, and therefore, the calculated upper-bound limits of risk would be less. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the exposure to ethylene oxide that might result from the proposed use of the additive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Formaldehyde  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A review of the petition also indicates that the additive may contain formaldehyde as an impurity at a dietary concentration of 15 micrograms/person/day. The potential carcinogenicity of formaldehyde was reviewed by the Cancer Assessment Committee (the committee) that has been formed by FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The committee noted that for many years formaldehyde has been known to be a carcinogen by the inhalation route, but it concluded that these inhalation studies are not appropriate for assessing the potential carcinogenicity of formaldehyde in food because of the inappropriate route administration and the fact that tumors were observed only locally at the portal of entry (nasal turbinates). The agency has received literature reports of two drinking water studies on formaldehyde: (1) A preliminary report of a carcinogenicity study purported to be positive by Soffritti et al. (1989), conducted in Bologna, Italy (Ref. 7), and (2) a negative study by Til, et al. (1989), conducted in The Netherlands (Ref. 8). The committee reviewed both studies and concluded in a ``Memorandum of Conference,'' dated April 24, 1991 and March 4, 1993, ``*&blank;*&blank;* that data concerning the Soffritti study reported were unreliable and could not be used in the assessment of the oral carcinogenicity of formaldehyde'' (Ref. 6). This conclusion is based on a lack of critical details in the study, questionable histopathologic conclusions, and the use of unusual nomenclature to describe the tumors. Thus, the committee concluded that there is no basis to find that formaldehyde is a carcinogen when ingested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Need for Specifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has also considered whether specifications are necessary to control the amount of 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide in the additive. The agency finds that specifications are not necessary for the following reasons: (1) Because of the low levels at which 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide may be expected to remain as impurities following production of the additive, the agency would not expect these impurities to become components of food at other than extremely low levels; and (2) the upper-bound limits of lifetime risk from exposure to these impurities, even under worst-case assumptions, is very low, less than 4 in 10 billion and less than 2 in 100 million for 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA has evaluated the data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed uses for the additive in paper and paperboard products in contact with aqueous food are safe. Based on this information, the agency has also concluded that the additive will have the intended technical effect. Accordingly, &sect;176.170 is amended as set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making the documents available for inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

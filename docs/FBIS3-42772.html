The authorities banned the newspaper DEN even before the  guns  were fired at parliament. It disappeared for a month and then  began to come out under a different name. There was the threat  that it would be cut off from its readers. But the people who  were united by the one-time newspaper and by participation in  all of its activities never lost contact with one another.  Moreover, recently the active newspaper's readership created an  organization out of the simple club and officially registered  it. Those attending the conference at the Rodina House of  Culture heard a report from the coordinating council of the  social-educational organization 'Den' Movement and discussed  plans for its further work. The movement is open to all who do  not see history as black and white, who recognize the seal both  with the double-headed eagle and with the hammer and sickle, and  who want to do something real for the revival of great Russia.    The editor in chief of DEN and ZAVTRA, Aleksandr Prohanov,  and workers of these publications, Yevgeniy Nefedov and Nikolay  Anisin, participated in the work of the conference.    In the next issue of the newspaper ZAVTRA we will give a  contact telephone number for the 'Den' Movement.</p>

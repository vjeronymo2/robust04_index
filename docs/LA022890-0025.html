			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SINKING ATLANTIS;  </P> <P> CRIME: OFFICIALS INTENSIFY THEIR CAMPAIGN TO CLOSE A MOTEL WHERE THEY SAY  PROSTITUTES AND DRUG DEALERS PLY THEIR TRADES.  </P> <P> It sits along Atlantic Boulevard in an area where police say prostitutes ply  their trade for anything from $40 to three cans of beer and a $15 IOU.  </P> <P> The Atlantis Motel consists of two stories of dirt-encrusted, broken-down rooms  that stink of frying grease. Most of the tenants have lived there for months,  sometimes years, signing over their welfare checks to the manager to cover the  $150 average weekly rental.  </P> <P> Many are on drugs, police say. Nearly all have small children who play in the  parking lot and are sometimes spotted bathing in the swimming pool, which reeks  of urine and too much chlorine.  </P> <P> The Atlantis has been around Cudahy for 25 years, and every year, according to  residents, business people and city officials, it becomes a bigger sore spot on  a busy street lined with some of the town's most established businesses.  </P> <P> Business people say they can't remember a time when the Atlantis was a decent  low-budget motel.  </P> <P> "Our customers can't even walk down the street without being propositioned or  asked if they want to buy drugs," said one businessman.  </P> <P> The Atlantis, Jack Joseph, the acting city manager said, is "a blot on the  city."  </P> <P> Over the last few months the city, with help from the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department, has launched a feverish campaign to wipe the Atlantis  Motel from Cudahy's streets.  </P> <P> Officials have tramped through the security gates innumerable times in the last  few months to conduct building inspections, fire inspections and Health  Department inspections. Cudahy's building inspector, Daniel Pulone, said  inspectors from his office visit the Atlantis about twice a week, noting the  code violations.  </P> <P> With long lists of violations supplied by the county Department of Health  Services and county Fire Department, the city is building an arsenal of  evidence it plans to use when it sues the owner in an effort to have the motel  declared a public nuisance and closed.  </P> <P> The city recently changed the curb marking in front of the motel from a  temporary no-parking zone to a no-parking zone in an administrative attempt to  stop drive-up drug transactions and prostitution.  </P> <P> If the paper-work onslaught fails to shut or clean up the Atlantis, city  officials say they hope law enforcement will succeed.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies have spent 263.3 hours in two months responding to calls at  the Atlantis Motel, Lt. Dennis Dahlman said. Dahlman said 36 arrests for  prostitution have been made, as well as an unknown number of arrests for drugs.  </P> <P> "It's a major problem," Dahlman said. "But we are not going to give up by any  stretch of the imagination. We're going to keep pounding on them and pursue  every avenue to get it closed down."  </P> <P> Shutting the Atlantis Motel for good may not be easy, city officials said.  Although the motel has a long history of violations, inspectors said,  violations are corrected within the deadlines.  </P> <P> It has been a frustrating experience for city officials, who insist that the  motel is nothing more than a haven for drug dealers, vandals and prostitutes.  </P> <P> Room 106 of the Atlantis Motel is the room inspector Pulone says is least  likely to win a Good Housekeeping award.  </P> <P> The door has been broken off its hinges and rests precariously against the  frame. Inside, a double bed with a stained mattress dominates the room. There  is trash everywhere -- on the floor, piled on the kitchen table, crammed into  cracks of ripped furniture. The curtains are tattered and faded green. The  carpet is brown. Everything is covered with grime.  </P> <P> This is the room from which deputies say many of the drug sales occur.  </P> <P> Upstairs, in cramped Room 209, 19-year-old Becky Sanchez tries to clean up  after her two infant children. She lives in the $190-a-week room with her  uncle, a friend and her children. She wants to get out, she said, but has to  stay home with her children and can't save any money for a deposit on an  apartment.  </P> <P> Almost everyone blames the condition of the motel on manager James Wu and owner  Jau Huang.  </P> <P> "The manager doesn't care about us," tenant Sandra Shaw said, plopping down on  the bed.  </P> <P> Although Huang has owned the motel since May, 1988, inspector Pulone says Huang  has made no effort to clean it up and, in fact, has let it become more squalid.  </P> <P> Pulone said Huang told him he bought the place sight unseen for $1.5 million.  Huang's name is on a business card describing him as vice chairman of Radisson  Plaza Hotel South Bay, scheduled to open in July in Carson.  </P> <P> According to building permits, Huang is vice president of Wei-Chuan  Construction, the Monterey Park company building the Radisson Plaza.  </P> <P> Huang, who lives in San Marino, is now in Taiwan, Wu said. Representatives from  Wei-Chuan construction refused to comment on the condition of the Atlantis  Motel, saying it is Huang's private business. Wei-Chuan Construction pays the  motel's water bills, according to city records.  </P> <P> Wu blamed the motel's problems on the tenants.  </P> <P> "We paint in the afternoon, they writing by the next morning," Wu said. "Who  can handle? I cannot handle."  </P> <P> Wu, who had a pile of eviction notices on his desk, said he has tried to evict  unruly tenants, but said: "They don't want to leave."  </P> <P> Pulone is not sympathetic. If Wu can't get rid of unruly tenants, somebody else  should, he said.  </P> <P> "You know who I really feel sorry for?" he said. "The kids. All those poor  little kids."  </P></p>

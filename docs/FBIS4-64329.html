			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Code Name `Bozorg Allawi'"] </F>   [Text] The Federal Government obviously has more  information about the murder of four Kurdish opposition members  on 17 September 1992 in the Berlin restaurant Mykonos than has  been assumed. This is indicated in a secret report dated 29  June 1993 by Working Group Iran of the Federal Office for the  Protection of the Constitution. According to this report, the  attack was prepared by the Iranian intelligence service in Bonn  and carried out under the code name "Bozorg Allawi." According  to the report, the largest of the three Iranian intelligence  services acting in Germany, the Ministry of Information and  Security (MOIS), has its headquarters for West Europe at the  Iranian Embassy in Bonn. The MOIS department has existed since  the turn of the year 1986/87, says the report. It is housed on  a specially secured floor of the embassy and has a radio room  and a staff of at least 20. According to information obtained  by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the  intelligence service headquarters is also involved in the  illegal transfer of military technology and is particularly  interested in "NBC [nuclear, biological, chemical] weapons  technology." The report also says that products for NBC weapons  systems have been exported with the help of intelligence service  personnel through Iranian cover firms in Germany and abroad,  bypassing all export bans. The attorney of a joint plaintiff  has requested that the report of the Office for the Protection  of the Constitution be now used in the Mykonos trial.</p>

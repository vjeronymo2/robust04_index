			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Funding gap 'threatens BR sell-off' LACK OF investment in British Rail threatens the privatisation of the network, the rail users' statutory watchdog said yesterday. Major General Lennox Napier, chairman of the Central Transport Consultative Committee, said: 'BR is under-invested, struggling to maintain service levels, shedding resources, and staff morale is not high.' Presenting the committee's annual report he said the gap between the available funding and what BR needed was 'becoming unbridgeable'. BR's external financing limit for passenger businesses in 1993-94 was set at Pounds 706m, compared with Pounds 1.2bn the previous year, leaving the network 'once again seriously short of funds'. Passenger services could begin to break down. 'Some passengers could find themselves travelling in older, shorter, less frequent and more crowded trains,' he said. Rails, ballast and signalling were getting old but there was no money to maintain infrastructure. This would result in short-term service reductions and speed restrictions. If privatisation was to have any chance of success, there were two overriding requirements: a high and sustained level of investment, and continuation of all the advantages of one co-ordinated network - including through-ticketing, a national timetable and information systems, and general acceptance of railcards and discounted fares. The committee also warned that market forces would not work in the passenger interest, and said the test of whether privatisation would be successful was the extent to which passengers were protected from backdoor fare increases. The price of private-sector involvement should not be paid by passengers through higher fares and loss of network benefits. It called on the government to require private operators to participate in existing fare schemes and keep price rises broadly in line with inflation. The committee said this year's fare rises of up to 10 per cent amounted to exploitation of BR's monopoly. A backlog of essential repairs was storing up problems, with many essential schemes stalled because conventional sources of funding were inadequate. It warned that the 'investment hiatus' could continue after privatisation as franchising arrangements might encourage franchisees to bid for the lowest possible subsidy. Punctuality and reliability varied considerably last year. InterCity's record - although slightly improved this year with 84.3 per cent of trains less than 10 minutes late - was still below target. On the Kent coast and Thames routes, the record was 'dismal'. Only the Gatwick Express surpassed its punctuality target. Overcrowding had worsened on some lines in spite of a fall in London commuter volumes. Area committees recorded a 13 per cent increase in passengers' complaints to 9,471 - the 11th consecutive yearly increase. CTCC Annual Report 1992-93.

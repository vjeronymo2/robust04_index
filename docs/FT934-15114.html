			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Unilever agrees to buy Japanese margarine brand UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products company, has agreed to buy a margarine brand from Ajinomoto, a leading Japanese food manufacturer, for an undisclosed price. The acquisition will lift Nippon Lever, Unilever's Japanese unit, to Japan's second largest margarine producer, with 25 per cent of the market. The move comes at a time when Japanese food companies are restructuring their operations by cutting down on products and reducing inventories. Ajinomoto, which is also trying to slim its business by cutting unprofitable operations, will leave the margarine market altogether with the sale of its Marina brand. The company entered the market 23 years ago.</p>

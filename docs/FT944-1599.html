			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (15): Trading post has big ideas - Brno, the country's second city, aims to become a centre for business Any city that lives in the shadow of Prague can count on being ignored most of the time. This gives an edge to Brno's attempts to become a business centre in its own right. For British veterans of the second world war, the city is perhaps best known as the home of the Bren gun. This fast and accurate machine gun was just one of the first-class light armaments for which the Moravian capital is famous. The desire to seize control of the region's arms industry was one of the reasons behind Hitler's decision to annex Bohemia and Moravia in 1938. The arms industry is now a shadow of its former self, although rebuilding a slimmed-down and modernised arms industry is again considered politically respectable. President Vaclav Havel's high-minded talk of getting rid of the Czechoslovak arms industry after the Velvet Revolution got short shrift in Moravia and Slovakia, where the industry employs thousands. Many of the best-known names in Czech industry are located in Brno, including Zetor, the tractor maker which is currently going through a painful restructuring process. With its long tradition of engineering skills and its endless industrial suburbs, the city is the Czech Republic's leading centre for transportation and agricultural machinery production. Some two-thirds of Brno's workforce is employed in the engineering, optics and glass industries. The skills base has attracted significant foreign investment, which is helping old capital-starved industries to restructure and modernise. ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant, has invested heavily in Brno in the past three years, and now employs nearly 6,000 people at engineering and electronics plants in the city. About a sixth of Brno's 390,000 inhabitants are students at its six universities which means a big supply of skilled labour for regional industries, which also include mining, energy and metallurgy. Internationally, Brno is probably best known as central Europe's largest trade fair centre. The city has been a trading post for centuries, and this year alone more than 1m visitors have attended dozens of fairs at the 750,000sq metre BVV exhibition grounds on the outskirts. The fairs draw exhibitors from around the world, with a greater number coming from the west since the collapse of communism destroyed the Comecon trading bloc. Mr Bretislav Fabian, sales director at BVV, says the Brno exhibitions 'are as important for central Europe as Frankfurt is for the west'. The highlight is a giant engineering fair every September, which this year drew more than 3,200 exhibitors from 35 countries. The city authorities have ambitious plans for reviving derelict areas of the city centre, including the construction of a huge shopping and office complex that will mean moving the city's main railway terminus. A joint venture between the city, the technical university and the UK construction company Bovis, part of the P&amp;O group, is building a Czech Technology Park on a 120-hectare site on the city's outskirts. Providing high-tech office space for new industries, it will capitalise on established academic-corporate links. The park has already secured Siemens Telecommunications as its first big-name client, according to Mr James Hoddell of Healey &amp; Baker, which is marketing the development but the entire Dollars 200m development is not expected to be finished for at least a decade.</p>

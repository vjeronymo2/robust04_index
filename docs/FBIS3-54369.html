It is worth noting that Tunis became the headquarters of  eight Palestinian federations following the PLO's departure from  Beirut in 1983. They are the federations of writers; lawyers  and jurists; teachers, women, workers, engineers; doctors,  pharmacists, and dentists, and farmers. [passage omitted]</p>

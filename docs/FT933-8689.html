			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / So where was Bernard Tapie? Time will tell THE tangled saga of Olympique-Marseille, the top French football team whose officials are under investigation for rigging a match against Valenciennes last season, has opened a farcical new chapter. French police are trying to establish whether Mr Bernard Tapie, the team's owner and a former Socialist minister, tried to bribe the Valenciennes trainer to cover up the scandal. The O-M scandal, which has dominated the French media throughout the summer, erupted in June when a Valenciennes player admitted accepting FFr250,000 (Pounds 28,000) from O-M officials to play badly in a game so the Marseilles club could beat his team. The scandal broke new heights when Mr Boro Primorac, the Valenciennes team's trainer, accused Mr Tapie of offering him a bribe at a meeting in Paris on June 17 to take the blame for rigging the match. Luckily for Mr Tapie one of his old cabinet colleagues, Mr Jacques Mellick, mayor of Bethune in northern France, leapt to his defence by saying he was with him in Paris from 2.30pm to 3.30pm on June 17, the time when Mr Primorac said Mr Tapie was trying to bribe him. But Mr Tapie's alibi seemed to fall apart this week when the police discovered photographs of Mr Mellick addressing a meeting of town hall employees in Bethune on June 17. The dateline on the pictures, taken by a local agency, was 2pm. Bethune town hall is 220km away from Mr Tapie's office. Mr Mellick could not possibly have been there at 2pm and with Mr Tapie in Paris at 2.30pm. Where was he? Mr Mellick has insisted that he was in Mr Tapie's office. He claimed that he was late for the meeting and arrived at the town hall at about 5pm. The employees at the meeting have backed his story - to the police and the French press. The tide of public opinion seemed to be swinging in Mr Mellick's favour until reports circulated that one of the photographs seized showed the watch of Ms Brigitte Navez, a town hall employee, and that the time shown on the watch did not tally with the mayor's story. All the police have said is that their examination of the photograph was inconclusive. One of Mr Mellick's aides said at a press conference that Ms Navez's watch was known to be faulty. Meanwhile Mr Mellick, well aware that his own reputation as well as Mr Tapie's hangs in the balance, has agreed to be questioned by the judge investigating the O-M affaire.</p>

The Moscow government transferred a statement to Interfax  saying that the Moscow authorities had made no decisions on  reburial of Lenin nor about his mausoleum.    In accordance with the Russian law on the status of Moscow,  all buildings and facilities on the Moscow territory on which  the legislative, executive and judicial bodies are situated  belong to the Russian Federation.    The statement underlined that the Moscow City's Executive  Committee had mentioned the Lenin Mausoleum among architectural  monuments in March, 1987.    "This is to say that only the federal bodies can decide on  the future of the mausoleum. However, the position of the  Moscow government which defends the historical monument, must be  taken into consideration," the statement says.</p>

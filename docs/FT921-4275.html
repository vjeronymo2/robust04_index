			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Aid needed to build new copper smelters' NEW COPPER smelters are unlikely to be built without the help of government grants because the financial returns they offer are otherwise unattractive, says Mr Ken Sangster, technical director of Outokumpu Copper Resources. The state-owned Finnish mining and metals group announced two weeks ago that it had shelved its proposed Metcob copper smelter project in Portugal. 'We didn't like the figures we saw (from a feasibility study) earlier this year,' says Mr Heikki Solin, OCR's managing director. When first mooted, it seemed that Portuguese government financial assistance would be available for the Metcob smelter. However, 'the money is now needed for other projects with a higher priority,' says Mr Solin. Exchange-control difficulties arising from the fact that the smelter would have been in the European Ecu area while copper is mainly traded in US dollars, also played a part in the decision not to go ahead, he adds. The smelter would have been heavily dependent on imported raw material because it could take no more than half its requirements from the new Neves Corvo mine in Portugal. Outokumpu has considered several copper projects over the past few years but its 60 per cent shareholding in Metcob meant that most attention was given to that project. The Finnish group also was among the potential buyers of the former Rio Tinto Minero copper smelter at Huelva in Spain, now owned by Ercros, a company controlled by Kuwaiti interests. Mr Solin says that it was not possible to agree a price, however. Mr Sangster suggests the 108,000-tonnes-a-year Spanish smelter 'runs well but needs expanding'. OCR was established last May as part of a change in Outokumpu's strategy that sees the group in divisions concentrating on individual metals. Now that the Metcob project has been dropped, OCR's main interest is in developing copper mines in Chile, particularly its 100 per cent owned Zaldivar project. Its terms of reference do not include Outokumpu's Scandinavian mines or the smelter at the Harjavalta copper-nickel complex in Finland. Outokumpu is 'examining its options' for the Harjavalta smelter and its decisions obviously have a bearing on whether or not some of the group's other copper smelter projects are looked at again. Three other copper smelter projects are being considered. Metallgesellschaft, the German group, is involved with various partners in a Dollars 500m scheme for Indonesia to produce 150,000 tonnes of copper a year; and Mitsubishi of Japan is considering one at Texas City, Texas, and one in Thailand. Industry sources suggest that the Thai smelter will be the first to go ahead while there is a growing possibility that the Texas project will be shelved, even though Mitsubishi has spent two years gaining various planning approvals.</p>

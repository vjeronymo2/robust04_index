			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST GERMANS EAGER TO HIRE NEW ARRIVALS  </P> <P> The refugees from Communist East Germany pitching their tents at this impromptu  camp near the Danube River sense that the freewheeling, capitalistic society  they have opted for might have some perils.  </P> <P> But few, it would appear, expected that their very first encounters would be  with headhunters.  </P> <P> For West German headhunters -- Western jargon for employment solicitors -- have  descended on the camp in Vilshofen and the others around Passau in Bavaria,  offering jobs to the newcomers, with apartments included.  </P> <P> "A young couple arrived here yesterday morning," remarked camp director  Friedrich-Wilhelm Moog as he made his rounds Tuesday. "I introduced them to a  local hotel owner, and he hired them, with living quarters. So they had a job,  home and were serving guests by evening."  </P> <P> The two bulletin boards in the 800-bed tent camp are cluttered  </P> <P> with the tacked-up blandishments of prospective employers.  </P> <P> There is one from a butcher in Munich, another from a plastics company with  offices in five cities, calls for physiotherapists, people who can work with  the aged, carpenters, bricklayers, stone masons, mechanics, construction  workers, technicians of various sorts.  </P> <P> And many of the refugees are qualified to respond. Most are young and skilled  craftsmen.  </P> <P> "I think most of them have pretty good qualifications, even if they haven't  been trained in the latest techniques," said Moog, who has been sending the  newcomers out to more permanent locations at a rapid rate. "Some of the  refugees can even pick and choose -- doctors and nurses are in demand  everywhere in West Germany."  </P> <P> His view was echoed by one of the headhunters, Elisabeth Simon, the head nurse  of the university hospital in Ulm in southern Germany.  </P> <P> "I am looking for 10 nurses for our hospital," she said during a break between  questioning newcomers. "We already have five nurses from East Germany, and they  are very professional. It is good for our West German nurses to see how well  the others do. I would sign up any I can find on the spot, with apartment  included."  </P> <P> On Tuesday morning, Simon's prospects were only so-so, however. "I found one  nurse from Magdeburg," she said, "but she already had plans to go to Cologne."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the nursing headhunter had found a 23-year-old nurse named  Brigitte who was still thinking over the offer -- though the newcomer said she  was inclined to accept a similar offer from a hospital in Augsburg.  </P> <P> "My boyfriend, who came with me, is a bricklayer," Brigitte said, "and he would  like to live closer to Munich, though I don't think we could afford to live in  Munich itself."  </P> <P> Brigitte said she and her 25-year-old boyfriend had already given much thought  to where they would work and live in West Germany. And their departure is  reflective of the quality of worker that East Germany is losing during the  refugee exodus.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Filling the Void  </P> <P> Also, Brigitte's story is emblematic of the consequent gain to West Germany --  for, Moog points out, the newcomers are filling the void in the demographic gap  here and will help pay taxes supporting the elderly in the future.  </P> <P> Brigitte said she spent three years in nursing school in Brandenburg and was  working in a home for the elderly in East Berlin.  </P> <P> "I love my parents, and I had a good childhood," she said. "I don't have any  bad memories. The older people are satisfied in East Germany. They have a  house, a car, maybe a weekend cottage. But the young people want to move  around, to be free, to travel. I had a good job and a three-room apartment.  </P> <P> "It's hard to say exactly what I disliked. But it was the (Communist) party  people always putting you down. The government acts afraid. They don't  understand the hopes of the young people in the country."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Has No Regrets  </P> <P> So Brigitte left a good job and her family for the West -- and, as yet, she has  no regrets.  </P> <P> "I asked my sister to come," she recalled, "and she wanted to, but her husband  wished to stay. She was happy that I got out. Her only fear was that I might be  caught and sent back to East Berlin. I really have no fears now about the  future here."  </P> <P> Another refugee, Bertram, is a 28-year-old roofer who fled with his wife and  child and his brother's family, a total of six.  </P> <P> Busily filling out his documents, he said: "The main thing I didn't like was  that the government was always saying something that you couldn't believe. When  we were growing up, they always said that the Western European countries were  our enemy, that the Soviets were good and the Americans bad.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'More Propaganda'  </P> <P> "But my father warned me not to believe all the propaganda, and as I got older  I could make up my own mind. I served in the army for a couple of years and  didn't like that -- more propaganda. I came to believe that someone in the East  is not much different than someone in the West. I'm a roofer. He's a roofer.  What's the difference? Only politicians believe there's a difference."  </P> <P> He hopes to get a job in his trade and has asked to go to Stuttgart, the  thriving capital of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.  </P> <P> A typical young mother in the process of moving from East to West is  23-year-old Ulla, with a 2-year-old baby in a carriage.  </P> <P> She worked in an electronics factory, while her 30-year-old husband was a house  painter.  </P> <P> "Part of the reason we crossed the border," she said, "was so that my daughter  could grow up and get the education she wanted. We didn't want her to be told  what to do by the government. We wanted her to have her own personality."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Straight From Vacation  </P> <P> She added: "We were a group of four families. Three wanted to leave, and one  wanted to stay. We had been applying to leave legally for three years, with no  success. So, when we were coming back from vacation in Romania and heard on  Radio Free Europe that the border was open, we suddenly decided to come here.  </P> <P> "I am looking forward to having an apartment with a washing machine," Ulla  said. "That we never had in East Germany."  </P> <P> Indeed, the youth and vitality of the newcomers is evident in the camps in  Bavaria -- Moog estimates the average age of his charges at 27, not counting  children.  </P> <P> One gray-haired gentleman surveying the bulletin board was approached and asked  if he was perhaps an older refugee.  </P> <P> "Oh, no, I'm here trying to hire a landscape gardener," replied the aging  headhunter.  </P> <P> COMMUNIST DEMAND  </P> <P> East Germany urged Hungary to curb the exodus.

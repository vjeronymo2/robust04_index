			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: S&amp;P slashes card rate - Investment group throws down challenge to bigger rivals IAN LINDSEY is more than just positive about the new Visa credit card launched this week by Save &amp; Prosper, the investment group of which he is a director. 'Customers would be absolutely stupid not to apply,' he says. S&amp;P's card undercuts the competition significantly. The annualised percentage rate of 14.6 per cent compares with 22.9 APR with Barclaycard and 23.9 APR on National Westminster's Visa card. These are the two largest issuers, with just under 13m cards between them compared with S&amp;P's 100,000. S&amp;P customers can also choose their statement date and apply for a Mastercard at no extra charge. So, are there any drawbacks? Until this week, S&amp;P applicants could choose between a fee-free card with an interest rate of 23.1 APR, or a card with a Pounds 10 annual fee and an interest rate of 21.3 APR. These cards have now been dropped for new applicants, although Lindsey says those who have them will not have their terms and conditions changed. The Pounds 12 annual fee - Pounds 2 higher than the old one - is reflected in the APR figure, which also includes the monthly rate of interest. But it does not take into account the date from which interest is charged. Unlike the other issuers, who levy interest from the date of transactions for those not paying off their bill in full each month, S&amp;P in the past charged interest only from the statement date - which is more favourable for customers. It says this meant a rate 3 per cent lower than for cards with the same monthly interest rate and annual fee, but that this difference was not reflected in the APR figure. 'The APR is said to be a guide to the cost of credit but, in our experience, it is one of the most misleading statistics which parliament has ever required banks to quote,' says Lindsey. The group has called regularly for a change but has been told by the Department of Trade and Industry that a new formula would be too complicated. Lindsey says there was no choice but to charge new cardholders interest, where appropriate, from the transaction date. S&amp;P denies it will raise the rate in due course, as rivals have claimed. 'If the general level of interest rates remains unchanged for the next decade, then our rate will not change; that's a cast-iron guarantee,' vows Lindsey - who believes his rivals overcharge customers. Paul Bateman, S&amp;P's chief executive, says the rate can be sustained because the group's operations are linked to the money market, which reflects base rates of 6 per cent at present. Some of the associated charges on the new card can be higher than for other issuers. S&amp;P could charge Pounds 25 to replace a stolen or missing card and Pounds 15 for obtaining a carbon copy; Barclays issues new cards free and charges only Pounds 3 for a carbon copy. Lindsey says, however, that these charges will usually be applied only when customers regularly (and wrongly) challenge transactions or if they lose their card often. He stresses that they are intended to combat fraud. Applicants for the new card must own their home, be a UK resident, have a regular income and a clean credit record. Those earning less than Pounds 10,000 a year are unlikely to qualify. The Pounds 12 annual fee is waived until March 1994 for those applying before November 26.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RAY: "Zambian President: Come and </F> Invest With Us"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 3 Feb (BELGA) -- The best way to promote  the cause of democracy in Zambia and Africa in general is to  invest in them, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba stated on  Thursday [3 February] in Brussels.    At a speech delivered to the chamber of commerce of Belgium  and Luxembourg and the ACP states (Africa, Caribbean and the  Pacific), he stressed that (black) Africa was changing and the  continent's image as the "black" continent which it had until a  few years ago no longer corresponded to the reality of the  situation.    The Zambian president, who peacefully succeeded Mr. Kenneth  Kaunda following elections in 1991, an almost unique event in  Africa, has been on a three-day visit to Belgium since  Wednesday, during which he is to meet European Community  officials.    Mr. Chiluba, a former trade unionist, added that "new  leaders" and "new regimes" had appeared, who were asking for  time in order to continue with democratization.    "The best way of helping us in this matter is by investing  in  my country," he added.    Mr. Chiluba believes that Zambia now possesses a pluralist  political system. "I could be beaten at the next elections," he  stressed.    The Zambian president also affirmed that his government had  been insisting on the privatization of the economy since 1991.  "Previously" (under the regime of the single party of the left,  editor's note) it had been 80 percent nationalized. Other  priorities are the fight against inflation and investments in  roads and education.    Mr. Chiluba was received by King Albert II on Thursday  morning. Following a meeting with the ambassadors of the ACP  states, he met in the afternoon with European Commission  President Jacques Delors.    Friday morning, he will be meeting with Belgian Foreign  Minister Willy Claes, and the secretary of state for cooperation  development, Mr. Erik Derycke, over a working lunch.</p>

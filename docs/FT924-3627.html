			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Thames taxis will rival RiverBus MR STEVEN NORRIS, minister for transport in London, is due next week to launch a high-frequency Thames passenger service that will rival the troubled RiverBus, currently under threat of closure. The service is planned by Thames Fast Ferries, a subsidiary of the Swindon-based White Horse property group which also runs the Tilbury to Gravesend ferry downriver from the capital. Earlier this year White Horse tried to take over RiverBus with the intention of integrating its operations with its own planned services, but the bid was rejected by RiverBus's owners, the administrators of Canary Wharf. The vessel to be launched by Mr Norris is the first of a fleet of 26 high-speed river taxis, each seating 12 people. Thames Fast Ferries expects to manufacture the others at the rate of about one a month. That means it is likely to be 1994 before the full service is in operation, although Thames Fast Ferries hopes to have a 'creditable' service going by next autumn. Initially the route will stretch from Chelsea to Docklands, but it might later stretch upriver to Putney. The company is also planning to run fast commuter services into London from Tilbury and Gravesend. Within cental London, vessels will run every five to 7 1/2 minutes. The company will have more landing stages than RiverBus: possible extra stops may include Blackfriars, Southwark Bridge and Tower Bridge. But vessels will stop only on demand, to shorten journey times. The river taxi fares will be no lower than those charged by RiverBus and the new services will not be included in the London Transport travelcard scheme. RiverBus has lost money consistently since it started services in 1988, partly because passengers have been deterred by high fares. Its losses are being underwritten by Canary Wharf's administrators pending a decision on its long-term future.</p>

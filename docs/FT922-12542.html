			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Observer: A mucky business Union Carbide's decision to sell its Indian subsidiary is a glum footnote to the 1984 poison gas disaster at its Bhopal plant, which killed 4,000 and injured 200,000 more. According to the unofficial Union Carbide version, it was the company's urge to keep control of its Indian business which contributed to the disaster in the first place. Back in the 1970s, when the Indian government decided to make multinationals relinquish majority control of Indian subsidiaries, most companies knuckled under. Others, such as IBM and Coca-Cola, pulled out entirely. Union Carbide did a deal. In return for keeping 51 per cent of the subsidiary, it agreed to build the Bhopal plant. The attraction for the Indians was that the factory produced a pesticide which generated export earnings. The drawback for Union Carbide was that the pesticide, Sevin, was too out-of-date to make much cash. How far the plant was then allowed to deteriorate is still hotly disputed. Union Carbide now proposes to put Dollars 17m of the sale money into a Bhopal hospital trust, raising its compensation payments to nearly Dollars 500m. But the affair does not rest there. Three weeks ago, the Indian government renewed its attempts to have Warren Anderson, 70-year-old ex-head of the company, extradited from the US on a charge of criminal negligence.</p>

According to the spokesman after being repelled, the PUK  forces had reported to Iraq's National Congress troops stationed  in the buffer zone between the belligerent parties, that the  IMP-KDP forces had intended to attack them.    Since the establishment of a ceasefire and deployment of  Iraq's National Congress troops, the PUK forces have repeatedly  violated the ceasefire under various pretexts, the spokesman  added.    PUK holds the view that Badenban region in the north and  Souran in the south of Kurdistan should be partitioned and  Kurdistan be administered as favored by the PUK.</p>

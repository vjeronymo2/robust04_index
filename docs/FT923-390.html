			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Danes may vote Yes next year, poll shows A MAJORITY of Danish voters would consider voting Yes in a second referendum on the Maastricht treaty next year if special arrangements are made to exempt Denmark from some treaty obligations. A Gallup poll published yesterday said 64 per cent of those questioned would consider voting Yes under these circumstances and only 16 per cent would vote No. In a referendum in June 50.7 per cent of voters rejected ratification of the treaty, while 49.3 per cent voted in favour. An agreement giving special exemptions to Denmark from participating in a common European defence policy, or introducing a common currency and European citizenship is under discussion between the minority government and other parties in the Folketing. An official Danish proposal to the other 11 members of the EC is expected in late November in time for the Danish issue to be discussed at the European Community heads of government meeting in Edinburgh in December. The Gallup poll results indicate that voters have not regretted the outcome of the referendum in June. If there are no concessions some 90 per cent of those who voted No would do so again, while only 83 per cent of those who voted Yes would do so.</p>

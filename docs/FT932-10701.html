			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Observer: Soundless Adding insult to injury, shareholders in Philips who haven't seen a dividend in three years, yesterday witnessed their AGM going-home present - traditionally a compact disc produced by Polygram - also evaporate into thin air. Nothing to do with the current hoo-ha about the exorbitant cost of CDs in Europe - 'we're not a spiteful company,' a London-based spokesman was quick to point out - the measure was attributed by president Jan Timmer simply to energetic corporate belt-tightening. Shareholders had been warned of the new policy in advance, which no doubt explains why the attendance figures dropped from 2,700 last year to 1,739 yesterday.</p>

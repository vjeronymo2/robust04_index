			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Martin Krno: "Rather Vague Indications; The </F> Movement for a Democratic Slovakia Presidium Decided on the Head  of the Election Campaign Team"]    [Text] Bratislava--The Saturday [16 April] meeting of the  National Presidium of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS], held behind closed doors, as has by now become a  tradition, dealt with the assessment of the political situation  in Slovakia and the policy statement of Jozef Moravcik's  coalition government, the movement's strategy for the coming  elections, and the election of new members of the HZDS Political  Board.    The meeting, which was chaired by HZDS Chairman Vladimir  Meciar, decided that Viliam Sobona, former minister of health,  will become head of the election campaign team. So far, the  Farmers Party of Slovakia [RSS] is the only party to have  officially expressed its readiness to form a preelection  coalition with the HZDS. As HZDS Deputy Chairman Sergej Kozlik  told a briefing after the HZDS Presidium meeting, talks on  closer cooperation with other political entities are under  way--for example, with the Slovak National Party and the  Christian Social Union, whose substantial part, however, now  seem to be inclined toward cooperation with Cernak's National  Democratic Party. Kozlik characterized the tone of the speech,  with which the prime minister introduced his policy statement in  parliament, and the contents of the document itself as  confrontational. He said that the coalition government's main  goal was to discredit the preceding cabinet of Vladimir Meciar  and warned against concessions to Hungarian political parties in  the spheres of culture, education, and the water regime at  Gabcikovo. Deputy Katarina Tothova considers the fact that the  government parties are not doing anything to prepare the  elections slated for late September or early October to be an  indication that this election date is jeopardized. On the basis  of an interview given by Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Simko to  Radio Free Europe, she also voiced the serious suspicion that  the "provisional" government is seeking constitutional changes.  When asked by PRAVDA, however, she was not able to specify those  changes. Another indication, she said, was the intention to  lower the present 5-percent threshold for political parties to  win seats in the National Council, even though no representative  of coalition parties has officially discussed this issue yet.    [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 18 April on page 2  carries a 200-word TA SR report on a meeting of the All-Slovak  Executive Committee of the Farmers Party of Slovakia, held in  Zvolen on 17 April. The report notes that members of the  Executive Council "unanimously approved the formation of a joint  electoral coalition with the HZDS."]</p>

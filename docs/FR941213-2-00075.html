			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD posits that this proposal will produce benefits to vendors as well as their customers. First, it will simplify the billing process by eliminating the need to separately identify and track those terminals receiving one or the other covered service. This should minimize the potential for billing disputes between vendors and their customers, and simplify the process by which vendors authorize (or deauthorize) subscriber devices for receipt of real-time quotation and transaction information on Nasdaq and OTC issues, Second, it will increase market transparency by ensuring that all subscribers to NSMI's comprehensive quotation data ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the quotations on Nasdaq and OTCBB issues that Level 1 subscribers currently receive) will receive trade-by-trade information for the same universe of quoted securities. Thus, the vendors' customers will automatically have access to more expansive data that can be used to gauge market trends and facilitate investment decisions. And third, implementation of this proposal will materially advance NSMI's efforts to simplify and update its fee structure, with a view toward reducing the administrative burdens and costs incurred by vendors that distribute quotation and transaction data from the Nasdaq and OTC markets, respectively. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  In this regard, the NASD notes that the SEC previously approved a similar initiative that linked the subscription of quotation and transaction data services for New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') listed issues and established unified subscriber fees. This was accomplished by certain amendments to the Consolidated Tape and Consolidated Quotation Plans. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The action proposed in this filing is one of a number of steps contemplated in the process of responding to vendor and subscriber concerns respecting the administration of information display, utilization and entitlement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Release No. 34&hyph;24130 (February 20, 1987); 52 FR 6413 (March 3, 1987). While the NYSE initiative resulted in decreased payments for a majority of subscribers with one display device, the Commission noted that some subscribers with one display device would pay increased charges and that certain smaller firms that had currently received transaction information only would experience a fee increase. The Commission, in its approval order encouraged the CTA and CQ Plan participants to monitor the operation of its revised structure to determine if relief for smaller firms is practicable.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The NASD and NSMI believe that that proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(5) specifies that the rules of a national securities association shall provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members, issuers and other persons using any facility or system that the association operates or controls. The proposed change in fee structure effects the consolidation of two existing services into a single service, priced at the current levels of the constituent services. As such, the proposal does not constitute a fee increase for those subscribers receiving the most comprehensive service. However, its implementation will require that Level 1 subscribers who had not previously received last sale data also pay for receipt of complete last sale data. In terms of the universe of Level 1 terminals currently supported, this segment accounts for about 6.5% of the terminal population. It should be noted that this percentage has been declining in recent years, apparently reflecting the enhanced value of last sale data that now includes all Nasdaq-listed securities and thousands of OTC equity securities. The NASD believes that the additional cost of $9.75 that some subscribers will incur will be partially offset by the administrative savings. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  In particular, large subscribers will no longer have to verify the accuracy of billings by tracking terminals that receive only one of the covered services. Administrative savings should also accrue to vendors with large populations of subscribers receiving Nasdaq market data. Moreover, the instant proposal will effect a simplification in the fee structure applicable to receipt of two major data services supported by NSMI. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> To the extent that some small volume subscribers to the current Level 1 service do not wish to receive the consolidated service they may subscribe to a vendor service offering the same categories of information on a delayed basis. NSMI imposes no subscriber charge for delayed market data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The NASD and NSMI also believe that this proposal is consistent with certain national market system objectives expressed by Congress in adopting Section 11A(a)(1) of the Act in 1975. Specifically, the Congress found that the efficiency of the nation's securities markets would be advanced by the broad dissemination of reliable quotation and transaction information to brokers, dealers, and investors. In other words, the Congress sought to increase market transparency by fostering opportunities for electronic delivery of current market data to the constituencies served by the various securities markets. The NASD submits that its proposal is consistent with Section 11A(a)(1) because it will optimize the distribution of real-time quotation and transaction data from the Nasdaq and OTC markets to market professionals handling customer orders. As a result, registered representatives using desk-top terminals to supply current market data on Nasdaq or OTC equities will automatically be able to furnish their customers with insider bids/offers as well as last sale prices for these securities. Hence, consolidation of the Level 1 and Last Sale services translates to expanded access to market data for retail investors who depend on their brokers for current market information  Finally, the NASD notes that the Commission previously approved amendments to the Consolidated Tape and Consolidated Quotation Plans that effected a bundling of quotation and last sale data services (and the establishment of unified subscriber fees) respecting NYSE-listed securities covered by these national market system plans. Based on these factors, the NASD reiterates its belief that the instant proposal is fully consistent with the data distribution objectives contained in Section 11A(a)(1) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

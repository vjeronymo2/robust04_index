			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Skandia to oppose merger by Volvo Volvo's campaign to win support for the merger of its car and truck operations with Renault received a setback last night when Skandia, an insurance company holding about 4 per cent of its voting capital, decided to oppose it. The move is a blow to Volvo's hopes of winning approval at a shareholders' meeting on December 7. Skandia said the merger was neither in the interests of Volvo shareholders nor the country. It brought to around 8.5 per cent the number of votes opposing the deal. Aktiespararna, the small shareholders' association whose members represent up to 6 per cent, is also opposed. Volvo is certain of about 30 per cent of the votes but of six Swedish institutional shareholders to have declared their stance, only two support it. Skandia's decision will narrow the chances of Volvo winning the majority it needs to fend off a legal challenge from Aktiespararna. Even if the deal goes through, Skandia said it will join a growing move among major shareholders to reshape the Volvo board, a step principally aimed against Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the chairman.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Brussels turns up heat on Bundesbank THE European Commission called yesterday for a 2 percentage point cut in short-term European interest rates, stepping up pressure on the Bundesbank to ease German monetary policy to stimulate economic recovery. Mr Henning Christophersen, European Commission vice-president, told EC finance ministers in Luxembourg that if such a cut was followed by a 1 percentage point reduction in long-term rates, growth in the EC would increase by 0.7 per cent. Germany had earlier successfully blocked inclusion of Commission growth predictions in an 88-page report on the EC's new 'growth package' published yesterday. The package is an action plan by member states to use supply-side measures to stimulate economies. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said interest rates in Germany were coming down gradually. 'If everybody (in the EC) had similar policies, everybody would have similar interest rates.' The polite criticism of German policy was echoed by Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, who said interest rates were too high to be compatible with a recovery. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the new French finance minister, said lower rates were the sina qua non for growth in Europe. The growth package unveiled yesterday is the culmination of a six-month Commission campaign for member states to shift from current to capital spending, pursue wage restraint and take advantage of modest Community powers to lend to small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Christophersen valued the package at Ecu35bn (Pounds 27.89bn) - a mixture of national measures, extra private investment generated by lending by the European Investment Bank and a new European Investment Fund. An estimated 450,000 new jobs were likely to be created in 1993 and 1994, while growth was likely to be 0.6 points higher next year than the present forecast of 1.75 per cent. However, doubts remain about the package's value. Mr Christophersen was unable to give a precise breakdown between member states' contributions and Community-led efforts. He also left open the possibility of revising downwards the Commission's forecast of 0.75 per cent growth in the EC this year. But ministers stressed the package shows member states are able to act collectively - a point underscored by the presence of finance ministers from the European Free Trade Area at yesterday's meeting. The Commission also hopes the package will persuade the US and Japan to stimulate their economies at July's G7 meeting in Tokyo.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Restructuring helps Omron to rise 42% Extensive restructuring enabled Omron, one of the largest makers of automation control components, to post sharply increased profits on slightly higher turnover in the six months to September 30. Recurring profits - before tax and extraordinary items - rose by 42 per cent on the same period a year ago to Y3.1bn (Dollars 31.85m), while sales grew by 1.4 per cent to Y176.2bn. After tax earnings increased by 38.2 per cent to Y1.9bn. The company said domestic demand remained very weak, and that the increase in turnover was produced largely by higher exports. Competitive cost-cutting and strong growth in overseas markets had helped to overcome the effects of the strong yen. Among the company's main divisions, only electronic fund transfer systems saw substantially higher growth in the period - up 13 per cent  - as demand for bank automation systems remained strong. The core control components and systems division achieved a small gain in turnover on higher exports. Restructuring would continue in the remainder of the financial year ending next March, the company said, and would include development of new businesses and products and the establishment of a regional headquarters in China in an attempt to expand business there. Omron forecast annual recurring profits of Y8.5bn, up by 13 per cent on last year, with turnover higher by 2 per cent at Y378bn.</p>

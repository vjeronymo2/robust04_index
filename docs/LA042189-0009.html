			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ARREST AFTER WOMAN'S DEATH STUNS AVALON  </P> <P> Residents in quiet Avalon said they were stunned Thursday by the news that one  of their neighbors had been arrested on suspicion of killing his former  girlfriend, in the city's first alleged murder in at least 40 years.  </P> <P> Bruce Edward Kingman, 41, was flown from Avalon to Long Beach on Thursday  afternoon and then driven to the Lakewood Sheriff's Station, where he was being  held without bail for allegedly killing Gail Lynn Pissula, 34.  </P> <P> Some of Kingman's friends and co-workers said she was a former girlfriend of  his who had recently returned to Avalon in search of work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Town Is Stunned'  </P> <P> "Everybody is shook up about it," said Lolo Saldana, owner of the local barber  shop. "The town is stunned."  </P> <P> Paramedics received a call from Kingman about 4 a.m. Thursday and arrived at  his trailer on Pebbly Road to find Pissula lying on the ground nearby,  sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> Kingman said Pissula came to his trailer and the two argued before she slipped  and fell on a wooden patio, said Deputy Dan Cox. Kingman reportedly told  deputies that he attempted to revive her but failed.  </P> <P> Sheriff's officials declined to release other details or to say what led them  to suspect Kingman of murder.  </P> <P> Kingman and Pissula had known each other at least since 1986, when both worked  in Two Harbors, at the opposite end of the island, friends said.  </P> <P> For the past year, Kingman has managed Pebbly Beach Building Supply Co., a  lumberyard just outside the center of Avalon, said Jack Fennie Jr., the owner  of the business.  </P> <P> Fennie described Kingman as an excellent employee who reorganized the  lumberyard and made it more profitable.  </P> <P> He lived alternately in a trailer behind the business and in a sailboat  anchored not far offshore, Fennie said.  </P> <P> Kingman and the dead woman had lived together until they broke up last summer  and she moved to the mainland, Fennie said. But Pissula had returned recently  to look for a summer job in Avalon, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rare Crime  </P> <P> Don Haney, editor of the Catalina Islander newspaper, said the alleged killing  had shocked the community. "But I don't think there is a concern that the  island has changed," he said. "Not many things like this happen."  </P> <P> John Windle, who served as constable on the island for 22 years, said there has  not been a killing that led to a murder conviction on Catalina in at least 40  years.  </P> <P> One woman shot an intruder in her home in the early 1960s and was convicted of  involuntary manslaughter, said Fern Whelan, clerk of the Catalina Justice  Court.  </P></p>

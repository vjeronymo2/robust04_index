			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Energy arm powers Veba turnover  -Sales at PreussenElektra have surged 28% Veba, the German energy-based conglomerate, began a roadshow in the US on Monday - its second in two years - and will travel to Canada later this week as speculation mounts that it might be about to follow Daimler-Benz on to the New York Stock Exchange. Its arrival in the US coincides with a 14.6 per cent increase in turnover for the first quarter of 1994, to DM17.49bn (Dollars 10.9bn). The biggest contributor to the overall result came from the group's energy sector, led by the PreussenElektra subsidiary. PreussenElektra's turnover for the quarter jumped 27.8 per cent to DM4.3bn. Mr Hans-Dieter Harig, chairman of PreussenElektra, exudes a quiet confidence about the sales gains. Significantly, he is confident that PreussenElektra, the second-largest force in the German energy market behind RWE Energie, can respond to growing pressure from both Brussels and Bonn for deregulation and liberalisation of the industry. 'I support these plans for deregulation. But Germany should not go it alone. We should have reciprocity for third-party access,' said Mr Harig. Mr Harig believes that PreussenElektra is well placed to defend its position when the German energy sector opens to outside competition, partly because of geographical location. It enjoys a dominance in energy distribution from Frankfurt to Kiel, and across the northern swathe of eastern Germany. 'This means we do not share a border with France, so we do not have to worry about competition from Electricite de France, the state-owned utility,' he says. PreussenElektra earlier this year concluded a deal with the Treuhand privatisation agency to acquire five units in eastern Germany, cementing its regional monopoly. The company, which last year made profits of DM968m on turnover of DM12.4bn, is keen to defend its position against future competition by tapping Scandinavian markets. In 1991, it set up Baltic Cable, a joint venture with Sydkraft and Vattenfall, the Swedish utilities. The venture will build and operate a 250km undersea cable between Germany and Sweden. The link, costing DM500m, is due to be completed in 1994 and will allow direct exchange of electricity between the two networks. Under the deal, Preussen-Elektra will import hydro-electric power during the day and deliver power back to Sweden at night. PreussenElektra believes it will benefit from the ability to import low-cost hydro and nuclear power, while the Swedish side will have have access to nuclear and coal-fired generation power in times of low rainfall. PreussenElektra has been working with Norwegian utilities since last year to build another undersea cable across the North Sea. These cable links play two roles: apart from increased co-operation with Scandinavia, they open up the possibility for PreussenElektra to expand in Poland and the Baltic States. 'We are not rushing in there. We have to consider economic viability. But we are very interested.' Closer to home, the company faces problems: opposition to nuclear power and falling energy consumption in eastern Germany. Of the electricity generated by public utilities in western Germany, about 37 per cent is sourced by nuclear power. PreussenElektra's share of nuclear power accounts for 47 per cent of that. Yet due to local opposition in Lower Saxony, the company has not been able to recommission its two nuclear power stations at Brunsbuttel, off-line since late 1992, and Krummel, at a standstill since mid-1993. These two units are costing Preussen-Elektra DM10m a month. 'I really see no end in sight to these problems,' says Mr Harig. However, Mr Harig adds that its five other nuclear power stations last year operated with an average availability of nearly 90 per cent, well above the average for the past 10 years. The other problem is that PreussenElektra's 51 per cent stakes in five regional utilities in eastern Germany coincide with a continuing fall in energy consumption in the east, and an increasing use of gas. PreussenElektra paid DM800m for its stakes and will invest DM8bn upgrading the region's power stations over the next several years. Energy consumption in the east fell by 45 per cent between 1989 and 1993. 'Our investments will pay off in the long term,' says Mr Harig. But he does not expect electricity sales to grow by more than 1 per cent a year, implying that no new power station capacity will be needed until 2005. For the moment, the period of expansion has ended. However, PreussenElektra will continue its research into electric vehicles. It has already set up a station on the island of Rugen. 'We are in the very early stages,' said Mr Harig. And like PreussenElektra's investments in Scandinavia and eastern Germany, he believes it is a long-term project. 'This industry is based on the long term.'</p>

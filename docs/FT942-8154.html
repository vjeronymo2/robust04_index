			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Forget trusts - Opt for the managers and make much more Why should long-term investors bother with unit trusts when they could make 10 times as much money out of shares in the trust managers? The question is particularly pertinent as the veteran M&amp;G Group prepares next week to celebrate two unit trust birthdays: a 30th for the M&amp;G Dividend fund and a 25th for M&amp;G Recovery. M&amp;G has been brewing up the customary mix of nostalgic facts and long-term performance figures. Graphs have been drawn showing how Pounds 1,000 in M&amp;G Dividend at launch in May 1964 would have been worth Pounds 65,440 by May 6 this year, (allowing for buying and selling costs, with net income re-invested). On the same basis, Pounds 1,000 invested in M&amp;G Recovery in May 1969 had grown to Pounds 111,040 by the end of April 1994, outperforming the FT All-Share index over the period by a factor of about 4.5. But a comparison investors might find equally striking will not be available: the performance of an investment in M&amp;G's own shares over the past 25 and 30 years. The group says its records do not stretch back that far; the stock exchange says documents covering the 1960s were destroyed in a warehouse fire. Yet it is clear that over the past 15 years, investors could have made up to 10 times as much in M&amp;G Group shares as in M&amp;G unit trusts. Our table compares the performance of a Pounds 1,000 investment in M&amp;G shares with that of a similar investment in a spread of its unit trusts, including both the best and the worst. If anything, the comparison flatters the unit trusts, where dividends are assumed to have been re-invested; the share dividends are not. Although the share performance figures do not allow for buying and selling commissions, these would probably not make much difference. The overall pattern was similar over shorter periods of 10.5 and three years but, the shorter the time scale, the smaller the lead held by M&amp;G shares. And if you look just at the latest year, 12 of the group's unit trusts outstripped its own share price. Nigel Russell, an analyst with James Capel in Edinburgh, says long-term investors would, in most cases, have done better in the shares of a fund management group than in the group's unit trust products. But he cautions that while the rewards can be high, so can the risks. 'With unit trusts, the punter is buying a diversified portfolio whereas, with M&amp;G itself, you are buying a single UK share in a very volatile business,' he says.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                 M&amp;G  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds1,000 investment         15 yr total return(pounds)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- M&amp;G shares                                         41,881 M&amp;G Capital                                        13,097 M&amp;G Dividend                                       10,809 M&amp;G Recovery                                       10,562 M&amp;G Austral &amp; Gen                                   3,608  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: M&amp;G  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

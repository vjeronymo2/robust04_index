			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Pension reform The government's white paper on pension reform indicates there will be more flexibility on the timing of annuity purchases after April 1997. Although details are few, it appears you will be able to take your tax-free cash at retirement and leave the rest of the fund fully invested so long as you buy your annuity by age-75. During the deferment period, it will be possible to draw an annual income from the fund. A second proposal will require the protected rights fund from the appropriate personal pension to buy an annuity that increases each year in line with price inflation, capped at 5 per cent (known as limited price indexation) rather than the 3 per cent fixed rate applicable now. Full details will be given in the Weekend FT in due course</p>

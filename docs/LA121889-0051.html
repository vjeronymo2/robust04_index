			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> EXPORTER SENTENCED IN SALES TO IRAN  </P> <P> A Silicon Valley exporter was sentenced to 33 months in prison and fined  $150,000 for conspiring to ship guided missile parts to Iran. Ken Park of Los  Altos Hills, owner of Ellin International Co. in Sunnyvale, pleaded guilty in  August to the felony charge, and the government dropped six charges of export  violations. He was sentenced in San Francisco by U.S. District Judge John  Vukasin, who could have given him five years in prison. Prosecutors said Park  shipped wing assemblies, illumination devices and other parts for the Hawk,  Sidewinder and Sparrow missile systems, and falsely labeled them as truck and  tractor equipment destined for South Korea.  </P></p>

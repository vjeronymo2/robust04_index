			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Italy to reshape defence industry The Italian government yesterday gave the go-ahead to a reorganisation of the state sector's defence industry by announcing a L4,068bn (Pounds 1.65bn) increase in capital for seven key companies. Mr Piero Barucci, treasury minister, unveiled a plan under which the loss-making groups, including the helicopter manufacturer Agusta, will pass without payment from the Efim state holding group, now in liquidation, to Finmeccanica. The Iri state group controls 85 per cent of Finmeccanica, its main industrial and high-technology arm, while the rest is floated on the stock market. The transfer has been made possible by a formula which guarantees survival of the seven without burdening Finmeccanica with their L7,000bn debts. In addition to the capital increase and other state credits, Efim's creditor banks will take shares in Finmeccanica and Iri's stake in the group will fall to nearer 60 per cent. The measures ensure that the state keeps control of strategic defence manufacturers and rationalises them under the umbrella of Finmeccanica, which has extensive defence interests centred on Alenia, its aerospace subsidiary. An important element of the re-organisation is a government defence plan that foresees arms spending of L55,000bn over 10 years, for which Finmeccanica lobbied hard. About half Italy's defence procurement budget goes to the seven ex-Efim companies which comprise Oto Melara, Breda Meccanica, Officina Galileo and SMA, together with three Agusta companies. The expanded Finmeccanica, which is in profit, will control about two-thirds of the country's defence interests and its turnover is intended to rise from about L10,790bn in 1993 to L13,500bn in 1995. The heavily-indebted Efim was placed in liquidation in 1992 and for more than a year its defence offshoots have been leased to Finmeccanica, giving it management control but not financial responsibility.</p>

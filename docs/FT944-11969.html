			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Profits at Christiania Bank jump to NKr1bn Christiania Bank, Norway's second-largest commercial bank, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in its nine-month results. The bank benefited from the continued upturn in Norway's economy, which has improved borrowers' ability to service loans. Christiania said nine-month pre-tax profits nearly doubled to NKr1.12bn (Dollars 171m) from NKr628m in the same period last year, providing further evidence that Norwegian banks are emerging from a four-year crisis. However, the group's operating profit, before loan losses, dropped NKr649m to NKr1.22bn. Net interest income was unchanged at NKr2.33bn but non-interest income fell by NKr638m to NKr1.13bn due to reduced securities and foreign exchange gains. Christiania said that a low level of interest rate exposure in the securities portfolio, helped limit bond losses in the third quarter to NKr10m. In the nine-month period, securities gains fell sharply to NKr94m from NKr591m while foreign exchange gains and other non-interest income dropped NKr101m to NKr145m. Nevertheless, the bank sharply reduced nine-month provisions for losses on loans and guarantees, to NKr100m from NKr1.24bn last year. Included in this year's figure is net reversals of NKr284m covering previous loss provisions. Christiania said credit losses to the international fisheries industry were the most troubled sector of its loan portfolio. In the third quarter the bank made provisions of NKr93m to cover fisheries loan losses, which for the nine-month period reached NKr384m. But combined gross non-performing and doubtful loans were reduced by 27 per cent to NKr11bn, while net non-performing loans were cut by 37 per cent to NKr3.6bn. While expressing satisfaction with the results, Mr Borger Lenth, group managing director, warned there was still room for improvement. The board may consider paying a dividend for 1994, but this is understood to be conditional on the bank's core capital reaching 6 per cent of risk-weighted assets at end-December, and on continued improvement in performance.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in  Spanish 0000 GMT 26 Apr 94 reports that Labor Party [PT]  presidential candidate Cecilia Soto explained her platform  during Radio ACIR's "Panorama Newscast." She stated the  Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], National Action Party  [PAN], and the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] "share  the obsolescence and fatigue of the Mexican political system."  Commenting on PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo's  invitation to his PRD and PAN rivals to hold a debate, she  regrets her exclusion and adds that it breaks slain PRI  candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio's promise that the debate would  include all candidates. When describing what her cabinet would  look like if she were elected, Soto says the country must have  "true" experts in their fields. She adds that her cabinet would  include members of other parties and several women. On the topic  of the Federal Judicial Police, Soto advocates abolishing this  corps as it has turned into "a Frankenstein monster that is  difficult to control."</p>

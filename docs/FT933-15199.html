			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report August Brent CRUDE OIL fell through the contract low at Dollars 16.65 a barrel on the IPE and in late trading was Dollars 16.52. The last time the near-month Brent futures contract traded below Dollars 16.65 was when it reached an intra-day low on February 26 1991 at Dollars 16.50. Traders said crude oil was pushed over the edge after locals began selling heavily when August WTI crude futures on Nymex crashed through long term support at Dollars 17.85 a barrel. The fall came while talks between Iraq and the UN on conditions that would allow Iraq to sell Dollars 1.6bn of oil over a six-month period were in session. One New York broker said the market now suspected Iraq would be allowed to sell oil at a time when Opec was producing above its ceiling. 'The market looks awful. We have new lows for two years ..If the headlines come out that Iraq is allowed to sell oil, it will dump a dollar. It's frightening. It looks so bearish.' GOLD and SILVER drifted lower in the afternoon on the London bullion market as disappointment over gold's failure to break through Dollars 400 a troy ounce in the morning encouraged mild profit-taking. Gold closed at Dollars 395.45, up Dollars 1.45 on the day. Compiled from Reuters</p>

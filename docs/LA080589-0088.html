			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HALL OF FAME GAME;  </P> <P> SHELL, THREE OTHER SUPER BOWL STARS WILL BE INDUCTED TODAY  </P> <P> Four men, 12 Super Bowl rings.  </P> <P> That alone illustrates the formidable talent being inducted into the Pro  Football Hall of Fame today.  </P> <P> "You've got representatives of the best teams of the 1960s and the 1970s," said  Terry Bradshaw, the former Pittsburgh quarterback who enters the hall with  teammate Mel Blount. Each owns an unprecedented four Super Bowl rings from the  Steelers.  </P> <P> "It speaks well for what athletes are taught. You're told to win and then  you're judged on how much you win," Bradshaw said. "It's not personal  accomplishments or statistics. America loves winners."  </P> <P> Also entering the hall are tackle Art Shell of the Oakland and Los Angeles  Raiders and safety Willie Wood of the Green Bay Packers, each of whom has two  championship rings.  </P> <P> As for the exhibition game that accompanies induction ceremonies, Washington's  Doug Williams won't play at all, and Buffalo's Jim Kelly will see only limited  duty.  </P> <P> Williams, 34, has been in traction for a back injury but will not need surgery.  </P> <P> In Williams' place, Washington Coach Joe Gibbs will use Mark Rypien and Stan  Humphries. Veteran Bill Kenney, signed as a free agent, also is expected to  play.  </P> <P> Expected to play their first game in Redskin uniforms are running backs Gerald  Riggs and Earnest Byner. Riggs, formerly with the Atlanta Falcons, and Byner, a  starter with the Cleveland Browns, were obtained in draft-day trades.  </P> <P> Buffalo Coach Marv Levy will give Kelly, Frank Reich, Stan Gelbaugh and Gale  Gilbert playing time at quarterback.  </P> <P> The Bills will be without Pro Bowl defensive end Bruce Smith, who is nursing a  thigh injury. Three other Bills remain out of camp in contract disputes.  </P> <P> The Bills are coming off a 12-4 season that took them to the AFC Championship  game, while the Redskins were 7-9.  </P></p>

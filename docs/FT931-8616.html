			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Mersey Docks 24% higher at Pounds 16.4m MERSEY DOCKS and Harbour reported a third successive record year for 1992, with pre-tax profits up 24 per cent from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 16.4m. Turnover showed a similar increase to Pounds 86.4m, against Pounds 69.5m. Tonnage through the port was up 12 per cent at 27.8m tonnes (24.74m tonnes), partly a result of the company taking over Coastal, an Irish Sea container line, in 1991. Improved margins reflected tight cost control, plus benefits from joint ventures or subsidiaries in shipping services, stevedoring, security, management consultancy and warehousing. Earnings per share were 18.01p (16.98p). A proposed final dividend of 5p brings the total to 7.5p (6p). Although 1992 was the first year in which the company faced a full tax charge, Mr Bill Slater, chairman, said earnings compared well with the last tax-free year of 1990, when the figure was 17.92p. There was no contribution from property development, although sales of land and shares in subsidiaries amounted to Pounds 1.59m. This was offset by severance costs and exceptional maintenance on the Port of Liverpool Building totalling Pounds 1.58m. The results, together with the return to a full tax charge, marked the end of 22 years of reconstruction following the government's rescue of the old Mersey Docks and Harbour Board which came close to defaulting on its bonds in 1970. The rescue forbade dividends while the company owed the government money, but the government wrote off Pounds 111.5m of repayable grants and loans - used for modernisation - in 1989. The company now employs 1,640 people - fewer than half of them dockers, compared with 7,000 dockers in the mid-1970s. Mr Slater said the government, the biggest shareholder, had told the company it had no immediate plans to sell its 20.67 per cent stake. Mr Trevor Furlong, managing director, said Mersey Docks was still looking to buy an east coast port that would provide synergy at the European end of a UK land bridge. Liverpool is now a principal hub for transatlantic, Irish, Mediterranean and West African cargoes. Development within Mersey Docks includes PowerGen's Pounds 40m coal terminal, which starts working this year, and a new timber products warehouse. A euro rail terminal for the Channel Tunnel is complete, as is a business park in Birkenhead.</p>

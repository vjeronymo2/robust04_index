			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> To date, there has been little evidence of demand for a materially later closing time for the Fedwire funds and securities transfer services to meet domestic needs. The most likely source of demand to make later payments is from the Pacific time zone. Banks with operations in that time zone, however, have expressed only slight interest in later Fedwire hours in response to requests for comment made by the Board of Governors in 1989 and in 1992. Moreover, many corporate treasurers generally view later-in-the-day payments activity as disruptive to their primary goal of determining the amount of money available for investment. This preference is, of course, conditioned by current conventions in the U.S. money markets, especially the times at which decisions must be made to invest or borrow funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank payment services. Currently, a number of large, internationally active U.S. banks offer their customers real-time account balance inquiry and payment services on a 24-hour basis. Many of these banks offer the capability to originate payment instructions in up to 60 currencies. Payment orders may be processed as book transfers or held in an electronic queue until the national payment system for the currency to be paid is open for business. Given current queuing practices, there would appear to be some scope for earlier settlement of queued payments if international clearing banks find it advantageous to process customer payments earlier in the day and national payment systems are open to process and settle such payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Fedwire Securities Transfer Service <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned earlier, most interbank transfers of U.S. government securities are processed through Fedwire. The DVP capability of the Fedwire securities transfer service increases the efficiency and integrity of the securities clearance and settlement process. In fact, the liquidity of the government securities market is partly a function of the Fedwire securities transfer system design, whereby the seller is assured of payment at the time the securities are delivered. While it virtually eliminates settlement risk, the current design of the Fedwire securities transfer service may, in some cases, result in significant demands for intraday credit. Once Fedwire opens in the morning, users of the Fedwire securities transfer service have no control over the time at which they may receive securities on a DVP basis. In particular, since the sellers of securities initiate the DVP transfers, receivers do not have any operational control over the time during the day when their securities and funds accounts are credited and debited, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the inception of the Board's Payment System Risk Reduction Program, the implications of the cost of intraday credit have taken on greater significance for participants in the Fedwire DVP securities transfer service. Receivers of securities, especially those maintaining relatively low intraday cash balances, are not in a position to manage their use of intraday Federal Reserve credit resulting from securities deliveries. Because of the inability to review transfers prior to receipt, this problem may be compounded if the securities delivery is not known, or the delivery amounts are incorrect. Although receivers of securities can reverse transfers received in error virtually immediately after delivery and payment occur, they must very actively monitor and manage their activity to be in a position to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The charging of fees for Federal Reserve intraday overdrafts has important implications for expanding the Fedwire securities transfer operating hours. An expansion of such operating hours could impose significant cost burdens on a potentially large number of banks that would need to make a choice between staffing their operations to manage their intraday overdraft positions, or remaining closed and incurring the costs of intraday overdrafts that might arise from securities deliveries during ``off-hours.'' In an effort to provide participants with the tools necessary to manage their operations and credit costs, the Federal Reserve is designing new Fedwire securities transfer service features, including receiver controls (such as receiver-authorized deliveries) and a mechanism allowing participants to choose whether to use the service during non-standard business hours. The Board believes that public comment on these new service features is required because of the impact they would have on senders and receivers of securities transfers and on the operation of the U.S. government securities market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis of a potential expansion of Fedwire securities transfer service operating hours must also take into account ``free'' transfers of securities, that is, the movement of collateral. The ability to move collateral during early morning Fedwire operating hours was identified as a potentially useful measure by several clearing organizations and banks in their comments on the Board's October 1992 Fedwire operating hours proposal. The ability to pledge collateral during early morning hours can reduce settlement uncertainties and enhance participant liquidity, particularly in times of financial stress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The discussion above suggests that careful attention must be given in the near term to features of the Fedwire securities transfer service that limit the control users of the service have over the receipt of securities, particularly if the hours of operation for the service were to be lengthened. The Board anticipates that the implementation of new service capabilities, such as those discussed earlier, could reduce or even eliminate the involuntary costs imposed on receivers of securities transfers, especially during expanded operating hours. Under these conditions, the public benefits of expanding these operating hours could be significant and would be derived in part from the opportunities to use securities as collateral, or as a near-cash equivalent, for purposes of meeting obligations that arise overnight. At present, however, an expansion of hours would not be advisable. The Board believes that the issues surrounding the development and use of new features for the Fedwire securities transfer service can be effectively addressed through the public comment process during 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the aforementioned complications associated with operating characteristics of the current Fedwire securities transfer system, the following analysis of implementation issues is limited to an expansion of Fedwire funds transfer service operating hours. The key implementation issues addressed in this section are technology, operational costs, monetary control and reserve management, overlapping business and calendar days, and the Federal Reserve's intraday overdraft policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

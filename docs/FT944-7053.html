			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Are bonds the answer? - Briefcase I am a married man, now retired, with two sons and I have been considering possible ways of reducing the burden of inheritance tax - perhaps through some form of trust arrangement - when my wife and I die. A couple of financial advisers have provided information concerning 'will trusts' and 'inheritance trusts' (also referred to as 'loan trusts'). Each recommends buying single-premium insurance bonds as a way of passing capital into a trust for the ultimate use of beneficiaries when the surviving spouse dies. What do you think? A bond can be helpful in the process of IHT planning but, clearly, it should be considered with all other forms of planning. Such bonds do generate commission for those who sell them. You need to determine the income required by the surviving spouse. If certain assets and the income arising from them could be left in trust to the children on the first death, possibly by way of a trust, then this would be an easy way to utilise the nil rate band and ensure that assets are passed on in a tax-efficient manner. But if all the assets are required to meet the ongoing needs of the surviving spouse, then this might not be a practical route for you. You could consider owning the house as tenants in common, rather than under a joint tenancy, and then leaving a half share in trust to the children, possibly with the wife as a trustee. This does not provide a cast-iron protection for the surviving spouse (also, the children might be able to force a sale through the courts) but it is worthy of consideration. Much depends upon the present and likely future relationships between the family and the income requirements. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward).

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Barclays to look worldwide for chief executive BARCLAYS is embarking on a worldwide search for a new chief executive from outside the bank, it was announced yesterday. Mr Andrew Buxton, who became chairman and chief executive in January, has asked a group of directors to find a chief executive after sustained pressure from institutional investors for the roles to be split. The appointment of an outsider is a significant change for the bank, which this month announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m and halved its final dividend. Although it has reformed its promotion policy, most of its chairmen - including Mr Buxton - have been members of families whose banks merged to form it 96 years ago. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries and a non-executive director of Barclays, said the group would ask a company of headhunters to find 'someone with a good track record, who is experienced, and is an established agent of change'. Sir Denys, who will lead the group of five non-executive directors, said Barclays would probably appoint a senior manager of a bank or a financial services company, but might consider an 'outstanding' candidate from elsewhere. He said the group would meet for the first time next week, and was already screening headhunters. 'There are some very competent people in Barclays, but just at this juncture someone from outside is needed to take a fresh look,' he said. 'I believe it is the right thing to do, as does the whole board. This is not a cosmetic exercise to get institutional investors off the bank's back.' Sir Denys said he hoped the search would be completed within months, although it would be a difficult task. 'I would like to do it as quickly as we can but it is not going to be that easy. There are not that many candidates,' he said. Although Mr Buxton announ-ced in January that he would split his responsibilities, some investors were concerned that the bank might only appoint a chief operating officer, and that Mr Buxton would prefer an internal promotion. The announcement that Barclays will look outside rules out internal contenders such as Mr Alastair Robinson, head of Barclays' banking division, and Mr David Band, the chief executive of the BZW investment banking subsidiary. Among the British candidates the bank might consider are Mr Brian Pearse, the bank's former finance director and now chief executive of Midland Bank, and Mr John Melbourn, head of credit risk at National Westminster Bank. Sir Peter Middleton, Barclays' deputy chairman, will be a member of the search group. Its other members will be Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ, Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman of Postel, and Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of Slough Estates. Institutional investors who have expressed discontent about the bank's management welcomed the move, but some shareholders made clear that they are concerned at the length of service of several of the bank's non-executive directors. One shareholder said he was concerned that non-executives had backed Mr Buxton's appointment to both roles last sum-mer. He was also worried that non-executives had failed to raise objections to Barclays' lending growth in the late 1980s. Barclays acts faster against stolen cards, Page 10 Observer, Page 21</p>

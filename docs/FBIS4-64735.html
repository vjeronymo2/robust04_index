			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ahmad Rafat] </F>   [Text] The signing of the Washington agreements between the  Bosnian president, Alia Itzebegovic, and his Croatian  counterpart, Franjo Tudjman, has not meant the end of the  problems the Spanish Blue Helmets must deal with. An authentic  diplomatic battle is now being waged against the Spanish  military in the zone, who are trying to mediate between Muslims  and Croats so that the agreements can be implemented. The Muslim  mayor of East Mostar, Smajo Klaric, has leveled harsh criticisms  of the Spanish troops, accusing them of a lack of neutrality  and, more seriously, of complicity in the sacking of the city's  historic treasures.    "I have no desire to respond to those accusations," says  Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Castro, spokesman for the Spanish  contingent in Medjugorje. "Our work in Mostar is our best  response." Colonel Luis Carvajal, commander of the Spanish  contingent, adds: "In the East, we have excellent relations with  the population. This is not hard to verify. Suffice it to walk  along the street to note how the people treat our soldiers. In  the Western part, however, we have very good relations with the  civil and military authorities."  <H5>  Threats </H5>   This may be an indirect way of acknowledging what various  neutral observers consider problems that the Blue Helmets are  having with the Muslim authorities. Attesting to these problems,  in March, two Spanish members of the humanitarian Doctors of the  World organization were threatened with firearms in their office  at the East Mostar hospital, which had been looted hours  earlier. Accusing both doctors of espionage and of trying to  render the Bosnian male infants impotent with their vaccination  program, the hospital's director was trying to force them out.  Incidents of this type, however, are customarily resolved  quickly by the Spanish military over a glass of a local brandy  known as loza.    "The real problem," says Col. Carvajal, "is those persons  who, with the war, have succeeded in gaining a certain level of  power and well being that they risk losing with peace. They, in  addition to the Serbs, who in one way or another must be brought  into this process, are the real obstacle to the Washington peace  agreements."    In the eyes of those interested in maintaining the present  situation -- and they are present on both sides, although in  greater number among the Croats -- the Spanish Blue Helmets, as  guarantors of the peace process, represent a real "threat."    This "threat" translates into the need for Col. Luis  Carvajal  and his assistants to carry out a diplomatic task in Medjugorje  that is key to the pacification. Their performance is being  attested to by the constant coming and going of delegations to  and from the city. Groups of Croats from West Mostar meet every  day with Muslims from East Mostar to discuss how to restore  electric power or clear a mined terrain. "Getting daily life  back to normal," says Col. Carvajal, "is of the utmost  importance in trying to guarantee the future of the peace talks.  If we can manage to get water running from the faucets and  electric bulbs lighting up again, the people will then pressure  the authorities to not back away from the process."    East Mostar has been without water, electricity, and gas for  the past 10 months. And in that time, 37,000 Muslim refugees,  victims of the ethnic cleansing being waged by the Croats on the  other shore of the Neretva River, have arrived on this side.  Some 57,000 persons now live in Mostar who are totally dependent  on the humanitarian aid arriving in the city owing to the  mediation efforts of the Spanish Blue Helmets in recent months.    To deal with the new situation created by the signing of the  peace agreements between Croats and Bosnians, the Blue Helmets  have had to reorganize. Mostar, Bosnia's second-largest city, is  situated in this region and has been entrusted to the Spanish  Blue Helmets.    Around mid-March, an Antimortar Radar Unit arrived in the  city and installed itself in the Muslim-inhabited eastern zone.  Until then, it had been impossible to determine the origin of  the mortars that from time to time were being launched against  the Muslim zone, in violation of the peace agreements.  <H5>  Aid </H5>   In cooperation with the Slovak battalion, the Spanish Blue  Helmets have also succeeded in reopening road M-17, which  connects Mostar with Sarajevo. By this route, which had been  closed for two years after Serb artillery destroyed the bridges,  it is now easier to get humanitarian aid to Sarajevo and other  cities in central Bosnia.    The change in the situation has noticeably improved the  morale of the Spanish soldiers. "At last," says one of them, "we  feel that we are being useful to these people." The Spanish  command did their utmost to bring about an exchange of the first  group of war prisoners between Croats and Muslims, to take place  on the very day following the signing of the Washington  agreements. As the Spanish wheeled armored vehicle leading the  convoy of International Red Cross trucks carrying the first 200  Muslim prisoners entered the city, it was met by a vast crowd of  people who, after having awaited that moment for eight hours,  broke out into feverish applause. "That was an unforgettable  moment," says a corporal, native of Madrid, holding back his  tears.    Agustin, a Blue Helmet member of the Madrid Unit, which has  been patrolling East Mostar for the past three months, asserts:  "I have never before seen so many people on the streets of  Mostar. Something is changing and I am glad for these people.  After so much suffering, they deserve a little hope."    Hope is the watchword of the Spanish contingent in Bosnia.  "The cease-fire," Col. Carvajal asserts with satisfaction, "is  being complied with in excess of our expectations, and the  situation must be made the most of to avoid a regression. We are  doing our utmost to encourage forward steps, because that is the  only way to avoid a return to the previous situation."</p>

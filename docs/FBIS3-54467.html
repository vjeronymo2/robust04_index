Alongside 'Ali Khamene'i, Rafsanjani is the only official of the  Islamic Republic who is mentioned by the Voice and Vision with  the titles of "His Honor" and "His Reverence" and using  third-person plural verbs instead of third-person singular.    With the publication of the harsh report of the Majles  against the Voice and Vision, there is no longer the slightest  doubt that Khamene'i wants to remove this important stronghold  from Rafsanjani and also impose the rights that the laws have  provided for the leader.    But, informed observers say, after placing $5 billion of his  budget at the disposal of the Majles and after giving in to the  pressures of the Majles and giving up the idea of having Mohsen  Nurbakhsh as his minister of economic affairs and finance, if  Rafsanjani loses this stronghold as well, he will no longer have  any job to the end of the second (and last) term of his  presidency except to go on a trip once in a while or entertain a  foreign guest.    Informed sources say Rafsanjani wants to keep this  stronghold  at any price and for this reason has told his brother, Mohammad  Hashemi, the general manager of the Voice and Vision, not to  listen to anyone, even the leader of the Islamic Republic. And  Mohammad Hashemi, by refusing the order of the leader, showed  that he respects his older brother more than the successor to  the "Imam."    The situation was that the leader of the Islamic Republic  instructed the head of the Voice and Vision not to publish its  response to the report of the Investigation Committee, but the  Voice and Vision not only published its response but, as the  saying goes, added other insults to what they had heard from the  Majles and hurled them back.    Informed sources, which carefully monitor the events of the  Islamic Republic, believe that the power struggle between the  leader and the president has reached a point of no return for  both sides.</p>

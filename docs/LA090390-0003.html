			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDUCING CLASS SIZES IN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> I am deeply concerned and critical of Gov. Deukmejian's unwise decision to cut  funding for the California Assessment Program (CAP). In the light of increasing  criticism of our national education policies, we can ill afford the loss of yet  another educational program.  </P> <P> As a senior at Artesia High School, my fellow seniors and I were looking  forward to increasing the scores for our school. We saw the CAP test and our  school scores as a rallying point for campus pride.  </P> <P> The logic in the governor's decision escapes me. I can only hope that the new  governor will show more concern for the state's troubled schools by restoring  funds for CAP, among other things. I can also say that Gov. Deukmejian's  dubious abilities, demonstrated by the CAP and his handling of Proposition 98,  have made me Democrat on state issues, while I am still Republican on national  ones.  </P> <P> EDWARD KYUNG HO KIM  </P> <P> Hawaiian Gardens  </P></p>

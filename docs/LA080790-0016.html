			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ACES RALLY BIDDERS AT WOMEN'S SPORTS BENEFIT  </P> <P> The Scene  </P> <P> About 320 local tennis fans gathered at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach  on Friday for cocktails and auction bidding to support the UC Irvine Athletic  Foundation and the Women's Sports Foundation. The $75-per-ticket, two-hour  party raised $30,000 and concluded with a shuttle ride to the John Wayne Tennis  Club, where the Dukes, a professional team from Orange County, played the L.A.  Strings.  </P> <P> Focal Points  </P> <P> The Dukes and Strings are two of nine teams in a national league called  Teamtennis, which was founded 10 years ago by guest of honor Billie Jean King.  Looking businesslike in a turquoise blazer and black slacks, King arrived to  the flash of photographers' strobes, the craning of rubbernecks and the  outstretched pens of autograph seekers. She obliged, looking a little pained by  all the fuss. A few minutes later, a smiling, joking, stunningly svelte Martina  Navratilova showed up, doubling the banquet hall buzz. The two tennis legends  settled at a table near the door, where they ate and chatted with friends  between interruptions. Among those seated with the queens of the court were  former top-ranked player Rosie Casals and Deborah Anderson, executive director  of the Women's Sports Foundation.  </P> <P> Speeches  </P> <P> After guests had a chance to browse silent-auction tables and serve themselves  pastas and other goodies from the buffet, Anderson stepped to the podium. The  New York-based, nonprofit foundation she heads -- another of King's creations  -- was founded 17 years ago as "a collective voice for women in sports," she  said. Now 330,000 members strong, that voice is heard through educational  programs, grants to athletes and coaches, and government lobbying. Anderson  described a recent survey of high school students that ranked athletes equal or  better than nonathletes in achievement tests and grades and indicated that  athletes were more involved with community organizations and less likely to  take drugs. "So the 'dumb jock' myth is just that -- a myth," she said. Next up  was King, who garnered a standing ovation. "Very good," she said, when the  applause died down. "That was the seventh-inning stretch." Saying she hadn't  known that she would be called on to speak, King kept it short and sweet -- a  few words about growing up in Long Beach, and a few more about the ongoing  fight for equal opportunities for women. She asked parents to "encourage your  girls to be active, not passive. We get a lot of messages to be so-o-o  dependent and so-o-o stupid," she said, singsonging for a big laugh. "Then we  get out in life and we're in trouble!"  </P> <P> Working The Room  </P> <P> Before regrouping court side, guests had a shot at a few items up for grabs in  a live auction. Navratilova opened bidding on Rams quarterback Jim Everett's  jersey (taken home by Leslie Cancellieri of Huntington Beach, who paid $550 for  the tent-size orange shirt), then sat back and listened while bids piled up for  one of her own racquets. Actually, she only sat back until the bidding stalled  at $700, when she took the microphone from the auctioneer. "This racquet has a  built-in forehand," Navratilova joked. King took over. "This is historic! She  used this racquet at Wimbledon! (Last month, Navratilova became the only person  ever to win nine singles titles at Wimbledon.) C'mon people! Let's go!" (They  went. The racquet -- plus a rubber chicken, a Spuds McKenzie doll and 10  lottery tickets -- sold for $1,500.)  </P> <P> Faces  </P> <P> Also attending were Fred Lieberman, owner of the Dukes; Greg Patton, the Dukes'  coach and men's coach at UC Irvine; Tom Ford, UCI's athletic director; Lynn  Cox, the globe-trotting swimmer from Los Alamitos, and Dukes players Sophie  Amiach, Marty Davis, Amy Frazier and Roger Smith.  </P> <P> SOCIAL CALENDAR, E4 PAMELA MARIN  </P></p>

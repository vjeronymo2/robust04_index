			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhanna Kasyanenko, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA </F> correspondent under the ``Foci of Epidemics Arise on the Don's  Soil'' rubric: ``Winged Cholera'']    [Text] Rostov-na-Donu --  The pediatric infectious disease department of Rostov's central  hospital is today so full that patients are being turned away.  Typhoid fever, dysentery, salmonellosis,  diphtheria...Tear-stained mothers, sad and somehow unchildlike  eyes of little children on transparent emaciated little faces.  ``Survive, survive,'' I want to whisper to each one, ``let the  fate of that little boy pass you by.''    A month ago, a family infected with diptheria was brought  here from the Veselovskiy rayon. The 10-year-old little boy  could not be saved. And this is not the oblast's only case of a  lethal outcome of diptheria, a disease that was considered  conquered forever many years ago. And that's really how it was  in our country. And suddenly -- a sharp jump in morbidity this  year. According to physician's forecasts, they will not be able  to stop it any time soon. It is not a matter of 1 year. And only  God knows how many more children's and even adults' lives this  contagious disease will take.    It seems that nothing foretold the problem in Volgodonsk  either. But just as suddenly, 130 persons -- big and small --  ended up on hospital cots with a diagnosis of typhoid fever.    Suddenly a landslide of morbidity due to dysentery,  salmonellosis, and tularemia began. In the mining city of  Gukovo, for example, salmonellosis raged twice this summer. Once  the source was the worker's dining room. The other time the  kindergarten was the source. About 100 persons became ill with  dysentery at the same time in Aksay. Cholera flew into the  oblast from India on the wings of a charter commercial run along  with Indian beads and leather handbags...    And all this happened suddenly? Of course not. Physicians  specializing in communicable diseases say with certainty that  diptheria was provoked and predetermined 3-4 years ago. The  current situation givens them the right to make the fully  substantiated announcement that it is a result not of chance but  rather the campaign developed in the mass media against  vaccinations -- the sole means of guaranteeing immunity against  diptheria. It may have been public opinion and intentional or  not, but it was completely purposely designed to be negative  toward vaccinations. People overloaded with scientific degrees  but not physicians spoke in the press and on radio and stated  that vaccinations, especially antidiptheria vaccinations, are  toxicogenic.    ``So why did you keep silent? Why did you not conduct  counter-propaganda?'' I asked Oleg Dumbadze, physician  specializing in communicable diseases from the oblast public  health department.    ``And why do we always remain silent about everything?'' he  responded to my question with a question. ``Because we thought:  They won't find any simpletons who will believe the madness that  is being carried over the radio.''    Of course, the problem lies not only in the vaccinations,  even though they are without a doubt very important. And to now  make them the entire cause is too simple. The plant  manufacturing the vaccines remained in Russia, but also  diptheria roams the territories adjacent to it -- Ukraine and  Byelarus. From there, infected people travel to us. But it is  very difficult to receive the vaccine because of the break in  economic ties. Another plant remained in Tbilisi.    The whole problem is in the total shambles of the socialist  health care system -- a system that other civilized countries,  as they are now called, have never known. L.S. Sadovskaya, head  of the No. 2 infectious disease department of the Rostov City  Hospital, told me painfully that even last summer health care  organizers from Scotland were in the city. They came to us with  experience. Indeed, not one country has yet created a system of  monitoring health that is as interconnected, efficient, and  maximally inclusive of the population as that recently created  in our city. And the Western specialists hurried to wreck it so  as to have time to see that it has already ceased to exist.    The break of the sanitary-epidemiological oversight from the  overall health care system did not play the definitive role in  the wave of infections. Today, public health physicians are  essentially removed from responsibility for the operation of  those enterprises on which people's health depends. Poisoning in  the workers' dining room? The mine's director is responsible for  it. Typhoid fever in Volgodonsk? A statement from the Vodokanal  that infection penetrating the water supply system through  rusted pipes is responsible.    Of course, the officials in charge of the government's  economic functions are responsible for this. But in our day,  they find hundreds of reasons to explain similar disruptions.    In fact, the oblast administration does not bear  responsibility for the situation either. For example, public  health physicians informed V.F. Chuba, head of the  administration, about the increase in morbidity due to  infectious skin diseases and spread of pediculosis. According to  current laws, V.F. Chub has the right to send recommendations to  places with a request to fix and improve things, which he has  done.    But nothing more.    It is crystal-clear that these noble desires will not be  fulfilled; they will vanish in the economic reforms as into a  concrete graveyard wall. That's what has already happened with  the recommendations to the heads of the rayon and municipal  administrations that the extermination of rodents and  blood-sucking insects be set up. The former ispolkomy [executive  committees] did not make the recommendations but instead  mandated that enterprises allocate money for the work each year  at all costs. Now that each has obtained economic independence,  no resources are found for these ``trifles.'' As a result,  tularemia spread by these very rodents and insects has put  dozens of people on hospital cots.    I have read many inquiries, letters, and recommendations  these days and have spoken with many specialists both at the  department of public health and at the oblast center of the  sanitary-epidemiological oversight. Everyone is doing something.  They are all busy. And at the same time they are on guard and  ready at a moment's notice to divert the reproach from  themselves, citing the work they have done or an article in the  law or else explaining the situation in terms of the general  economic collapse. And it turns out that there are no guilty  parties.    But then for whose blame are the children on the hospital  cots atoning with their suffering?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F> Beilin, place not given, by Rafi Rosenfeld from the "It Is All  Talk" program -- live]    [Excerpts] [Rosenfeld] Good morning, Deputy Foreign  Minister Yosi Beilin.    [Beilin] Good morning.    [Rosenfeld] 'Arafat says in a recording that there is a  secret document containing an Israeli pledge to discuss the  status of Jerusalem within three years of the interim  arrangement. And yet, despite the commotion which followed the  report, his remarks do not disclose anything.    [Beilin] It is a joke. There is a non-secret document,  which says something in this spirit.    [Rosenfeld] The Declaration of Principles, I believe.    [Beilin] Yes. I heard the tape, and it is quite silly. It  may be okay for a mosque speech, but I would not advise you to  take it seriously in terms of the truth, particularly since the  letter story is a joke. The Oslo agreement states that within  two years at most -- not three, he confused his dates there --  we should start negotiations, with Jerusalem as one of the  issues on the agenda.    [Rosenfeld] Let us now address another aspect of the tape --  the call for jihad. The prime minister said: If 'Arafat has  indeed called for jihad, the future of the peace process is in  doubt. What does he mean, if 'Arafat indeed called for jihad?  You heard the tape, as we all have, and he did call for jihad.    [Beilin] Yes, he said: We have to continue the jihad, it is  a matter for you more than us, and to prove my point, I even  asked for a letter to support it. What can I tell you? Those  who always attached great significance to 'Arafat's  pronouncements, will take a very grave view of this. It is not  that I am taking it lightly, but I have never attached great  significance to his utterances. I think his remarks about jihad  will discredit him in public opinion throughout the world.  These remarks will not be able to stop the negotiations, but  they are definitely not something we can shrug off, and they  will cost 'Arafat more than anyone else.    [Rosenfeld] The question is whether we will not pay with  victims.    [Beilin] No, I do not think an actual call for jihad against  Israel was made in South Africa. I think his entire speech  there was ridiculous, and this part of the speech looks  ridiculous to me, too. I do not perceive any change in  'Arafat's policy. I will see it as a violation of the agreement  if, God forbid, actual orders to attack Israel or to disregard  some clauses of the agreement are given, or if elements  connected with 'Arafat carry out terrorist operations. That  would definitely be a grave violation of the agreement, and if  it happens, the agreement will have no future. [passage omitted]    [Rosenfeld] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, Minister  Shulamit Aloni told our correspondent this morning that perhaps  we should look for new partners.    [Beilin] I am all for it. If she manages to find new  partners, I am certain she will inform me, too, and then we will  launch negotiations with the new partners.    [Rosenfeld] In other words, you are saying that past  experience shows there are no other partners.    [Beilin] There are none, but if someone can find a partner  better than 'Arafat, I will not fight for 'Arafat's right to  continue negotiating with us at any cost. I think we would all  be happy if we could conduct negotiations with someone who could  both represent the Palestinian people and present stands that  are more compatible with ours. I regret to say I do not know of  any such person. We waited for 26 years, and thank God, we are  now leaving Gaza, we are beginning the peace process, and we are  to have an entirely different Middle East in spite of the  foolish things 'Arafat occasionally says. It is no use: Those  who would like to use his utterances to stop the negotiations,  are bound to fail. [passage omitted]</p>

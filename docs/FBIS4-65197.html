			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dorothea Siems: "Shelling Out--The Federal </F> Government Uses Development Aid More To Boost Exports"]    [Text] The economics minister is still balking. "Tying  development aid to large export orders," says Guenter Rexrodt,  "is out of the question." Only a short time ago, he had  "emphatically turned down" such petitions. But once again the  liberal is fighting a losing battle: Industry has long since won  out in Bonn.    Still this year, Bonn is introducing a new financing tool  which gives priority to subsidized credits for large-scale  infrastructure projects. The procedure of the so-called second  window of development policy: The federally owned Reconstruction  Loan Corporation (KfW) borrows money from the capital market  and, together with development aid, hands it out as loans. Bonn  guarantees 90 percent of the outside capital. With such mixed  financing, conditions lie between those of usual development aid  credits (a life of up to 40 years, with 0.75 percent interest)  and commercial loans.    The new "mobility of the Federal Government" (BDI) [Federal  Association of German Industry] is to give German industry  better chances in the hotly contested markets in China,  Southeast Asia, India, and Latin America. Especially  advantageous: The new tool is also to benefit threshold  countries no longer needing development aid, but which  stubbornly insist on favorable financing in placing large orders.    Recently, enterprises had criticized repeatedly the  governments of other countries, above all Japan and the United  States, for providing much more support for their enterprises.  Because of the "merciless competition," Babcock manager Hans  Westphal demands that development aid be handled differently:  What is needed are "more credits for a specific purpose" and  "competitive financing packages."    With the new credit too, Bonn now follows the  recommendations  of enterprises--and at the same time violates an agreement among  OECD member states. In 1991, after a tough struggle, they had  agreed on a guideline for financing large projects in developing  countries. The principal point: Commercial credits must not be  mixed with Third World aid, and tying development money to  export orders is inadmissible. At the time, the club of  industrial countries thought they had averted a terrible  "subsidy fight." Since then, the OECD has been setting  "consensual interest rates" that are reexamined every six  months. For China, for instance, the interest rate at present is  6.75 percent.    In fact, however, it has been the Chinese who have recently  tried to force better conditions. A further source of conflict  are the differences in the national finance sectors which so far  are not even covered in the OECD consensus. Japanese exporters,  for example, can borrow money from their banks very favorably  and long-term, and in France the state guarantees a large part  of the financial risk.    Up to now, the Federal Government pursued the goal of also  harmonizing these areas at the OECD level and preventing  competitive subsidy races. Now, however, Germany is racing in  precisely the opposite direction.    A model case already exists: Development Aid Minister  Spranger contributes 352 million German marks [DM] so that a  Siemens/AEG consortium may build a subway in the southern  Chinese province of Canton. In this manner the Germans garnered  orders worth about DM700 million. "Pushed through at that time  as an exceptional case," thunders former development minister  and SPD [Social Democratic Party] politician Erhard Eppler,  "this method is now to become a system."    In view of "unemployment and recession in Germany," as  Spranger defends the new economic policy component of his  development policy, "export opportunities should not be missed."  In this kind of development aid, the lion's share returns as an  order for German enterprises.    No wonder that managers doing business with India also push  "with great tenacity" (Rexrodt) for corresponding financial  infusions from Bonn. A consortium consisting of Siemens,  Deutsche Babcock, Takraf, and MAN Gutehoffnungshuette is at  present negotiating with the Indian Government on a brown coal  power plant with its own mine in South Indian Tamil Nadu. "Only  the financing is not yet cleared up," according to Babcock  manager Rainer Schumacher. It involves over DM2 billion, says  the manager, "so Bonn should shell out something."</p>

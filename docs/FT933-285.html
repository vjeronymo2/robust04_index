			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (21): Private capital eases the travellers' ride - Sally Bowen examines infrastructural improvements SOME OF PERU'S roads, such as the central highway into the heart of the Andes, are unparalleled feats of engineering. Others, the jungle highway built by former President Belaunde, for example, represent the triumph of optimism over reason. Almost without exception, they are excruciatingly uncomfortable to travel along. But within the last few months, the Peruvian traveller is starting to see the occasional stretch of perfectly smooth, uniformly grey asphalt - a welcome, if brief, respite from the bone-shaking norm. Peru's highways are finally under repair. Of some 70,000km of roads throughout the country, just 10 per cent are at present asphalted. In total, according to transport ministry estimates, only 1,000km of roads throughout the country are in reasonable condition. The InterAmerican Development Bank (IADB) is lending Peru Dollars 210m over four years to help repair trunk roads. The Peruvian government is adding another Dollars 90m. By December, 440km of the main coastal road, the Panamerican highway, will be newly surfaced - and by the end of next year, 1,200km will have been completely rehabilitated. In Peru's rugged interior, in provinces which are still in a state of emergency because of lingering subversion, road-building is entrusted to army engineering battalions. The Treasury has been able to budget Dollars 80m this year and Dollars 150m next for repairs to these badly-neglected highways and for reconstruction of bridges dynamited by Sendero Luminoso guerrillas during the past few years. 'Road-building is central to the government's strategy of integration, development and pacification,' says Mr Dante Cordova, minister of transport and communications. 'The army's doing something productive and at the same time generating security. It also provides jobs for local people.' Another loan of Dollars 220m is under negotiation with the World Bank to rebuild and asphalt roads such as the Huanuco-Tingo Maria-Pucallpa link, which runs through coca-growing territory. The initiative will help cut exorbitant transport costs and thus, it is hoped, encourage coca-farmers to switch to other crops. It is not only in roads that improvements are now being seen. Deregulation of ports and airports is bringing welcome benefits to travellers and exporters. Peru's ports used to be among the most expensive in the world. But in its earliest months in government, the Fujimori administration managed to break a fifty-five year union monopoly on stevedoring, cutting costs by around three-quarters. More recently, port charges levied by Enapu, the state ports authority, have undergone cuts of up to 40 per cent. 'Callao, Lima's port, is now one of the most competitively priced in the world, cheaper than Guayaquil and about the same as Valparaiso,' says Mr Cordova. 'Ilo and Matarani in the south can now compete on costs with Chile, while Paita in the north is cheaper than its Ecuadorean rivals.' Although the process is taking longer than anticipated, privatisation of port and airport services is under way. Ramps, car-parking, duty-free shops and restaurant facilities at Lima's Jorge Chavez international airport will soon all be privately managed under a concession system. Corpac, the airports authority which has traditionally run these services will be reduced to a 'technical body, concentrating on air traffic control,' says Mr Cordova. Meanwhile, small domestic airlines have proliferated and fares have plummeted. A special privatisation committee (Cepri) has been appointed to oversee transfer of Enapu's seven Pacific seaports to the private sector. The southern port of Ilo is being treated as a special case, with its own Cepri. Great hopes hang on Ilo. In February last year, Peru signed a historic agreement with Bolivia, giving its landlocked neighbour access to the sea via a 'corridor'. Bolivian and Peruvian entrepreneurs will share an industrial free zone in Ilo, while the Bolivians also now have rights to a strip of Peruvian coast known as Boliviamar, which is slated to become a popular seaside resort. The Peruvian gesture is aimed at capturing the lion's share of Bolivia's import and export trade, which currently brings in some 500,000 tonnes of merchandise a year via the northern Chilean port of Arica. The plan depends on the upgrading of the La Paz-Ilo road link. A team of engineers from South Korea's Daewoo Corporation is already completing an initial study for the road, which Peru's transport ministry expects to cost around Dollars 120m. Even a cursory glance at the map reveals the strategic potential of a port such as Ilo. The Fujimori administration would like to see it - or neighbouring Matarani - become the gateway between Asia and Latin America. More ambitious, and still very much at the drawing-board stage, is a plan for a transcontinental highway linking Ilo with the Brazilian Atlantic port of Santos. The economic arguments for such a road are powerful. Brazil's soya, concentrated in south-western Acre province near the Peruvian border, must currently be transported some 4,000km for shipping from the Atlantic ports ' it is only 1,300km to Ilo. The cost of exporting Brazilian soya to Asia via Peru would, says Mr Arturo Ramirez of the Cepri-Ilo, result in savings of Dollars 23 per ton, or Dollars 500,000 on an average boatload. With only minor improvements, Ilo could handle huge increases in trade - currently under 12 per cent of port capacity is being used. The sell-off of the state-owned Ilo copper refinery late this year, and forthcoming development of the recently-privatised Quellaveco mine to the east of Ilo could also boost total shipments. The Dutch company Haskoning is presently completing a study on Ilo's privatisation. Once evaluation is complete, a promoter will be contracted and the port concession put up for international tender in March 1994. This will be the pattern for future privatisations of infrastructure. New Peruvian investment laws throw concessions for any of the country's roads, ports and airports open to private bidders. This could be the way ahead for the transcontinental highway. If international organisations will not put up the estimated Dollars 1.4bn required, 'maybe private Brazilian consortia will bid for a 60-year concession and operate it as a toll-road,' says Mr Cordova. 'We're working on stretches of it already, but Brazil will be the biggest beneficiary.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 14 (AFP) -- Two young avant-garde  artists arrested here at the weekend are still being held by  police, their friends said Tuesday. Ma Liumin, 25, and Zhu Min,  22, were arrested when about a dozen uniformed and plainclothes  police descended on an informal art show organized by the two at  their home in the city's eastern Chaoyang district just as it  wound up Sunday afternoon, witnesses said.    Police Tuesday again raided the artists' home, where a  number  of painters live, and took away paintings and materials, the  friends said.    Police refused to comment, although Monday they confirmed  the  raid, but gave no details.    "Ma was nude during the gathering but his show was purely  artistic and had no political message," one of the artist's  friends said.</p>

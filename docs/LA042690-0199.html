			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING;  </P> <P> INJURED GWYNN DETERMINED TO RACE AGAIN  </P> <P> Drag racer Darrell Gwynn, speaking publicly for the first time since his  near-fatal accident Easter Sunday in England, said he hopes to return to racing  despite having part of his left arm amputated.  </P> <P> "I think all my parts are going to be moving in another month, so hopefully,  I'll be back in tip-top shape," Gwynn told Dave McClelland of the National Hot  Rod Assn. in a conversation taped for distribution. "Generally speaking, I feel  pretty good. If I leave here and I'm walking, I'll be real happy.  </P> <P> "Everything's here, except my left hand. I think I can drive without that."  </P> <P> Doctors at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, in Aylsbury, England, where Gwynn was  taken after his top fuel dragster crashed during a practice run, have not  determined if Gwynn will be paralyzed. He has no feeling below the waist, but  doctors said that the swelling around his spinal cord, which was bruised and  crushed, must be reduced before they can make a diagnosis.  </P> <P> "I've been conscious since the time I got off the plane here in England," he  said. "I've been awake the entire time and lived a whole lot, been through a  lot of things that I didn't think would ever come my way."  </P> <P> Gwynn, 28, a three-time winner of the Winston World Finals at Pomona and one of  the sport's leading drivers, was testing his dragster before an exhibition race  against Al Segrini, a fellow American, on the Santa Pod track in Bradsbury when  it suddenly veered into the guard rail and rolled over on its side, pinning  Gwynn beneath it as it slid down the strip.  </P> <P> "I recollect everything that's happened and for some reason the car just wanted  to go and I had no control over it. I asked my dad, 'Hey, is it something I  did?' and (he said) it looks like mechanical failure at this time."  </P> <P> Jerry Gwynn has been his son's crew chief and team manager since Darrell began  racing in 1980 in their hometown of Miami.  </P> <P> The premier motorcycle road racers in the United States will be at Willow  Springs Raceway this weekend for the Western Eastern Roadracers Assn. Formula  USA championship race and the Kerker/Scandinavian Brake Systems national  endurance race.  </P> <P> Dave Sadowski, winner of the Daytona 200 last March on a Yamaha 750, heads the  entry list for the WERA Formula USA race on Sunday, which will be 20 laps  around Willow Springs' 2.5-mile road course. Formula USA bikes are unlimited in  engine displacement and modifications, usually four-cylinder variations of  Japanese sportbikes such as the Yamaha FZR, Honda Hurricane, Kawasaki Ninja or  Suzuki GSXR.  </P> <P> Sadowski, 26, from Buford, Ga., will ride a Yamaha for the Vance &amp; Hines  team of Santa Fe Springs. In addition to winning the Daytona 500, the most  prestigious race on the American Motorcyclist Assn. schedule, he won the 1986  WERA national endurance championship.  </P> <P> Formula USA was started in 1986 at Willow Springs by track promoter Bill Huth  and taken national last year by WERA. The bikes are capable of speeds up to 170  m.p.h.  </P> <P> Also on Sunday will be three 12-lap races for Superstock bikes.  </P> <P> Saturday, 60 teams will compete in the six-hour national championship endurance  race, which will start at 11:30 a.m. It will be Round 3 of the 15-race series.  </P> <P> Each rider will race between 60 to 90 minutes before stopping for fuel, tires  and a rider change -- which will all be accomplished in less than a minute.  </P> <P> Team Suzuki's Mike Smith of Atlanta and Kurt Hall of Bluffton, S.C., who won a  six-hour race last month at Talladega, Ala., will be favored in the enduro on  their Suzuki 1100. Their Talladega victory was the team's 50th since it was  organized as Team Hammer in 1981 with Bruce Hammer and John Ulrich, two  Southern Californians, as the riders.  </P> <P> Among the other entries will be Team Marlboro Roberts, managed by former world  champion Kenny Roberts, who also manages world champion Eddie Lawson and Wayne  Rainey on the world championship Grand Prix circuit. Roberts' team will include  Rich Oliver of Pittsburg, Calif., winner of the 250cc race at Daytona this  year.  </P> <P> Willow Springs Raceway is located off Route 14 in Rosamond, just north of  Lancaster, about 90 miles from downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> MIDGETS -- Sleepy Tripp, defending champion in the United States Auto Club's  ESPN Thunder Series, will attempt to make up more ground on points leader Robby  Flock when the series resumes Saturday night at Ascot Park. Tripp, who won his  201st career race last week, trails Flock, the USAC Western Regional champion,  by 16 points with two races remaining. Three-quarter midgets will share the  billing with the full midgets.  </P> <P> DRAG RACING -- The National Hot Rod Assn. will open its Division 7 season this  weekend at Bakersfield Raceway for eight sportsman categories. It is the first  of six events leading to the Winston divisional point championships.

The car was built by his boat crew, headed by his father, Ray, also  a former world drag boat champion. Capaldi decided to switch from water to  asphalt after a crash in his "Shot in the Dark" blown alcohol hydro last April  at Puddingstone Lake that sidelined him for five weeks.  </P> <P> STOCK CARS -- Ron Meyer has won the Winston Racing Series championship three of  the past four years at Ascot Park, but this year he is concentrating on  pavement racing so his older brother, Bill Jr., has taken over the family  position in the pro stock class.

Street stocks race Friday night at Ventura Raceway.  </P> <P> RALLY -- Rod Millen, a transplanted New Zealander living in Irvine who won the  National Pro Rally driver championship last year, will drive a Mazda in the  annual Rim of the World Rally on Saturday. The event, part of the North  American Rally championship series, will start at 1 p.m. in Lancaster and run  for 14 hours in a series of stages in the Angeles National Forest northeast of  Antelope Valley.  </P> <P> Millen is not contesting the national series this year but is making an  appearance this weekend to prepare for defense of his Asian-Pacific rally  championship.  </P> <P> MOTOCROSS -- The Continental Motosports Club's Spring Classic series will be at  Carlsbad Raceway on Sunday.

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Fixed-rate mortgages gain in popularity THE PROPORTION of borrowers taking on fixed-rate mortgages in the first quarter of the year increased sharply as a result of difficulties faced last year by homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, it was disclosed yesterday. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said 46 per cent of first mortgages and 48 per cent of re-mortgages taken out in the first quarter were fixed, compared with 27 per cent and 35 per cent respectively in the first quarter of 1992. The council, which represents both building societies and centralised lenders such as banks, said that the shift would give the government more scope to use monetary policy to influence the economy without disrupting the housing market. However, it warned that building societies could be exposing themselves to greater risks through fixed-rate lending, and would be less able to maintain profitability by widening the spread between the rates offered to savers and borrowers. Mr Adrian Coles, the council's director-general, said in an article in its quarterly economic journal that the share of first mortgages fixed for more than a year rose to 37 per cent in the first quarter, against 20 per cent in the corresponding period the year before. He said an increase in the proportion and length of fixed-rate mortgages would allow the government more scope to raise interest rates to influence exchange rates without the side effect of restraining consumer spending. One reason for Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism nearly a year ago was that the political price of raising interest rates was thought to be too high because of the effect on most borrowers' mortgage repayments. Yet Mr Coles said that building societies could face higher risks from increased fixed-rate borrowing, even if they have fixed the rate at which they borrow the money to fund the mortgages by using interest-rate swaps. One risk is that they will lose some ability to widen the gap between interest rates paid to savers and charged to borrowers to compensate for other problems. Most societies took such an opportunity at the end of last year. Another risk is the 'pre-payment risk' that has affected mortgage lenders in the US as borrowers have repaid fixed-rate loans as rates fall. This could limit societies' ability to cover the cost of fixed-rate mortgage funds. Housing Finance No 19. CML, 3 Savile Row, London W1X 1AF. Pounds 20.</p>

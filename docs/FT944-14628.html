			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vickers hint Vickers advanced 7 1/2 to 170 1/2 p in turnover of 4.8m following buy recommendations from SG Warburg and Credit Lyonnais Laing and - towards the close of the session - persistent talk of a possible takeover move from Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company. The engineering sector's other takeover situation, the potential bidding auction for submarines group VSEL between British Aerospace and GEC, continued to keep the market guessing. VSEL put on 20 at 1320p while BAe firmed 2 to 480p. GEC, again affected by heavy volume, shed 2 to 282p in turnover of 14m.</p>

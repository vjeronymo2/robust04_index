			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SENATE APT TO BE BALKY ON CAPITAL GAINS;  </P> <P> BRADY HITS TAX CUT FOES FOR MAKING IT RICH VS. POOR ISSUE  </P> <P> Democrats said today that President Bush's cut in capital-gains taxes is no  sure bet in the Senate, while his Treasury secretary criticized opponents for  discussing the issue in terms of rich against poor.  </P> <P> "I think there is a reasonably good chance we'll be able to prevail here" and  defeat the reduction, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) told  reporters.  </P> <P> Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), a member of the Finance Committee, said he thinks  the deficit-reduction plan to be written by the panel next week will not  include the capital-gains cut, which the House approved on Thursday.  </P> <P> Instead of the capital-gains cut, Bradley said the Finance Committee is likely  to approve a measure making tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts  available to more workers as an incentive for saving.  </P> <P> At a Finance Committee hearing on IRAs, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady  defended the capital-gains reduction as an important tool for economic growth.  He said there is no certainty that IRAs increase savings, and called the  proposal too expensive when the budget deficit exceeds $100 billion.  </P> <P> Brady complained that 80% of the tax saving under the expanded IRA proposed by  Bentsen would go to those with incomes over $50,000 a year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Democrats' Argument Told  </P> <P> Democrats' major argument against the capital-gains cut is that 80% of its  benefits would be collected by those with incomes above $100,000.  </P> <P> "It is hard for me to understand why this whole discussion has to reach the  level of rich vs. poor," Brady said.  </P> <P> "The rich are getting richer in this country and the poor are getting poorer,"  said Sen. Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.). "You'll have to forgive us for bringing  it up."  </P> <P> Brady contends the figure cited by Democrats on capital gains is misleading on  the ground that the over-$100,000 category includes many people of relatively  modest earnings who, once in a lifetime, sell a small business or a home and  for that year their income is pushed above that level.  </P> <P> Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments, are taxed at the  same rate as wages. Bush and a majority of the House want to tax only 70% of  gains.  </P> <P> The secretary cited an estimate that 47% of capital gains are realized by  people whose other income -- not including the gains -- is less than $50,000 a  year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bentsen Responds  </P> <P> In response, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) said the joint-committee staff, which  provides technical tax advice to Congress, found that only 18% of the gains  were taken by people who reported more than one capital-gains transaction a  year -- eliminating the one-time sellers.  </P> <P> The Finance Committee will begin work next week on a package of spending cuts  and revenue increases aimed mainly at reducing the deficit by about $17 billion  during budget year 1990, which begins Oct. 1.  </P></p>

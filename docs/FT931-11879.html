			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Service sector 'new industrial dinosaur' BANKS, insurance companies, defence contractors and government departments are taking over from textiles, shipbuilding, steel and coal as Britain's industrial dinosaurs, says BWD Rensburg, the Huddersfield-based stockbroking group, in its quarterly review of northern companies, published today. Rising unemployment in southern England is the first sign of labour shakeout and cost-cutting in the service sector similar to that which has devastated smokestack industries in northern England during the last 15 years. This has made old regional boundaries irrelevant when analysing unemployment trends, says Mr John Dyson, BWD's corporate services director. Every region now has successful areas and blackspots, he says. Jobs in the north are less concentrated in single sectors and areas, and there are now many more small businesses in the region and a wider spread of companies. This, according to the review, is a result of the region having to restructure after the old industries were run down in the early 1980s, and has helped the north withstand the recession. 'The mass service-industry employers are the new potential dinosaurs of the next century,' Mr Dyson says. The analysis - based on last October's jobless figures - found a cluster of areas, mainly in a coastal belt running from Suffolk to Devon, where unemployment had risen by 2.2 percentage points or more year-on-year. The analysis attributes this to the concentration of service-sector industries in those areas. By contrast, 13 travel-to-work areas with an unemployment rate of less than 5.3 per cent are mainly clustered in a belt running across northern England from the Lake District to North Yorkshire. The seasonally adjusted jobless rate was 10.1 per cent last October. The analysis also shows two similar areas of low unemployment in Wales, two in Scotland, and another cluster of three, based on east Cheshire and the Derbyshire peak district. Because the areas are where people with good incomes live or spend their leisure time, Mr Dyson calls the large cluster of low unemployment the northern playground and the coastal belt of rising joblessness the southern playground. 'The north-south playing field is now much more even, with no clearly winning regions emerging,' he says. The Quarterly Review. BWD Rensburg, Woodsome House, Fenay Bridge, Huddersfield HD8 0JG.

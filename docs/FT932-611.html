			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: Restoring roads in Bangladesh The Bangladeshi government has appointed ROUGHTON AND PARTNERS and LG MOUCHEL &amp; PARTNERS to assist it with the rehabilitation of 300kms of cyclone damaged roads in the Chittagong and Noakhali areas of Bangladesh. The government has received a loan from the Asian Development Bank to finance the rehabilitation of certain roads which were affected by cyclones. The object of the rehabilitation is that the roads will provide improved means of evacuation in the face of cyclone warnings, that they will be reconstructed to resist cyclone damage and that they will be capable of carrying relief traffic immediately after abnormal flood waters have receded without sustaining damage. The estimated value of this project is between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m. Work is due to begin in October and will continue until the beginning of the monsoon season in May 1994.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC BERKELEY CHANCELLOR ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION  </P> <P> UC Berkeley Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman, who has led that prestigious and  argumentative campus since 1980, announced Thursday that he will resign next  year and return to teaching law and city planning.  </P> <P> Heyman, 59, said he is resigning "to regain the sense of perspective you have  as a faculty member." Including his six previous years as vice chancellor,  Heyman will have been a top administrator for 16 years and that, he said, "is a  long time at a place like Berkeley."  </P> <P> His reign as chancellor has been quieter than those of predecessors in the  1960s when the campus was a center of student protest. Nevertheless, Heyman  faced controversies over alleged bias against the admission of Asian-American  students and over university growth in a city that sometimes has treated UC  officials like hostile invaders.  </P> <P> Heyman's resignation, effective next June 30, leaves an opening at what many in  higher education consider to be one of the world's finest research  universities, public or private. Nobel Prizes and other symbols of academic  power are sprinkled throughout the Berkeley faculty.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Search Committee  </P> <P> UC President David P. Gardner said he will soon appoint a committee to search  for Heyman's successor.  </P> <P> "The state of California, the University of California and the Berkeley campus  have been extraordinarily well served" by Heyman, Gardner told a press  conference at a UC Regents meeting here Thursday. He stressed that he was  reluctantly accepting the resignation.  </P> <P> Wearing one of the trademark bow ties that add to his genial, professorial air,  Heyman said one of his biggest accomplishments was enrolling more minority  students. Last fall, non-Anglos made up 51% of UC Berkeley undergraduates,  compared to 34% in 1980.  </P> <P> However, Heyman was embroiled for years in charges that the school was trying  to limit the number of Asian-American students. That led to several  investigations by faculty and the state government and to some changes in  admission policy. Heyman eventually apologized to the Asian community for what  he said was earlier insensitivity to their complaints.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who is chairman of the Assembly  subcommittee on higher education, issued a statement Thursday in praise of  Heyman. "He will be most remembered for his recent leadership and sensitivity  on the Asian admission issue," Hayden said.  </P> <P> At the press conference, Heyman said his other accomplishments include  construction of new science buildings and more student housing, as well as a  sharp increase in annual private donations to the school, from $31 million in  1980 to more than $100 million last year.  </P> <P> Yet he conceded that he has tired of the sometimes confrontational politics on  campus and such lingering disputes as whether UC should build dormitories on  People's Park and on campus hilltops. The People's Park plan, strongly opposed  by the city, led to a street riot 20 years ago and another one a few months  ago.  </P> <P> "The rhetoric is a little more abrasive at a place like Berkeley," Heyman said.  </P> <P> UCLA Chancellor Charles Young, who is the dean of UC campus heads with 20 years  on the job, said he was expecting Heyman's resignation. "I think it's been  clear for some time that Mike is getting to the point that he wants to do  something else with his life," said Young, who credited Heyman with helping to  heal the wounds of campus protests during the 1960s and 1970s.  </P> <P> Robert Clodius, president of the National Assn. of State Universities and Land  Grant Colleges, also said he was not surprised by Heyman's announcement. "Some  of the things you have to put up with (as chancellor) get old after a while,"  he said in a telephone interview from Washington.  </P> <P> Clodius called Heyman "one of the truly great, unapologetic liberal thinkers I  know of in higher education."  </P> <P> Guillermo Rodriguez, student representative on the Board of Regents, said  Heyman was very accessible to students and fair in dealing with protests. The  chancellor's main weakness, according to the UC Berkeley senior, was in not  pushing harder to increase the number of minority professors.  </P> <P> Heyman said he also is unhappy with the ethnic composition of the faculty but  stressed that more minority scholars appear to be in the pipeline toward  teaching. Non-whites make up 10.2% of the faculty now, compared to 8.5% when he  became chancellor, officials said.  </P> <P> Heyman said he will take a year's sabbatical and then return to teaching and  research at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall law school and the department of city and  regional planning. He said he wants to concentrate on environmental and  transportation issues in the San Francisco Bay Area.  </P> <P> He will take a still unspecified pay cut from his now annual salary of  $142,900.  </P> <P> An alumnus of Dartmouth College and Yale University Law School, Heyman joined  the UC Berkeley law faculty in 1959 after serving as chief clerk to then-U.S.  Chief Justice Earl Warren. He became vice chancellor in 1974.  </P> <P> Three years into his chancellorship, Heyman was widely considered a finalist  for the presidency of the nine-campus UC system. That job went to Gardner and  the two men later had some conflicts, although on Thursday they described each  other as good friends.  </P> <P> Asked about qualifications for his successor, Heyman listed top scholarship,  egalitarian ideals and "good luck."  </P></p>

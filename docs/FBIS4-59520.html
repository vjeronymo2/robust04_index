			<p>BFN     [Text] Field Colonel 'Ali al-Jayfi, commander of the  northern Yemeni al-'Amaliqah Brigade, has said that his troops,  backed with tanks and artillery units, are currently stationed  at a distance of 40 km northeast of Aden, having inflicted  successive defeats on the southern forces and overrun their  strongholds in Abyan.    Speaking to an international media delegation touring the  areas of the fighting, Col. al-Jayfi said that some northern  troops have arrived at the al-'Alam area 20 km north of Aden.  He pointed out that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih ordered the  siege tightened on Aden, stronghold of the Yemeni Socialist  Party. The northern commander added that his troops are  repositioning themselves around the city and waiting for a  political decision to capture it.    An official military source in Sanaa has said that the  northern troops advanced in the al-Dali' sector and regained  control of the southern al-Musaymir town.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Outokumpu to sell US subsidiary OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, is selling OM Group, its US speciality chemicals subsidiary, through an initial public offering in the US. Net proceeds are estimated at between Dollars 150m and Dollars 170m, while OM Group will raise Dollars 20m through a simultaneous treasury issue. The offering will be underwritten by Lehman Brothers, Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp and Goldman Sachs, and comprise US and international tranches. Mr Markku Toivanen, president of Outokumpu Metals &amp; Resources, said: 'This business is not a core one. We are not comfortable in marketing speciality products as we are more a commodities business.' He said an IPO, rather than a trade sale, would help with future fund-raising. OM Group, based in Cleveland, is one of the world's leading producers of metal-based speciality chemicals and has manufacturing facilities in the US, Finland and France.</p>

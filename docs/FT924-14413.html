			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / President handed tax bill problem THE US Senate last night handed President George Bush a tricky political problem, less than a month before the presidential election, by passing a Dollars 27bn tax bill that he may feel obliged to veto. Mr Bush supports the core of the bill, which includes the creation of 50 urban and rural enterprise zones to promote investment, an increase in the tax-deductible income ceilings for those with personal pensions, and a repeal of the special tax on certain luxury items, such as yachts and furs, though not cars. However, the bill also contains several small tax increases - on moving expense allowances, on securities dealers and on high-income retired people  -which run counter to the president's renewed election promise not to raise taxes 'ever, ever.' With the House of Representatives already adjourned and the Senate about to be, Mr Bush need not formally exercise the veto but could simply not sign the bill, a tactic known as the pocket veto. Either way, Senator Robert Dole, Republican minority leader in the Senate, predicted the bill would not become law. The loss of the enterprise zones would be seen as a defeat for the president's commitment to improve the inner cities. He might blame his action, or inaction, on the Democratic-controlled Congress, but a portrayal of the country's poor as suffering by his desire to preserve tax breaks for the rich would put him where he does not want to be - on the political defensive. Reuter adds from Washington: Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, received the endorsement yesterday of nearly 600 economists, including nine Nobel prize winners. They said they liked his plan to revitalise the US economy through government spending and tax breaks for business investment.</p>

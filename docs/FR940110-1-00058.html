			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Increase in household income or sale of project before end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of required long-term period. (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Increase in household income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.5(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households occupying a rental housing unit subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income-targeting requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must satisfy the income-eligibility requirement applicable to such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income-targeted unit, as committed to in the AHP application, upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial occupancy. The household may continue to occupy the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income-targeted unit even if its income increases above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income-eligibility requirement for such unit. The unit may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to count toward meeting the income-targeting requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed to in the AHP application, provided the rent charged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remains affordable to the household as defined in proposed &sect;960.1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (as further discussed below). However, if the household's income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rises above 140 percent of the income-targeting level committed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the AHP application, the sponsor must make the next available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rental housing unit in the project affordable to and available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupancy by a household whose income is at or below the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income-targeting level committed to in the AHP application for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original unit. Once the next available rental housing unit is so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupied, the rent charged on the unit occupied by the household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose income has risen shall no longer be subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that it be affordable for households at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income-targeting level committed to in the AHP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This approach is consistent with the approach followed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LIHTC program. Under the LIHTC program, a unit is in compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the occupancy requirements until the tenant's income has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risen to 140 percent of the qualifying income. See 26 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;42(g)(2)(D)(i). The next available unit must then be rented to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income-eligible tenant at an affordable rent. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 42(g)(2)(D)(ii). This approach allows the household to achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stability by allowing increases in income without fear of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> displacement or increased rents. In addition, it does not cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destabilization of the project's cash flow by having the project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsor provide additional income-eligible units with reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rents that may reduce the income of the project. It also would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the treatment of rents under the AHP's 20 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement (also known as the maximum subsidy rule), which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently an interim rule of the Board, and which is incorporated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;960.9(c) of this proposed rule. (See discussion of 20  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent requirement below.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.1 of the proposed rule defines ``affordable for very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-income households'' to mean:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For purposes of rental housing units, that rents, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable utility costs, charged to households for such units do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not exceed 30 percent of the income of a household (assuming a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household size of 1.5 persons per bedroom or 1.0 person per unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without a separate bedroom) which has an income of 50 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the median income for the area, as adjusted and published by HUD,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except that in areas where the Secretary adjusts this income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figure downward because of prevailing construction costs, low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing costs, or unusually high household incomes, then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``affordable for very low-income households'' means that rents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including reasonable utility costs, charged to households for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units do not exceed 30 percent of the income of a household which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has an income of 50 percent of the median income for the area, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published by HUD, with adjustment for household size, but without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the adjustments made by the Secretary for prevailing construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs, low housing costs, or unusually high household incomes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If a rental unit is targeted to a household whose income is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than 50 percent of the median income for the area, then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``affordable for very low-income households'' means that the rent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including reasonable utility costs, charged to a household for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such unit does not exceed 30 percent of the maximum qualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income of the targeted households of the size expected to occupy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed definition implements section 10(j)(13)(D) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, which defines ``affordable for very low-income households'' to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mean that rents charged to tenants for units made available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupancy by low-income families shall not exceed 30 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the adjusted income of a family whose income equals 50 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the income for the area (as determined by the Secretary of HUD)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with adjustment for family size. 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(13)(D).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.1(b) of the Board's existing AHP regulation contains a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of the term that is similar to the statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition. See 12 CFR 960.1(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

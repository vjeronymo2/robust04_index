			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY ATTORNEY'S BATTLE PLAN AGAINST COCAINE OUTLETS FOUNDERS IN COURT  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn on Wednesday announced a plan to clamp  down on motels, apartment buildings and other residences where rock cocaine is  sold -- but it immediately foundered in the courts.  </P> <P> Backed enthusiastically by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, Hahn launched the  narcotics abatement unit of city lawyers who will go to court to shut down what  Hahn called "cesspools of drug dealing" throughout the city.  </P> <P> Hahn immediately sent a deputy to court for a restraining order. But Los  Angeles Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin was unimpressed with the urgency of the  problem or the solution touted by Hahn.  </P> <P> Lewin declined a request by Deputy City Atty. Kevin T. Ryan for temporary  restraining orders to force owners and operators of the "rental rock houses" to  eliminate drug dealing immediately or face closure. Instead, he scheduled a  court hearing for Feb. 16 on six suits filed by Hahn's new unit.  </P> <P> The next round for the city attorney's office will be to persuade the judge to  issue a restraining order at that hearing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Drug-Related Activity'  </P> <P> Later Wednesday, a Times reporter visited some of the sites targeted by Hahn  and saw what neighbors called "drug-related activity." Wads of bills were  exchanged surreptitiously near a motel, and pedestrians and automobiles,  passing by in a stream, stopped at an apartment building suspected of being a  drug sale site.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised they haven't closed it earlier," said Lorenzo Gregg, 32, one of  a small group of local residents who gathered outside the Gates Hotel, 7814  Figueroa St., to listen to Hahn and Bradley. "There has been a lot of drug  trafficking, people getting killed, shot. It's bad for the community. You can't  even walk around at night."  </P> <P> "We are not going to quit until we have made every neighborhood in this city  safe and secure for decent, law-abiding citizens," Bradley said.  </P> <P> The two officials and police were applauded by members of the Western Heights  Neighborhood Assn. who waved a placard proclaiming opposition to rock houses,  places where cocaine is sold.  </P> <P> Deputy Police Chief Glen Levant, who said police made 58,000 drug arrests and  closed 500 rock houses last year, said Hahn's efforts represent the first  attack on the motels. He said 200 motels and other sites have been identified  throughout the city as places where drug dealers operate.  </P> <P> The Gates Motel, where more than 60 arrests have been made in the last two  years, was one of six sites Hahn's office attempted to close to drug dealers  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Civil suits were filed against owners and operators of each targeted location  under the state's relatively new Controlled Substances Abatement Act.  </P> <P> Patterned after the state's 1912 Red Light Abatement Act, which allowed  authorities to put houses of prostitution out of business as public nuisances,  the law enables a judge to padlock the premises of a motel or house used for  drug trafficking if owners ignore court orders to abate the nuisance.  </P> <P> Those found in contempt of court orders banning illegal activity can be fined  from $500 to $10,000 under the drug abatement law.  </P> <P> "We have no desire to deny anyone the use of their business or home," Hahn  said. " . . . But the drug trafficking problem in this city is too serious, too  menacing and too urgent for us to keep fighting with one hand tied behind our  back."  </P> <P> In addition to the 12-unit Gates Motel, which Hahn termed "one of the worst  locations," the suits seek to curtail drug dealing at:  </P> <P> * The 15-unit Mid-Town Motel, 730 S. Alvarado St., where 19 arrests were made  last year;  </P> <P> * A 10-unit apartment building, 2922 S. Budlong Ave., where 52 arrests were  made in six months;  </P> <P> * Five adjoining dwellings at 3847-3849 S. Western Ave., with 30 arrests in 18  months;  </P> <P> * A house at 1733 Longwood Ave., with 10 arrests in two years;  </P> <P> * Another single family dwelling at 2179 W. 21st St., where 15 arrests have  been made since June.  </P> <P> Hahn said he hopes his special unit can file suits against similar sites every  month.  </P> <P> Ernest Moszzkley, a security guard at the Dr. Ruth Temple Health Center near  the Western Avenue site, said young men run through the clinic when the  purported "crack house" across the street is raided.  </P> <P> "The police make sweeps," he said. "But (the dealers) are like rats. They come  back."  </P></p>

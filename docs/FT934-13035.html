			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Take it from the top: Is success something you can learn? Take one Brazilian archbishop, one French chef at a three-star restaurant, an Australian marathon runner, a Russian conductor, the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, the chief of an American Indian tribe, and 34 other super-achievers. Find out how they got where they are, and what makes each tick. Distill the result, and you should have the secret of success. Today, at a conference at Leeds Castle, Kent, that secret could be revealed. A team of researchers from the Performance Group, a Norwegian management consultancy, has spent two years travelling the world with a tape recorder talking to 40 'world-class performers', including politicians, sports stars, film makers, business people and clerics. A group of senior business executives has been invited to hear the study's conclusions. All will probably be hoping to glean a few tips for themselves. At first sight, the reasons Luciano Benetton became a sweater-selling superstar may appear to differ radically from those that made Fumihiko Maki one of Japan's leading architects, or helped yachtsman Dennis Conner win the America's Cup. But the Performance Group contends that all top performers have common characteristics - and that success is not a birthright but a trait that can be developed. The most obvious similarity among those interviewed for the study is a sense of compelling purpose. Successful people, it seems, are greedy for knowledge and never stop acquiring it. They learn from their mistakes, they learn from others. They have strong powers of concentration. They are disciplined, intense and most have integrity. Wilma Mankiller is presented in the study as a typical world-class performer. She is the first woman to be elected principal-in-chief of the Cherokee Nation, an Indian tribe in North America with 137,000 members. Her ambition to lead the tribe came after a serious car accident. She says she is dedicated to her work and respects her colleagues: 'What I like best, and think is the most fun, is to talk with people in the Cherokee Nation at large and focus on what it is we need to do, and then put all of the pieces for a project together and move forward.' Arne Naess, mountaineer and Norwegian shipowner, agrees that dedication is fundamental: 'You cannot be successful at anything doing it 90 per cent of the time.' Far from being egocentric, however, successful people are aware of the need to motivate those who work with them as well - at least so they said in their interviews. Esa-Pekka Salonen, 35, conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, says he aims to 'make others feel free, to create an illusion that they are actually doing what they are doing out of their own desires and not being led by somebody'. All top performers are able to work intensely, according to the study, but can also be flexible. For chef Michel Guerard, pioneer of nouvelle cuisine, this means one minute dreaming up a strategy for restaurants combined with health spas, the next making a perfect chocolate mousse. Hard work, however, needs to be matched by relaxation. According to Jan Carlzon, former president of Scandinavian Airlines System, 'to withdraw is one of the keys to going forward again'. All withdraw in different ways. Masanari Iketani, chief executive of Tokyo Steel, gets up at first light to tend his orchids. Susan Bambrick, a leading Australian academic, takes an early morning dip in the sea. Once a week Paulo Evaristo Arns, archbishop of Sao Paulo, leaves his office and goes incommunicado for a day. World-class performers do not waste time. They know how to delegate and keep their desks tidy. Ricardo Semler, who runs Semco, the unusual Brazilian manufacturer of industrial equipment that allows employees to set their own hours and in some cases their pay, is particularly jealous of his time. 'If I can't imagine anybody else doing the task and I still think that it has to be done, I do it,' he says. He schedules no appointments unless there is a definite reason for them, and he does not answer telephone calls. Most high-flyers agree that it is important to make mistakes and experience failure. Hector Babenco, the Argentine film director who made The Kiss of the Spiderwoman, describes having a film panned by the critics: 'I was crying at ridiculous moments of the day, watching the ceiling all night . . . Then one day when I woke up, I said that life is bigger than everything else. Today I am a new person.' Many of these leading performers share a competitive streak. Cheong Choong Kong, chief executive of Singapore Airlines, emphasises 'a person's drive, an aggressive need always to be one step ahead of the others'. Conner attributes his prowess as a yachtsman to persistence and an inner drive to win - instincts he thinks result from growing up poor in San Diego, surrounded by rich folk and their sailing boats. However, some comments in the study fail to back up the thesis that anyone's performance can be improved by taking a lead from the successful. Several believe that greatness is congenital. Maestro of the Russian Opera, Valery Gergiev says: 'Number one: you are born. You are born with certain abilities already. It is in the computer, and you can't change it easily.' Others have had greatness thrust upon them. Masanari Iketani inherited his steel business from his father. About half of the interviewees rate their fathers - mothers are hardly mentioned - as the most important influence in their lives. The Performance Group argues that high-flyers have lessons for all of us. But it is one thing to establish that world-class performers have much in common. Whether the executives attending the Leeds Castle conference will leave with a more purposeful stride is another matter.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / How economics is linked to ethics: The following is a digest of Monday's presidential address by Samuel Brittan at the British Association The relation between economics and ethics is very much in the air. I had already suggested it for the theme of the economic section at the annual conference of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which has been taking place this week in Keele, Staffordshire, when an authoritative survey article appeared in the most accessible of all academic journals, the Journal of Economic Literature, entitled Taking Ethics Seriously: Economics and Contemporary Moral Philosophy*. The UK journal, The Political Quarterly, is presenting a special issue this September entitled Ethics and Markets; and there are many more such offerings in the pipeline. There is, in addition, the profitable sub-discipline, known as Business Ethics, linking the fringes of the corporate and the academic world. These developments have many origins. The self-proclaimed role of the financier, George Soros, in toppling Britain from the exchange rate mechanism in 1992 made people ask whether such speculation is an immoral undermining of government policies or a praiseworthy acceleration of the overdue destruction of unrealistic parities and currency systems. Headline business scandals suggest the need to make more explicit the constraints within which profit-making should be pursued; and events in the former Soviet Union have underlined the difference between Mafia capitalism and the more respectable variety. Much of the debate in the last two centuries has consisted of attacks on the morality of markets by self-proclaimed prophets, such as Carlyle or Ruskin, and less than completely convincing replies. My own presidential address to Section F (Economics) tried to ask a different question: how do the moral beliefs of economic actors, such as businessmen, workers or consumers, affect their behaviour and thus economic performance? A belief in a 'fair wage' or a 'fair profit' can affect the response to government economic programmes, just as much as more tangible forces, such as minimum pay laws and social security systems. In the ex-Communist countries, questions such as the range of permissible actions against competitors, or conventions governing the treatment of property, have proved much more relevant than the supposedly hard-edged mathematical relationships which preoccupy many top-grade western economists. Debate is beginning on these issues; but much of it has been bogged down in a dispute on whether 'man' is a predominantly altruistic or self-interested animal, a topic on which biology should have the last word. Less has been written on the specific effects of particular beliefs; and I had to proceed very much by example. The debate has also been held back by the now-fading superstition, taught in many textbooks, that economic practitioners can only talk about means, and that attitudes towards, say, economic growth versus income equalisation are like tastes for strawberry or vanilla ice cream about which no argument is possible. There are two general points to make: The influence of so-called moral beliefs is not always for the good. Cynics and hard-headed realists may do less harm than a Grand Inquisitor prepared to torture and sacrifice human life for his own idea of the greatest good. People do not have to be especially selfish to play the market game. Even altruists can justifiably buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest if this helps to reveal information about tastes, needs and know-how and to co-ordinate dispersed human efforts. Indeed an altruist may put more effort into profit-making than citizens with normal mixed motives, because he wants the largest possible earnings to devote to philanthropic activities. But, irrespective of motive, the market game has to be played within rules and constraints which need explicit discussion and analysis. The following are examples where great confusion exists.</p>

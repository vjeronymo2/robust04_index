			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> A PAEAN TO BLACK CULTURE AT HIGHWAYS  </P> <P> Brisk good humor, kinetic energy and deep conviction revved up "Star Spangled  Nigger," a performance piece at Highways Monday night. The bent spoke in the  wheel was an excess of full-throttle emoting that came across as exaggerated  and ultimately unbelievable staginess.  </P> <P> The creation of Meri Nana-Ama Danquah, a poet born in Ghana, with contributions  by fellow performers Halima Williams and Ezra Knight, the work is a paean to  black physicality, tenaciousness and spirituality in a frequently hostile  American culture.  </P> <P> Performed in front of an American flag, with ironic refrains quoting the Pledge  of Allegiance and the National Anthem, the piece incorporates snippets from two  African dances (choreographed by Yao Tamakloe) as a way of reaffirming the  power of cultural roots.  </P> <P> These segments -- in which the performers were joined by dancers Carolyn "Kemi"  McPherson and Mark Lawson and drummer Murshid Husam-Iddin -- were more about  exuberant spirits than the niceties of replicating indigenous styles.  </P> <P> Williams, whose body moved in luscious parallel to her lyric monologue about  sexual pleasure, later overplayed her note of anguish and rage until it lost  its punch. But Knight's feisty, funny rap about his first name and his  portrayal of a wild-eyed street kid who died of a gunshot and still found  himself roaming the streets was right on.  </P> <P> Danquah, shifting from wooden passivity to grim stridency, found her best mode  as a serenely authoritative witness to memory.

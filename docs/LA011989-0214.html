			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> JUDGE WON'T HALT BUNDY EXECUTION  </P> <P> A state Circuit Court judge today refused to block Tuesday's scheduled  execution of triple killer Ted Bundy, who faces his fourth execution date.  </P> <P> Judge John Peach denied three claims in Bundy's appeal filed in the north  Florida city where Bundy abducted his last victim. Columbia County State Atty.  Jerry Blair, who prosecuted Bundy for the 1978 murder of 12-year-old Kimberly  Leach, said: "It's time . . . we're approaching the 11th anniversary of the  death of Kimberly Leach, and Ted Bundy is still alive." Unless he wins a stay,  the 42-year-old former law student will die in Florida's electric chair  Tuesday.  </P></p>

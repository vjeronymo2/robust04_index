			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / People: Geoffrey Woodroffe to preside over grief and grievance Britain's funeral business is getting its first Ombudsman, Professor Geoffrey Woodroffe, director of the centre for consumer and commercial law research at Brunel University. Woodroffe's new part-time appointment will entail his scrutinising complaints from families who are dissatisfied with services provided by funeral parlours belonging to either the Funeral Standards Council or the Funeral Planning Council, which together account for about half of the country's 4,000 funeral directors. These two professional bodies have largely displaced the older National Association of Funeral Directors, which, established in 1979 in order to bring greater transparency to the business, was criticised by the Office of Fair Trading in 1989. The Ombudsman's function has teeth, notably the power to order companies to pay compensation up to Pounds 50,000 to claimants whose grievances are upheld. The office is able to receive complaints backdated to - but not beyond - April 4 this year. The funeral business in the UK is worth some Pounds 1bn annually, with around 640,000 funerals taking place each year. Woodroffe is a solicitor by training and has broad experience of commercial law both in the UK and through his diverse work for the European Commission. The Ombudsman's council has a team of six (besides Woodroffe himself) including: Jill Moore, chairman; Peter Gibson; Cassandra Kent; Cynthia McDowell; Alan Edwards; and Gordon Kee. The council will be promoting its work through citizens' advice bureaus and other public forums.</p>

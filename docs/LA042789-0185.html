			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTING AFFIRMATIVELY;  </P> <P> GLENDALE BEGINS TO MOVE TOWARD INTEGRATING THE CITY'S WORK FORCE  </P> <P> Jose Manuel Feliciano has always been one to believe that nothing is beyond the  reach of determined minds, regardless of race or social condition.  </P> <P> The son of a poor Pentecostal minister, Feliciano lived during his childhood  years in a converted garage in a small town in Puerto Rico.  </P> <P> But his humble background, he proudly points out, did not prevent Feliciano,  39, from getting two college degrees and fulfilling his lifelong dream of  becoming a public servant.  </P> <P> These days Feliciano is facing the biggest challenge of his life. As  coordinator of Glendale's newly revamped affirmative action program, his job is  to persuade other minorities that they can also succeed.  </P> <P> It is by no means an easy task, given Glendale's less than exemplary efforts to  recruit minorities and its recent history of racial incidents. In the past four  years, Glendale has lost a major discrimination lawsuit filed by a Latino  police officer; been home to a white supremacist group; attracted a rally by  another white supremacist group that ended in a near riot, and seen homes,  cars, a Jewish temple and a school smeared with racist graffiti.  </P> <P> None of which is surprising to Feliciano, he is quick to point out. After all,  the city is going through an at-times painful transition from what was once a  white, conservative community to an ethnically diverse California melting pot.  </P> <P> "It's a sad commentary to make," Feliciano said in his small, cluttered City  Hall office. "But it's going to get worse before it gets better. As immigrants  continue to come, I predict more incidents of racial tension in the San  Fernando Valley, including Glendale."  </P> <P> To ease such tensions, the city has launched a major offensive to integrate the  municipal work force. Critics say that Feliciano's efforts are in the wrong  direction and that the city is not doing enough to make up for the damage  created by years of neglect.  </P> <P> But Feliciano will have none of it. Just watch me, he seems to say, his words  and gestures denoting confidence about the job he began in November.  </P> <P> Feliciano arrived to Glendale in 1977 as a personnel trainee and quietly rose  through the ranks. Ten years and five promotions later, he became the city's  personnel services administrator.  </P> <P> A devoted family man and proud father of two, along the way Feliciano became a  real estate investor and prospered. "Let me tell you," he grinned. "I've made a  lot more money in real estate than I have in this job this year."  </P> <P> Affirmative action coordinator since 1981, Feliciano acknowledges that he and  the city did not begin recruiting minorities aggressively until virtually  forced to in 1986. That year, Carlos Jauregui, a Latino police officer,  successfully sued his department for discriminatory promotional practices.  </P> <P> What was once a marginal occupation that took up "about 20%" of his office time  has now become Feliciano's main responsibility -- affirmative action duties  account for "more than 60%" of Feliciano's workload.  </P> <P> "I see an emphatic, positive change on the commitment of public officials since  around 1986 toward welcoming a more integrated work force," Feliciano  explained.  </P> <P> As a result, in two years the percentage of minorities in the work force jumped  from 24.4% in 1986 to 29.2% of the city's 1,419 employees in 1988. It had taken  the city 11 years before that to raise its minority representation from only  10%.  </P> <P> Since then, city officials also began hiring consultants, commissioning  studies, sponsoring ethnic festivals and establishing seminars and workshops to  increase awareness of cultural, gender and age differences among city  employees.  </P> <P> Starting last month, all new employees are given a two-hour crash course  conducted by Feliciano on cultural diversity. Posters preaching tolerance and  praising diversity ordered by Feliciano cover the employee orientation room.  </P> <P> At a recent orientation class, Feliciano addressed a group of seven employees,  of whom five were minorities. He said the mix is typical of the kind of  employees the city is hiring.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recruitment Stepped Up  </P> <P> The city has also stepped up its recruitment efforts. In February, the city  contracted the Los Angeles-based consulting firm of Glenda Madrid and  Associates to establish specific minority hiring goals based on "relevant  market" analysis -- a study of the ethnic makeup of the different labor pools  the city draws on to fill its positions.  </P> <P> Also, last month the Glendale City Council allocated $142,000 to hire a  minority recruiter and a clerk and to pay for advertisements to attract  minorities. Feliciano wasted no time in putting the money to use -- last week  Sandra Houlemard became the city's first full-time minority recruiter.  </P> <P> Most of the changes stem from an independent study of the Glendale police  hiring and promotional practices ordered by U.S. District Judge Dickran  Tevrizian in his ruling on the Jauregui case.  </P> <P> The 11-month study was completed last November by the Latino law firm of Ochoa  and Sillas. It concluded that the Glendale Police Department had disregarded  its own promotional practices and built a force led by white officers who were  slow to act on racial complaints.  </P> <P> It also made a number of specific recommendations to improve the entire city's  hiring and promotional practices and to deal more effectively with future  harassment complaints.  </P> <P> In a joint public statement, then-City Manager James Rez and Police Chief David  J. Thompson said they accepted the study's findings and vowed to carry out most  recommendations immediately.  </P> <P> Attorney Herman Sillas, who wrote the report, was retained as an adviser by the  city to help Feliciano make those changes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Long, Hard Look'  </P> <P> "The Ochoa and Sillas report made us take a long, hard look at ourselves," City  Manager David Ramsay said.  </P> <P> The Jauregui ruling, however, fell short of imposing minority hiring quotas on  the city or any of its departments. "Our affirmative action program is  completely voluntary," Feliciano explained.  </P> <P> The court case, Feliciano said, addressed problems in only one of the city's  departments and was limited to the Police Department's promotional policies --  not hiring problems or work- force harassment.  </P> <P> Doris Woods, enforcement manager of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission's Los Angeles office, said cities are required only to be equal  opportunity employers to be eligible for federal contracts.  </P> <P> She said her office handles individual complaints but does not monitor city  programs.  </P> <P> Glendale has had since 1972 an affirmative action policy plan that resembles  many others throughout the country. In the plan, Glendale says its goal is to  "place the ethnic composition of the permanent full-time Glendale work force on  par with the composition of the labor market. . . ."  </P> <P> For years, however, the city did little more than some advertisements in black  and Latino newspapers.  </P> <P> "Before 1986 we were concentrating on internal processes, like changing the  classifications of 'policeman' to 'police officer' and 'fireman' to  'firefighter,' things like that," Feliciano explained.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Lot of Selling'  </P> <P> "To get an affirmative action program going, you have to do a lot of selling,  changing minds, education, understanding . . . and it takes time."  </P> <P> Results from the Madrid study are expected in July, but Feliciano does not need  a report to know that the city badly needs more minority employees. "When you  can't go down any further, the only way is up," Feliciano said.  </P> <P> Despite the renewed commitment to affirmative action, city employment has  fallen far short of reflecting the rapid demographic changes occurring in  Glendale.  </P> <P> A recent Glendale school board study shows that the number of students whose  primary language is not English has jumped from 18.4% in 1981 to 59% this year,  said Alice Petrossian, the school district director of intercultural studies.  </P> <P> Nor is the city anywhere close to reflecting the diverse makeup of its  immediate labor market -- Los Angeles County. According to data from the 1980  census, minorities account for 46.9% of the county's work force. And by all  accounts, the minorities' share of the labor market has increased significantly  since then.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Glendale Fire Department, which contains the city's  least-integrated employee roster, is still 94% white and has yet to hire a  black, an Asian-American or a woman.  </P> <P> And the perception of racial harassment in the work force has yet to disappear.  Glendale Employees Assn. Vice President Art Sandor said he has received three  complaints of alleged racial harassment so far this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Complaints Passed On  </P> <P> He said two of the complaints have been passed on to the city manager, while  the merits of the most recent complaint are still being evaluated. Ramsay said  his office is conducting a thorough investigation in both cases, which remain  confidential to protect the alleged victims.  </P> <P> Moreover, critics contend that the city's affirmative action program has not  prevented whites from retaining a near-monopoly over the city's top jobs. City  statistics filed with the Federal Equal Employment Agency last year show that  94.1% of the city's executive-level and 80.6% of the city's management-level  positions are held by whites.  </P> <P> "The affirmative action movement started in 1965 . . .," said Glendale  Community College administrator Ray Reyes, a longtime critic of of the city's  minority hiring policies. "When is Glendale going to find that out? When are  they going to stop wasting time in studies and seminars and start opening  choice jobs to minorities?"  </P> <P> Easier said than done, replied Feliciano. And taking shots from people like  Reyes, he said, does not help the process. It's hard enough, Feliciano said, to  overcome the negative publicity that has rocked Glendale in the last four  years.  </P> <P> The string of incidents revived unpleasant memories that the city had been  quietly trying to outlive -- such as being the home to the American Nazi  Party's Western Region headquarters between 1966 and 1968 and the violence that  followed the first wave of Latino immigrants in the early 1970s.  </P> <P> If only the press got off the Glendale-bashing bandwagon, Feliciano snapped.  "But the press continues to alienate people by looking at the past, instead of  the future, and I resent that," he said. "I happen to think the city is truly  committed to affirmative action. We are way ahead of what everyone else is  doing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Called Me a Coconut'  </P> <P> On a recent recruiting trip for the Police Department to East Los Angeles, a  group of Latino activists Feliciano won't name, "called me a coconut," he said.  "You know, brown in the outside, white in the inside."  </P> <P> Feliciano said the remark did not anger him as much as he was saddened by the  lost opportunity. "I felt these people were screening themselves out of the  competitive process, and I know the process is fair.  </P> <P> "But it takes a long time for people to change their preconceived notions. They  want to be sure we're for real and not just putting up a front."  </P> <P> Echoing statements made by several top city officials in recent years,  Feliciano dismissed the city's racial problems as "isolated incidents that do  not reflect the views of the wide majority of this city's residents."  </P> <P> Furthermore, he said, Feliciano himself is the perfect example of the city's  commitment to hiring and promoting minorities.  </P> <P> When he came to California, Feliciano said, he applied for work in at least a  dozen cities and government agencies. Fresh out of college with a master's  degree in public administration and having done some social work in New York  state, Los Angeles and Glendale, he soon found out that not too many  organizations were interested in a relatively inexperienced Puerto Rican who  could not communicate well in English. "Glendale was the only city that gave me  a chance," he said. "All the others turned me down."  </P> <P> Whether Feliciano and the city develop enough credibility among minority groups  to attract quality recruits and see them rise up the ladder remains to be seen.  </P> <P> After all, as Reyes pointed out, employment records -- not seminars and studies  -- ultimately determine the success or failure of affirmative action programs.  </P> <P> Let the skeptics talk, Feliciano said, because no matter what they say today,  "in five years you'll be writing the biggest success story in Glendale's  history."  </P></p>

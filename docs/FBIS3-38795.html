The offer has been accepted by the Palestinians  except for six CH-13 helicopters and two U-17AB reconnaissance  planes, considered to be outdated equipment.    Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis and Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias toured Greek army camps inspecting the  material which will be given free as part of the Greek  contribution towards peace in the Middle East. PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat made a request for such supplies during a meeting  with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou on his recent visit to  Greece.</p>

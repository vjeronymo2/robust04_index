			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 27, BNS -- Lithuanian Prime Minister  Adolfas Slezevicius said he needs to meet with his Belarusian  counterpart Vyacheslav Kebich.    Kebich survived a no confidence vote in the Belarussian  parliament Wednesday [26 January], but the Belarusian lawmakers  managed to oust Parliament Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich.    Commenting on the developments in Minsk, Slezevicius told  reporters Thursday that the search for solutions to several  disputed problems, like the Adutiskis railroad station, has  stopped and experts have "used up their ability" to deal with  these matters.    The Lithuanian premier said he is glad that Lithuania joins  NATO's Partnership for Peace program. "We want Lithuania to be  among the first in this field, and this is a very important step  in enhancing security and considering Kozyrev's (Russian foreign  minister) statements."    Commenting on the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party's  proposal to take a no confidence vote in the government,  Slezevicius said the initiative is a "normal action...and the  right of all politicians and political parties."    The premier said the social democrats simply try "to attract  attention to a petty party that is poorly represented in the  parliament."    Slezevicius said the earlier governments failed to stabilize  the economy and to stop crime.</p>

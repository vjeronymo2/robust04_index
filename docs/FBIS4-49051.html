			<p>BFN     [Text] Canberra, May 2 (XINHUA) -- A China trade and  investment forum will be held in Australia's big cities of  Melbourne and Sydney early next month in a bid to give a further  impetus to economic cooperation between the two nations.    The forum, initiated by the Chinese Government, will be held  from June 1-2 in Melbourne and from 7-8 in Sydney and will be  joined by more than 100 representatives of Chinese industries,  the largest business delegation ever to visit Australia.    The forum was agreed by the two sides last October when Wu  Yi, China's minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation,  paid a visit to Canberra.    The event also follow the Australia-China forum held in  Beijing organized by Austrade last year.    Austrade's East Asia regional office manager Martin Walsh  said in a release today that the forums will provide a unique  opportunity for the Chinese Government and business officials to  outline investment and environment policies for Australian  business.    He said that China continues to be of increasing importance  to Australian exporters and the forums will offer outstanding  opportunities for local firms to follow up with key contacts  from China.    "The forums will also give Chinese company executives and  other decision makers a chance to witness first hand Australian  technology, industry expertise and capability," he said.    The two forums will mainly focus on sectors of building and  construction, transport and telecommunications, food technology  and manufacturing.    China, the largest buyer of Australia's wool, is the ninth  largest export market for the South-Pacific country, with a two  way trade standing at three billion U.S. dollars last year.</p>

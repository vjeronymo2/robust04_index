			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>   [Text] At the beginning of the session, Belarusian Supreme  Soviet Chairman Myechyslaw Hryb thanked the deputies once more  for their confidence and for electing him the Supreme Soviet  chairman. He spoke about the political course he is going to  pursue as head of state.    [Begin Hryb recording] I will do everything possible to make  the work of the Supreme Soviet constructive and fruitful. I am  addressing our opposition: We could eliminate this critical  situation only through joint efforts. I am not for the  establishment of single viewpoints on various issues, however, I  am against idle criticism. I am appealing to you to show and  prove through your actions and not by words alone that we are  concerned with the destiny of our people. Only consolidation --  but not confrontation of all forces -- can help us. I want to  stress that Belarusian mass media can play an important role in  the consolidation of our people and can lessen the tension in  our society. I wish our mass media to be critical and honest.  I was elected Supreme Soviet chairman in a very complicated and  difficult period. I know that our disabled people, pensioners,  families with many children, students, servicemen, workers of  the agricultural and industrial sectors, and scientists are  living through hard times. However, I will not begin my work on  this post with empty promises. I can promise one thing: I will  always remember that laborious Belarusian people, who deserve a  better life, support me. I will do everything possible to  improve living standards of every Belarusian citizen and family.  I hope for your understanding, your civil wisdom; I appeal to  you for your support and comprehension. The destiny of Belarus,  our Motherland, is currently in our hands.    As for the relations of Belarus with foreign states, they  will be prolonged and based on mutual respect, good neighbor  relations, and mutually beneficial cooperation. [end recording]    Later, lawmakers listened to the speeches of their  colleagues  on miscellaneous issues. After the speeches, People's Deputy  Vasil Ivanavich Shaladonow, general prosecutor of the Republic  of Belarus, took the rostrum and proposed including the issues  on electing a new chairman of the Constitutional Committee and  on criminal responsibility of two judges -- Eduard Klimyankow  and Mikhail Klopaw -- into the agenda of the 13th Supreme Soviet  session. The deputies agreed and these issues were included in  the session's agenda.    Next, Supreme Soviet Chairman Myechyslaw Hryb read the  issues  to be discussed by the deputies at this session. People's  Deputy Alyaksandr Lukashenka criticized the deputies for not  paying attention to what happened in this assembly hall the week  before. It is necessary to conduct early Supreme Soviet  elections and not to hide our heads in the sand, said Alyaksandr  Lukashenka. Some deputies proposed discussing economic issues  because the industrial and agricultural sectors are in a  critical state.</p>

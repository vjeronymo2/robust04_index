			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: SGS rises 3.3% in 'satisfactory' year SOCIETE Generale de Surveillance (SGS), the world leader in product inspection and testing services, posted a 3.3 per cent rise in net income last year to SFr187.6m (Dollars 125.9m) and announced several moves to improve relations with investors. Mrs Elisabeth Salina Amorini, the chairman, said the results were 'very satisfactory' in a difficult year. The directors of the family-controlled group have proposed a 5.3 per cent rise in dividends, to SFr40 per registered share and dividend right certificate and SFr200 per bearer share. They also plan five-for-one splits in the par value of the registered and bearer shares to make them more tradeable. In addition, the group is offering to exchange dividend right certificates, which account for about 7 per cent of its market capitalisation, for bearer shares at the rate of six certificates for five shares. Revenues were up 9.7 per cent to SFr2.2bn, with acquisitions contributing 3.3 per cent of the growth, and cash flow improved 8.3 per cent to SFr286.6m. The operating margin eased to 8.9 per cent from an exceptionally strong 10.2 per cent.</p>

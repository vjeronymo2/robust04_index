			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Argentine oil group doubles net YPF, Argentina's recently-privatised oil company, nearly doubled its first-half net profits, despite a relatively small rise in sales, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. First-half earnings were Dollars 230.3m on sales of Dollars 1.91bn. In the same period last year it earned Dollars 127m on sales of Dollars 1.81bn. Analysts said the results were in line with the market's expectations. The company said during its privatisation in June that it estimated 1993 earnings at about Dollars 600m. YPF's share price rose 2.5 per cent to close at Dollars 20.20 on the news. At the end of June, the government sold 45 per cent of YPF for Dollars 3.04bn to investors, making it Argentina's largest privatisation to date.</p>

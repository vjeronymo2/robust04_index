			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN'S BOYCOTT OF ELLIS BOOK  </P> <P> Though blacks have always decried racist representations of themselves in  literature and film, and though Jews have always spoken out against  anti-Semitism, the male editors of the Los Angeles Times have decided that when  it comes to the sexist and violently misogynistic depictions of women in Bret  Easton Ellis' "American Psycho," women should be silent lest they violate the  rights of men to read and create texts and films that sexually degrade and  dismember women.  </P> <P> As evidenced by your editorial, The Times has decided that a man's right to  propagate and consume sexist depictions of women is more important than a  woman's or child's right to live without the fear of being sexually assaulted.  One in six women and one in four little girls have been sexually assaulted. Yet  The Times expects women to do nothing but allow the production, promotion and  consumption of misogyny to continue and grow unchecked.  </P> <P> Freedom of speech is an important right, but when it cost the lives of women  and children, it is in direct contradiction with the basic values of our  democracy. We recognize this conflict when we disallow child pornography and  violent pornography.  </P> <P> Democracy was never meant to be anybody's Hell. Our Founding Fathers sought to  protect freedom of religion and political expression. We are not fools to  believe that any of them would have continued "American Psycho." They could  hardly have dreamed of such a work and would have relegated it to the rank of  obscenity.  </P> <P> Since we live in a democracy, we have the right to demand change. We can do  this through boycotts and via the political process. The purpose of a democracy  is to create a society in which people can live in peace and happiness.  </P> <P> Texts like "American Psycho" create injustice and harm, and we have every right  to oppose them, even to destroy them. Such is the reality and function of  democracy; and it is right, because it creates the most happiness and peace for  all, especially for women and children.  </P> <P> RICHARD PROCIDA  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> People Against Pornography  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO OPERA OFFERS 'SATYAGRAHA'  </P> <P> Nine years after its world premiere in Rotterdam, and following U.S. stagings  in New York, Chicago and Seattle, Philip Glass' controversial and haunting  "Satyagraha" finally reached California this week, courtesy of San Francisco  Opera.  </P> <P> David Pountney's original production (re-staged here by Harry Silverstein) and  Robert Israel's designs occupy the War Memorial Opera House handsomely. The  performance, conducted once again by Bruce Ferden, puts across Glass' extended  meditation on the life of Mohandas K. Gandhi in an aura of compelling visual  and musical images.  </P> <P> Though written for conventional, non-amplified musical forces -- soloists, a  large chorus and an orchestra without brass or percussion -- Glass' second  opera eschews the standard operatic devices of arias, duets and set pieces.  </P> <P> Each of the seven scenes is musically self-contained and usually constructed as  a self-repeating passacaglia. With shifts of accent and new texts, each piece  accumulates tension or force as it proceeds. The description is simple; in  practice, the work unfolds as emotionally colorful and harmonically varied.  </P> <P> Glass' critics say his palate is limited and his musical materials minimal.  Perhaps so, yet the contrasts in this three-act, three-hour opera are many, and  effective. In a score in which endless repetition can occur within small  sections, the larger structures achieve integrity and uniqueness through  separateness of thought and strict architectonic boundaries.  </P> <P> For example: The opening scene, wherein the modality of restless F-minor is  explored thoroughly, gives way to an extended section (the Farm Scene) probing  gentle C-major. When the act moves on to its finale, the brightness of the  B-flat scale bursts forth freshly. Armed with no more than a capsule summary of  the action of each scene, the observer finds the actual dramatic content in the  interaction between words and notes -- the vowel-rich, warm and open Sanskrit  language combined with Glass' grateful vocal lines.  </P> <P> No supertitles were used at this performance. Nor were any needed.  </P> <P> This set of five performances -- (the run ends on Sunday) brings together  veterans of the world premiere with enthusiastic local forces.  </P> <P> On Monday night, Ferden conducted a pointed but spacious musical performance,  savoring details but keeping the longer line in view. His energetic orchestra  played keenly, yet never covered the singers. The 61-voice chorus sang and  moved gamely, though vocally it was undernourished and poorly blended.  </P> <P> The principals sounded tired. But they sang spiritedly. Douglas Perry, who  created the role of Gandhi in 1980, still explores its beauties with  sensitivity and grace. He was seconded neatly by the male soloists: LeRoy  Villanueva, Dale Travis, Victor Ledbetter and Philip Skinner. The women --  Claudia Cumming, Ann Panagulias, Catherine Keen and Emily Manhart -- performed  less resonantly, though reliably.  </P></p>

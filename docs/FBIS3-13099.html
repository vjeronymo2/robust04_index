			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following review of the 4 March  issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Popular, Student Demonstrations Condemn Hebron Massacre    2. Lawyers Association, Professional Unions Urge Boycott,  Reject    Normalization    3. Information Says IDF Chiefs Preplanned Massacre    4. Islamic Group Claims Operations To Avenge Massacre    5. Party Secretary Expects Islamic Victory Against  Injustice,    Rulers' Corruption  <H5>  POPULAR, STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS CONDEMN HEBRON MASSACRE </H5>   The 4 March edition of AL-SHA'B, mouthpiece of the  opposition  Labor Party, is almost entirely devoted to local reaction to the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    A 1,000-word report on page 1 by 'Abd-al-Rahman Isma'il and  Mu'tazz al-Hadidi gives a detailed account of the "massive  demonstration" involving tens of thousands of members of the  Islamic current in al-Tahrir Square in central Cairo on 3 March.  The report notes that demonstrators burned the Israeli flag,  condemned the "Zionists," called on the government to expel the  Israeli ambassador, close the Embassy, and abrogate the Camp  David Accord, and urged Arab rulers to stop dealing with  "Zionists." The report also notes that demonstrators hurled  stones at the police, who were ordered to "fire live and rubber  bullets and tear gas to disperse demonstrators." The security  forces arrested hundreds and attacked citizens brutally with  clubs, according to the report.    Under the headline "Week of Anger in Egypt," a page 2  feature  carries several reports on popular and student demonstrations  and rallies criticizing the "slack Egyptian and Arab official  stance on the Hebron massacre," and calling for closing the  "Zionist" embassy.    A feature entitled "Revenge on the Zionists Is a pan-Arab  and  Islamic Duty" appears on pages 4-5, including more reports of a  week of demonstrations at the universities of Cairo, Alexandria,  'Ayn Shams, al-Azhar, and Hulwan and several other reports about  popular rallies to support the massacre victims and denounce  such crimes.  <H5>  LAWYERS ASSOCIATION, PROFESSIONAL UNIONS URGE BOYCOTT, REJECT </H5>   NORMALIZATION    On page 11, the paper publishes a boxed 150-word "statement  by the Lawyers Association," which calls on Arab and Islamic  states to "adopt a unified stance and demand international  protection for the Palestinian people." The statement calls on  Arab states to withdraw from the peace talks now that the  incident has uncovered "the aggressive nature of the Israeli  Government and people and proved that Israel is not serious  about seeking peace." The statement also appeals to Arab and  Islamic states to "stand firmly against the normalization  process with Israel and to stop all kinds of dealings with it."    Page 12 features a framed 200-word statement by "The  coordination Committee of the Egyptian Professional Unions,"  which urges Arab and Islamic states to "maintain the full  boycott of the usurping Zionist enemy" and "reject all forms of  normalization." The statement calls on the Egyptian Government  to "expel the Zionist ambassador and close the embassy of the  criminal Jews." It calls on the PLO and Arab governments to  withdraw immediately from the "farcical talks that are led by  the United States, the major supporter of Zionist terrorism."  <H5>  INFORMATION SAYS IDF CHIEFS PLANNED MASSACRE </H5>   A 200-word report by Mahmud Bakri on page 3 cites  "information" obtained by the paper that Israeli Army chiefs  planned the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.  <H5>  ISLAMIC GROUP CLAIMS OPERATIONS TO AVENGE MASSACRE </H5>    A 100-word report on page 7 cites an Islamic Group statement  claiming responsibility for detonations in retaliation for the  Hebron massacre.   <H3>    PARTY SECRETARY EXPECTS ISLAMIC  VICTORY AGAINST INJUSTICE, RULERS' CORRUPTION </H3>   In a 4,000-word article on page 2, Labor Party Secretary  General 'Adil Husayn writes that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre  is a warning to every Arab and Muslim that "Israel does not  develop missiles and nuclear bombs to use against Palestinians  in the territories, but to threaten the Arab nation,  particularly Egypt, if they dare disobey the orders or raise  their heads in pride."    Addressing the United States, Husayn says: "We will not be  fooled by your denunciations, even if the Security Council  issues a strongly worded resolution condemning the enemy (it  will not do), because words are no longer enough." He warns  "our corrupt rulers" that the United States will not save them  if the masses decide to punish and overthrow them, noting that  popular demonstrations prove that "Egypt will not lead the march  of capitulation" and that it will continue to be "the fort of  the Arabs and Muslims."    Husayn refutes the view that the world has joined forces  against Islam and Muslims because, according to him, that view  prevailed "in the first spell of dizziness after the sudden,  thunderous collapse of the Soviet bloc." Things are different  today and will keep changing daily, because yesterday's allies  of the Western bloc are no longer a bloc, he says. He contends  that Europe is breaking away from the United States, thus  speeding up NATO's collapse; that an economic war is raging  between the United States and Japan; that China is becoming a  great economic power and enhancing its nuclear power; that India  is developing militarily and economically; and that Russia will  not be in chaos forever and that its crises might prompt it to  take a more hostile attitude toward the United States. He  concludes that the American dream of power has been shattered.    He maintains that of all regions, the Arab region is the one  surrounded by the Americans, who want to display their might and  support the Zionist expansionist plan. He attributes this  desire to God almighty's will ruling that "oil will be an  Islamic product." Apart from Venezuela, all OPEC states are  Muslim. Major non-OPEC reserves are in Somalia and the Muslim  republics that belonged to the Soviet Union. And Chinese oil is  concentrated in a region inhabited by Muslims, he explains.  Admitting that oil is a vital strategic product and that  whoever controls its output can control the world, he says that  the Islamic states' monopoly of oil can turn them into a very  influential political power. That is why major states try to  avert this eventuality. The United States wants to monopolize  Arab oil to control Europe and Japan's supply and thus subjugate  these states as it pillages Arab wealth, Husayn claims. With  oil, we can join the ranks of major states and mobilize billions  of oppressed people for the Islamic awakening, he says.    Claiming the existence of a battle between Islam as a  religion and civilization and the secularist, materialist West,  Husayn says that Islam is "the right alternative, maintaining  the balance between the materialist and the immaterialist and  providing the solution for all mankind's suffering under Western  control."    Reminding readers of the establishment of the Islamic state  in Iran and Sudan, of Iraq's "steady development into a regime  that is fully bound by Islamic shari'ah," and of events in  Algeria, he says he sees a "belt of struggling Islamic states  extending from the Arab Maghreb to Sudan and Somalia, then to  Iraq and Iran, at the core of the Gulf and its oil." He notes  that the "Islamic states' belt will not relinquish Palestine or  Jerusalem once it expands."    Turning to Egypt, Husayn asserts that the people are  fighting  courageously under the Islamic banner. "Despite years of  misleading campaigns, the youths have proven in their recent  rallies and demonstrations that they firmly reject plans of  capitulation to the U.S.-Zionist alliance," he says. He adds:  "The coming stage will witness an escalation of rejection and  resistance."    Addressing the ruling group, he states that the masses will  not be deceived by the denunciation of the crime in the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque. He assails the leadership, asking: What  use is denunciation when it was you who led us to the current  state? "We will not denounce with statements, but with  organized action that removes you from your posts so that a new  faithful, courageous, and clean government can rise and join the  mujahidin in the Arab and Muslim nation," he says, adding: This  will happen when we wrestle our right to hold free elections  that will bring you down.</p>

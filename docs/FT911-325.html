			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Board changes at Conder MR CHRISTOPHER Stewart Smith is resigning as chairman of Conder, the Winchester-based construction and property group which last month announced it had fallen deeply into loss in 1990. Mr Michael Pelham, managing director, also plans to resign from the board at the annual meeting next month. Mr Stewart Smith, a former director of P&amp;O who took over as chairman of Conder in 1987, is to remain as a director until a replacement non-executive chairman is appointed. Mr Alan Lovell, finance director, takes over as acting chief executive. The shares closed 3p lower on Friday at 46p. Last month, Conder said it had been driven into a 1990 pre-tax loss of Pounds 19.29m. Losses on curtain walling contracts for two City office developments were at the heart of the fall. That came after a strong performance in 1989 when pre-tax profits soared by 67 per cent to Pounds 10.42m. Heavily geared at the last year-end, Conder has since sharply reduced borrowings with the sale of properties and a forecourt services business.</p>

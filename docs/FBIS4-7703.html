			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 4 (TANJUG) -- Croatia will sell out  cheaply at least 20,000 apartments, summer homes and other  facilities worth over three billion U.S. dollars, whose owners  are nationals of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the  president of the Association for the Equitable Treatment and  Protection of the Property of Yugoslav Citizens, Mirko Lalovic,  said on Monday.    That such a sale will take place is also evident from the  fact that the Croatian Fund for Privatization announced in March  the placing on sale of 18 holiday complexes, which are the  property of firms from Serbia and Montenegro (federal units of  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), the president of the  Belgrade Association told TANJUG.    Croatia has usurped the facilities, following its forcible  secession from the former Yugoslav Federation in 1991 under the  pretext that they were public property and has entered them into  the land register as state property.    In order to usurp the private property of FRY nationals,  Croatia introduced an exorbitant tax on the private property of  non-Croatian nationals, 15 German marks per square meter  annually.    The same tax for Croatian nationals is 3.75 marks, proving  that it was a well thought out plan to coerce property owners  from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to give away or sell  them to Croatians at bargain price.    Since payment operations between Croatia and the Federal  Repubic of Yugoslavia is non-existant, citizens from Serbia and  Montenegro, Republics making up the Yugoslav Federation, are not  able to pay their taxes.    The Croatian legislator has thus provided, when  indedebtedness exceeds a third of the value of the taxed  property, for selling it. The beneficiary will be the state.  This will happen soon due to the accumulated interest (two  percent daily), so that summer homes, houses, apartments and  other facilities, property of FRY nationals have already been  put on sale, Lalovic said.    Such an usurpation of assets contributes to the creation of  an ethnically clean Croatia, because Serbs and Montenegrans will  lose their properties in that republic, thus denying them the  right to return once relations are normalized, he added.    Stressing that the Croation attitude towards real estate  owners from Serbia and Montenegro is unprecedented in  international law, Lalovic added that they acquired the property  at the time when Croatia was part of the former Yugoslavia,  which means under the same conditions as Croats have so that  they should be treated equally, regardless of the fact that in  the meantime they have become foreigners.    The usurpation of property in Croatia has been recordered by  over 16,000 Yugoslav nationals.    It is assessed however that 25 to 30 percent of owners have  not done so, expecting that the situation will sort itself out,  so that it is certain that the total value of properties exceeds  three billion dollars, Lalovic said in conclusion.</p>

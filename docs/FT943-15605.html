			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): New lease of life for smartcards The life span of banking smartcards is to be extended with the introduction of a smartcard chip which uses re-programmable memory cells. Smartcards are increasingly used as credit and debit cards in order to cut down fraud. But currently banks are forced to re-issue the cards regularly to frequent users, because they cease to function once their memory capacity has been exhausted. The new card, which has been been devised by Schlumberger and Texas Instruments, is based on re-programmable EEPROM memory cells. These allows the chip to store about 160 transactions in a sequential file. Once the card reaches this capacity, it automatically creates more capacity by deleting the oldest record. Schlumberger, which will put the card into commercial production later this year, believes the longer life of the card will substantially cut down banks' issuing costs. It will also offer issuers the chance to get more information about their customers' purchasing patterns, because the chip's transaction memory will be accessible.

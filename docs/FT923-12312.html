			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Carlton raises Pounds 64m via bonds CARLTON Communications, the media group which holds the London regional television licence, has raised Pounds 64.25m from a convertible bond issue. The bonds carry interest of 7 1/2 per cent, payable semi-annually, against a yield on the shares of about 3.2 per cent. Goldman Sachs, which lead managed the issue, priced it on the basis that Carlton would deliver annual dividend growth of about 12 per cent. Bond holders have the right to convert into Carlton shares at 696p, a 16 per cent premium over the 600p share price when the issue was priced. On full conversion Carlton's capital would be increased by just under 5 per cent, the level at which existing holders must be offered pre-emption rights under guidelines issued by institutional investors. The lead manager said the issue was considered aggressively priced by many UK fund managers and some 70 per cent was sold to continental European investors. Carlton said the proceeds will be used to fund small acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. This is the first convertible issue by a UK company since Thames Water launched an Pounds 80m deal last August. However, bankers said the heavy supply of rights issues and flotations was leading more companies to consider convertibles as a means of raising long-term equity-linked finance.</p>

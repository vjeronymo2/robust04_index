			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TASK FORCE OUTLINES BENEFITS OF DIVIDING L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT  </P> <P> Dividing the Los Angeles Unified School District into at least eight and as  many as 49 smaller districts will improve academic performance and reduce the  number of dropouts, according to a report issued Wednesday by a task force  formed to study ways to break up the district.  </P> <P> The report shows that the present 610,000-student district is "incapable of  addressing the legitimate education needs of Los Angeles-area students," said  Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge), a longtime advocate of  breaking up the district, who formed the task force.  </P> <P> But two of the seven members appointed to serve on the Los Angeles Task Force  for Better Education said that despite the report's conclusions, they have not  seen enough evidence to show that dividing the district would cure the many  ills plaguing the schools.  </P> <P> "No one can isolate the size of the district and say that is causing all the  problems," said task force member Richard C. Williams, a professor of education  at UCLA and director of the Corrine A. Seeds University Elementary School.  "Gangs, poverty and immigration are issues that have to be taken into account."  </P> <P> Williams said that although the testimony presented during the four hearings  held by the La Follette task force was compelling, it was largely the opinions  of parents and teachers unhappy with the way they have been treated by district  officials. No school district personnel testified during the hearings held over  the past eight months.  </P> <P> "Much of what we heard was anecdotal evidence," Williams said. "This is not a  study. This is an invitation to dance."  </P> <P> Both Williams and task force member Leo Krzywkowski, associate dean of  education at Cal State Northridge, said they heard enough testimony to support  a detailed study of the effects of breaking up the Los Angeles school district.  </P> <P> "It presents a strong argument for looking at the issue," Krzywkowski said.  "But this is not a research paper."  </P> <P> The state Board of Education today begins hearings in Sacramento to decide  whether a $250,000 study by the Los Angeles County Commission on School  District Organization is warranted. Gov. George Deukmejian has included money  for the study in his proposed budget.  </P> <P> Dauna Packer, a parent and former school board candidate for the west San  Fernando Valley, said a group known as United Parents of Los Angeles has sent  the state board more than 4,000 letters during the past week supporting the  study.  </P> <P> If money for the county study is included in the final state budget and a study  is completed, then voters living within the boundaries of the 708-square-mile  school district would decide the issue, probably in three years, La Follette  said.  </P> <P> La Follette said questions of how to divide students, property and debt of the  Los Angeles district would have to be answered by consultants hired by the  county Commission on School District Organization. La Follette, who is leaving  office after her term expires in December, said she did not know how much it  would cost taxpayers to split up the district.  </P> <P> La Follette said student performance would improve in smaller districts because  locally elected board members would be more likely to listen to suggestions by  parents.  </P> <P> Los Angeles school district officials have said attempts to break up the  district probably would face a legal challenge on the grounds that such a plan  would create more segregated school districts.  </P> <P> Los Angeles school board President Jackie Goldberg criticized La Follette for  the task force report and said more state money is needed for education.  </P> <P> "It's a crime that California ranks 30th among the states in spending on  education," Goldberg said. "There is nothing to be gained by dividing up the  district. It isn't going to change any of our problems."  </P> <P> United Teachers-Los Angeles President-elect Helen Bernstein said the district's  current efforts at school-based management are a better way to give parents and  teachers more say in running neighborhood schools than breaking up the  district. UTLA has a membership of 26,000 teachers in the Los Angeles district.  </P> <P> La Follette, who has served five terms in the Assembly, has made several  unsuccessful attempts in past years to interest colleagues in legislation to  break up the Los Angeles school district.  </P> <P> The other members of the task force were Bernard James of Pepperdine University  School of Law; Ray Johnson, Inglewood chief of police; Edward W. Lee of the  Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Los Angeles, and Ronald D. Stephens,  director of the National School Safety Center in Encino. Jane Boeckmann,  president of World Communications Inc., was also a member but did not attend  any hearings, La Follette staff members said.  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan, while governor in 1970, vetoed a bill aimed at  breaking up the Los Angeles school district, saying the measure would hamper  efforts at the time to divide the district into administrative regions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> Hearings begin today in Sacramento to decide whether a $250,000 study of a  school district breakup is warranted. If money is included in the state budget  and a study is completed, then voters living within the boundaries of the  708-square-mile school district would decide the issue, probably in three years  after consultants submit recommendations on how to divide students, property  and debt.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jack Cheevers contributed to this story.  </P></p>

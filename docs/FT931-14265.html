			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (12): A house with glass walls / A look at the development of industrial and competition policy 'The intellectual father of the single market, Lord Cockfield, once said that if all had known how much more competition the single market would result in, European industry and, surely, European governments would have been against it' - Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner. FOR THOSE who believe that Europe should have an industrial policy, the beauty of the single market is that it represents such a policy in itself. In a unified market, runs the argument, companies can no longer hide their inefficiencies behind national barriers. Forced to operate on a truly competitive European stage, they thus enter a Darwinian process which produces regional champions capable of taking on the world's finest. There will, of course, be casualties along the way. But, runs the argument, there should be at least as many winners as losers. The removal of trade barriers is in itself an important stimulus to economic growth, which will - in theory - make good any damage suffered by industry as a whole through increased competition. However persuasive this argument, it suffers in the short term from two serious snags. First, far from enjoying immediate economic growth, the single market starts life in a fairly severe recession. It is unusually hard to be sure how long this will last or how severe it will prove, if only because it is partly due to the one-off effects of German unification. Second, some of Europe's basic industries - steel in particular - are suffering the effects of the wider structural change in eastern Europe. It is again hard to be sure how long the influx of cheap manufactured commodities from the east will last. But there is room for pessimism. If a steel mill or petrochemical plant is not going to be replaced, it can be run purely for cash rather than profit. This is a particularly attractive option if the cash comes in the form of much-needed hard currency and the plant is relied upon for holding a community together. Additionally, the single market will have the effect of exposing industry to greater competition from the industrial giants of the US and Japan. So it is not hard to see why it is viewed with mixed feelings by some European industrialists. In many cases, the net result is bound to be a competitive squeeze on profit margins. This raises the immediate question whether overheads and manning levels need to be squeezed as well. This may be happening already. By the end of last year, the list of multinationals announcing large-scale job cuts in Europe was lengthening ominously. Part of this, however, was a conventional reaction to recession. Furthermore, job losses in the European car industry, for instance, must be seen in the context of continued controls on Japanese car imports until the year 2000. Again, the 12,000 European job losses announced last month by IBM are a reminder that at least some European markets were exposed to the full force of international competition all along. But there seems little doubt that as companies integrate their production around Europe - whether to take advantage of the single market or to protect themselves from its pressures - systematic job losses will result. The result, Mr Percy Barnevik, president of the engineering giant ABB, told the FT earlier this month, could be a shake-out of labour comparable to that seen in agriculture earlier this century. Another element of industrial restructuring is to be expected as well. Mergers and joint ventures in European industry are by no means new: they are a consequence of industrial globalisation. But they are also a logical response to the challenges brought by the single market. It is not easy to specify the extent to which these mergers have been due to the single market. The European food industry, for instance, has seen a particularly high level of takeover and merger in recent years, with multinationals such as Unilever, Nestle and BSN increasing their dominance, and mere national players looking increasingly vulnerable. But this is largely the result of developments within the industry itself, such as the increased readiness of consumers to sample foreign food. It is worth remembering that some of Europe's most important markets are not much affected by the single market. The pharmaceutical industry still has to satisfy the medical authorities in each EC country separately before it can sell new drugs. Airlines are still greatly restricted on the routes they can fly within the EC. Car-makers' protection from the Japanese will last until the end of the century. The steel industry is still protected and subsidised in many EC countries. But in the long run, there is no doubt of the implications for industrial structure. The domestic market for individual European companies is becoming inexorably bigger. Another powerful stimulus for change comes through the gradual opening up of government contracts to competitive tender from companies from other EC countries. European industry is bound to respond by becoming leaner and larger. One of the most important determinants will be EC competition policy. Sir Leon Brittan, head of the competition directorate until the end of last year, was seen as a champion of the British preference for unfettered competition. His successor, the Belgian socialist Mr Karel Van Miert, may come under greater pressure to promote a more French-style industrial policy, perhaps favouring regional champions through merger and acquisition. Certainly, if the worst fears about the risks of the single market are realised, the clamour from Europe's industrialists for a more interventionist approach on restructuring can only become louder.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         THE TOP TEN EUROPEAN COMPANIES BY MARKET CAPITALISATION                          ON SEPTEMBER 30 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Ranking                                      Market 1992  1991  Company            Country        Capital dollars m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    1     1  Royal Dutch/Shell     N-UK        76049.7    2     3  Glaxo Holdings          UK        38315.5    3     2  BT                      UK        35909.7    4     5  Unilever plc/NV       N-UK        31589.6    5     8  Nestle                 SWI        27918.6    6    18  Roche Holding          SWI        25018.2    7     6  Allianz Holding        GER        22570.7    8     9  Siemens                GER        21269.0    9    15  BAT Industries          UK        20520.9   10    12  Deutsche Bank          GER        20329.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Turnover dollars m 1992  1991  Company            Sector   This Year    Last Year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    1     1  Royal Dutch/Shell     212     95999.0    98192.0    2     3  Glaxo Holdings        433      6769.1     5613.9    3     2  BT                    223     22041.0    21738.6    4     5  Unilever plc/NV       451     38279.6    37570.6    5     8  Nestle                451     38270.2    35149.3    6    18  Roche Holding         622      8680.3     7330.2    7     6  Allianz Holding       151         0.0        0.0    8     9  Siemens               541     49130.8    42520.1    9    15  BAT Industries        171     22834.2    24833.9   10    12  Deutsche Bank         112         0.0        0.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              per cent           Profit  dollars m 1992  1991  Company            Change   This Year    Last Year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    1     1  Royal Dutch/Shell    -2.2      8990.2      13044.1    2     3  Glaxo Holdings       20.6      2358.3       2120.3    3     2  BT                    1.4      5078.5       5081.8    4     5  Unilever plc/NV       1.9      2961.5       2945.0    5     8  Nestle                8.9      3194.4       2726.7    6    18  Roche Holding        18.4      1544.1        724.7    7     6  Allianz Holding       0.0      1200.5       1306.9    8     9  Siemens              15.5      2300.7       1899.8    9    15  BAT Industries       -8.1      1735.3       1591.5   10    12  Deutsche Bank         0.0      2281.3       1585.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              per cent                        Year 1992  1991  Company            Change   ROCE   employees  Ending  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    1     1  Royal Dutch/Shell   -31.1      15.2      135000  31/12/91    2     3  Glaxo Holdings       11.2      37.8       37083  30/06/92    3     2  BT                   -0.1      24.8      219000  31/03/92    4     5  Unilever plc/NV       0.6      28.1      298000  31/12/91    5     8  Nestle               17.2        25      201139  31/12/91    6    18  Roche Holding       113.1      13.5       55134  31/12/91    7     6  Allianz Holding      -8.1         0       73300  31/12/91    8     9  Siemens              21.1       8.2      402000  30/09/91    9    15  BAT Industries        9.0       6.1      212316  31/12/91   10    12  Deutsche Bank        43.9      20.8       71400  31/12/91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

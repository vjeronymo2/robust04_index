			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Confusion in Haiti US troops are on the ground in Haiti, and to the relief of all concerned, so far hardly a shot has been fired in anger. Welcome too was yesterday's endorsement by exiled Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide of the weekend accord brokered by former President Jimmy Carter that allowed the peaceful entry of US forces. Following a visit to the Pentagon, Mr Aristide now appears confident that he will return to his country within 24 days and is setting about forming a government. But Mr Aristide's endorsement of the Carter accord does not silence the many questions that remain. As Mr Aristide indicated yesterday, its ultimate success will depend on the successful disarmament of Haiti's armed forces. That task has only just begun. Mr Aristide needs to be sure that the US does not abandon what would have been one of its objectives had it invaded: to purge and professionalise the police and armed forces. Unless the apparatus of intimidation and terror that was responsible for his exile is dismantled, Mr Aristide would not be able to govern even if he returns. Once US troops were back home, he would again be under threat of a military coup. The deal brokered by Mr Carter specifies that 'certain military officers' would enter 'an early and honourable retirement when a general amnesty is voted into law by the Haitian parliament, or October 15 1994, whichever is earlier'. That is too vague for complete comfort. It was Lt Gen Raoul Cedras and his fellow generals who reneged on a deal signed under UN auspices that would have returned Mr Aristide to Haiti last October. Until the weekend, his junta was held responsible for such dreadful human rights abuses that Mr Clinton came to the brink of ordering an invasion. Days later, they were described by members of Mr Carter's negotiating team as honourable men and patriots. US troops were also, to the frustration of some, ordered to stand by while policemen attacked pro-Aristide demonstrators in Port-au-Prince. Furthermore, the Haitian police are apparently now expected to disarm the Haitian army. And the army - the ostensible target of an American invasion - is guiding the US forces to their positions around the country. All this may be the consequence of tactical decisions based on the changing circumstances. Whether this is the case, or there has been a shift in US strategy, will only be clear in time. Last night the US armed forces were permitted to intervene to prevent human rights abuses and Mr Aristide has, it seems, accepted the need to be patient. In avoiding an invasion, Mr Clinton has bought relief from his congressional critics. But to resolve the problems that last week made an invasion seem inevitable, he must act decisively, in particular to ensure the armed forces will be unable to prevent Mr Aristide from exercising his democratic mandate. That will mean the US military adopting a more active, and therefore more risky, role than they have assumed so far.</p>

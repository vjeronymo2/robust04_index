			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Books: Campaign of love and loathing - A his'n'hers account of the presidential race ALL'S FAIR: LOVE, WAR AND RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT by Mary Matalin and James Carville, with Peter Knobler Hutchinson Pounds 19.99, 493 pages Gore Vidal still has the wonderful knack of hitting the nail on the head. All's Fair, he wrote in the New York Times, 'is a him-and-her comedy worthy of early Hepburn and Tracy.' The only question, with that incomparable film couple no longer available, is who gets to play Mary and James; his suggestion - and not a bad one - is Susan Sarandon and John Malkovich. Even by political standards, it might be a messy movie to make, because of its lack of good and bad guys, happy or sad endings and clear-cut plot lines (nothing could be that clear in 1992 with Ross Perot jumping up and down every other month). But Mary Matalin and James Carville, with the assistance of very professional writing help, have managed to produce a book mostly about the 1992 presidential campaign and somewhat about their own love affair that satisfies political junkies without ever becoming maudlin or excessively self-congratulatory. She is the Chicago native of Croatian descent, who converts to conservatism early and rises steadily in the Republican party political apparatus to the position of political director and deputy campaign chief for George Bush. She has a temper and a tongue and is now, naturally, a TV talk show host. He is the 'ragin' Cajun' from Carville, Louisiana, sometime drop-out, sometime Marine and sometime lawyer who had managed many more losing campaigns than he had won until Pennsylvania, 1991, when he directed his Senate candidate from a 47 point deficit to a ten point win over a very well known Republican former governor. That brought him to Bill Clinton's attention and, eventually, to the position of manager of the Democratic presidential campaign. He has a temper and a tongue and is much in demand on the talking head circuit, when not advising Clinton and too many other candidates to mention. Naturally they fell in love, sustained it throughout the campaign, mostly by rarely seeing each other but talking almost every night, and were married last year. She is a visceral Republican, he a dyed-in-the wool Democrat, she was emotional about Bush and he about Bill and Hillary and both freely confess to loathing the other's party. James writes, charitably, 'I always say I want the people I'm running against to catch the clap and die.' The personal likes and dislikes of both - more in her case than his - keep the book going. Mary's admiration for Lee Atwater, the 1988 Republican attack dog strategist who died of a brain tumour in 1991, is absolute, as is her contempt for John Sununu, former New Hampshire Governor and Bush's White House chief of staff until the end of 1991 ('the political acumen of a doorknob.') Both are contemptuous of the press operating as a pack, regardless of their fondness for individual hacks. James says it takes the assembled heavies three minutes after an event to decide what is 'the story . . . once the collective mind is made up it will not change . . . history gets created in three minutes; don't miss it; if you get there late, you're dead.' He is not wrong, and not only in the US. Working in the thick of a presidential campaign is mostly mechanical, often off-the-cuff, and leavened, or sullied, by reactive dirty work. Mary is delighted when finally the Bushies take aim below Clinton's belt, to which she adds with a series of vicious attack faxes to the media, for which she is unrepentant. James is generally more forgiving. After all, it was his slogan - 'it's the economy, stupid' - that in the end made Clinton president, and he is still a political consultant. The confection of the book, alternating monologues, sometimes faux-conversations, arranged roughly chronologically, works better than it sounds. There may have been - and will be - more profound books on the 1992 campaign, but this has an honest ring. No more so than when James writes 'so little of this stuff is contrived and so much accidental. So little of it is Machiavellian and so much is actually human.' And it produces a president.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLASH FORWARD;  </P> <P> FASHION: L.A. PREVIEW SHOW OF SPRING LOOKS EXPANDS ITS VISION BEYOND THE  CLOTHING INDUSTRY FOR A PEEK AT SOME RELATED FIELDS.  </P> <P> Lookwest '91 began as a plan to augment the well-established, annual  presentation of Los Angeles fashion designers' spring collections. But, typical  of this city's erratic fashion industry, it became the only preview of the  season.  </P> <P> This is something like replacing a week's episode of "The Cosby Show" with 10  minutes of home videos about the TV series' producers. It's not the same as  seeing a "Cosby.' But judged on its own merit it might turn out to be quite  impressive -- as Lookwest did.  </P> <P> Sponsored by Los Angeles members of Fashion Group International -- a business  network for women in the industry -- Monday night's event went well beyond the  typical fashion show to explore photography, food, fine and graphic art,  architecture, advertising, beauty and the entertainment industry, as well as  clothing design. It was an effort to explore how these worlds relate and how  Southern California is the raw material that inspires them all.  </P> <P> The fashion segments included as few as one, and seldom more than six outfits  by any one designer, and did not supply anything close to full coverage of the  local fashion market. But the show did capture the eclectic assortment of  youthful, playful, and often costume-like clothes the world looks to this city  to supply. And the range of designers -- from the very well-established Bob  Mackie, Nolan Miller, Georges Marciano for Guess and Robin Piccone for Body  Glove, to newcomers Eddie Lowrie, Arrastia and Ofelia -- offered the most  comprehensive capsule view yet of what Los Angeles fashion is all about.  </P> <P> The complex presentation cut from videotaped street scenes of ethnic  neighborhoods to live fashion showings to taped interviews with leaders in the  designated fields.  </P> <P> The fashion segments featured about 100 designers, whose spring '91 styles  worked into certain categories chosen to reflect aspects of Los Angeles: "Wheel  City," "Cross Culture," "Hollywood" and so on. In a more democratic show, this  would never do, since no designer's complete idea about fashion's next  direction was fully represented. But the Fashion Group never pretended this was  an objective or encompassing show, and that was their prerogative.  </P> <P> Maggy Barry and Stephen Walker for Van Buren were among the best represented  designers, with a number of '60s-inspired slip dresses and body-gripping  unitards appliqued with leather and sequined peace symbols and flowers, as well  as an assortment of leather jackets and pants covered with stars and stripes,  during the "Wheel City" segment of the show.  </P> <P> Kevan Hall's evening wear was younger spirited than usual. His long dinner  jacket mixed natural linen with iridescent silk and topped a brief, chiffon  swing skirt. A short, tangerine-colored chiffon dress with illusion sleeves had  a kicky, '60s tent-dress feel to it, seen in the Hollywood segment.  </P> <P> Christine Albers showed fresh and energetic white bodysuits cropped at  mid-thigh and topped by full cut, navy cardigan jackets of the same length  during the "Solar Action" segment.  </P> <P> Rosemary Brantley's crisp silk patio outfits included a glamorous,  fuchsia-color bathrobe dress over short shorts, for "L.A. Spectrum," a segment  about the colors of the city. From Michael Hoban of North Beach Leather, bright  color bomber jackets were appliqued with traffic signs or "Highway 101" road  markers.  </P> <P> The latest from Body Glove beach wear was a silver neoprene fencing jacket  covering a black Lycra romper cut to mid-thigh, with a halter top. Brenda  Welch's evening swim wear and after-swim wear included glitter-appliques on the  leg of crushed velvet capri pants or the center of a strapless bra top. For  Guess, Marciano branched out from a kicky little blue denim skort (a takeoff on  a tennis skirt) to what qualifies here, if nowhere else, as evening wear:  silver hot pants and a sheer, slate gray man-tailored shirt. Bob Mackie offered  several body-paving sequined evening gowns. In the true L.A. spirit, both he  and Marciano were part of the Hollywood segment.  </P> <P> Rather than try to articulate what fashion has to do with works by other  creative forces, the producers allowed videotapes to do the talking.  </P> <P> With wonderment, restaurateurs Wolfgang Puck and Barbara Lazaroff, best known  as creators of Spago, talked about bok choy, fresh corn and other produce  available here year-round. Artist David Hockney described his painterly  evolution from isolated cube forms to swirling line compositions as a result of  nothing more than a change in home address, from the flats of South Hollywood  to the curving landscape of the Hollywood Hills. Choreographer/singer Paula  Abdul described her early days as a typically unorthodox Los Angeles  entrepreneur, explaining that her mother was her first agent, posing as such  when Paramount Studios dug out then Laker Girl Abdul's home number from the  phone book and called inquiring about her day rate as a choreographer.  </P> <P> T-shirt clad, world-traveling fashion photographer Phillip Dixon remarked,  "There's all the sophistication you need (in this city), if you want to go find  it." Jay Chiat of Chiat/Day/Mojo Advertising, known for his sports  photography-inspired Nike ads, recalled how athletes dress in such ads and  noted, "A lot of fashion is either followed or generated by advertising." April  Greiman described her sophisticated method of making high-tech graphics and  said, "When I came to Los Angeles I was a little shocked by the lack of  culture. The lack of tradition. But the greatest weakness is the greatest  strength."  </P> <P> And architect Jon A. Jerde, who designed the new Fashion Institute of Design  &amp; Merchandising where a pre-show cocktail party was held, concluded: "There  is no L.A. It's a great eclectic collision."  </P> <P> The evening generated proceeds enough to finance fellowships in six categories:  Advertising (John Butler and Mike Shine), architecture (Julian Reid), fashion  photography (Christopher Reisig), fine art (Ian Falconer), graphic art (Lise  Mardon) and restaurants (Mike Payne, Anne and David Gingrass). An additional  $48,000 went to the Fashion Group's Rudi Gernreich Memorial Scholarship fund.  </P> <P> Patricia Fox and Paddy Calistro co-chaired the event, and James Watterson  produced the fashion show.  </P> <P> Pioneering spirit and overall success aside, the evening did have its problems,  from the most practical to the more earthmoving. Some 150 members of the press  attended the show, and many complained that they could not tell which designer  created which outfit, since the usual list in order of appearance, the "run of  show," was not supplied.  </P> <P> An ill-conceived segment on hairstyles and makeup would have worked better as a  video segment. Top stylists included Cristophe, Laurent Dufourg of the Jose  Eber salon, Lemaire, Aniko of Elle, and Mitsu and Mario of Joseph Martin. The  leading look was the short feather cut with high crown of the early '60s.  </P> <P> More disconcerting is the fate of the fall press week, which the California  Mart, a building in downtown L.A. where fashion designers lease show room  space, has traditionally sponsored. Several months ago, Mart official David  Morse announced there would be no press week this fall, suggesting first that  it might be incorporated into other Mart activities later, then canceling the  idea.  </P> <P> Among other repercussions, there will be no Designer of the Year, no Rising  Star, no Photographer of the Year awarded this season, which has helped  generate national business in the past. And designers will not get the national  press coverage they usually receive.  </P> <P> Whatever the future holds it will have to include a rethinking of how Los  Angeles collections are presented for review by retailers and the press.  </P></p>

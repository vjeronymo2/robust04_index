			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Britannia Group seeks Pounds 3.75m to fund acquisition of land BRITANNIA GROUP is raising Pounds 3.75m net by way of a 1-for-1 rights issue at 35p a share primarily to fund the acquisition of housebuilding land.

Britannia Homes, in its first full year of operation under the new management, showed a profit after interest of Pounds 277,000 on a turnover of Pounds 5.9m. Residential house sales were budgeted to rise substantially in the current year with unit sales completed in the half year up from 38 to 69. In July and August it completed a further 41 sales. Group turnover in the half year from continuing operations was Pounds 15.61m (Pounds 15.83m). Gross profit came to Pounds 878,000 (Pounds 1.64m) after land provisions of Pounds 750,000 (nil).

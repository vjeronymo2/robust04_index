			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan. 5 KYODO -- The European Union (EU)  has officially abolished discriminatory curbs adopted by some of  its member states against some import items from Japan, Japanese  Government sources in Brussels said Wednesday [5 January].    The 12-nation union agreed in December to scrap import  quotas  on 44 Japanese-made items imposed by France, Italy, Spain,  Portugal and Greece. The 44 items include cars, automotive  components, motorcycles, fruit juice and natural honey.    The import restrictions on about half of them had already  been dropped separately by the five countries, so the EU  decision affects 24 products which were still subject to  restrictions.    The sources said the EU also agreed to end discriminatory  treatment of imports from other members of the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and countries in Central and  Eastern Europe.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Business Radio plans to expand LONDON Business Radio, which has applied for a London commercial radio licence to broadcast a service aimed at business and industry, said yesterday it hoped to take the service to other UK cities. The consortium - made up of the GWR radio group, Reuters and Associated Newspapers - said it would apply in September for an AM licence in Manchester. Applications are likely next year for licences in Birmingham and Glasgow. The hopes of extending a radio service covering business, the City of London, industry and personal finance depend on the consortium winning an AM licence in London. London Business Radio is one of 48 applicants for eight licences in London and faces a direct rival in City Talk, a consortium put together by Mr Mike Bloomberg, the Wall Street entrepreneur with a growing role in the financial information business. Libel proceedings may arise from the hiring of Mr Charlie Cox as managing director of The London Radio Company, which is trying to displace LBC. Mr Cox, a former LBC executive, said yesterday he was taking legal advice on possible defamation proceedings over a press release issued by LBC about his leaving.</p>

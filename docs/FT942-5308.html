			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / The Pineau-Valencienne Affair: Schneider chief's arrest spotlights business ties - David Buchan looks at Franco-Belgian two-way investment Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne's detention in a Brussels prison has developed into an affair of enormous media and business interest in France and Belgium. But it has not so far caused a major political row between the two governments. Certainly, the Schneider chairman must have taken some satisfaction from having almost the entire French political and business establishment weigh in on his side. On hearing of his arrest 10 days ago, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur rang his Belgian counterpart, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, while Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, telephoned his opposite number, Mr Willy Claes. They got the same message in private that the Belgian press has been broadcasting in public: that Belgian justice is independent of government. Since that has not always been the case in France, it was perhaps a salutary reminder. Having assured themselves that Mr Pineau-Valencienne is not being ill-treated - he is getting meals from the French embassy and wearing his own suits, rather than prison-wear - the French authorities are now helping Belgian justice to run its course. Mr Jean-Claude Van Espen, the Belgian prosecuting magistrate investigating alleged Schneider irregularities in Belgium, got no answer to his first request on May 16 for judicial help from France. But last week Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, France's justice minister, belatedly pledged full co-operation to establish the truth. Last Wednesday a French judge and policemen helped their Belgian counterparts start to question Schneider executives and look for documents at the group's Paris headquarters as well as at Mr Pineau-Valencienne's suburban home. If the Schneider affair has gradually elicited more co-operation from France, in Belgium it has reawakened a certain animosity towards its large neighbour. This is particularly prevalent in the field of business. Extending beyond traditional Belgian complaints about French high-handedness, there is irritation, particularly in the Flemish community, about the activities of slick 'money men' from France. In Paris last March Mr Luc Van den Brande, head of the Flemish regional government, invited French companies with interests in Belgium to 'stop thinking about purely financial operations' and to start creating real jobs. His reprimand was exaggerated, because some French companies, such as Renault, have set up manufacturing plants in Belgium. But of 800 French-controlled subsidiaries in Belgium, employing 157,000 people, most resulted from takeovers in the financial sphere. By far the biggest was the 1988 takeover of Societe Generale de Belgique by the Suez financial group, which now controls 61 per cent of the giant Belgian holding company. Some of the French financial investment - such as the controlling stake by EMC, a French holding group, in the Tessenderlo chemical company - is in industry. There is a link between the two countries' biggest companies. Elf-Aquitaine, the French oil group, owns 5 per cent of Petrofina, Belgium's leading company in this sector, but the main ties are in banking and insurance. The French insurance groups Union des Assurances de Paris and Assurances Generales de France control Royale Belge and Assubel. The investment flow is by no means all one way. Belgian companies have some 350 subsidiaries in France, employing 37,000 people. They range from Solvay, the major Belgian chemical company, to the flourishing textile businesses of west Flanders that have expanded into northern France. In tending to reinforce their presence in Belgium through financial takeovers of existing Belgian enterprises, rather than setting up greenfield operations there, French companies have tended to forget about that often-awkward customer - the minority shareholder. 'This may be because Belgian legislation to protect rights of minority shareholders is fairly recent, though very similar to what has existed for longer in France,' says Mr Jean-Nicolas Caprasse of Deminor, a Brussels legal firm specialising in work for minority shareholders. The new Belgian law gives people owning 1 per cent of a company's shares, or BFr50m (Pounds 980,000) of the company's capital, the right to start legal proceedings for an investigation into the company. Deminor acted for minority shareholders in Wagons-Lits, the Belgian travel group, who felt they were unfairly treated when Accor, the French hotel group, took it over in 1991. Belgium started to put legislation to protect minority shareholders into place only in 1989, after the Societe Generale de Belgique saga, and completed the job in 1991. For its part, the French business community has closed ranks in rallying to Mr Pineau-Valencienne's defence. 'Imagine that a policeman from a French village committed a certain offence and Mr (Charles) Pasqua (the interior minister) was arrested for five days while the affair was studied,' said Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, expressing a common reaction. The Belgian affair has underlined French companies' particular sensitivities about allegations of malpractice, following revelations of a series of examples of corruption in the last two or three years, including those of companies involved in illicit political financing. Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a crusading French magistrate who is running in the European Parliament elections, has just published a 40-page booklet alleging widespread corruption in French political and business life. Mr Jean-Pierre has stopped short of giving specific details into his allegations of corruption in areas ranging from party financing and export commissions to football and motor racing. But there is a growing nervousness in France that he, or someone else, may soon provide them. See leader page</p>

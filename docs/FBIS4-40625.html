			<p>BFN     [Text] Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  (LDPR) Vladimir Zhirinovskiy sharply criticized the decision of  the State Duma to transfer to the mandate commission the appeal  of acting Prosecutor General Aleksey Ilyushenko asking for the  consent of the Duma for bringing Zhirinovskiy to justice on  warmongering and inciting ethnic hatred charges.    Zhirinovskiy stated that Ilyushenko himself was "nobody and  is sitting in his office only because the president wants it."    Ilyushenko motivated his appeal by the results of the  preliminary investigations due to the publication of  Zhirinovskiy's book "The Last Push for the South." Ilyushenko  referred to provisions in the Criminal Code against warmongering  and inciting ethnic hatred.</p>

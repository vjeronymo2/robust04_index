			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Touching nerves on a learning curve: Jurek Martin assesses the first week of Bill Clinton's presidency IN THE FIRST week of his presidency Mr Bill Clinton has shown himself more than capable of touching a few raw national nerves in the US. His appointment of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to head the task force on health-care reform, and his determination to end the military's discrimination against homosexuals, may be socially and politically controversial - for sure, they are not the acts of a shrinking violet. Both decisions may be seen as deliberate counterbalances to the impressions of uncertainty left by the last week of his transition into office - when, as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York observed, 'the clatter of broken campaign promises' could be heard all over Washington - and to Mr Clinton's tactical retreat when his nomination of Ms Zoe Baird to be attorney-general ran into trouble. But these decisions may also reflect, as did his inaugural address, a conscious determination not to neglect what he promised to do in the campaign: in sum, to avoid the mistakes four years ago of President George Bush who took over and did very little until his invasion of Panama. The elevation of Mrs Clinton, a lawyer, should come as no surprise. Her role in the election campaign was played down for political reasons, after a few early and not entirely tactful remarks about baking cookies, but neither the president's reliance on her advice nor her intellectual and professional credentials have been in serious dispute. Still, she presents a new target for those on the right who rail against 'feminazis,' as Mr Rush Limbaugh, the virulent talk show host, likes to call independent professional women. The reintroduction of her maiden name, which disappeared after her husband had lost his first bid for re-election as governor of Arkansas, has excited some adverse comment from the hyper-critical. Recognition of her influence also creates an element of uncertainty in a Washington unaccustomed, since Eleanor Roosevelt in the 1930s and 1940s, to dealing with a First Lady on substantive policy-making. Disputes with women cabinet secretaries may be fair game, but the rules of engagement with Mrs Clinton, answerable in the first instance only to her husband, are not so clear. However, Mr Clinton has made clear that he considers ending the ban on homosexuals in the military to be a matter of principle. He frequently cites comparable resistance more than 40 years ago to the full racial integration of the US military, forced on an unwilling top brass by President Truman. The new president's campaign commitment to end the exclusion was unequivocal. To him it is conduct that matters, not a person's sexual orientation. Some of his aides point out that, while the military record on race may now be exemplary by US standards, it has also condoned some gross misconduct - as shown by the notorious Tailhook revelations of appalling sexual harassment of women. In the last analysis the military high command will do, as it always has, what it is told by its civilian commander-in-chief. But it is not above trying to throw a few blocks in his path, not least by exploiting its connections in Congress. Opponents there of keeping gays out of the armed forces maintain their presence would be detrimental to conduct, morale, privacy and efficiency, though the evidence adduced is often thin, and that the president would be exceeding his authority by unilaterally ending it. Above all, they argue that the president should heed the advice of his senior officers, who have forged such a fine fighting force. There is also a deep national ambivalence about gay rights, extending far beyond the religious, homophobic right. There are constant battles about whether school textbooks should acknowledge homosexuality as an accepted way of life. Last year several states, most controversially Colorado, passed laws appearing to encourage, or at least not to discourage, discrimination against gays. Mr Clinton, therefore, has stepped into a political and social minefield, convinced he has right on his side. He is respected for this, but not necessarily for the wisdom displayed in taking it on so early in his presidency, thus putting at risk a large stock of his initial political capital, already a little depleted by the Baird withdrawal. Put crudely, the argument is that, when it comes time to cut the military budget, he will be in need of the support of the likes of Senator Sam Nunn, Democratic chairman of the Senate armed services committee and an opponent of ending the ban on homosexuals. There is already tension between Mr Clinton and Mr Nunn. There is also the threat of mischief in Congress, for example, by tagging on to the family leave bill an extension of the homosexual ban, thus forcing the president to veto a measure high on his agenda. Representative Tom Foley and Senator George Mitchell, Democratic leaders of the House and the Senate, would rather not have to finesse this one, and do not want Congress to lapse back into 'gridlock' even before the president's domestic policy agenda is on the table. Late yesterday Mr Clinton indicated his inclination towards a phased, consultative approach, saying he favoured delaying an end to the ban on homosexuals for six months to give him more time to study the issue. He can take some consolation in the knowledge that, either way, he was going to be damned and that to leave his wife under wraps and gays out of the military might not have been the softer options. The learning curve is steep.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          GAYS IN THE WESTERN MILITARY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- No formal            Moves to liberalise discrimination       New Zealand: Australia            Leaked Defence Ministry paper last month said Austria              armed forces had agreed to drop ban on recruitment Belgium              and employment Canada               US: Denmark              Clinton administration has proposed dropping ban Finland              Discrimination remains France               UK: Germany*             Criminal offence abolished last June but MoD still Netherlands          discharges those it discovers to be gay Norway               Ireland: Spain Sweden Switzerland          All male homosexual acts illegal  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Allegedly barred in practice from officer rank  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Stonewall Group  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

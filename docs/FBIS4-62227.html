			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Robert Serebrennikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- "The approved state budget is  more realistic than ever before: it offers an opportunity to  follow an economic course chosen by the government as well,"  said Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin, commenting on the  Duma's decision to approve a draft law on federal budget of the  Russian Federation for 1994 in the first reading.    "According to specified data, the budget was endorsed at  194.4 trillion rubles for expenditures and 124.4 trillion rubles  for revenues. The top limit of the budget deficit was estimated  at 70 trillion rubles, or 36 per cent of budgetary expenditures.  A decision was adopted to look into the problem of more  rational use of funds envisaged as financial aid to subjects of  the federation," Dubinin said in an interview with ITAR-TASS.    However, leader of the Russia's Choice faction Yegor Gaydar  believes that the approval of the federal budget by the State  Duma means that a negative tendency which appeared in spring,  1994 will continue to develop. The essence of this tendency is  a step-by-step increase in subsidies, growing expenditures  envisaged by "investments and subsidies" articles with  simultaneous cuts in social allocations, in particular, for  culture, science and education.    In an interview with BUSINESS-TASS prominent Russian  economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy said that the federal budget in  its present form will not change anything and the situation in  the country will be the same as it was before. "Lawmakers do  not realise that the budget is the money of all citizens which  should be correctly used to prevent the situation from getting  worse," Yavlisnkiy said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jaroslav Kmenta report: "Iran Has Apparently Manifested an </F> Interest in Products From Czech Arms Factories"]    [Text] Prague -- Representatives from Skoda Plzen, which  is part of the RDP Group arms consortium, held talks during  their visit to Iran in autumn with officials from the Iranian  Army at the country's Defense Ministry. A diplomatic source  informed MLADA FRONTA DNES of this yesterday. He added that  this was supposed to have been an informative meeting concerning  possible cooperation in the arms industry.    Skoda Director General Lubomir Soudek has not denied this  report; at the same time, however, he has not confirmed it. "I  am not saying yes or no. I do not think it is anyone's business  what the talks were about, how extensive they were, or with whom  they were held. When the talks assume a specific form, we will  proceed in accordance with the laws," he said.    The Iranian regime is described by some countries -- for  example, by Israel -- as a terrorist regime.    Lubomir Soudek denied contacting the Iranians to offer them  surface-to-air missiles or the Tamara passive radar system.    According to the most recent issue of the weekly RESPEKT,  there exists an internal memorandum by Lubomir Soudek from the  trip to Iran in which he writes about a meeting at the Defense  Ministry and about talks with the army.    According to this document, the Skoda director was, for  example, supposed to have briefed Iranian Deputy Defense  Minister Vaheed on the RDP Group, the Czech company involved in  the production and sale of weapons. The Iranians were supposed  to have shown an interest in the new generation of  surface-to-air missiles, the Tamara radar system, and modernized  tanks.    Soudek has confirmed that a memorandum from his visit to  Iran  exists; nevertheless, he said that it is not available to  reporters. The Skoda director told us the following in  connection with the talks on the Russian T-72 tank, in whose  modernization the plant will participate: "So far, we have not  modernized a single tank; we have nothing to offer. However, if  Iran is on the list of countries to which the export of special  materials is prohibited, of course, we will not consider  exporting there."    The Foreign Ministry, according to our source, will ask  Lubomir Soudek for an official report on his company's  activities. Czech diplomats do not know anything about  representatives from Skoda Plzen holding talks with army  officials in Iran. According to our source, the ambassador of  the Czech Republic to Iran was only informed of the Skoda  delegation's visit to the Agriculture and Energy Ministries.    "If Skoda Plzen negotiated in Iran as it was alleged to have  done, then after 1 March -- when the law on arms trading should  come into force -- it would be possible to regard such activity  as an offense," said our diplomatic source, without giving any  details.    Lubomir Soudek has emphasized that he held talks in Iran on  -- for example -- plans for a joint enterprise in the sugar  refining industry and on the founding of a company to  manufacture Skoda trolley buses for the Teheran public  transportation system. "If some people want to turn the  business trip into a scandal, then they should not be surprised  if the number of unemployed increases," declared Soudek.</p>

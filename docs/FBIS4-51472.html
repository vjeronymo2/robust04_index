			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Excerpt] The powerful People's Liberation Army [PLA]  establishment has responded angrily to President Bill Clinton's  ban on guns and ammunition, indicating it is yet another example  of American "hegemonism".    Sources close to the army said, however, because the value  of  the targeted imports was no more than U.S.$200 million  (HK$1.5-billion [Hong Kong dollars] ) the PLA would be  relatively restrained in making public protests.    Moreover, the PLA is still hopeful of the resumption of full  ties between the Chinese and the American armies, which would  enable China to import technology with military applications.  Diplomatic sources said the ban should not jeopardise the first  steps that had been taken earlier this year towards the partial  resumption of military links.    Chinese Vice-Chief of Staff General Xu Huizi is still  expected to visit the U.S. in the summer, when he will probably  look at military-related technology. The sources said that if  the American army proved amenable to upgrading military  relations, Beijing would not play up the just-announced ban.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department coordinator for  the Cyprus issue, left Cyprus for Washington this morning  without succeeding in ending the deadlock in the talks on the  confidence-building measures.    Mr. Lamb yesterday had separate meetings with President  Glavkos Kliridhis and Rauf Denktas. According to a statement by  government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis, Mr. Lamb attempted to  persuade the Greek Cypriot side that if certain changes were  made to the documents, an agreement could be reached. President  Kliridhis reiterated that our side would accept neither changes  to the nonpaper nor a new document.</p>

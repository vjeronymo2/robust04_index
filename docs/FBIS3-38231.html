Goncz and Demirel agreed that closer political, economic,  and  cultural links between Turkey and Hungary could also promote  Hungary's Western integration in certain areas. Turkey supports  Hungary's OECD membership and also sees cooperation  possibilities under the peace-partnership scheme.    Goncz confirmed the invitation for Demirel to visit Hungary,  and they also discussed the situation in the former Yugoslavia,  including Bosnia-Herzegovina. Goncz said that settlement of the  conflict is necessary before refugees sheltered by Hungary can  be returned to their homeland.    Demirel expressed Turkey's readiness to join all efforts at  ironing-out differences and preventing the war from eventually  spreading to Kosovo, Sanjak, Macedonia, or Vojvodina.    The Middle East peace process was the subject of talks  between 'Arafat and Goncz. Arafat said he hopes for an early  agreement on the basis of his Davos discussions, because it is  important for the peace process not to lose its credibility by  further delay. They also discussed Hungarian-Palestinian  relations and the reconstruction program. Goncz confirmed an  invitation for 'Arafat to visit Hungary.    Birkavs told Goncz of Latvia's intention to increase ties  with the Visegrad Group (comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary,  Poland, and Slovakia). He called for new accords with Hungary,  mainly in business and law. Birkavs cited security as a top  priority for his country.    Goncz welcomed endeavors to boost bilateral links, and  expressed Hungary's readiness to help Latvia join European  integration organizations.    Goncz asked Paye to back Hungary's efforts to attain full  OECD membership. Paye expressed his appreciation of previous  cooperation between various committees of the OECD and Hungary.    Accompanied by Hungarian Foreign Economic Minister Bela  Kadar, Goncz and Larosiere discussed EBRD assistance for  economic restructuring, privatization, and infrastructure  projects in Hungary, amounting to ECU200 million so far, plus  aid commitment of ECU700 million. They also reviewed areas for  possible additional EBRD support, primarily banks and large  privatized companies.</p>

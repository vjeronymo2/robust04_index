			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> A strike by the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers against members  of the League of Resident Theaters -- which locally includes the Mark Taper  Forum, the Los Angeles Theatre Center and South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa  -- was narrowly averted Tuesday when the society signed a four-year agreement  with the league. The terms of the contract "fall far short of the union's  stated goals," according to a statement released by the society, but its  executive board voted to accept the league's final offer anyway and to  recommend ratification by its membership. The new contract, retroactive to last  April 15, runs to April 14, 1993. Except for some percentage increases, details  of the new agreement were not made public. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

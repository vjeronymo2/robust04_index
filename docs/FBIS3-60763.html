Airport police have  learned the two hijackers are male and female. The male is  named (Luo Chang-hu) and the female is known as (Wang I-yin).  Claiming that they carried explosives, they demanded that  Fuchien [Fujian] Airlines' (?Flight FC-518) bound from  Chianghsi's [Jiangxi] Kanchou [Ganzhou] for Hsiamen [Xiamen] be  diverted to Taiwan. There are 50 people on board, including  eight crew members and 42 passengers. The plane was hijacked at  1312 local time. Our Air Force immediately learned of the  hijacking. Because the Chinese communists' Yun-7 aircraft is  similar to military aircraft, our Air Force adopted serious  precautionary measures. At 1422 local time, four F-5E's took  off from Taiwan to guide the hijacked plane to Taoyuan CKS  International Airport. Government officials have gone to the  airport to handle the matter. According to Prime Minister Lien  Chan and instructions from the Mainland Affairs Council, it is  expected the government will adopt a new method for handling the  hijacked plane.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Hong Kong fifth round talks grind to a halt THE FIFTH round of Sino-British talks ended in Beijing yesterday with little sign that the gulf separating the two sides over Hong Kong's future political development had narrowed, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador at Beijing and chief negotiator, described the talks as 'normal' - an indication that the Chinese had not discussed substantive issues - but said the two had agreed to a sixth round of talks on June 23-25. The Hong Kong government yesterday confirmed that Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, would fly to London later this month for high-level consultations about Hong Kong policy. While in London Mr Patten will attend a meeting on July 1 of the British cabinet's Hong Kong committee, chaired by Prime Minister John Major. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and other senior British ministers will also take part in the discussions which are being billed as crucial for charting Britain's policy towards the Hong Kong talks. Both Mr Patten and senior ministers in London are losing patience with China over the progress of the talks in Beijing. Next month's meeting, the announcement of which is intended to concentrate the Chinese leadership's mind, is expected to endorse Mr Patten's policy of going 'one extra mile' and leave with him the power to recommend termination of the talks.</p>

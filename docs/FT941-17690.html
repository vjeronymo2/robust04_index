			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Thornton Pounds 3m zero pref placing Thornton Pan-European Investment Trust is to raise some Pounds 3m net of expenses via a placing of zero dividend preference shares at 50p apiece. It is also proposed that the life of the company be extended by about eight years to October 31 2001. The new shares have been placed with institutions, subject to a clawback by qualifying shareholders on the basis of one new preference share for every three ordinary held. The zero dividend preference shares are designed to offer investors a return of 90.83p each on the new winding up date, which represents a gross redemption yield of 8 per cent on the subscription price. Following the introduction of zero dividend preference shares, the existing ordinary shares are to be redesignated as ordinary income shares. For shareholders who wish to realise their investment in the company, Olliff &amp; Partners, adviser to the proposals, is making a cash offer which amounts to 101 per cent of formula asset value.</p>

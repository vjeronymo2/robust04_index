			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Narrow vote in favour of Rover changes ROVER workers have voted by a very narrow margin in favour of reforms to working practices and bargaining procedures through which the company aims to transform efficiency. The package has been strongly endorsed by union leaders. The vote in the ballot of 28,000 union members was 11,961 to 11,793. While the company intends to go ahead with the reforms, the narrowness of the vote suggests that Rover faces a hard task in persuading its workforce to adopt the changes wholeheartedly. Union leaders had praised Rover for its willingness to negotiate and for its attempts to involve workers more fully in decision-making. Shopfloor resentment is thought to have stemmed in part from the company's failure to offer any cash inducement to accept the package. Other carmakers seeking change have tended to make such offers. Rover had sought to sweeten its package through such measures as increasing job security by suggesting it would not implement compulsory redundancies, and by improving holiday and sick-pay arrangements for blue-collar workers. While welcoming these proposals, some workers were concerned about measures such as the phasing out of 'clocking-on' arrangements and payment of wages by credit transfer rather than in cash. The company's intention of removing all demarcations between jobs will have raised fears about increased workloads. Other aspects of the package include 'single-table' bargaining procedures at which leaders of white-collar and blue-collar unions will negotiate on pay together; the extension of team working; and a mechanism for binding arbitration in disputes, providing both sides agree to it. Rover said the package was so broad that it was inevitable there would be concerns. It would attempt to allay fears as it introduced the changes.</p>

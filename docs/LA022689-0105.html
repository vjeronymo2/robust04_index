			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS COLLECT;  </P> <P> DEVELOPERS FIND PEACE AT A PRICE  </P> <P> With his swank new Westside hotel sitting empty and losing a reported $800,000  a month, developer Sheldon Gordon struck a desperate deal.  </P> <P> Gordon wrote a check for $250,000 to a group of Los Angeles homeowners that had  dragged the project through months of tedious hearings. He also dropped  $800,000 into a bank account -- to be controlled by him and the homeowners --  to find more parking.  </P> <P> The homeowners, in return, consented to leave the Ma Maison Sofitel alone.  Within weeks, Gordon was entertaining celebrities at his $50-million hotel, and  the homeowners were setting up a "neighborhood preservation fund" with their  pot of gold.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Seen the Light'  </P> <P> "They have seen the light," Harald Hahn, one of the homeowners, proclaimed  after signing the agreement. "We made them see the light."  </P> <P> Gordon, speaking later to a reporter, was contemptuous.  </P> <P> "If that's the American way, I am crazy," he said. "It was blackmail."  </P> <P> However appalling to developers, the pay-out in Los Angeles last fall reflects  the increasing boldness with which community groups across the state are  pushing builders to dig deep into their pockets in the name of neighborhood  peace.  </P> <P> The legacy of development disputes in the 1980s, many builders and residents  say, can now be measured in dollars and cents. The old compromises -- a shorter  high-rise or a smaller condominium project -- are often no longer enough for  residents, who say they cannot rely on unresponsive local governments to look  out for their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "There seems to be very little give and mostly take," said one Los Angeles  attorney who represents developers in negotiations with community groups.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Legal Tab  </P> <P> Frequently, developers are being asked by residents -- and they are agreeing --  to subsidize their own opposition. It has become an unwritten rule in many  areas that builders pick up the tab when they reach an agreement with residents  who have hired attorneys, consultants and other experts to dissect their  proposals. The bills can run into the tens of thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> In discussions that end less amicably, residents sometimes use money paid to  them by one developer to take on another. For example:  </P> <P> * Hahn and his group have already received requests from several homeowner  organizations -- including one near the controversial Westside Pavilion  shopping mall 4 miles from the hotel -- to spend Gordon's money in their  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> * In the San Joaquin Valley, a small Tulare County citizens group opposed to a  proposed cogeneration plant in Hanford last year settled a lawsuit against the  developer for $100,000 and is using the cash to pursue a separate suit against  the same developer. "We have money now, so people are quaking in their boots,"  said Marcie Williams, who heads Citizens for a Healthy Environment.  </P> <P> * San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth, a residents group concerned about  downtown expansion, reportedly received more than $500,000 from developers  several years ago in exchange for settling separate lawsuits over proposed  skyscrapers. The group paid its bills but also used the money to prepare for  the next developer, founder Sue Hestor said. "You kind of just recycle your  money," she said.  </P> <P> * In West Los Angeles, the Friends of Westwood homeowners group collected  $150,000 for attorney and other costs when it sued to block construction of a  high-rise on Wilshire Boulevard. Having already raised some money from its  members, the group had an estimated $20,000 to $40,000 from the settlement left  over for other causes. Among other things, Friends of Westwood donated $2,000  to a Hollywood group that sued to block the city's redevelopment project there.  </P> <P> Throughout the state, there is a widespread perception among community groups  that government has not been doing enough for residents -- leaving them to fill  the void. Many trace the phenomenon to government cutbacks after Proposition  13, the tax-cutting measure of 1978.  </P> <P> With state and local governments spending less money on things like streets and  parks, there has been "a trickling down" of responsibility, as one Sacramento  observer explained it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expensive Proposition  </P> <P> "It has become very expensive to do what we do," said Sandy Brown, co-founder  of Friends of Westwood and a signer of the agreement with Ma Maison Sofitel.  "It is something homeowner associations never had to contend with before. . . .  I don't think the development community should have to give money to anybody,  but on the other hand I don't think the residential community should have to  hire experts to defend itself."  </P> <P> Hahn, vice president of the Westside Civic Federation, a coalition of homeowner  associations, said community groups have had little choice but to look out for  their own needs.  </P> <P> "We don't want to be perceived as being here to milk the developers," he said.  "But on the other hand, the city isn't doing a whole lot to protect us, so we  have to protect ourselves. It points out a real weakness in our political  system."  </P> <P> Faced with income losses, city and county governments statewide have pressed  builders to pick up some of the tab by imposing various fees and requiring them  to install such things as traffic signals and left-turn lanes.  </P> <P> But in many instances, influential developers twist arms at City Hall and wind  up providing fewer amenities than local residents would like. In other cases,  tax-hungry cities and counties approve projects despite local opposition  because they see them as moneymakers. In these cases, residents complain, they  have been abandoned by their elected representatives.  </P> <P> "What the citizens realize is that in the relationship between developers and  elected decision makers, there aren't really any good safeguards that assure  the citizens have in fact gotten their due," said Mike Remy, a Sacramento  land-use attorney and former professor of environmental studies. "This gives  citizens an incentive to take things into their own hands."  </P> <P> And that has been expensive for many groups. Many builders, recognizing that  residents often cannot afford this watchdog role, often do not mind picking up  the bills in friendly negotiations. The added costs, developers say, are  eventually passed on to consumers in everything from higher meal prices in  hotels to more costly homes and offices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pushing for a Solution  </P> <P> "By definition, the community would not experience the cost but for the  developer's project, so the developer ends up saying, 'OK,' " said Douglas R.  Ring, a Century City attorney who represents developers. "The developer is  always pushing for a solution that does not require him to reduce the size of  the project he has planned, because the economics, if you will, flow with the  larger project."  </P> <P> Across the state, community groups find they have extraordinary leverage with  developers who have large amounts of money wrapped up in a project or strict  deadlines to meet. Residents can delay projects for months -- if not years --  by tying them up in government hearings or in court. And in the building  industry, delays mean more attorney fees, higher interest payments, lost  revenues and, in extreme cases, bankruptcy.  </P> <P> "Every day that passes is a costly day for the developer," said Kenneth B.  Bley, who represented the developer in the Friends of Westwood case. "So you  have to look at the bottom line. It makes more sense to try to resolve a matter  quickly even if it means paying a few extra dollars. And both sides know this."  </P> <P> Even so, community groups angling for cash have not always found it easy. Such  deals have offended developers and residents alike, particularly when the  agreements receive great scrutiny because of widespread publicity.  </P> <P> In the San Joaquin Valley, Williams said her group faced "a lot of hard  feelings" over the $100,000 settlement. An editorial in the Hanford Sentinel  newspaper suggested that the Tulare County group change its name to "Citizens  for a Healthy Environment Except When the Price Is Right." The editorial  charged that the settlement showed the group's "true interest lies not in the  warm green shades of nature, but in the crisp green color of folding cash."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Legal Extortion'  </P> <P> In San Francisco, Hestor's group has been accused by some developers of "legal  extortion" and, at one point, former Mayor Dianne Feinstein asked the district  attorney to look into the allegations. Hestor said the "smear campaigns" have  made her think twice about asking for money.  </P> <P> "I don't believe it is extortion, but I don't want to take the heat," Hestor  said.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, both Gordon and the homeowners he negotiated with have taken a  thrashing in the Ma Maison Sofitel case.  </P> <P> "To me it stinks," said Ethel Shapiro, a West Hollywood homeowner who lives  near Gordon's hotel. "It is a payoff. If they were that concerned about  parking, they wouldn't have allowed themselves to be bought off."  </P> <P> Others have raised concerns that the homeowners gave up too much in the deal by  agreeing, among other things, not to oppose the hotel's request to serve  alcoholic beverages. In newsletters to fellow homeowners, Hahn and Diana  Plotkin, the lead negotiators, wrote that "none of our future rights to enter  into the process have been waived" and that their associations "retained the  right to continue to monitor the hotel and address all concerns which will  impact the community."  </P> <P> But the confidential agreement, a copy of which was obtained by The Times,  clearly restricts the homeowners' ability to take on the hotel in the future.  The agreement prohibits the homeowners from taking "any action at any time" to  change the hotel's parking requirements, occupancy limits or license to serve  alcohol unless the hotel itself requests a change. Moreover, the homeowners  agreed not to oppose the hotel in any court-ordered environmental proceedings.  </P> <P> In an interview, Plotkin defended the deal: "We did the best job we could. We  did a hell of a lot better than the people in West Hollywood. . . . I know  there are always going to be critics. There are a lot of people who are  jealous. There are a lot of people who are angry."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Action Criticized  </P> <P> Gordon has also come under attack because of the hotel agreement, according to  several developers and land-use attorneys who asked not to be identified. By  paying the "ransom," as one of them characterized the payment, Gordon opened  the door to more "hostage situations" for other developers.  </P> <P> Indeed, sources said, at least one other developer near the hotel has already  been approached by homeowners about making a contribution -- perhaps as high as  $250,000 -- to the neighborhood fund. Other developers apparently have cash  payments on their minds too. In Westwood, Brown said she was told up front by  one builder, "I am not going to give you one red cent," even though she never  asked for any money.  </P> <P> There is concern among some developers that groups in California, if encouraged  by lucrative cash deals such as the Ma Maison Sofitel payment, may become as  difficult to deal with as a highly controversial citizens group in Washington  state. In the last year, an aggressive citizens environmental organization has  shaken King County in the Seattle area by tying up proposed projects until  developers agree to stiff environmental requirements and hefty cash  settlements.  </P> <P> The founders of the Hestia Alliance, named for the Greek goddess of hearth and  home, reportedly received $500,000 in a settlement with the developers of a  proposed housing and apartment complex near their home.  </P> <P> "We make no bones about it," said Tom Evans, the group's attorney, who would  not confirm the amount of the settlement. "We go into these battles with the  intention of obtaining funds to pay for furthering the goals of the  organization. . . . Developers are truly interested in better mitigation (of  damage to the environment), but unless someone comes along and applies the  pressure, none of this stuff is going to happen."  </P> <P> King County developers have complained bitterly about the group's tactics,  accusing it of creating "an assembly line extortion machine," in the words of  critic Peter L. Buck. At least one developer has refused to pay. Dick Van der  Peyl, whose company wants to build several hundred apartments in King County,  said he agreed to Hestia's environmental requests but turned down the group's  demand for $15,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Had Been Shaken Down'  </P> <P> "I felt like I had been shaken down," Van der Peyl said. "We are willing to  give legitimate documented expenses . . . but they just flat out demanded 15  grand from us before even having done any environmental work on the project."  </P> <P> In California, few groups seems to be interested in cash alone. In many cases,  the "extractions," as one attorney called developer concessions, come in "cash  equivalents." Some community groups do not need or want money. Some,  particularly in more affluent areas, have attorneys, engineers and other  professionals among their members who volunteer their services, or leaders who  work on neighborhood issues so often that they have become experts themselves.  </P> <P> In some neighborhoods, it is a matter of ethics.  </P> <P> Hoag Canyon homeowners in Bel-Air said they rejected a $150,000 offer from a  developer who flattened a nearby mountain ridge without any notice to area  homeowners. Instead, the Roscomare Valley Assn. held out for an agreement that  requires the developer to rebuild part of the ridge and pay about $40,000 in  lawyer and engineering fees.  </P> <P> "Our particular homeowner group was offended by the offer," Mark Slade said.  "It is really up to the individual homeowner group how they feel about it. This  is a way of doing business throughout the city. . . . We always felt the  objective was to save Hoag Canyon as much as possible. Mitigation funds of any  kind were not our objective. In fact, we found it distasteful."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deal Falls Through  </P> <P> In the hills above Sherman Oaks, a homeowner group helped craft a proposed  agreement with the developer of a housing tract that called for a $500,000  contribution to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to purchase land in the  area. Richard Close, who heads the Sherman Oaks homeowners group, said some  residents had ethical problems with the deal, which ultimately fell through for  other reasons.  </P> <P> "We did have some moral questions raised in our minds, but we never had to make  the hard decision," Close said. "We made it clear up front that the money would  not go to the homeowners association, that it had to go to a third party.  Still, you have the moral question of whether it is right to agree to a project  in which substantial dollars are being given to a group. Is that any different  than a developer making a large contribution to council people?"  </P> <P> In planned communities, which are common in suburban settings such as Orange  County, many homeowner and condominium associations are precluded by their  bylaws from accepting or spending money outside their maintenance  responsibilities. In such cases, members negotiate with developers for sound  walls, palm trees, wider driveways or traffic signals.  </P> <P> Other community groups statewide work closely enough with developers -- and get  enough concessions -- that they see no need to stow away cash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Private Park  </P> <P> In the Miracle Mile area of Los Angeles, cordial negotiations between residents  and the developer of a six-story office building on Wilshire Boulevard netted  the community a two-acre private park where the developer had proposed building  condominiums.  </P> <P> The park cost developer Jerry Snyder $750,000 as well as annual maintenance  expenses -- more money, several residents said, than any homeowner group could  have hoped to extract in cash. Snyder also agreed to give the Miracle Mile  Residential Assn. a free office in the building for five years.  </P> <P> Lyn MacEwen Cohen, who negotiated the agreement for the homeowners, said she  never asked for money.  </P> <P> "We really don't have much need for funds," she said. "What we have is a  wonderful park."  </P> <P> The developer of a shopping center near Marina del Rey, confronted by nearby  condominium owners opposed to alcohol sales at the center, agreed to provide an  overnight private security patrol in the neighborhood for three years. The  service will cost the developer between $30,000 and $50,000 a year, but he  would have lost far more than that if his project had been denied its liquor  licenses. Meanwhile, the neighborhood got a service it had wanted for many  years but could not afford.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chinatown Center  </P> <P> In San Francisco, a downtown developer has agreed to contribute $500,000 to a  recreational center in Chinatown, while a developer in a rural Solano County  consented to set aside open space to win support from residents for his  project.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles Harbor area, the developer of a condominium project has  agreed to build a senior citizens center, and in Brentwood, the J. Paul Getty  Trust will pay $300,000 to homeowners near its proposed arts center so they can  erect gates to keep traffic out of their neighborhood.  </P> <P> The list goes on and on, particularly in the Los Angeles area, where "every  acre is being fought over," according to San Francisco attorney Mark  Weinberger, who represents community groups across the state.  </P> <P> And both developers and homeowners say they are bracing for more.  </P> <P> "The sophisticated developer of the 1990s is going to be the developer who  understands how to communicate with homeowners just like the successful  developer of the 1950s was the person who understood how to mass-produce in  large volume cheaply," said Ring, the Century City attorney. "The developer who  is the dinosaur is the guy who says, 'It is my property. I can do what I please  with it, and the hell with them.' "  </P> <P> Hahn, the Los Angeles homeowner leader, made a similar prediction.  </P> <P> "If a developer is a bandit, you have to watch out for us," he said. "If you're  a bastard, you get treated like one."  </P></p>

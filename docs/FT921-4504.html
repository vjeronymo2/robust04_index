			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Monday Profile: Musketeer who prefers obscurity - Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip If he appears on your television screen during the general election, it will be no more than a fleeting glimpse. He will be at the heart of Prime Minister John Major's campaign, but outside his constituency you will neither see nor hear him pressing the case for a fourth Tory term. Mr Richard Ryder is one of the most powerful figures in the Conservative party. Quite consciously he is, and intends to remain, among the least well known. Mr Ryder is government chief whip. His role, simply, is that of party manager. He is the man charged with doing the prime minister's bidding at Westminster; the agent who ensures that the Tory troops are kept loyally in line; and the impresario for the government's 'floor show' in the chamber of the House of Commons. He is all of that, and then more. In his 15 months in the job - he was one of the Treasury mafia rewarded for his role in Mr Major's leadership bid - he has emerged as campaign strategist, prime ministerial confidant, and cabinet fixer-in-chief. If the Conservatives win, he could claim a prize Whitehall department. Mr Ryder wants, instead, to stay on as chief whip. His politics and personality are a puzzle. For all his influence, there is only handful at Westminster that knows the man well or feels sure of his political outlook. The son of a country squire, a friend says he fits the Boy's Own image of an English gentleman - 'diffident and proper, but shrewd and tough when it matters'. He is courteous but unforgiving of disloyalty; self-deprecating but always determined to win. The chief whip is both liked and feared by his charges on the backbenches, and respected by the team of a dozen junior whips. But ask one to pin a political label on Mr Ryder and the response is a vague circumlocution ending in the phrase: 'Well, you know I'm not quite sure.' Mr Ryder chose long ago not to wear his brand of Conservatism on his sleeve. Unusually in an age of pushy politicians, the adjectives most frequently applied to him are circumspect, discreet, tactful and taciturn. It is a mistake, however, to think that he does not have views. At barely 43, he has been in politics for nearly two decades, working for six years in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's office before beginning a steady, if initially unspectacular, rise through the ministerial ranks after entering parliament in 1983. A friend recalls Mr Ryder's bubbling enthusiasm before the 1979 general election, when he promised that, at last, Mrs Thatcher would lead a government that 'changes things'. A guest at a recent lunch said he was as interesting as any on the future of a different brand of Conservatism in the 1990s. His outlook is unconventional. He has fused an upbringing in insular, rural Suffolk with a deep enthusiasm for the distinctly less feudal culture of North America. The result is a political perspective not slotted easily into traditional Tory pigeonholes. As the MP for Mid-Norfolk he has preserved his ties with East Anglia. Yet he is anti-establishment, disparaging the class-conscious England that others might argue has survived longer in that part of the country than elsewhere. A Cambridge historian, he does not blame socialism for Britain's long-term economic decline. Instead he traces it to the cultural snobbery which led 19th-century entrepreneurs to forsake industry for the quiet gentility of the country. He combines his enthusiasm for the enterprise culture on the other side of the Atlantic with more conventionally English attitudes to social welfare. He dislikes intensely the residual racism in sections of the Conservative party. He has a habit of reminding those who assume the superiority of European over American culture, of the millions who were slaughtered in Hitler's Germany. A pragmatist rather than ideologue, his present role suits him. It is that of the backroom mechanic and tactician, the mediator and, from time to time, the dictator. The chief whip is at the political centre, brokering cabinet deals before selling them to the party at Westminster. But the slight figure with an almost schoolboyish appearance is never called from his privileged seat on the government front bench to speak at the Commons Despatch Box. As chief whip he can cite tradition when he politely declines requests for newspaper interviews. His style is that of his political master. He is ready to listen carefully to the concerns of jittery MPs. But once his mind is made up, he demands absolute loyalty. As one charge puts it: 'He has a light touch . . . most of the time.' A senior colleague is less tactful: 'He is the toughest of us all.' When Mr Ryder took over the whips' office in November 1990, the party's MPs were in disarray. They had just ousted their leader. They were bitterly divided over Europe and were more than half-convinced that they were about to lose the general election. They had chosen as prime minister a man from the back streets of Brixton in south London, with a fraction more than three years' experience in the cabinet. Mr Ryder was even less well known. A former junior whip, under-secretary at agriculture and middle-ranking Treasury minister, his principal claim to fame was some skilful public presentation during a scare about salmonella in eggs. At the Treasury he is remembered as sharp and insightful, although one mandarin says: 'He hardly made an impact on economic policy.' He did, though, cement his friendship with Mr John Major, another East Anglian MP with whom he had shared a spell in the whips' office. Few, therefore, were surprised when Mr Ryder was given the task of healing the party's self-inflicted wounds and reuniting it behind the new prime minister. Less that 18 months on, the government backbenches are scarcely recognisable. They are still prone to the occasional bout of jitters. Resentments burn among the old guard over the way in which their former leader was dumped. But the blind panic that engulfed Mrs Thatcher has been replaced by carefully organised calm. The poll tax, the flagship of the third term, was sunk with barely a ripple. The scores of MPs whose antipathy towards Europe once threatened to tear the party apart were reduced by the time of December's Maastricht summit to an isolated handful of diehards. Mr Major's consensual style was vital, but Mr Ryder still gets much credit for transforming a rabble into something akin to the old Tory party. It took time and energy. In spite of bouts of ill health he works ferociously hard. From a spacious but spartan room adjoining the members' lobby of the Commons and from the rather more grand surroundings of Number 12 Downing Street he typically works 15 hours or more a day. His private passions - modern painting, jazz and Ipswich football club - have been put temporarily on one side. Like most of life's natural 'fixers' Mr Ryder puts a premium on organisation and on personal contact. His formal lines of communication are supplemented by a personal network of friends and agents. At weekends, he spends much of his time on the telephone. He is the founder of the now famous 'four musketeers', the small Downing Street group which has spent most of the past year planning Mr Major's election campaign. It was Mr Ryder who first detected the dangerous drift into which the government slipped early last summer. He suggested regular meetings to integrate the party's control of the Whitehall machine with the political imperative of winning the election. Ministers, he told friends, needed to be reminded that they were politicians as well as policymakers. Since then he has been joined by Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, Mr John Wakeham, the minister charged with government presentation, and Mr John MacGregor, the leader of the House of Commons, for daily breakfast meetings at Number 12. More recently, he has synchronised the Conservative onslaught against Labour with the government's control of the parliamentary timetable. It has been no accident that the party's daily press conferences attacking opposition policies have coincided with Westminster debates on the same themes. As a friend puts it: 'He is more determined than any of us that we are going to win.' So during the election campaign proper he will spend most of his time at Conservative Central Office: fixing, calming nerves, knocking heads together - and keeping out of camera shot.

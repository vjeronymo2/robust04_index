			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Last minute talks try to save consortium offer for ITN Last-minute talks will be held today to try to reach agreement on an offer for Independent Television News that would involve Pounds 30m in financial support. Representatives of all ITN shareholders will meet Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, before the 3pm deadline for the expiry of the offer. Carlton, the television production and services company, is a member of the four-company consortium which is offering Pounds 1 for each Pounds 1 ITN share and promising to put up Pounds 30m to deal with a deficit of Pounds 25m over five years on ITN's London headquarters. The other consortium members are Central Television, London Weekend Television and Reuters Holdings. Together they would take 80 per cent of ITN. It is not expected that full agreement will be possible on present terms before the deadline expires. Some companies who might sell do not like the Pounds 1 price. Others, such as Thames, Granada and possibly Yorkshire, which would like to continue as ITN shareholders, do not want to be shoe-horned into the remaining 20 per cent envisaged by the proposal. If progress is made at today's talks the deadline may have to be extended.</p>

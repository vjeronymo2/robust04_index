			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Catching the bus to engineer a rare market event - Paul Cheeseright considers the sale of shares in Trinity Holdings where banks have a large equity stake THE SINKING stock market evidently holds no terror for Trinity Holdings, the specialist vehicle manufacturer. After a week in which the FT-SE 100 Index declined more than 50 points, it announced its intention to apply for a listing later this month. With the market casting a jaundiced eye over even traditionally defensive stocks, like breweries and food manufacturers, any listing would have looked a bold move. The fact that it is for an engineering company makes the timing look odder still. The arrival on the market of engineering companies is in any case a rare event. The last was Prospect Industries in May 1991. The sector, highly exposed to the recession, has found little favour as investors have watched another bout of painful restructuring and shrinking profits. Made confident by its own expansion, Trinity is hoping to place shares worth about Pounds 25m. The placing is arranged by Baring Brothers and brokered by Albert E Sharp. The management expects to retain majority control of a company with a likely capitalisation of about Pounds 80m. Under the Dennis brand name, Trinity makes refuse collection vehicles and chassis for fire engines, buses and coaches. Its Duple Metsec subsidiary makes complete bus kits, sold in developing countries. Reliance Mercury specialises in dock-handling and airport towing vehicles, while Carmichael manufactures airport crash tenders. For the Warwick-based group, with plants in Guildford, Halifax, Tipton and Worcester, the simple fact of placing the shares may be more important than immediate market performance. The reason lies in its structure. The company was a subsidiary of Hestair until 1989 when Hestair decided to concentrate on management services and shed its engineering arm. That resulted in a Pounds 27.3m management buy-out led by Mr Geoff Hollyhead, chairman and chief executive. The new company began with three levels of debt - senior, mezzanine and preference shares - totalling Pounds 23.8m. But what made the buy-out idiosyncratic was that the bank consortium involved, headed by Citicorp Investment and Bankers Trust, took 49 per cent of the equity, leaving the management and employees with 51 per cent. There is no suggestion that relations between the Trinity management and the banks have ever been less than amiable and mutually supportive. And Trinity has repaid Pounds 12m of its Pounds 16m senior debt, so that its total debt burden, apart from overdrafts, stands now at Pounds 11.8m. This is made up of the balance of the senior debt, Pounds 4m of mezzanine finance and Pounds 3.8m of preference shares. Mr Hollyhead said the bank consortium was prepared to extend its loans beyond the existing five year term, but the heavy equity holding of the consortium and its consequent involvement in management decisions has left Trinity slower on its feet than it might otherwise have been. It is not yet clear exactly how much money Trinity will seek to raise, or on what terms, but, provided the placing is a success, the overall effect will be not only to widen its equity but also to wipe out its indebtedness. The main elements of recent growth have been the acquisition of Reliance Mercury and Carmichael, the activities of which, combined with those of Duple Metsec, account for 27 per cent of Trinity's steadily increasing turnover. At the same time new products have been introduced, notably a new refuse collection vehicle and a new chassis for a medium-sized bus, the Dart, now the best selling bus on the UK market. Unit production at Trinity has been rising steadily since 1989 along with turnover, which, in the year to January 1993, should top Pounds 100m, nearly doubling that of the year to January 1990. Profits before tax and interest payments to the bank consortium should this year reach about Pounds 8m, against Pounds 5.4m in the January 1992 year and Pounds 4m in the January 1990 year. Since the buy-out, conditions in the refuse collection vehicle and bus and coach markets have been discouraging. This has had less to do with recession than the fall-out from government policies. Abolition of grants to bus buyers, the privatisation of National Bus and the deregulation of the bus industry have all contributed to a 50 per cent cut in what Trinity estimates to be the normal level of bus and coach purchases. The purchase of refuse collection vehicles has been 40 per cent down nationally on normal buying patterns, largely because of the turmoil created by pushing local authority services out to tender and the reluctance, under those circumstances, to invest in replacement vehicles. Believing that these two sectors will settle down after the organisational changes, Trinity expects to increase production and, if it can hold its market share, increase profits.</p>

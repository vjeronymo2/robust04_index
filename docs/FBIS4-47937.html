			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 5 SAPA -- Controversy surrounding claims  of electoral fraud in KwaZulu/Natal continued on Thursday [5  May] after individual Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]  officials charged the elections were not free and fair in the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] stronghold of Zululand.    A letter apparently drafted by the Empangeni sub-region of  the IEC and leaked to SAPA's Durban office said "pending the  commissioner's decision our impression of elections in this sub-  region is that they were not free and fair".    Electoral officer for the lower Umfolozi area, Jan Riekert,  told SAPA late on Thursday night that in his opinion the  election in the area had been free and fair. Mr Riekert said  reports of irregularities in the electoral procedure had not  been substantiated and he was satisfied that complaints that  ballot boxes had been tampered with had been satisfactorily  resolved. The ballot boxes had been set aside and had not been  included in the count.    Mr Riekert conceded, however, that local IEC staff had  expressed reservations about the freeness and fairness of the  elections in that area at a confidential meeting on Wednesday.  "It was purely an opinion poll among ourselves...And was not a  specific resolution that was formed," Mr Riekert told SAPA. He  denied knowledge of the letter, which was reportedly sent to IEC  headquarters in Johannesburg.</p>

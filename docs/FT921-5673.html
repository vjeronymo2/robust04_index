			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Stake in Israeli publisher sold MR YA'ACOV Nimrodi, the Israeli businessman who last week bought the daily newspaper Ma'ariv from the administrator of Mr Robert Maxwell's Israeli assets, has sold on half his holding in a deal which gives a rival publisher a large stake in the company. Mr Nimrodi, best known outside Israel as an arms dealer who was involved in the Iran-Contra affair, sold a 22 per cent stake in Ma'ariv Modi'in, publisher of Ma'ariv, for Dollars 3m to the Schocken family, which publishes the rival Ha'aretz and Hadashot daily papers. The move, apparently unhindered by any media monopoly regulations, prompted speculation that the Schocken group was planning some rationalisation of Israel's crowded newspaper market in which a survey last week showed most titles were losing circulation. The group had also been in negotiation with one of the losing bidders for Ma'ariv. Another 22 per cent stake in Ma'ariv was sold by Mr Nimrodi to Mr Jack Lieberman, an Australian with established investments in Israel, and a local partner. Mr Nimrodi paid Dollars 14.5m for Mr Maxwell's 87 per cent holding in Ma'ariv - significantly less than Arthur Andersen, the administrator, had originally hoped to raise. Both the Schocken group and Mr Lieberman have also agreed to put up a proportional share of the Dollars 10m Mr Nimrodi pledged to inject into Ma'ariv to pay off bank debt.</p>

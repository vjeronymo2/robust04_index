			<p>BFN     [Text] A senior journalist known for his pro-Beijing  stance has been appointed ATV's news controller, prompting  concerns over the station's future editorial policies. Leung  Yu-shing's appointment follows a week of controversy at the  station, during which the acting news controller, Poon Fu-yim,  and five other senior staff resigned.    The six were angry over the ATV management's interference in  the screening of footage from a Spanish documentary on the 1989  Tiananmen Square massacre. The programme was eventually aired  as originally scheduled last Saturday [4 June].    ATV announced Leung's appointment after the station's chief  executive officer, Mark Lee, and the deputy chief executive,  Clarence Chang, appeared with the six resigning staff at a  Legislative Council hearing into the controversy on Monday  evening.    Leung has served in senior positions in a number of news  organisations, including the former RTV [Rediffusion  Television], RTHK [Radio Television Hong Kong), and the  Chinese-language newspapers Sing Tao [SING TAO JIH PAO], Wah Kiu  [HUA CHIAO JIH PAO], and Express [KUAI PAO].    Leung's most recent position was as publisher of the  Chinese-  language magazine Pai Shing [PAI HSING], which has folded.  Leung joined the magazine when it was bought by a pro-China  businessman, Tsui Tsin-tong, and turned from a fortnightly to a  weekly publication. Under Leung's leadership, the magazine was  criticised by readers and journalists for publishing  "Beijing-friendly" articles in contrast to its previous critical  stance.    Tsui announced late last year that he would not continue  supporting the magazine. It became a monthly publication and  Leung resigned at the same time. The magazine ceased  publication last month.    ATV did not mention Leung's record with Pai Shing in the  press release on his appointment as the news controller.  Leung's service on the executive committee of the News  Executive Association has also contributed little to the  confidence of journalists in his commitment to press freedom.  "Management won't need to interfere in the news department any  more," one journalist said. "Leung will do their work for them."    An ATV source said the management only decided on Leung's  appointment on Sunday. The source said the management was in a  rush to replace Poon and the others, because they felt they  could no longer trust them, and Leung, unemployed since leaving  Pai Shing, was immediately available.    The chairwoman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association,  Daisy Li, said she hoped the ATV news department would have  genuine editorial autonomy in future, and not just superficial  autonomy over its output. The union will meet with the six  resigning ATV staff on Saturday to consider ways to avoid  similar controversies.    The spokesman for the Press Freedom Action Group, Chung  Cho-hong, said he was troubled by Leung's appointment.  "Handling of the news depends on a lot of human factors," Chung  said. "So we are troubled that they hire someone with this kind  of background."    The group has called for Lee to make a public apology over  the Spanish documentary incident, and has collected more than  2,000 signatures on a petition calling for Chang to resign.  Chung said his group will not go ahead with a threatened hunger  strike outside ATV's Broadcast Drive studio, and will reconsider  its next step.    Legislative Councillors on Monday called for new television  licensing conditions to safeguard the editorial independence of  television news departments.</p>

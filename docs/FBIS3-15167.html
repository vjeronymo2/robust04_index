			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mykola Okhmakevych, president of the </F> Ukrainian Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, by UNIAN  correspondent Inha Balytska; place and date not given: "The  Itinerary of Ukraine's International Broadcasting Passes Through  Jerusalem"]    [Text] The first Ukrainian program was beamed to all  continents on 18 February. The only places where it will not be  seen are some regions in the Pacific and western parts of the  United States and Canada. From now on, every Friday, there will  be 50 minutes of Ukrainian Television on the international air.  This is the result of an agreement concluded between the  Ukrainian Television and Radio Broadcasting Company and Israeli  television structures. This event is commented upon by  president of the Ukrainian Television and Radio Broadcasting  Company Mykola Okhmakevych.    [Okhmakevych] During the times of the USSR, we did not give  much thought to using space for applied purposes. In those  times, Ukraine did not use artificial satellites for  broadcasting our programs to other countries, and there are  practically no other ways. As a result, the only television  program that has a satellite channel is "Ostankino."    When I was invited to negotiate with Israel's Television  (credit must be given to Ukraine's Embassy in Israel for the  preliminary work it did), I did not expect that in the very near  future, we would have regular satellite television broadcasting  to all continents. We are working with the organization  "Intergama." "Intergama" leases quite powerful satellites. It  turned out later that "Intergama" does not have enough programs  to work with. That is why an idea emerged: "Why not beam  Ukrainian Television programs on the international air?"    [Balytska] Who will prepare the international program and  what it will look like?    [Okhmakevych] For this, we are creating a special editorial  board (for the time being, about 10 persons). The first two  programs were made as a digest: information block, which may  present interest, and a number of interviews, which will  elucidate Ukraine's policy as we see it and not as the foreign  press comments upon it.    Speeches by the state's leading persons are planned. Various  information materials will be presented, including some concert  features. At first glance, everything looks somewhat eclectic,  but when we proceed to new proportions (I am sure that we will  expand them), we will build our program differently.    [Balytska] Consequently, the programs will be exclusively in  Ukrainian?    [Okhmakevych] Yes, they are meant for those who want to  watch Ukrainian-language programs.    [Balytska] Perhaps, it might be worthwhile to provide  translation so that those who have no command of the Ukrainian  language would also be able to obtain information on Ukraine?    [Okhakevych] I think that this might be possible at a new  stage, but not now. Approximately 20 million Ukrainians live  abroad, including nearby foreign countries. This program is  mainly for them.    [Balytska] "Non-foreign" Ukrainians will never see it?    [Okhmakevych] I think that, in the course of time, it will  also be possible to see it here -- we already have the  enterprise "Saturn" with corresponding technological means.    [Balytska] Tell me, please, where are you getting the money  for all of this?    [Okhmakevych] A joint Ukrainian-Israeli venture was created.  It must ensure the payment and even a possibility of getting  some profit (mainly through carrying advertisements). Besides,  "Intergama" works on connecting this channel to the cable  television of all consumer countries (there already exist such  agreements), and if there is stable reception, there may be  profits.    I hope that in the future, our program for abroad will be  available on a daily basis -- three or four hours a day and not  just once a week. The main thing is to just begin, and we have  done this.</p>

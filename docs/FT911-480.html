			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Arts: Heavenly choirs - Records WILLIAM BOYCE was a chorister at St. Paul's who later became Master of the King's Musick and organist to the Chapel Royal. He edited an important collection of English cathedral music and was a prolific composer of masques, anthems, chamber music and symphonies. He was one of our 18th century masters, sturdy, clean-cut and spruce. He wrote too little for the theatre. As his music for Dryden's The Secular Masque and the score put together by Constant Lambert for the ballet The Prospect before us show he had the genuine dramatic spark. That spark is present in the Serenata Solomon (1743), a setting of words by the Dublin writer Edward Moore based on the Song of Songs but falling on the profane side of the fence. This is a delightful work in the vein of Handel's Acis and Galatea, with amorous airs for He and She (as the lovers are called) with occasional choruses. Don't be put off by the initial nervousness of the soprano Bronwen Mills. She recovers in time to prove a worthy partner for the stylish tenor Howard Crook. Good support from choir and orchestra of The Parley of Instruments under Roy Goodman. Sir John Stainer, Eminent Victorian musician par excellence, was also a St Paul's chorister and later organist to the cathedral for many years. Like Boyce he did valuable musicological work. As a composer he was less productive and, to judge from The Crucifixion (1887), less rewarding. This 'Meditation' on the Passion was hugely popular in its time and still, it seems, has loyal admirers. The present Cathedral Choir is joined by the Special Service Choir founded by Stainer. The recording has just enough of Wren's echo. Andrew Lucas is the organist, John Scott conducts. They do their predecessor proud. In the narrations the two soloists, while sounding totally sincere, manage to skirt mawkishness. The baritone David Wilson-Johnson is more successful than the tenor Maldwyn Davies in avoiding the genteel pronunciation (guilt-ee, glor-ee) once thought seemly for religious texts. Did I hear someone sing 'Here in a basement'? Perhaps it was the echo. The form of The Crucifixion, with hymns doing duty for chorales, owes something to the Bach Passions, yet it is depressing to realise that the style, five years after Parsifal, 40 years after Elijah, is still mini-Mendelssohn. Yet Ethel Smyth's powerful Mass in D and Elgar's Gerontius were only a decade or so over the horizon. Meanwhile, go back to Boyce for comfort and still better to Purcell. A splendid bunch of his canticles and verse anthem (with the Funeral Sentences for the Death of Queen Mary), recorded by Decca during the 1970s with the choir of St John's College Cambridge under George Guest, is now available on CD. These works, blazing with vitality and originality, should restore anyone's faith in English music. Rossini's sanguine Stabat Mater (1842), gives a very different view of the crucifixion to Stainer's, as ebulliently Latin as the other is piously Anglo-Saxon. The new Philips recording from Bavarian Radio under the enlivening direction of Semyon Bychkov sweeps all before it - the concluding Amen chorus (does anybody still believe Rossini couldn't write a fugue?) has tremendous drive. The male soloists (Araiza and Furlanetto) are good, the women (Vaness and Bartoli) are outstanding (listen to the two latter in the duet 'Quis est homo'). But I hope the soprano won't admit any more vibrato into her tone. The EMI L'Enfance du Christ made in the chapel of King's College Cambridge by the Choir under Stephen Cleobury is decent but too soft-focussed. The boy angels are faultless, the men's unison recitatives in the soothsayer's scene unimpressive, the Choir as a whole is as expert as one would expect. Ann Murray's Mary is vividly human. Likewise the Herod of David Wilson-Johnson. The final, unaccompanied number threatens to go flaccid. Nothing flaccid about the Erato recording of 1988 under John Eliot Gardiner, made in the medieval church at Perouges near Lyons, and now available on CD. This conductor's acute understanding of Berliozian colour and accent, clearly conveyed by the Lyons Opera orchestra, provides exactly the sharp focus the music requires. The Monteverdi Choir is its usual excellent self, never more so than when they nobly sustain a slowish speed for the Shepherds' Farewell. Jose Van Dam gives an account of Herod's scene which one can hardly hope to hear surpassed for perfect legato suffused with expressive shading. Both narrators are British. Tear (EMI) and Rolfe-Johnson (Erato) are intelligent, musical and deeply committed artists. I recall years ago a Columbia 78 by the French tenor Jean Planel, whose serene objectivity seems in retrospect more appropriate than the modern singers' involvement. Boyce: Solomon (a serenata).

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Accounts body plan attacked THE Chartered Institute of Management Accountants has criticised the Accounting Standards Board's proposals for an operating and financial review in company accounts. The Cima response follows the publication in April of a discussion draft of the ASB review, which suggests that companies should be required to describe their activities in detail. Cima broadly supports the review, which echoes Canadian requirements and the discussion and analysis in US company accounts. It argues that the increases in management time, audit and other costs, including the preparation of the review, are such that 'the board needs to make a strong case for its provision'. It adds that the greater level of disclosure should not place UK companies at a disadvantage in relation to other European competitors. Cima says that too much detail is required in the review and that might add 10 pages to the average annual report. The review should concentrate merely on sales, profits and cashflow. It suggests that the review might include a statement from leading lenders to a company, giving their assessment of its financial needs and resources. Cima says the board's suggestion that the review should be voluntary will not work. To be effective, it should be enforced with an accounting standard or be a requirement for a Stock Exchange listing. Cima also argues that the review should be examined by auditors to ensure that it is not inconsistent with UK company law and that accounts give a true and fair view. It suggests that aspects of the review should be included in the recommendations of the Cadbury committee on financial aspects of corporate governance.</p>

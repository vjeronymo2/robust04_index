			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 9 June.    On 7 June the Central Bank reported that the Chilean trade  balance registered a $334.2 million surplus between 1 January to  15 May, with exports at $3.9001 billion and imports at $3.5659  billion. This figure differs from the $62.2 million deficit  registered during the same period in 1993, and confirms Chile's  rebound in exports, which had been affected in 1993 by the drop  in the prices of copper, cellulose, fishmeal, and fruit, among  other products. Economic authorities said that the increase in  the price of copper greatly contributed to improving the trade  balance. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1753 GMT 7 Jun 94)    The Andean Board, headquartered in Lima, reported that the  Andean Group has become a major Chilean trade partner in the  past few years. Sales to these countries went from $525 million  in 1992 to $585 million in 1993. However, exports to Japan  dropped from $1.714 billion to $1.543 billion; to the United  States from $1.58 billion to $1.532 billion; and to Brazil from  $451 million to $424 million. During this period Chile exported  to the Andean area a greater number of products than any other  country, with the number of various products rising from 2,456  to 2,509. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1638 GMT 3 Jun 94)    The Chilean Foreign Ministry Economic Department has  reported  that Chile's foreign investments since 1990 amount to $3.486  billion, out of which a total of $2.373 billion was invested in  Argentina, $636 million in Peru; $192.9 million in Brazil; and  $69 million in Venezuela. Investments were also made in Panama,  with $39.9 million; Cuba, $32.3 million; Ecuador, $16.4 million;  Bolivia, $7.5 million; Colombia, $6.9 million; Uruguay, $2.7  million; Costa Rica, $1 million; and Mexico, $750,000.

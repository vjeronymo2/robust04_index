			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan's trade and industry  minister on Thursday [26 May] urged business leaders to increase  employment of female college graduates, who are having great  difficulty finding jobs in the prolonged recession, government  officials said.    Eijiro Hata, head of the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI), made the request in a meeting with leaders of  the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren).    Noting that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has expressed  concern  over the lack of job opportunities for female graduates, Hata  said his ministry seeks help from the Nikkeiren, the officials  said.    They quoted Takeshi Nagano, president of Nikkeiren, as  saying  that it is an important task and the organization will act in  line with MITI's request.    Nagano, however, offered no concrete proposals on the female  employment issue, according to the officials.    The current economic downturn, which started about two years  ago, has prompted Japanese corporations to streamline their  businesses and to cut down on employment.    Surveys show that the number of job openings for new college  graduates, both male and female, fell about 20 percent this  spring and will further drop by around 25 percent in the spring  of 1995 -- about a 40 percent fall from the latest peak in 1992.    Nearly 13 percent of female students graduating from  colleges, universities and vocational schools in March had not  found jobs as of the end of February, a Labor Ministry survey  found.    A separate Labor Ministry survey last December found that  more than 52 percent of the 1,000 or so firms responding said  they were employing fewer women because more male students were  seeking work.    More than 30 percent of the companies said they were hiring  fewer female graduates from two-year colleges and high schools  because "women are working longer."</p>

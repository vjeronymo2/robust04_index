			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Warning on Lords change to pits bill The government warned last night that the proposed privatisation of British Coal could be derailed by a Lords amendment to the Coal Industry Bill. Peers voted 127 to 121 for a cross-party amendment requiring ministers to satisfy themselves that new owners can meet liabilities to landowners. The amendment is aimed at ensuring that potential owners of privatised pits can cope with liabilities such as the cost of cleaning up contaminated land. Lord Strathclyde, industry minister, said the amendment would 'create uncertainty' in the privatisation process. 'There would also be greater scope for judicial review.' Lord Morris of Castle Morris, Labour's energy spokesman, said the amendment would ensure that British Coal's 'so-called environmental time-bombs, such as subsidence, water pollution and contamination of land,' were taken into account. 'This is a great triumph in protecting the innocent people who may be adversely affected by coal privatisation in respect of land contamination and other potential damage to their property.' However, the government is likely to seek to reverse the amendment in the Commons. Peers also voted 83 to 72 for an amendment requiring pit owners seeking access to private land to pay landowners the higher of open market value or compensation for loss. A third amendment limiting conditions under which a compulsory order for access to land could be made was agreed without a division. This amendment restricts orders to cases where more than 250,000 tonnes of coal were thought to be available and where voluntary agreement had proved impracticable. The bill was given a third reading by the Lords and will return to the Commons shortly for a debate on the amendments. MPs last night voted by a majority of 133 (293-160) to reject a decision by the Lords which would have freed large garden centres, nurseries and DIY shops from all restrictions on Sunday trading.</p>

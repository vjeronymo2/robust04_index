			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Swans bidder may not proceed The only prospective bidder for Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, said yesterday it was reviewing whether it wished to proceed with the acquisition, in view of the attitude of the Ministry of Defence. French-based Soffia/Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie said it would make a decision over the weekend. Mr Fred Henderson, chairman of CMN Support Services in the UK, will fly to France today for discussions with Mr Iskandar Safa, head of Soffia. He said: 'I think there's a bias in favour of it not going ahead but that's not a definite decision. 'We have to look at the overall deal and see if it still makes sense, and in particular make our minds up whether we still have the same faith in the MoD agreeing to Swan Hunter carrying out contracts for them in the future. That is a serious doubt.' Time for a going-concern sale of Swan Hunter is running out. Price Waterhouse, the receiver, has set a deadline of Wednesday for CMN to start paying the wages of the design team, which is crucial to winning new orders. The MoD said last night that Mr Roger Freeman, defence procurement minister, had issued an invitation to Mr Safa to meet him in London within the next few days.</p>

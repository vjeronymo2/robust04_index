			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> D. A. TO KEEP STAFF OFF CRIMINAL JURIES  </P> <P> Ventura County prosecutors no longer would be allowed to serve on criminal  juries under a policy tentatively approved Tuesday by Dist. Atty. Michael D.  Bradbury.  </P> <P> The policy was drafted less than two weeks after a prosecutor served as foreman  on a Municipal Court jury that convicted an Oxnard man of being under the  influence of heroin.  </P> <P> Judge Steven Hintz, who allowed Deputy Dist. Atty. Terence M. Kilbride to sit  on that jury, granted a new trial Friday to William Lopez, 28. Hintz made his  ruling not because of Kilbride's jury service, but because he said the trial  prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kent Baker, violated Lopez's constitutional  rights by asking whether he had refused to waive his rights to an attorney when  he was arrested.  </P> <P> Bradbury said the new policy is "based on our conclusion that there is a  conflict of interest in that case and in all future cases."  </P> <P> Under the new policy, any prosecutor called to jury duty must tell the judge  about the policy and ask to be excused. If the judge refuses, the trial  prosecutor should ask the defense attorney to excuse the prosecutor-juror. And  if the defense refuses, the trial prosecutor should move to excuse the  prosecutor-juror from the panel, the policy says.  </P> <P> The Ventura County public defender's office already has a policy forbidding  deputy public defenders from serving on juries in cases that it represents,  Assistant Public Defender Jean L. Farley said.  </P> <P> About six months ago, Farley said Deputy Public Defender Susan Olson was  excused from the trial of a man who was being represented by a colleague,  Stewart Spivak, now a private attorney.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While many of the commenters supported the proposed provision, several commenters opposed it on several accounts, including that it would have an adverse economic impact on HMOs/CMPs, that adequate enrollee protections already exist, and that it would interfere with the patient-physician relationship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are aware that the right to immediate PRO review may add to the costs of caring for Medicare enrollees. It is difficult to assess the degree to which this will affect HMOs and CMPs, because many Medicare-contracting plans delegate the discharge decision to the physician and hospital. In these circumstances, PRO review has already been in effect and no additional financial impact is anticipated. In addition, some HMOs/CMPs pay hospitals on a diagnosis-related group basis and hospital payments may not be affected. In circumstances where the HMO/CMP makes the discharge decision in conjunction with its affiliated physicians and pays the hospital on a per diem basis and thus faces additional hospital charges, we do not concur with the commenters' position, that is, that the HMO/CMP not be held financially accountable for the additional hospital days. For risk-contracting HMOs/CMPs, the Medicare payment rate is based on fee-for-service costs, and the costs of extra hospital days during the PRO review process are incorporated into these calculations. Therefore, the average cost for hospital inpatient days during the PRO review period in the HMO's/CMP's area are already included in the adjusted average per capita cost rate. Since all cost-contracting HMOs/CMPs currently choose to have the hospital seek payment directly from the fiscal intermediary, there should be no additional costs to the health plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While we do not have evidence of early discharge complaints against HMOs and CMPs, it is possible that some Medicare enrollees are dissatisfied but have no mechanism for expressing it. Moreover, in the interests of due process, we believe it is important to provide beneficiaries comparable rights whether they do or do not enroll in an HMO/CMP, and whether or not they have the need to take advantage of those rights. Moreover, if there really are no complaints, then this will not be a burdensome requirement on HMOs and CMPs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, in response to concern about the patient-physician relationship, there has been no problem of this type arising out of the right to immediate PRO review under the fee-for-service program. Also, HMOs/CMPs, because they coordinate their enrollees' total health care needs, generally have a strong relationship between their Medicare enrollees and physicians (as well as other health plan staff). We believe that HMOs/CMPs that maintain positive communications and relationships with their Medicare enrollees will not experience any difficulty in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter was concerned about frivolous claims and the potential incentives to appeal to the PRO for review. This commenter suggested that either the Medicare program or the enrollee be responsible for the expense of extra hospital days if the noncoverage decision is upheld.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Our experience with immediate PRO review of hospital discharge (noncoverage) decisions does not support a concern about frivolous claims. Relative to the number of discharges under the Medicare fee-for-service program, the number of appeals to the PRO is extremely small. We expect that HMOs/CMPs, because they are more involved in the health care of their enrollees, would have a similar experience, and may even experience fewer PRO appeals if they communicate effectively with their enrollees and have adequate safeguards against premature discharges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

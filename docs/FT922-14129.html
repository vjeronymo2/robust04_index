			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / GM coup promotes ex-chief of Procter &amp; Gamble NON-EXECUTIVE directors of General Motors, the struggling US car manufacturer, have staged a palace coup, reducing the power of the company's chairman and demoting his chief lieutenant in an effort to speed a return to profitability. The move is a severe rebuke for Mr Robert Stempel, GM chairman for the past 20 months, who retains the title but has been replaced as chairman of the board's important executive committee, which oversees the running of the company between board meetings. His place has been taken by Mr John Smale, a former chairman of consumer products group Procter &amp; Gamble, who has been on the GM board for a decade and is believed to have played a central role in encouraging the board shake-up. The board announced late on Monday that it had replaced Mr Lloyd Reuss, GM's 55-year-old president and Mr Stempel's long-time lieutenant, with Mr John ('Jack') Smith, head of GM's international operations. Mr Smith has also been appointed chief operating officer, a title the board declined to give Mr Reuss when it reluctantly appointed him president in 1990 on Mr Stempel's insistence. Mr Reuss, who is responsible for GM's North American car business, has been widely criticised for the severity of its operating losses, which totalled some Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4bn) in 1991. Only two months ago Mr Stempel, responding to rumours that Mr Reuss might be ousted, insisted that 'Lloyd's my man'. Mr Smith, 54, is a former chief of GM's European operations who won praise in the mid-1980s for helping turn that business from losses into Europe's most profitable large manufacturer. Mr Stempel has been trying to similarly shake-up GM's bureaucratic and inefficient North American business and announced 70,000 job losses and 21 plant closures last December. But the board's action shows it has grown frustrated at the pace of change. It said in a statement: 'regaining profitability requires a more aggressive management approach to remove excess costs'. The board, which said its actions were approved by Mr Stempel, has also demoted the company's chief financial officer, Mr Robert O'Connell, who moves to head GM's finance arm, General Motors Acceptance Corp. He is replaced by Mr William Hoglund, formerly in charge of components operations. The moves were welcomed on Wall Street, where Mr Smith and Mr Hoglund are highly regarded but Mr Reuss has long been unpopular. Analysts said the shake-up should accelerate GM's existing restructuring plans and might make them more radical.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 20 (CNS)--China had a good harvest  last year in spite of many difficulties with the total grain  output reaching 450 billion kilograms, the cotton output four  billion kilograms, edible oil 16 million tonnes and meat 37  million tonnes thanks to people's efforts, better policies and  fine weather, State Councillor Mr. Chen Junsheng said.    China's Minister of Agriculture Mr. Liu Jiang, speaking at a  national agricultural work meeting, said that this year's goal  for agriculture and the rural economy was to raise the income of  farmers steadily and guarantee the supply of agricultural  products, causing an all-round development of the rural economy  with the aim of achieving a five percent increase in the per  capita income of farmers and a grain output of more than 450  billion kilograms and increases of 850 million kilograms for  cotton and one million tonnes of edible oil. These goals  indicate the government's desire to develop the agricultural  sector and its determination to better the living standards of  farmers despite many difficulties.    Many difficulties have been encountered in raising the  output  of grain and cotton because of lower profits and inflation  affecting production means, resulting in a dampening of farmers'  enthusiasm for growing these crops. The Minister of Agriculture  said that China's agriculture lacks a stable basis with the area  of land under grain cultivation last year down by seven million  mu over the previous year. The government would, he said, call  on the relevant departments to see to it that an area of more  than 1.6 billion mu under crop cultivation is maintained the  special loans were set aside for 500 counties to support their  cultivation of grain.    Cotton output was down last year resulting in a price hike  in  cotton and harmed the textile industry. The government has  therefore set the area of land under cotton cultivation this  year at 90 million mu and has decided to raise the purchase  price of cotton considerably besides arranging loans to 150  counties for the production of high-quality cotton.    The output of meat, poultry, eggs, milk, aquatic products,  fruit and vegetables, which are important to people's daily  lives all increased greatly last year and importance is place on  this year's production as well. Mr. Chen called for a big  increase of these products, saying that the outer suburbs of the  country's main cities should increase their areas for vegetable  cultivation to guarantee supply and keep prices stable.</p>

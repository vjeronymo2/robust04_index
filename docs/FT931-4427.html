			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / OFT weighs extension of credit protection THE OFFICE of Fair Trading is investigating whether small companies should be given similar protection to that available to the private individual under the Consumer Credit Act. The government has asked the office to establish whether small businesses, as consumers of credit and hire services, are sufficiently protected by the existing legislation. The move was announced yesterday by Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, at the annual conference of the Institute of Credit Management in London. At present sole traders and partnerships are treated in the same way as private consumers, but limited companies, however small, are excluded. The Consumer Credit Act requires credit organisations to provide purchasers with detailed information on the total cost of credit and imposes restrictions on credit companies repossessing goods if payments are not kept up. There was little support from the credit industry for a possible extension of protection beyond individual consumers. The Finance and Leasing Association said it would be inappropriate to extend the provisions of the act to companies because it contains many detailed provisions that would be unnecessary for the more sophisticated business customer. Ms Victoria Mitchell, legal secretary of the association, which represents more than 100 non-bank finance and leasing companies, said: 'The act assumes a low level of knowledge on the part of the purchaser.' Far from seeking to extend the act to limited companies, she said, the association had been lobbying to remove sole traders and partnerships from its cover. Some forms of credit, such as variable rate hire purchase agreements, could not be offered to private individuals under the act but were used by businesses. Extending the act would reduce credit options open to business, she added. Giving business users of credit extra protection would need specialist legislation, which the association said would not be in tune with the government's desire to reduce the burden of legislation on business. Barclays Bank said only about 10 per cent of its business customers would be affected by an extension of credit protection to companies because most were sole traders or partnerships. Both the granter of the credit and the customer would have to deal with more paperwork if the legislation were to be extended, it added. The OFT study forms part of a general review of credit legislation and credit industry practices.</p>

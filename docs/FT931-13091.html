			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Sweden to launch Y200bn, four-year Samurai deal SWEDEN plans to follow up its Y100bn Eurobond issue, launched 10 days ago, with a Y200bn Samurai deal due to be announced in Japan today. The issue, arranged by Nomura Securities, will be the largest Samurai bond (foreign bond in the Japanese domestic bond market). The latest offering will bring Sweden's SKr230bn (Dollars 30bn) borrowing package announced last autumn close to completion. Only SKr25bn (Dollars 3.5bn) remains to be raised, according to Ms Christine Holm of the Swedish debt office. It is not clear whether the completion of the programme will signal the end of the recent spate of Swedish offerings in the international bond markets. The Swedish parliament lifted restrictions on foreign currency borrowing last year, due to the country's mounting funding needs. The split between foreign and domestic borrowing is now due to be re-examined, but a final decision on the structure of Sweden's future borrowing is not likely to be decided until April. The four-year Samurai issue will pay a coupon of 4.2 per cent, and is partly swapped, according to Ms Holm. The cost of funds is more competitive than for the recent Euroyen deal, despite the higher fees charged in the Samurai market. The launch of the deal, so soon after the Euroyen offering, reflects strong demand for yen-denominated debt from Japanese investors so far this year. Strong expectations of a further rate cut and negative views on the stock market, have fuelled domestic demand for bonds. The deal is expected to be placed with a broad base of Japanese investors, both institutional and retail. Meanwhile, the National Bank of Hungary yesterday launched a Y40bn issue of five-year Samurai bonds, carrying a 6 1/2 per cent coupon. The deal was arranged by Daiwa Securities. The Asian Development Bank, which tapped the Euroyen market only last week, is also preparing to launch a Samurai bond offering, via Nomura Securities. A Y30bn issue of 20-year Samurai Bonds is due to be launched in the next month or so. In the Eurolira bond market, Swedish Export Credit launched the first swapped issue since the lira was withdrawn from the exchange rate mechanism last September. Since then, the European Investment Bank, which has a natural requirement for lira, has been the only issuer to tap the market. The L150bn issue of five-year bonds, via Credito Italiano, proved to be attractive to investors, due to the 12 per cent coupon. The Italian bond market has rallied strongly due to expectations of falling interest rates and an easing of concern about the currency. However, a lack of swap opportunities is likely to limit further supply in the sector. The Aa1 senior debt rating of the Halifax Building Society, placed under review for possible downgrade in December, has been confirmed by Moody's, the US ratings agency, which cited the society's strong pre-provision profitability.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Improved margins behind Roxboro's 51% advance Shares in The Roxboro Group rose 14p to 246p yesterday as the specialist electronics group announced a 51 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to July 1. Profits grew from Pounds 2.97m to Pounds 4.49m on turnover ahead 19 per cent at Pounds 26.1m, compared with Pounds 22.1m. The group came to the market in November at 230p and completed the acquisition of Solartron, a sensors, transducers and instrumentation group, for Pounds 43m in May. In a little over a month, Solartron contributed Pounds 726,000 to operating profits from turnover of Pounds 4.72m. Mr Harry Tee, chief executive, said that operating margins for the group had risen from 14.1 per cent to 17 per cent. For the full 1993 year they stood at 15.9 per cent. Solartron had been slightly margin dilutive, though Mr Tee said he would be very disappointed if it was to be more than that over the full year. He said that the group - now reorganised into three divisions: specialist components, sensors and instrumentation - was looking to expand further. He wanted to strengthen Dialight, the visual indication company, internationally, especially into Europe. The group also wanted to expand its sensors operations. BLP Components, the electro-magnetic products company, operated in 'smart' metering, which, according to Mr Tee, was a market waiting to take off. While the introduction of smart electricity meters depended on the regional electricity companies and Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, smart gas meters were more likely to grow in the short term. The large after-market helped Weston Aerospace, which makes sensors for aerospace applications, buck the trend in that sector and maintain high margins. Mr Tee said that instrumentation had the weakest margins, though there was good growth in vibration monitoring for turbines. Earnings grew 42 per cent to 8.1p (5.7p) and the maiden interim dividend is 1.5p, as forecast at the time of the Solartron purchase.</p>

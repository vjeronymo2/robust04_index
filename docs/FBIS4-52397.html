			<p>BFN     [Text] The government decided on 6 May to give top  priority to providing official development assistance (ODA) to  southern African nations, including Botswana, Mozambique, and  the Republic of South Africa [RSA], in which an administration  led by black citizens will be established. This policy, called  the "New Frontier Program," aims to provide comprehensive  assistance to southern African nations, which are attracting  much global interest, so as to improve the economic situation of  the whole region on the occasion of RSA's achieving the  historical change from white domination to multiracial  coexistence. Japan especially aims to stress the expanded  range of its international contribution, which tends to be  regarded as "Asian-oriented."    Providing ODA to the RSA has been allowed since 1990 only  for  the purpose of helping black citizens to become self-reliant.  However, by the end of 1992, Japan had only provided about 100  million yen in small-scale grants and technical cooperation.    Following the new administration's inauguration, it is  expected that larger assistance will be needed in the future.  Therefore, Japan wants to positively extend cooperation in the  form of loans and other aid on the premise that the OECD's  Development Assistance Committee will designate RSA as a  qualified recipient of assistance.    With regard to Mozambique, Japan has already decided to  provide it with full-fledged ODA in the form of bilateral  assistance, while also participating in UN Peacekeeping  Operations. Japan is now studying details of the plan.  Moreover, in light of the establishment of the new  administration in the RSA, Japan will expand its assistance  program to cover Botswana, where the Southern African  Development Community's secretariat is located, so that Japan  can carry out comprehensive assistance. Japan provided  Mozambique with about $200 million in bilateral assistance from  1988 to 1992, and Botswana with about $5 million from 1987 to  1992.</p>

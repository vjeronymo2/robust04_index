			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC NOTES  </P> <P> Nine leading Australian business groups have attacked Prime Minister Bob  Hawke's Labor government, accusing it of political expediency in delaying two  large projects to ensure that the environment is protected.  </P> <P> The government has refused to give the go-ahead for two large, export-earning  projects: a $780-million pulp and paper mill in Tasmania and a gold, platinum  and palladium mine in the Northern Territory.  </P> <P> In a joint statement released in Canberra, the nine groups said recent  government decisions had sent a clear message to Australian business. "That  message is: Resource development and business investment are subject to  short-term political expediency.  </P> <P> "The greatest threat to business investment is uncertainty. The uncertainty  created by a government that goes back on its undertakings is undermining  business confidence."  </P> <P> The government's decisions have not ruled out the projects altogether, but they  face lengthy delays, and the participants are unsure whether the projects will  ever begin. The groups said it was a fallacy for politicians and bureaucrats to  assume that deferral of investment proposals was costless.  </P> <P> "Business cannot confidently invest in the current climate," the groups  declared. "We urge the government to renew business confidence by establishing  and abiding by clear and firm guidelines for investment and environment  protection."  </P></p>

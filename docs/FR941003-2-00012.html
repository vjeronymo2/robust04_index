Issues for Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Information Infrastructure is a system of high-speed telecommunications networks, databases, and advanced computer systems that will make electronic information and entertainment products more widely available and accessible to the public than ever before. This increased availability and accessibility will dramatically affect the way information and entertainment products are created, marketed and delivered throughout the world. Consequently, the commercial viability of the NII hinges not only upon effectively promoting and encouraging use of the NII by types of users, but also upon implementing standards, policies and practices that ensure that the owners of products can effectively control access to and the integrity of their electronically disseminated products and services. In this regard, it is essential that the public and private sectors collaborate to ensure that the interests of owners and users of intellectual property are adequately considered in any discussion of proposed standards and policies that may be established. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To address the issues raised by the NII, the President formed the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF). The mission of the IITF is to articulate and implement the Administration's vision for the NII. The IITF is working with the private sector, public interest groups, Congress and State and local governments, to develop comprehensive telecommunications and information policies and programs that best meet the country's needs. The IITF is chaired by the Secretary of Commerce and is comprised of senior Administration officials having expertise in the technical and legal areas of particular importance to the NII. The NII Security Issues Forum was established within the IITF to address the cross-cutting issue of security on the NII. The Forum is chaired by Sally Katzen, Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the IITF, the President has established the U.S. National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIIAC). The NIIAC represents industry, labor, and public interest groups, and advises the Secretary of Commerce on issues relating to the NII. The Council has established three Mega-Projects which will form the backbone for initial programmatic work of the NIIAC. Mega-Project III, co-chaired by John Cooke of the Disney Channel and Esther Dyson of EDVenture, is responsible for addressing security, intellectual property and privacy issues as they relate to the NII. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Structure and Content of Public Hearing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Security is linked inextricably to the commercial success of the NII. The policies and procedures used to ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of digitally produced and transmitted products and services on the NII will determine whether, how, and at what cost such products and services will be made available. Without the existence of appropriate legal, technical and policy mechanisms, the potential of the NII to be a commercially viable means for delivering digital products and services cannot be realized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development of policies and procedures that will ensure commercial security of intellectual property on the NII requires study from different perspectives. One such perspective is the legal protection of intellectual property. This topic is presently being addressed by the IITF Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights, chaired by Bruce A. Lehman, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks. The Working Group on Intellectual Property has recently released a preliminary report on intellectual property issues on the NII and has conducted a series of public hearings to receive views on the preliminary report and any other concerns about intellectual property raised by the NII. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

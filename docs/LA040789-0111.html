			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Austrian artist Hundertwasser is a visionary jack-of-all-trades afflicted with  a slight case of megalomania. A driven man who designs stamps, national flags  and entire societies, the 61-year-old artist also writes manifestoes and makes  his own clothes. "I sew my own clothes," he says, "to show that life is  possible without money; trousers with stitches on the outside, rabbit skin  shoes, everything found in garbage bins."  </P> <P> Though Hundertwasser had extensive schooling and his work has much in common  with that of Paul Klee, Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, its strongest ties are  to outsider art. There is a manic intensity, a barely contained hysteria to  these images which, while espousing various utopian theories, churn with an  undercurrent of eroticism and madness. Hundert-wasser's vivid colors, obsessive  patterning and primitive motifs -- matched with his ideological naivete --  place him squarely in the folk art camp.  </P> <P> This survey of graphic work doubles as a seminar on Hundert-wasser's humanist  ideas on ecology and global harmony. Attempting to convey the universality of  man in portraiture, his images basically serve as illustrations for his  charmingly simple solutions to the ills of the world. (Planting gardens on the  roofs of buildings is a typical scheme.) However, despite the optimism of  Hundertwasser's ideas, his work hums with a strange vibe. Like illustrations  for frightening fairy tales, his work resonates with the same vaguely menacing  air that colors much European animation. Other pieces have the insipid  sweetness of work by Sister Corita Kent, and look like the kind of stuff you'd  find on the walls of a Montessori school.(Jack Rutberg Fine Arts Inc., 357 N.

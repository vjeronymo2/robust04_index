			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Faster inquiries aim to cut years off road building The government yesterday gave details of proposals aimed at shortening the time taken for public inquiries into new road schemes. With recent measures to reduce the length of the planning process, the effect of the proposed changes could be to cut total time taken to plan and build new roads from an average of 13 years to only eight, the transport department said. The government hopes to have the new rules in place by the summer after a three-month period for public consultation, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said in a Commons written answer. The main changes to the rules are: Giving a formal standing to pre-inquiry meetings so that contentious issues can be resolved early. Allowing the inspector to set a timetable for the inquiry in advance. Requiring statements of evidence to be presented and exchanged before the inquiry. Allowing the inspector to study long statements before an inquiry with only summaries read out at proceedings. Giving inspectors the right to refuse evidence they believe to be irrelevant or repetitious. The new rules would apply in England and Wales only. Scotland already has a 'fast tracking' procedure to speed roadbuilding programmes. 'These measures will bring highway inquiry rules into line with other planning inquiries while stopping deliberate attempts to slow their progress,' Mr MacGregor said. 'These tactics have in the past led to the waste of time and taxpayers' money,' he added, saying the new proposals would not diminish objectors' rights. Public inquiries form only part of the planning process but they can lead to substantial delays in roadbuilding. The extension to the M3 motorway at Twyford Down in Hampshire took 25 years before work started and involved three public inquiries. The M11 extension in east London, recently the subject of battles between police and protestors, also required three public inquiries. The new rules would not reduce the number of inquiries but should reduce their length. The British Road Federation welcomed the planned changes but said they would work only as part of a wider package including steps to cut delays within the Department of Transport, more generous compensation payments and increased public involvement at an early stage in roadbuilding. Mr Richard Diment, director of the federation, said: 'Britain's current planning laws are a recipe for blight and cannot deliver the quality transport system our country needs.'</p>

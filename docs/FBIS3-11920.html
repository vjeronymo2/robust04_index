			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "Group Occupies Surinamese Power </F> Station and Takes Staff Hostage"; as released by The Hague ANP  database]    [Text] Paramaribo, 21 Mar (ANP) -- For some hours now, the  members of a group calling itself the "Suriname Liberation  Front" have been occupying the Afobaka power station in  Suriname. They have taken hostage approximately 30 staff  members of the bauxite company Suralco, who were keeping the  power station operational.    The occupiers are demanding the resignation of the Venetiaan  government. Their ultimatum will run out on Tuesday at 10  o'clock local time. The authorities in Paramaribo have not yet  reacted to the occupation.    The power supply could be cut off at any time, informed  Suralco. The company supplies power to the Suriname energy  company which provides Paramaribo with electricity. According  to an anonymous spokesman for the group, a seven-mile stretch of  the road to the dam has been mined. The dam is located on Lake  Brokopondo, approximately 100 km from the Surinamese capital.    In a telephone call made to a radio station in Paramaribo,  one of the Suralco staff members among the hostages said that  the occupiers were demanding "the decentralization of power and  means of exercising power" and the resignation of the Venetiaan  government. "If any weapons are pulled out, then the state will  be responsible for the consequences," said the hostage.    The "Suriname Liberation Front" is complaining about  "economic abuses" and the bad situation regarding education and  health care. The group wants the activities of the Canadian  Golden Star company to be reviewed. Golden Star recently  concluded a contract with the Surinamese Government for gold  prospection in the area to the East of the dam.</p>

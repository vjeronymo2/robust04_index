			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Markets: Brokers eye recovery with suspicion - Wall Street LIKE a thrifty car buyer cautiously eyeing a second-hand model with suspiciously few miles on its clock, the US stock market is in no hurry to buy the latest economic recovery. In normal times, yesterday's November employment report showing a big rise in non-farm jobs and a handy decline in the national unemployment rate would be a cause for celebration among equity investors. What could be more pleasing than the sight of an economy building up a head of steam, just in time for the arrival of a new president who has pledged to correct long-term structural weaknesses in the economy with a healthy dose of public spending? This market, however, is reluctant to herald the new economic dawn, having made the mistake of proclaiming a recovery when the Gulf war ended in the spring of 1991 only to see it disappear like a desert mirage a few months later. Admittedly, there has been some strong buying of secondary stocks - the Nasdaq composite index has risen 9 per cent since election day to a succession of record highs. Yet, over the same period the Dow Jones Industrial Average has hardly budged, and although the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 has broken through to an all-time high, during the past month it has gained only 3 per cent. Yesterday morning's market performance typified the pattern of the past month. The Nasdaq continued to strengthen as investors sought out growth stocks, the S &amp; P 500 posted only a modest advance, while the Dow barely moved. This in spite of news of a 105,000 increase in November non-farm payrolls and a 0.2 percentage point drop in the unemployment rate to 7.2 per cent. Both figures were considerably more bullish about labour market conditions than analysts had expected. In some respects, equity investors are behaving more like bond investors. Their cautious embrace of the recovery reflects a concern that the combination of a reviving business cycle and fiscal stimuli from a new government could quickly lead to an overheated economy, one replete with rising inflation and rising interest rates. To make matters more confusing, the long end of the bond market rose yesterday following the jobs data, defying conventional wisdom that good economic news is bad news for long-term Treasury investors. Bond prices firmed because investors believe the strengthening economy will persuade President-elect Bill Clinton that his aggressive stimulus package of public spending and middle-class tax cuts is no longer needed, at least not on the scale originally envisaged. Much depends on how Clinton responds to yesterday's job figures. Until now, he has welcomed each sign of economic recovery, but also warned that structural deficiencies in the economy still need to be addressed. At the same time, however, sources in the Clinton camp have privately admitted that the incoming Democratic administration may tone down some of its more ambitious spending plans if the recovery maintains its current pace. If the new President does eventually decide to keep his foot off the fiscal accelerator next year, the stock market may then get what it most wants - relatively inflation-free economic growth. On the corporate front, one company finally facing up to its own structural deficiencies is General Motors. As part of a programme aimed at shrinking capacity to fit declining domestic demand, the car maker announced on Thursday plans to close nine more north American plants that employ 18,000 staff, and dispose of 14 per cent of its car components operations. GM unveiled its cost-cutting plans on the same day that official data showed that car sales are at their highest in nearly two years, but that GM's share of the US market is shrinking. In spite of the figures, investors seem to welcome GM's long-awaited restructuring, and the company's stock rose more than 4 per cent over the week to Dollars 33 5/8 . The large regional bank NationsBank was the subject of extraordinary trading activity this week when 28m shares changed hands in just one day. The huge volume was related to NationsBank's decision to offer shareholders the option to receive stock at a 5 per cent discount instead of a cash dividend on their shares. The market's biggest trading houses swarmed around NationsBank's stock like sharks at a feeding frenzy, because by using complex arbitrage strategies they could profit handsomely from the dividend reinvestment programme. Thus a policy aimed at encouraging the little fish to invest more in a company only served to leave the big fish a little fatter.  ------------------------------------ Monday        3305.16  +  22.96 Tuesday       3294.36  -  10.8 Wednesday     3286.25  -   8.11 Thursday      3276.53  -   9.75 Friday        3288.68  +  12.15  ------------------------------------</p>

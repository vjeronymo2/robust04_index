			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> MISSING BOY, 3, FOUND IN TIJUANA  </P> <P> A 3-year-old Van Nuys boy who was reported missing Thursday was found unharmed  this morning in Tijuana, and a suspect in the abduction was being questioned by  authorities there, Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> Hector Vasquez was reported missing at 8 p.m. but may have been abducted from  the front of his home in the 14700 block of Delano Street as early as 11 a.m.,  police said. The report was delayed because the boy's mother and other  relatives each mistakenly believed that he was in one or the other's care,  police said.  </P> <P> Lt. Dennis Dunn said an unidentified person told police that the boy was taken  to Tijuana. Two detectives drove to the Mexican border city and with help from  local authorities found the boy unharmed at the airport. A woman who was with  the boy was taken into custody, Dunn said.  </P></p>

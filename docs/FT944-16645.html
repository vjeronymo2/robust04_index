			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: International Paper earnings rise 47% The strength of the upswing in the US paper cycle was underlined yesterday by a 47 per cent jump in third quarter net earnings at International Paper, the world's largest paper company. Mr John Georges, chairman, said he expected even stronger earnings in the fourth quarter, and added: 'We believe that we will see even more robust growth in 1995.' Mr Georges said the economic upturn in the US, Europe and the Pacific Rim meant that the company was experiencing higher prices and greater demand for all its products. 'As the worldwide economies improve, we expect demand for paper and packaging products to grow faster than the industry's manufacturing capacity,' he said. Earnings were up in packaging and board and remained at a high level in forest products. Printing papers were in profit for the first time in two years, helped by a very strong market for pulp and a sharp recovery in Europe. However, profits were down in the group's speciality products division, a catch-all category which ranges from oil and chemicals to Ilford photographic film. Group sales in the quarter were up 11 per cent at Dollars 3.79bn, with the strongest rises in printing papers (up 19 per cent) and packaging (up 13 per cent). The slowest sales growth came in forest products (up 4 per cent), which had recovered earlier in the cycle. Pre-tax profits were up 40 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 167m, bringing the nine-month increase to 20 per cent. Earnings per share were up 47 per cent at 87 cents for the quarter - the highest figure since the second quarter of 1992, but still well below the levels reached in the last cyclical peak. The figures further contributed to a feeling of optimism in the US paper industry created by Scott Paper's Dollars 1.6bn sale of its SD Warren subsidiary to Sappi of South Africa on Monday. Analysts had commented that Scott's success in selling the business would be a test of confidence in the sector's outlook. After earlier gains, International Paper's shares fell Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 77 1/2.</p>

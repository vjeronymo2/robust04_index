			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Henrique Hargreaves, chief of the Brazilian </F> civilian household, by William Franca; place and date not given]    [Text] [Franca] Last week the government reviewed nine  provisional measures on varied subjects that Congress did not  discuss. Is there ill-will in Congress against the government?    [Hargreaves] The decision by Congress not to vote on a  provisional measure is sometimes a strategy, sometimes a lack of  consensus. But there is no ill-will. A political agreement  usually takes its time but Congress has one virtue: It respects  every agreement reached.    [Franca] In the recent case of the approval of the FSE  (Social Emergency Fund), the government had to make an extra  effort: The finance minister had to appear on television and  almost every minister appeared before Congress. Is it necessary  to exert "extra pressure" to get Congress to function?    [Hargreaves] No. We work to expedite the agreement, to  explain every point as best we can.    [Franca] Was the most recent cabinet reform, which took  place  last week, designed to broaden support in Congress?    [Hargreaves] Instead of reform I would rather call it  "cabinet change" because the structure was not modified. The  appointment of new ministers did not seek to broaden support in  Congress.    [Franca] What prompted President Itamar Franco to invite  General Bayma Dennis to occupy the Transportation Ministry? Why  not a politician or an technician in the transportation field?    [Hargreaves] The Transportation Ministry, although many may  consider it to be so, is not such a technical post. It is more  of an administrative post. There will be elections this year  and most politicians are running as candidates. Therefore, one  cannot chose someone for the Transportation Ministry who will  then resign to run for election in a month. As for a technician  in this field, no matter how much experience he may have, we  would not know how capable he would be of administrating this  ministry at this time of budget difficulties with the  "difficult" relationship with Congress. We do not deny that the  Transportation Ministry is experiencing administrative  difficulties. In view of all this, President Itamar Franco  decide to chose General Dennis, a military man who enjoys a good  relationship with politicians and, on top of that, is a good  administrator.    [Franca] In view of the "problems" in the Transportation  Ministry, was the appointment of Minister Margarida Coimbra, who  was a technician, a mistake?    [Hargreaves] I would not agree. But I did not belong to the  government when she was appointed.    [Franca] Does the presence of a considerable number of  military men -- on active service or retired -- in the upper and  middle echelons of government hint at a possible trend toward  the militarization of Itamar Franco's administration?    [Hargreaves] Why should all government officials be  civilians? Are they not considered equals? That is odd. There  is no division. The participation of women and men in the  government does not have to conform to a system proportional  representation, so why should civilians and military. The  question: why military? is always raised. Nobody ever asks: why  civilian?    [Franca] The Franco administration is civilian and not  military. Why then should it insist on that option?    [Hargreaves] I can explain that by giving you an example.  The Federal Police (whose current director is Colonel Wilson  Romao, retired) have always been headed by a member of the Armed  Forces -- with the exception of Romeu Tuma and Amaury Galadino.  They (the military) have always discharged their duties well.  Romao's appointment was made at a time of crisis that called  for a speedy reestablishment of discipline, and the military are  used to doing just that.    [Franca] And how about the Sudene (Northeast Development  Superintendency) and the special commission which is  investigating irregularities in the executive branch, which are  both headed by members of the Armed Forces?    [Hargreaves] Let us not close our eyes to the obvious: One  must acknowledge that the military are more disciplined and know  how to impose discipline.    [Franca] Is it easier for Planalto Palace to boss the  military around, given the fact that they are more disciplined?    [Hargreaves] I would not venture to say that it is possible  to put ideas into the heads of the military, I contended that  they are more disciplined and can discipline others better than  civilians.    [Franca] Following your line of thought, if prices were to  skyrocket we could find a military man heading the Sunab  [National Supply Superintendency] or some other economic  department.    [Hargreaves] I have no prejudices.    [Franca] On the question of government support in Congress,  you said the "cabinet reshuffle" did not seek to broaden its  support. Does this mean it already has the necessary support?    [Hargreaves] I would not say the latest votes reflect the  support the government has in Congress. I believe they are  related to the government's stance on the subject. This is not  the solid support that backs the government. I do not have  facts and figures to support this, but we have the backing of  congressmen from all parties rather than one party in coalition  with the government.    [Franca] Given that the government has to work with an  unspecified number of congressmen who have the most varied  political tendencies, how will negotiations at the Constituent  Congress be conducted?    [Hargreaves] A Constituent Congress cannot be compared with  the ordinary work of Congress. The latter functions in terms of  parliamentary support -- government and opposition -- whereas a  process involving an amendment to the Constitution has more to  do with ideological, programmatic, and even dialectical  questions.    [Franca] Does the government believe the outcome of the  Constituent Congress will measure up to its expectations?    [Hargreaves] Yes, it does, it does, (he repeats) it does.  The government also believes the outlook can be either good or  bad depending on how the vote on political issues goes. If  political issues do not fare well, the Constituent Congress may  lose all meaning.    [Franca] What do you mean by "fare well"?    [Hargreaves] That solutions be balanced; vested interests  must be left aside or the process will produce negative results.    [Franca] What do think about the idea to extend the deadline  for ministers and governors to resign from office in order to  run for another elective post?    [Hargreaves] I would rather not speak about specific  projects.    [Franca] Three weeks ago, President Itamar Franco stated in  Juiz de Fora that "if [Finance Minister] Fernando Henrique  [Cardoso] were to run for the presidency he would have the  support of the government." Is Planalto Palace endeavoring to  turn this hypothesis into reality?    [Hargreaves] I cannot answer your question. Planalto  Palace's overriding concern at present is the success of the  economic plan. If we mix the two, we will give the impression  that the economic program is linked to candidacies. They are  totally separate.</p>

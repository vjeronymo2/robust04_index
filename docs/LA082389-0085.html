			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> OREGON GETTING SET FOR WAGERING ON NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE GAMES  </P> <P> In a couple of weeks, a new football season opens in Oregon. Fans will walk up  to counters around the state, plunk down a dollar, make a few choices and leave  with a ticket -- their lottery ticket.  </P> <P> Before this summer, the National Football League and the state of Oregon  probably were never mentioned in the same sentence. Then along came a new,  controversial lottery and the result is a war of words over the ideals and  realities of U.S. sports, a war that yet may land another professional sport in  court.  </P> <P> The Oregon lottery game, approved by the state's lottery commission and  seconded by the state's legislators in July, is called Sports Action. For as  little as a dollar and up to $20 a card, players pick four to 14 NFL games  against the point spread. Picking four games correctly will pay about $8 on a  $1 card. Fourteen of 14 is expected to pay about $8,000.  </P> <P> Oregon Lottery officials predict sales of $10 million to $30 million this  season. And after paying off winners and administrative costs, the lottery's  proceeds will go to the athletic departments of the state's seven universities  and colleges. Between $4 million and $9 million is expected to benefit college  sports in the state, with a potential $3 million apiece going to the University  of Oregon and Oregon State this year.  </P> <P> The NFL hates this. It is on record as being opposed to gambling on its games,  even though point spreads are an unmistakable part of newspaper statistics and  televised network football broadcasts. And the fact that the money goes to fund  college sports makes matters even worse, according to the league.  </P> <P> "We view it as a change in the traditional stance that colleges have taken in  opposition to legalized gambling," said NFL spokesman Joe Browne. "We're all  for full funding of athletic programs, but not for piggybacking on NFL games in  this way."  </P> <P> Administrators of both the lottery and college athletic departments in Oregon  love it. Gambling is a fact of life, they say, and their game is small change  to the big money of Las Vegas bookmaking. They are happy to take whatever they  can get.  </P> <P> "It's terrific," said Oregon Athletic Director Bill Byrne. "We have the only  state legislature in the country that chose not to fund women's sports when  Title IX was instituted, so we had to drop swimming and baseball to add women's  programs in 1980. Those sports won't come back because of this, but the money  certainly will help us. All this is, really, is a state-run office pool. I have  no problem at all accepting the money."  </P> <P> The NFL still is considering legal action, Browne said, but it must act fast:  The season starts Sept. 10. NFL attorney James B. Noel recently met with Jim  Davey, director of the Oregon Lottery, to find out the specifics of the  lottery.  </P> <P> "Now we see where we go next," Browne said.  </P> <P> Faced with a similar situation in 1976 in Delaware, the NFL sued and lost, but  the lottery went under during the appeals process. Projected revenues of $6  million to $8 million fell far short; the lottery did about $700,000 in  business.  </P> <P> But the Delaware lottery was different from the new Oregon lottery. Delaware  had predetermined winnings, while Oregon is going to use a parimutuel payout  system, meaning that winners receive a share of the prize pool. Also Delaware  officials set their own point spreads; Oregon officials plan to use a Las Vegas  oddsmaker. This, the folks in Oregon say, will lead to more realistic odds.  </P> <P> "I think they might be successful, just on a smaller scale than Las Vegas,"  said Mike Tenay, a supervisor at the race and sports book of the Gold Coast  Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. "It's the office pool, only larger stakes. I  like the idea."  </P> <P> In a 1977 opinion in a federal court in Delaware, Judge Walter K. Stapleton  said that betting on NFL games had been going on so long without damaging the  league or its reputation that there was no reason to stop the Delaware lottery.  But, Browne said, the NFL "felt very strong" about its chances on appeal when  the lottery folded and the case was dropped.  </P> <P> Since then favorable decisions on trademark and licensing issues "would help  our case, we feel, if we do go to litigation," Browne said.  </P> <P> But Davey said the lottery commission is aware of those concerns and has been  careful to avoid conflicts with the NFL in its new game.  </P> <P> "We use no team nicknames, no team colors, no team uniforms," Davey said. "It  will just say Washington and Dallas, with the point spread. That's it."  </P> <P> The advertising also is generic. Posters appear at the counter showing football  players in nondescript uniforms.  </P> <P> There also is a disclaimer saying the game is not sponsored or promoted by the  NFL.  </P> <P> "If the NFL is so concerned about gambling, why don't they go into Nevada and  clean that out? We have $1 bets. They have $1 million bets. Go after the big  boys, then come after us," Davey said.  </P> <P> The problem isn't Oregon, but the developing trend that has the NFL all worked  up. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia conduct lotteries, but  none, save Delaware, ever involved professional team sports.  </P> <P> "We are not concerned about the two senior citizens in Oregon putting down $1  on a gambling sheet," said Browne. "What we are concerned about is what this  will lead to."  </P> <P> Lottery officials in Kentucky are talking about a similar game, and New  Hampshire and Massachusetts are interested. "We don't want to see this  throughout the 50 states," said Browne.  </P> <P> The amount of money gambled on sports in this country in a year is staggering:  an estimated $20 billion to $40 billion. Counting non-sports betting, estimates  range to more than $200 billion, with approximately $40 billion going through  illegal bookmakers, Davey said.  </P> <P> "We don't think we're expanding gambling at all," he said.  </P> <P> What bothers the NFL is the thought that fans, betting legally, will be more  concerned about the point spread than about their team winning or losing. As  for Las Vegas, the sports books were doing business "when we were simply a  cottage industry," Browne said.  </P> <P> "The lottery commission says the state will reap the benefits that now go to  the neighborhood bookie," he said. "Well, if people believe that, I've got a  bridge in New York I'd like to sell them. This state-approved lottery allows no  credit, no tax-free earnings and gives smaller odds and smaller payoffs than a  bookie. Rather than taking business away from a bookie, lotteries like this  will just produce a new generation of gamblers in America."  </P> <P> "You have to laugh a little bit at the NFL's argument," retorted Byrne, who  said the estimated $3 million that the Oregon athletic department will receive  will just about cover the cost of non-revenue sports this year.  </P> <P> "They raise the specter of the evils of gambling on a $1 bet. I've heard them  mention organized crime. It's just a little bit ridiculous. I haven't heard the  NFL complain about oddsmakers on TV. They seem to enjoy the broadcasting  revenue. They don't complain about point spreads in the paper."  </P> <P> Byrne also said it's not a novel idea for money bet on state lotteries to be  sent to state colleges and universities.  </P> <P> "We will fund our faculty salaries from video poker," he said. "A $50 million  science center is under construction at the University of Oregon, thanks to the  lottery. The $100 million Portland Convention Center too. If it's perfectly all  right for the lottery to fund these things, why not help the athletic programs  too?"  </P></p>

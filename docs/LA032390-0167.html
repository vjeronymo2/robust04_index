			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARRIAGE CAN BE BETTER FOR THOSE TRYING 2ND TIME WITH EACH OTHER  </P> <P> Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton did it.  </P> <P> Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner did it.  </P> <P> Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson did it just last year.  </P> <P> And so did Barbara and Bobby Carr.  </P> <P> Although the Carrs, a Maryland couple, cannot be counted among celebrity  twosomes, they do have the distinction -- as do those Hollywood duos -- of  having married, divorced and remarried each other.  </P> <P> The Carrs were married the first time on Jan. 1, 1981; that was the second  marriage for both and brought together his son and her two daughters from their  respective first marriages.  </P> <P> The two separated in May, 1987, divorced in February, 1989, and remarried  quietly in a civil ceremony in June, 1989, and in a public, religious ceremony  Oct. 7.  </P> <P> "Now we're happy and we choose to be together because we want to be, not  because we need to be," said Bobby Carr, 46.  </P> <P> "We paid a high price, (but) the reward is amazing," said Barbara Carr, 41.  </P> <P> They communicate better now, she says. There is more honesty in the  relationship, and they realize how lucky they are to have another chance at a  life that was good for several years.  </P> <P> How many couples get back together after divorcing seems impossible to say. The  National Center for Health Statistics, which tracks marriages and divorces,  does not count this subgroup. The Carrs' relationship turned sour on Bobby's  "alcohol problem," which worsened during the six years of their first marriage,  he said, "and continued to intrude on our life," especially during the last 18  months they were together.  </P> <P> When Barbara "got tired of trying," she left, he said. It was May 15, 1987.  Bobby remembers the date without hesitation.  </P> <P> "I was not at all happy about her leaving, but in a way she did me a great  favor," he said. "It took that kind of emotional shock for me to hit bottom."  </P> <P> Bobby's life took a turn for the better on Sept. 3, 1987, when he began  attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and "worked that program eagerly." He  also made up his mind "that there was a way to reconcile with Barb."  </P> <P> But their lives apart took several more turns -- including a new relationship  for Barbara -- before they turned back to one another. In June, 1988, she filed  for divorce, but it was not granted because Bobby refused to agree that "there  was no chance of reconciliation," as the law requires.  </P> <P> Eight months later, in early 1989, Bobby agreed to the divorce and it became  final. Barbara remembers that she was anything but happy. While still in the  office of the master (an attorney appointed to review divorce agreements before  they go to a judge), she recalls thinking: "I don't want this. I really still  love this person.  </P> <P> "I cried the whole weekend."  </P> <P> "The only remaining link (between them) was the automobile she was driving that  was in my name," he said.  </P> <P> When Bobby called to suggest that she refinance the car in her name, he found  out that Barbara had ended the relationship she had been involved in. Bobby  seized the moment and asked her for a date. She agreed. That was in April.  </P> <P> The former husband and wife continued to date, to talk, to try to work things  out.  </P> <P> Early in May, Bobby went to Seattle for five days. They missed each other "a  lot" and began to keep "extremely steady company thereafter," Bobby says,  although they continued to live apart. "We talked about the possibility of  getting married again."  </P> <P> Again, Bobby seized the moment. He went to the courthouse and got a marriage  license, which is valid for six months. When he brought it to Barbara, she put  it in a drawer. Then, in June, she said, "let's go over to the courthouse and  get married." It was the day of her older daughter's high school graduation.  </P> <P> So, after the graduation on June 13, Barbara and Bobby Carr were married again.  But they didn't tell anyone. And they didn't move in together until the end of  summer. Several weeks after the courthouse marriage, they told the children,  who were thrilled. (The Carrs had no children from their earlier marriage to  each other.) Then they told Barbara's parents, who were also happy, and finally  their close friends.  </P> <P> Although it is nearly impossible to categorize couples who recouple, the Carrs  fit at least one criteria identified by doctors and counselors who have worked  with such people. Their relationship underwent an obvious change: Bobby's  successful battle with the bottle.  </P> <P> Couples who undergo behavioral changes are among those ripe for recoupling,  says JoAnn Magdoff, a NewYork psychotherapist who has worked with similar  couples. She identifies two more groups of people predisposed to getting back  together:  </P> <P> * Those who married young and feel that life is passing them by. These people  often divorce and go out into the world only to find that the grass wasn't so  brown at home. So they remarry. "They're sowing their wild oats in the middle  (of a marriage)," Magdoff says.  </P> <P> * Couples with an extensive history, particularly those with children. "Who  else was there when your child was born? No one else who you meet later shares  that," she says.  </P></p>

The delegation includes party Secretary General Eugenio  Manuvakola, the leader of the delegation; Information Secretary  Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim; Dr. Isaias Samakuva; and Cipriano  Chipipa, the party representative in Zambia. Senior party and  government officials as well as members of the General Staff of  the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola welcomed the  delegation. Our correspondent Lourenco Bento interviewed  Manuvakola on arrival:    [Begin recording] [Manuvakola] We have come here for  consultations. We have been in Lusaka for over two months now.

The government has not done so  yet.    [Bento] Circles in Luanda have described the Lusaka talks as  a carnival. Do you share the same view?

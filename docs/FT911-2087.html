			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Government Bonds: Treasuries advance after Fed's surprise cut in rate BOND prices firmed at both ends of the market yesterday after the Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut the discount rate and signalled a lower Fed funds rate. In late trading the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up  5/32 at 96 1/2 , to yield 8.183 per cent. The two-year note was up  5/32 at 100 3/8 , yielding 6.779 per cent. The Fed's decision to lower the discount rate from 6 per cent to 5 1/2 per cent stunned the market, which had been convinced that the Fed's refusal to cut rates a few weeks ago following bad jobless figures and good inflation data, and its recent operations in the credit markets, indicated that the authorities were determined not to loosen monetary policy any further. The rate cut suggested that the Fed was more worried about the state of the economy than the markets had previously thought, said analysts. Yesterday's figures showing a 2.8 per cent decline in March factory orders and a weak purchasing managers' index for April reinforced the view that the economy is taking a long time to come out of its current slump. The relatively subdued response to the rate cut from the long end of the market was down to a reluctance among dealers to push prices up too high before next week's big auctions of three-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds. Although the discount rate move was unexpected, the Fed's pre-noon intervention in the credit markets was anticipated. The Fed conducted Dollars 3bn in customer repurchase agreements to add reserves to the banking system, a move designed to push the Fed funds rate to a new target of 5 3/4 per cent. Fed funds did hit 5 3/4 per cent during the day, but by late afternoon the rate had firmed to 5 15/16 per cent. GERMAN government bond prices showed strong gains yesterday following the 0.5 per cent cut in US interest rates, which killed fears that the Bundesbank might raise German interest rates at Thursday's council meeting. Traders said that prices firmed across the yield curve and they expected to see some buying of shorter dated bunds now that there was less chance of an interest rate increase. They noted that there had already been some buying of shorter-dated bunds before the US cut was announced as investors moved out of longer-dated bunds. The D-Mark firmed after Mr Horst Koehler, state secretary in the Finance Ministry, said in Washington he saw no chance of Germany cutting interest rates for the time being. The Bundesbank yesterday accepted bids for a total of DM40.4bn in a two-tranche tender for securities repurchase funds. It offered DM29.5bn of 34-day funds at 8.6 per cent and DM10.9bn of 62-day funds, mostly at 8.9 per cent, which means that a net DM4.9bn will be drained from the market. Traders said that yesterday's pay strike by more than 200,000 western German engineering workers was a cause of concern to the market. Critics of the engineering workers' wage demand say their 10 per cent claim threatens to slow economic growth in western Germany and throttle the east German recovery, and the union's demands have evoked strong criticism from the Bundesbank as well as from employers. JAPANESE government bond yields fell against the background of lower US interest rates and rekindled hopes that the Bank of Japan would cut the official discount rate soon. The yield on the benchmark No 129 government bond dropped two basis points, from 6.73 per cent to 6.71 per cent, in London as soon as the US discount rate cut was announced. The yield opened at 6.705 per cent in Tokyo and dipped to 6.69 per cent before closing at 6.73 per cent. Traders said they expected to see a flattening of Japan's inverse yield curve as yields at the short end came down. The strengthening of the yen against the dollar should make it easier for the Bank of Japan to countenance a cut in the official discount rate. However, Japan's finance minister, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, yesterday echoed a statement from a Bank of Japan official in Washington to the effect that Japan would not match the US rate cut. UK government bond prices rose yesterday with shorter maturity bonds gaining more than long-dated gilts, in response to the US rate cut. Trading began in a gloomy mood following the results of the Confederation of British Industry industrial trends survey, which indicated that an upturn in the British economy was still some way off. However, prices recovered after the US announcement. The benchmark 11 3/4 gilt due 2003/07 rose from 109 15/16 to 110 1/16 to yield 10.245 per cent. THE FRENCH Treasury said it would offer FFr6bn-FFr8bn of tap stock (OAT) tranches at its next monthly auction tomorrow. The new 9.50 per cent OAT due 2001 will be one of the taps on offer and will become the 10-year benchmark as its liquidity increases.</p>

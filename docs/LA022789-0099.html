			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> HUNGARY ASKS U.N. ROMANIA PROBE  </P> <P> Hungary, in an unprecedented attack by one East Bloc state against another,  today demanded that the U.N. Commission on Human Rights investigate violations  of basic freedoms in neighboring Romania.  </P> <P> Gyula Horn, Hungarian state secretary for foreign affairs, delivered the demand  at the commission's annual meeting. Horn specifically denounced the repression  of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Romania and a wholesale destruction of  villages to facilitate a forced industrialization program ordered by Romanian  leader Nicolae Ceausescu. Budapest backs a Swedish proposal that the U.N. human  rights body appoint someone to investigate Romania, he said.  </P></p>

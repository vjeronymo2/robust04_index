			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Chrysler to sell car wiring division Chrysler, the US car manufacturer, announced yesterday that it will sell its Mexico-based Acustar electrical wiring division to a newly formed US subsidiary of Yazaki Corporation, one of its Japanese component suppliers. After the sale is completed, Chrysler said it would enter a supply agreement to purchase wire products manufactured by the Yazaki unit. The terms of the deal were not revealed, but the Acustar wire division, which has almost all of its 11,000 employees based in eight assembly plants in Mexico, had sales worth approximately Dollars 300m in 1993. Industry analysts estimated that the deal was worth anything between Dollars 25m and Dollars 100m. In selling Acustar, Chrysler is following the lead of Ford and foreign car companies, which have been recently selling their low-tech, labour-intensive component manufacturing operations to specialist suppliers. Chrysler said that one of the motives behind the sale was that it would allow Acustar to achieve Mexican national supplier status, which makes it easier for the operation to sell its products in the Mexican market. This will benefit Chrysler's subsidiary in Mexico, the company said, because by buying wiring components manufactured by a Mexican supplier, Chrysler will be entitled to receive more export credits from the Mexican government.</p>

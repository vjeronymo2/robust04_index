The IAEA is going to consult with North Korea on details of  the inspection soon, and the United States is trying to persuade  it to allow the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks  to make a decision on the issue of taking samples, the daily  newspaper quoted a South Korean Government source as saying.    North Korea said that, of its seven declared nuclear  installations, it would rather not allow inspections of the  5,000 kilowatt experimental reactor and radiochemical  laboratory, according to the paper.    Pyongyang has insisted that it would never allow the  inspectors to take samples from fuel rods, a process that is  indispensable to measuring of the amount of plutonium that has  been extracted.    The United States agreed to discuss the sample problem and  special inspections of two undeclared sites in the high-level  talks, the paper said.    At an inspection in 1992, the IAEA asked North Korea for  fuel  rod samples but was rebuffed.    "We had not prepared to halt our experimental reactors,"  they  were told. "The crane to pull up the fuel rods is out of order."    With the North Korean condition, the IAEA is dissatisfied  with the inspection, but the United States is persuading it that  it is more important to solve the North Korean nuclear problem  through dialogue, the ASAHI said.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Bright spot in the gloom - In spite of the recession, prices for antique jewellery are holding up well and sales seem little affected The jewellery business is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy economic scene. Right at the top of the market, in that world where rising mortgage interest rates hold no fear, and right at the bottom, where a pair of earrings can do wonders for a woman's morale, sales seem little affected. In the sale rooms, the main bar to ever-increasing volume is not the lack of willing buyers but the fact that supplies, far from rising, are strictly limited. In times like these there is something infinitely reassuring about antique jewellery. Prices for signed pieces by the great French jewellers - Boucheron, Cartier, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, La Cloche - have held their own and more through the months of war and recession, while truly remarkable pieces  -such as the huge, beautiful sapphire brooch that Christie's sells next week in Geneva, or the Van Cleef &amp; Arpels mutli-gem set brooch that Phillips sold, again in Geneva, last November  - continue to command the sort of attention and prices that made the 1980s boom. At the less extravagant end of the market, Georgian rings, Victorian brooches and turn-of-the-century necklaces not only have considerable charm and are a delight to wear but, most important, their value is tried and tested. Buying modern may be exciting, but it is usually a much less secure investment. There is a salutory tale told of what happened when one of London's leading modern jewellers needed to sell most of his wares. In spite of a high-profile name and a reputation for exciting design, the auction house charged with the sale only managed to realise, on average, some 10 per cent of the listed retail price - in other words, his rent, mark-up and manufacturing costs were so high that some 90 per cent of the price of each piece was attributable to things unrelated to its intrinsic value. At auction, for example, although each house charges commission, there are no high retail mark-ups, no long line of people who all need to take their cut. All this means that it is still possible to find a good Georgian or early Victorian piece for anything between Pounds 800 and Pounds 1,000; those with up to Pounds 2,000 to spend are almost spoiled for choice. On top of that, if ever the owner needs to sell, he or she stands a fair chance of getting their money back. To the would-be buyer the best advice is the oldest - choose pieces that give you real pleasure, for then you will always have a bargain, no matter what you paid. Go, if possible, for a piece with a designer's name. The collector's market for named pieces is increasing daily: Mark Twain's memorable remark about land - 'they aren't making any more of it' - applies just as surely to antique jewellery. An instantly recognisable piece by a known designer can do nothing but become more sought-after. As antique real jewellery becomes more scarce, a new market has recently opened up - costume jewellery. The craze for the costume jewellery of certain distinguished houses started in the US, but in the last few years it has spread to this country. Christie's, for instance, now holds regular sales at its South Kensington auction rooms. It all started about two years ago when an elderly woman with a large personal collection came in wanting to know if they could sell it. They could and they did, proving that here was yet another market to explore. Costume jewellery from before the Second World War and the late 1940s and early 1950s is usually of high quality, but when it comes to collecting, a certain lineage is everything. Trifari, Chanel, Christian Dior, Schiaparelli are the golden names at the top of collectors' lists but look out, too, for Mazer, Jomaz and Boucher. However, some auction houses (Phillips, for instance) have found that whereas a year or two ago old costume jewellery was a hot seller, the market has since settled down and only the best, the really wearable, finely-made pieces are reaching the prices their sellers hope for. If you are looking for single pieces to wear and enjoy, you may well find dealers a better bet than sale-rooms. For instance, Christie's now has a minimum commission charge of Pounds 20, so only the larger and more valuable pieces are sold individually - the less distinguished or less expensive pieces are grouped in lots ranging from Pounds 150 upwards. Rooting around an individual dealer's collection can still bring its rewards  -there are some who were buying individual pre-war pieces by Miriam Haskell for well under Pounds 40 just last year. There are less distinguished pieces of costume jewellery (often only in the sense that they are of unknown provenance, not of inherently less charm) lurking in stalls at Gray's Antique Market, at Alfie's and all the usual marketplaces that represent wonderful value for money compared with the offerings in the costume jewellery departments of most stores. As with any jewellery, the golden rule is to buy the highest quality you can afford. There are few undiscovered bargains to be had. Everybody seems agreed that buyers are becoming more knowledgeable - about stones, settings and designs - so anybody risking their own taste at an auction had better do their homework first. Serious collectors need to know whether the piece is good for its type, how its setting or workmanship relates to similar pieces, how its designer is rated and just how fine the intrinsic materials are before investing their hard-earned cash in a valuable piece. Some auction houses (Phillips, for instance) have found that whereas a year or two ago, old costume jewellery was a hot seller, the market has settled down and only the best, the really wearable, the finely-made pieces are reaching the prices their sellers hope for.</p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: STEVE HOWE CAN RETURN TO MAJORS IN 1991  </P> <P> Steve Howe, the former Dodger pitcher who has been suspended six times for drug  and alcohol problems, will be allowed to return to the major leagues starting  in 1991, Commissioner Fay Vincent said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Howe, released by the Texas Rangers on Jan. 19, 1988, for using alcohol in  violation of his aftercare program, can return to the minor leagues this  season, Vincent said.  </P> <P> Howe, who will be 32 Saturday, was the National League's rookie of the year in  1980, but was released by the Dodgers, Minnesota and Texas because of his  problems. He was suspended for the 1984 season by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn for  cocaine use.  </P> <P> "While I believe a lifetime ban is fully warranted in this case, I resolve the  doubts raised by the conflicting medical and psychological problems in Howe's  favor and will offer him yet another chance to return to the game," Vincent  said.  </P> <P> Vincent added that Howe would be removed from the game if he tests positive, or  has a relapse. He will be tested as often as every other day.  </P> <P> Howe spoke to Vincent on Feb. 8. Howe has a 29-31 career record with 60 saves  in his seven major league seasons.  </P></p>

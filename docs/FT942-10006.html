			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germany wrestles with energy puzzle - The problems posed by deregulation plans After introducing virtual monopoly structures in eastern Germany's gas and electricity sector, western Germany's utilities are now embarking on another task: finding ways to protect their position against plans by the federal government in Bonn and the European Union to deregulate the energy sector. Yesterday the EU's working party on energy met to prepare a draft paper on deregulation of the energy sector, which is expected to be presented on May 25. At the same time, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics ministry, is planning to use the German presidency, starting on July 1, to open up Germany's energy sector to more competition. Mr Rexrodt has already outlined his proposals for the revision of energy policy and cartel legislation. They include the abolition of voluntary demarcation agreements and franchise agreements with utilities and local authorities; the introduction of third party access to gas grids; and cost transparency. One of his aims is to make Germany more attractive to investors. But this would also mean eventually phasing out the Kohlpfennig, a levy paid by western German customers to the electricity companies to subsidise the coal industry. At the moment, the Kohlpfennig subsidises German coal by about DM200 (Pounds 80) a tonne to keep out coal imports, which cost about DM80 a tonne. As a result electricity prices for German industry are among the highest in Europe. Yet Mr Rexrodt, especially in an election year, cannot scrap the Kohlpfennig, which would threaten 100,000 mining jobs. So far, Mr Rexrodt's proposals for deregulation have been sharply criticised by the opposition Social Democrats and the country's powerful energy sector. Mr Martin Weyand, head of the energy department at BGW, Germany's association for Gas and Water, says they are flawed for several reasons. 'There is no reciprocity,' he argues, adding that foreign companies would be able to supply the German market but German suppliers would not have access to foreign markets. The BGW also believes that long-term supply contracts with high take-or-pay obligations would be replaced by short-term contracts, which would not guarantee secure supplies. It argues too that the obligation to connect customers and guarantee supply would no longer be met. And finally, the BGW says it is not clear how private investors, who built the grids in the first place, would be compensated for the use of their property and services. Yet the BGW and the German utilities, including RWE and PreussenElektra, recognise that the debate over de-regulation of the energy sector is now firmly on the agenda in Bonn, and in Brussels. The question is how the utilities will be able to maintain a position giving them exclusive demarcation rights on distribution and supply. 'The Rexrodt paper could backfire,' says one energy expert. 'If a company wanted to switch to another electricity supplier, in most cases the new supplier would have to supply through the network owned by the regional distributor and original supplier. The fees would be high. The company might end up even paying more.' Yet recent examples in eastern Germany have shown that foreign competitors can co-exist with domestic distributors without disrupting supplies, and at the same time give the consumer more price flexibility. A case in point is the Anglo-American consortium headed by Britain's PowerGen and NRG of the US, which recently bought a 44 per cent stake in a power generating plant owned by VKR, a subsidiary of PreussenElektra in Schkopau, near Leipzig. Another example is Wintershall, the gas division of BASF, the chemicals group, which is investing DM5bn in building new pipelines across Germany. 'We are in here for the long term,' says Mr Herbert Detharding, chairman of Wintershall. 'We are slowly denting the monopoly and introducing competition. And everybody knows there's room for competition in this country.' But Germany's established utilities still don't see the reason to compete. 'If we have to compete, then make the playing fields level. But why change the system when the present one works.'</p>

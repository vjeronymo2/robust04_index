			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / International Company News: Adidas seeks DM150m injection ADIDAS, the troubled German sporting goods group controlled by Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French businessman, plans to raise up to DM150m (Dollars 98.60m) from a refinancing package. The announcement comes amid speculation about Adidas' future following the collapse last month of the proposed Pounds 215m (Dollars 333.25m) sale of Mr Tapie's controlling stake to Pentland, the UK consumer products concern and a minority investor in Adidas. Pentland's decision to pull out of the deal has fuelled reports that Mr Tapie, whose plans to reduce his debts through disposals have been hampered by the recent collapse of two other proposed sales, may be forced to find a new purchaser for his 58 per cent stake in BTF, the German holding company through which he controls Adidas. However, news of the capital injection, to be effected through a DM50m increase in nominal capital, was accompanied by the announcement that Ms Gilberte Beaux, a close associate of Mr Tapie, had been provisionally appointed president of Adidas to replace Mr Rene Jaggi. Ms Beaux, a former banker, joined BTF two years ago at the time of the Adidas acquisition. She has since represented Mr Tapie on the Adidas board. Earlier this year Mr Tapie gated his Adidas responsibilities to her when he began his short-lived career in the French cabinet. Mr Tapie was forced to resign his cabinet post because of his involvement in a fraud case.</p>

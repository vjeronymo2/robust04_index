			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, Arnulfist Party </F> presidential candidate, with unidentified reporters outside a  restaurant in Panama City on 14 April; live or  recorded--broadcast in progress]    [Text] [Reporter] ...in a national network?    [Gruber] Look, I share the president's concern this evening  after seeing the video clips. The video clips show us part of  our history, part of the past, and we, who suffered that past,  have relived it this evening; therefore, we have recalled what  the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] was.    [Reporter] Opposition groups claim he did this to support  your candidacy. What is your comment?    [Gruber] I do not think this was done to support my  candidacy. This president has shown this video clip to the  country as evidence of his concern for what may happen on 8 May.  I do not think it was done to help me.    [Reporter] Isn't the president taking sides with a party and  violating the Constitution with this?    [Gruber] No, he is not.    [Reporter] Nevertheless, Ernesto Toro Perez Balladares has  said this is negative and that President Endara is violating the  Santa Maria la Antigua Commitment by doing this.    [Gruber] I do not think the president has violated the  Constitution or the Justice and Peace Commission Pact. He has  only shown part of our history. We cannot deny this is part of  our history. There are many people who want to forget it, but  it is there, and we have seen it tonight.    [Reporter] Certain groups want to know why it was done now.    [Gruber] Perhaps he was concerned about what is taking place  in the country. He said it this evening; he is concerned,  perhaps due to so many attacks against him. He wanted to show  the country part of Panama's history.    [Reporter] Is this a strategy to achieve unity of the  civilist forces?    [Gruber] Look, we have been issuing appeals for unity since  December. We again issued appeals in January, February, and  March. I do not think this will help much concerning unity. I  hope it does, but I doubt it.    [Reporter] Do you think this will change the Panamanian  people's mind so they vote for [words indistinct]?    [Gruber] Please. I think.... [pauses] Panama lived under a  dictatorship for 21 years. The Panamanian people remembered it  this evening when they saw the video clips. It will definitely  change their minds.</p>

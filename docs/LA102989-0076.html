			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAKING ENDS MEET IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> I want to commend you for focusing on the housing problem in the Southland.  </P> <P> Housing, transportation, work and violence are increasingly more of a problem  to most people. For instance, I worked for a year or so as an apartment  hostess, leasing and showing apartments. They paid me $5 per hour.  </P> <P> If a worker makes $5 per hour ($200 per week) what is left for food, clothing  and transportation, when the worker pays "the lowest" $500 per month for a  place to live? The government still gets its share even though it considers the  income poverty level.  </P> <P> A vehicle is a must in California. Try riding a bus to work, or to shop. Ice  cream will melt, meat will thaw and bathrooms are almost unknown -- yet the  system takes four to five hours of your time. There are many people who want to  work, are able, are qualified -- but the work they find doesn't pay enough to  rent the $500-a-month apartment and still get them to work. I hope you talk to  some of these people and write about them. Maybe then the system will listen.  </P> <P> COLLEEN HUBER  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

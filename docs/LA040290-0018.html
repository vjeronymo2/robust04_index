			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES NOISE;  </P> <P> MARINES NEED TO MOVE TUSTIN COPTER FACILITY;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT NEAR THE AIR STATION MAKES ITS OPERATIONS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE  AREA.  </P> <P> Living next door to the Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro and the Tustin  helicopter base, as the city of Irvine does, creates unique problems. The  situation challenges the ability of the City Council and me as city manager to  protect the rights of residents to live peacefully in relatively quiet  surroundings, and at the same time remain supportive of the national defense  mission of the Marines, who were here long before the city.  </P> <P> Over the years, we have worked hard to build good relations with the Marines.  We are neighbors, but we have very different interests. MCAS El Toro is a major  military air base with high performance, and extremely noisy jet fighters.  Irvine is a rapidly growing and primarily residential community. Normally,  entities such as these are less than compatible. So differences are going to  occur, and we must do our best to work them out.  </P> <P> Having a good relationship where we can maintain an open dialogue has helped  make it possible for Irvine and the Marines to coexist peacefully, respect each  other's turf and work closely together on issues of conflict. Our ability to do  that has steadily improved since 1980, when the city and the Marines entered  into a Memorandum of Understanding that recognized the need for mutual  cooperation. The memorandum addressed a wide range of issues. Under it, some of  the things the Marines agreed to included working with the city to mitigate  adverse impacts of base operations, adhering to takeoff and landing patterns  that minimize noise impacts on surrounding communities, and keeping the city  and its residents notified of changes in operating procedure.  </P> <P> In turn, the city agreed to work with the Marines on land planning affecting  the base, to advise them of proposed new developments and, among other things,  to waive restrictions in times of national emergency.  </P> <P> Since the signing of that document, open dialogue has helped lead to the  extension of Jamboree Road through the base, adjustments in planning that have  benefited all parties, and the realignment of the "Browning Corridor" used by  helicopters operating out of MCAS Tustin to minimize residential neighborhood  overflights. Eighteen months ago, the city also formed the Helicopter  Overflights Task Force, made up of residents, city staff and Marines. The Task  Force's findings and recommendations, presented to the City Council Feb. 13,  addressed a variety of issues, including better public notification of  helicopter activities and establishment of navigational landmarks to help keep  pilots away from residential neighborhoods. The cooperative work of the task  force represents an important step in helping mitigate the noise impacts of  helicopters operating from MCAS Tustin.  </P> <P> Recognizing, however, that helicopter overflights still represent a continuing  disruption, the Marines need to eventually consider relocation of the  helicopter operations at the MCAS Tustin facility, which has been in operation  since the 1930s. Development around that site has made it incompatible with the  area.  </P> <P> In-depth discussions to encourage early relocation have been initiated by the  city. If the Marines agree to move, they will need to be compensated fairly for  the base property. Presently, however, they have no plans to relocate -- but we  hope that they will consider this alternative.  </P> <P> Discussions on relocation will no doubt present major challenges. So, too, will  the Marines' recent draft study of projected aircraft noise levels. The study,  known as the Air Installations Compatible Use Zones program, or AICUZ,  establishes a noise "footprint" within which certain types of development  cannot occur. Unlike previous AICUZ studies, which have been used for 10 years  as the basis for the city's land planning, the draft study incorporated a new  methodology that extended the size of the footprint to include areas previously  believed to be outside the AICUZ boundary. Consequently, the draft report threw  years of land planning into doubt.  </P> <P> The city recognizes that the Marines are concerned about continued encroachment  of development around the base. We want to address these concerns as well.  However, the sudden use of a new methodology resulting in a larger footprint  has raised questions in many people's minds. Raising further questions were  reports that the computer model used to create the footprint ignored actual  test data that showed noise levels to be less than noise presently being  experienced on the ground.  </P> <P> We believe it is important to establish criteria for noise projections that  will stand the test of time and allow the community to plan for the future. But  we don't want this or any single issue to dampen a largely positive  relationship. Irvine and the Marines have a solid history of cooperative  dialogue, and in some cases, a sharing of interest. Neither we nor the Marines,  for instance, ever want to see full or even joint commercial use of MCAS El  Toro. We have worked as the closest of allies in protecting this shared  interest.  </P> <P> In other words, we have found a way to coexist peacefully and work together.  Like two old neighbors, we have our differences, but we each keep coming back  to borrow a cup of sugar.  </P> <P> </P></p>

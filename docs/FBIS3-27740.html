			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Essay by Doan Chuong: "Dialogue on Human Rights"] </F>   [Text] In an interview with VNA on 13 January, Deputy  Foreign Minister Le Mai clarified our policy of holding a  dialogue with other countries on human rights. This is another  manifestation of our government's open-door foreign policy.    Although being an agonizing victim of the confrontration on  human rights, we are ready to hold a dialogue on human rights  because we are Vietnamese. And just as Uncle Ho put it: We are  clear and straightforward. We only demand independence and  freedom without harboring any personal hatred. We want the  world to realize that we are a civilized nation, even more  civilized than the assets-plundering and country-invading  clique. It is not that those wanting to have a dialogue on  human rights with us are in the same situation as us, but rather  those countries which once confronted us on human rights. We  are ready to a hold dialogue with them and we wonder if they  will behave like civilized people while talking with us or will  they display a lack of civilized attitudes as they usually do?    First, we would like to talk about the United States. They  once helped the French colonialists re-invade our country and  they were reported to have at times shouldered as much as 60  percent of the war expense for the French. They then sent their  troops to invade the southern part of our country and they  launched barbarous air strikes against the north, creating  untold deaths and suffering and lingering cultural, social, and  environmental consequences. They have also imposed a protracted  embargo against us, thus violating the right to development of  our people and their legitimate human rights.    It is clear that over the past 40 years, they have  confronted  us on human rights and now they want a dialogue on the issue.  Will they prepare to repay their human rights debts for the  Vietnamese people? Or will they, after failing to defeat us in  their human rights confrontations, now change their tricks by  resorting to a human rights dialogue to subjugate us?    U.S. political circles have noisily talked about their human  rights-based foreign policy. Their radio stations are daily  harping about U.S. human rights values. But everyone knows that  the United States itself was the mastermind of the nuclear  disasters at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. While boasting about their  human rights protection policy, they are trying to perfect their  mass-destruction weapons. We do not want to interfere in their  internal affairs, but we are aware that the United States'  Declaration of Independence of 1776 stated that everyone is born  equal. But since then, African Americans in their country have  continued to suffer from the bad practice of deep-seated racial  discrimination. Although the American black makes up only 15  percent of the U.S. population, the number of black prisoners  accounts for 50 percent of the nation's total. According to  figures provided by the Census Bureau in a 1992 report, 32.7  percent of American blacks live below the poverty line. This  means that one in every three American blacks live below the  poverty line. The gap between the rich and the poor is  extremely wide. In 1991, the annual income of one-fifth of the  richest Americans constituted 46.5 percent of the total national  income. Whereas, the annual income of one-fifth of the poorest  accounted for only 3.8 percent of the total national income.    His excellency Mr. (Brzezinski) once said that the  violence-exalting television- and movie-based culture was  creating the highest murder rate in any civilized country in the  world. In 1993, there were 390,000 killings of that nature in  the United States. One may ask, is this representative of U.S.  human rights values?    Australia is also a country which is very enthusiastic about  asking for a human rights dialogue. But we wonder if certain  forces still remember that they once joined with the United  States in confronting us on human rights during the recent war.  We also do not want to interfere in their internal affairs but  we know that after 200 years, it was only in November last year  that their parliament, after 50 hours of debate, eventually  agreed to recognize the land ownership of the Aborigines.    There are many other countries which once rivaled us on  human  rights for a long period of time. We welcomed President  Mitterand for having personally traveled to Dien Bien Phu to  close a page of past history. But the human rights debts owed  to the Vietnamese people are still there and cannot be easily  ignored. Morals do not allow them to forget. We do not want to  interfere in their internal affairs but we are aware that in  their countries, there are numerous problems related to human  rights. Morally, they must learn to address their own problems  before talking about teaching other people to do this or do that.    With our age-old cultural tradition and with our Ho Chi Minh  morality, the Vietnamese nation can feel proud of being a human  nation. There is no need to recall faraway stories; our  attitude toward the POW/MIA issue and the way we treated Puppet  government employees and Puppet Army personnel in the past are  enough to testify to this fact.    Those who once confronted the Vietnamese people on human  rights and who now want to have a dialogue with us on human  rights should think of the need to pay their human rights debts  to the Vietnamese people if they regard themselves as civilized  and thoughtful people. Having already failed in their attempts  to confront the Vietnamese people on human rights, how can they  be successful in their bid to use dialogue on human rights to  subjugate the Vietnamese people? This is unacceptable and  impractical.</p>

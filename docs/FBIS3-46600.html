Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Abu  Hassan  Omar said today that the reduction was proof that the  government's efforts to curb inflation had been effective with  the help of the public and the business community.    He, however, said the government was still not satisfied  with  the 3.6 per cent inflation rate achieved so far and his ministry  would continue its efforts to bring down the rate further.    The country's inflation rate stood at 3.9 per cent from  January until July this year, dropping to 3.8 per cent at the  end of August and stayed at 3.7 per cent at the end of September  and October.    As for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Abu Hassan said the  index for food was now 33.7 per cent, gross rent, fuel and power  (20.2 per cent), transport and communication (18.6 per cent),  beverages and tobacco (4.3 per cent, clothing and footwear (four  per cent), furniture, furnishing and household equipment and  operations (5.8 per cent) medical care and health expenses 1.8  per cent, recreation, entertainment, education and cultural  services (5.2 per cent) and miscellaneous goods and services  (6.4 per cent).    (The CPI measures the average rate of change in prices of a  fixed pattern of an average household in Malaysia with 1990 as  the base year.)    He said his ministry was responsible only to bring down the  food index and other sectors, whether government agencies or the  private sector, had a role to ensure the CPI was further reduced.    Speaking at a year-end press conference at his Menara  Maybank  [Maybank Towers] office here Abu Hassan said his ministry would  continue to take the lead in the fight against inflation next  year.    Asked how far the ministry hoped to reduce the rate of  inflation next year, Abu Hassan said, "The prime minister  himself, as head of the Cabinet Committee on Inflation, had said  that the government's objective is to achieve zero inflation  rate. It is not impossible. The private sector can help the  government reduce the current inflation rate further by  increasing efficiency and reducing production costs thus  enabling the price of goods to remain stable."    Abu Hassan also announced that his ministry would begin a  major publicity campaign from April next year to enhance the  people's awareness on the scourge of inflation.    Among the ministry's steps to curb inflation this year  include the setting up of a price information centre to give  consumers up-to-date information on prices of goods; holding a  "fair price" shops competition and conducting price checks on  business premises under "Ops Budget".</p>

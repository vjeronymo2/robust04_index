			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Hoover outlines agreement to save Glasgow plant HOOVER, the US domestic appliance group, yesterday outlined details of the agreement reached with union representatives last week at its plant at Cambuslang, near Glasgow. Hoover believes it can now turn its lossmaking European operations back into profit. The agreement, formally announced yesterday between the company and the AEEU engineering and electrical union at its 1,000-strong Cambuslang plant, is designed to make it one of the most cost-effective in Europe. Hoover said yesterday that the changes will double annual output to about 1.8m units. The company confirmed that 400 jobs would be created at the plant as a result of the agreement, with production being transferred from its plant at Dijon in France, which would be closed with the loss of 600 jobs. Mr Bill Froust, Hoover's European president, said the Cambuslang agreement safeguarded the plant's future and was designed to improve the company's operating costs. The agreement is far-reaching in its assertion of management authority, although Hoover will continue to recognise the union. However, the company said it requires flexibility from its staff and the elimination of all restrictive practices and local union agreements. Under the deal, employees will work as directed by the supervisors and a new common job description will be introduced. Hoover also said that it will regularly evaluate the cost of manufacturing components or sub-assemblies in-house and compare it with the cost of contracting out the work. Under the deal, Hoover reserves the right to fix shift patterns for staff. It said that manning levels would reflect operational needs. The agreement says that union activity in the plant will be reduced, with the position of senior shop steward being abolished. The position of a single full-time convener is to be reviewed. The deal stipulates that union representation will not exceed an average of one representative for every 70 hourly paid workers. Hoover said it would not accept any stoppage or any other form of industrial disruption until the provisions of its procedure agreement had been exhausted. It warned that any worker who failed to honour this faced summary dismissal. Pay is being frozen until the beginning of next year and the premium shift rate is being cut from 156 per cent to 133 per cent, the industry norm. Hoover said that from the beginning of next month, all new employees would be hired initially on two-year temporary contracts without benefits such as sickness payments. Many of the new conditions were introduced by Hoover at its white-goods plant at Merthyr Tydfil, South Glamorgan, in May 1991.</p>

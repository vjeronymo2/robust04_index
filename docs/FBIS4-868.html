			<p>BFN     [Text] The Rwandan scenario is foreseeable in Zaire. A  member of the Executive Bureau of the Sacred Union of Radical  Opposition stated this during a European tour. (Jacques Matamba  Moyo), who is also the chairman of the Confederation of  Reformist Nationalists, said that the radical opposition has  just formed an army. The mission of this armed branch of the  opposition is to topple the Mobutu regime. (Moyo) is asking  foreign nationals to leave Zaire. Here with the details is  (Moyo), talking to Ousmane Kaba:    [(Moyo)] It is possible -- when one looks at what is  currently happening -- that a social explosion of great  magnitude could take place at any time in Zaire, due to the  extreme deterioration and degeneration of the current  socioeconomic situation for the military, I repeat, the  military, civilians, and religious followers. We are saying  that, in order to prevent--as usual--Mobutu's friends abroad  from putting pressure on state powers in their respective  countries, and in order to prevent them from coming to Zaire  under the cover of a rescue operation and saving the dictator,  we are asking them as early as now, to make the decision -- as  precautionary measures -- to evacuate their nationals.    The socioeconomic situation has deteriorated so much that it  obliges responsible people, responsible statesmen, to prevent  what might happen. We are asking foreigners to leave, to leave  us alone to settle our disputes calmly, and when we are through  with this we will resume our political cooperation and aid  efforts with them.</p>

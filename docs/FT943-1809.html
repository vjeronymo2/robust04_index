			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Creating profit The scene is familiar. A chief executive, standing at a podium in a hushed, darkened hall, gestures at the slide projections behind him showing the expected rise in profits from the company's latest takeover. Of course, reorganisation costs will be high, he warns. The balance sheet in the next set of accounts does indeed show hefty writedowns, but as these costs bypass the profit and loss account, profits leap. In the never-never land of UK accounting, those techniques have given a company active on the acquisition trail an effortlessly rising stream of earnings. Until, as Coloroll and other corporate stars of the 1980s bear witness, reality intrudes. Typically, the acquisitions perform badly and cashflow collapses. Today's publication of new rules on treatment of acquisitions and mergers by the Accounting Standards Board aims to reduce the room for such creativity in accounting. The rules, which greatly curb the use of provisions and writedowns, among other detailed measures, are likely to be successful in that aim. In doing so, they will prevent some deals which could have occurred under past rules. Shareholders may well welcome this, as some of the grossest abuses of acquisition accounting have been highly expensive for them. Directors may not, where their pay is linked to earnings growth. It is harder to say, though, whether discouraging corporate enthusiasm for takeovers is economically beneficial or not. The 1980s takeover scramble attracted much opprobrium, and many of those deals have so far proved disappointing. But that is partly due to recession: the longer-term returns remain unclear. But while the revisions are welcome, it is worth sounding a note of concern. The rules have the virtues of consistency, but may make an unhelpfully crude distinction between capital and current spending. The problem surfaces most clearly in the proposed new treatment of reorganisation costs, to which leading companies have strongly objected. Such costs, previously treated as part of the capital cost of the deal, must now be treated as an expense. The idea is to remove subjective considerations, such as whether these costs were foreseeable before the deal. Yet such factors are frequently relevant to the valuation of assets: directors assess the value of a target in the light of the 'refurbishment' which needs to be done to realise its potential. Those in pursuit of better accounting standards need to bear in mind how accounts are intended to be used, and by whom. The Accounting Standards Board has sometimes appeared to see itself on a quest for absolute truth. Its new rules are likely to succeed in making company accounts reflect more fairly the full cost of acquisitions. Shareholders and lenders may, however, find it as hard as in the past to use the values in the accounts to estimate future profits.</p>

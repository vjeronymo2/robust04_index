			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Why the Gideons are facing a fight in hotel bedrooms / Discovering a new 'bible' guaranteed to help you gravitate from mud bath to solarium I think it was 'Sky' Masterson - had an unlikely talent. He knew much of the Bible by heart, and could use this to impress young ladies of a devout disposition. What they did not realise was that Sky read only the Bible because he lived in hotels, and the sort of hotels where the only adornments to the rooms were Bibles left by the tireless Gideons. Nowadays, although the Gideons have not given up the good fight - there is another volume which seems to have been placed in thousands of hotel rooms by a mysterious evangelical organisation. It is called 'The Leading Hotels of the World' and it is published by a company called The Leading Hotels of the World Inc. Rather than preach of the riches and pleasures of the life to come, LHW Inc contents itself with promises of what can be attained in the worldly life. It worships Mammon and is no less fascinating for that. But, like the Bible, or at least the King James' version, it preaches to us in a language which we never hear spoken. Typically, any of the 300 or so listed hotels will combine 'modern amenities with the charm and tradition of a bygone era.' Strangely, none of the hotels ever offers modern tradition with the amenities of a bygone era. I was brought up to think that a hotel was somewhere in which one relaxed and used as a base from which to explore the neighbourhood. That is old-fashioned, not part of the existence promised by the Leading Hotels of the World. They all offer dreadful sports - 'gymnasium, clay tennis-court, 18-hole mini-golf, and horseback-riding.' Note, it is never 'riding' but always 'horseback-riding.' And one absolutely does not leave the hotels. These are city-states, determined that their citizens should never spend their dollars in the outside world. At first, you might feel a bit restless. But, after you have been massaged into submission by the 'additional features' - naturally, all the hotels offer additional features - your brain will have been too thoroughly washed to conceive of another lifestyle. You will gravitate, an assiduous mummy, from sauna to hydro-massage to mud bath to solarium to revitalising centre. You do not worry about children in the Leading Hotels of the World. Most of them offer 'children's programs,' and this does not mean Blue Peter in the language of your choice. No, 'children's programs' mean that your children are programmed to be happy, happy, happy without you in their mini-saunas, mini-solaria, and mini-revitalising centres. These are delights never mentioned in the Gideon Bible. But, as in the Bible, certain passages in 'The Leading Hotels of the World' are not meant to be taken literally, or, if so, only as prophecy. Are we really to believe, as gospel, that the Dubin restaurant in the Hotel Esplanade, Zagreb, offers 'intimate luxury and exquisite international cuisine'? I imagine that of late it has become a little more intimate and a little less exquisite. And is Las Hadas hotel in Manzanillo, Mexico, 'so perfect that it is a natural setting for the movie, 10'? And is the angular tower-block of the White Swan hotel, Guangzhou, really 'a vibrant, yet peaceful symbol of today's China'? Or the almost new Hotel Shilla in Seoul really the 'Heritage Home of Ancient Korean Charm and Hospitality' with 'Traditional Royal Dynastic Luxury and Elegance'? To ask these questions is like saying of the Book of Genesis that God did not really create the world in seven days. It is a good point, but churlish and lacking the imagination which fired the writer. And I have found in The Leading Hotels of the World the perfect place for 'Sky' Masterson: the Soaltee Hotel in Katmandu: 'Additional features: casino Nepal, Nepal's only casino.'

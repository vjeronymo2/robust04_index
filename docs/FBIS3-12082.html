The former human rights ombudsman -- who became Guatemala's  president on 6 June 1993 in the midst of a terrible political  crisis originated by ousted President Jorge Serrano's failed  self-coup -- has paved the way to peace with the signing of an  overall agreement on human rights with the rebels.    The Government Peace Commission (Copaz) and the Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity's (URNG) "military command" reached  this agreement in Puebla (Mexico) after overcoming several  obstacles throughout three years of conversations.    The agreement with the rebels strengthens Ramiro de Leon  Carpio's administration, which during his 10 months in power has  lost credibility and the support of the diverse sectors of  society that demand an end to the conflict and better living  conditions. People's leaders consulted by ACAN-EFE indicated  that light can now be seen at the end of the tunnel and that  even though the agreement has been signed true hope lies in its  fulfillment and the beginning of the end of the massacre.    "The signing of the agreement is a victory for the whole  community that pressured the government and the guerrillas. It  is not a voluntary gift, although it fell on Ramiro de Leon  Carpio," stressed Rosario Pu, leader of the Committee of Peasant  Unity (CUC).    Meanwhile, Rosalina Tuyuc, leader of the National Commission  of Guatemalan Widows (Conavigua), told ACAN-EFE that a first  step has been taken for a constitution of civilian communities  [pueblos civiles] and that this agreement will stimulate and  support the people. "For us the signing of this accord is very  important because it opens up a space for society," she  highlighted.    Meanwhile, Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia  Laguardia said the agreement gives "a new glimmer of hope to the  population" because the parties have demonstrated their  democratic calling to reach an understanding. Garcia recognized  that the work of Frenchman Jean Arnault was a key to reaching  the accord, with which the incipient democracy will be  strengthened in the medium- and long-term. For the human rights  ombudsman now "it is necessary to form a national front of peace  to discuss an agreement of social conditions as the only way to  end the instability."    Nineth Montenegro, president of the Mutual Support Group  (GAM), also told ACAN-EFE that after 34 years of war the  agreement represents "a significant step forward" in the  attainment of peace. "I am very happy to hear there is talk of  democratizing and demilitarizing the country," the human rights  leader remarked.    The issue of human rights was the most complex one of the 11  points on the agenda agreed upon in Mexico in 1991 by the  government and the URNG under the mediation of Catholic Bishop  Rodolfo Quezada Toruno. According to Quezada Toruno, who was  dismissed from the negotiations by de Leon Carpio, who in turned  requested the UN mediation, under his mediation the parties were  nearing the signing of an accord, but the foiled coup  perpetrated by Serrano on 25 May 1993 ruined all the efforts.    The peace negotiations became bogged down several times  during the coupist government of Serrano, and although de Leon  gave new momentum to the process, it was not until last January  that his representatives were able to meet for the first time  with rebel leaders in Mexico.    De Leon removed the main players of the government in the  process and appointed Hector Rosada to head the government  delegation. Rosada has been charged with exerting pressure to  force Quezada Toruno's removal and dissolve the National  Reconciliation Commission.    The signing of the human rights accord and its international  verification mark the end of a 34-year-old armed confrontation  in Guatemala, the only country in Central America where tension  remains. The undeclared civil war has left more than 150,000  people dead, some 250,000 widows, and 45,000 missing persons due  to political reasons, as well as thousands of refugees.</p>

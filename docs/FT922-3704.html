			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Core inflation slows to lowest annual rate for five years THE PRICES of manufactured goods leaving Britain's factories rose by 3.6 per cent in the year to May, the lowest annual rate of increase for five years. The producer prices index, often taken as a measure of core inflation, rose 0.1 per cent on the month compared with a 0.4 per cent monthly rise in April, supporting government hopes that upward pressure on prices will continue to ease. Further evidence of the disinflationary momentum in the UK economy came from the rise in the index excluding the volatile prices of food, drink and tobacco. This rose by 0.2 per cent in May compared with the previous month, bringing the year-on year rate of change to 2.7 per cent, the lowest since the late 1960s. Producer price inflation has been falling steadily - bar a couple of upward monthly blips - since a peak of 6.2 per cent in April 1991. It remained above 4 per cent for the first three months of this year, dropping to 3.8 per cent in April. The latest figures are likely to cool recent worries that underlying inflationary pressures in the economy are proving difficult to squash. Over the past six months the annual rate of retail price inflation - the headline inflation figure - has stuck at above 4 per cent after dipping briefly to 3.7 per cent in October. On Friday, the retail prices index for May is expected to show a slight rise from April's 4.3 per cent before resuming a downward path later in the year. The prices of raw materials and fuels used by manufacturing industry rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent last month. Non-seasonally adjusted input prices fell by 0.1 per cent on the month and by 0.9 per cent compared with the same month a year ago, reflecting depressed commodity prices. The Treasury said the figures provided further evidence that underlying inflationary pressures were weak. 'We are on course to meet the Budget forecast that output price inflation excluding food drink and tobacco will fall to 2 per cent in the final quarter of 1992,' it said.</p>

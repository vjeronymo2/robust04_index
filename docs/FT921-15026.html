			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Mass higher education IN THE mid-1960s Britain had 32 universities and 220,000 full-time students. On current projections, it will end the century with 80 universities and 1m students. In the 1990s alone, student numbers are set to rise by almost two-thirds, with the proportion of 18-year-olds proceeding to higher education rising from 19 per cent to 32 per cent. It is an educational revolution, by any standards. Ignore the prophets of doom predicting dilution and disaster: they said much the same in the 1950s, were dismissed at the time, and have been proved wrong since. But it would be no less misguided to ignore the serious implications of expansion for the higher education system. Two stand out: the emergence of a new university hierarchy, and the issue of funding future growth. Ending the so-called 'binary divide' between polytechnics and universities will not produce a unified higher education system. On the contrary, taken together with current changes in the direction of research funding, it will herald a new and deep division between institutions engaging in teaching and research, and those charged with teaching alone. Only some 15 universities can expect to be in the new 'ivy league' of elite institutions: the rest will be essentially teaching colleges, whatever their titles. For all the likely cries from the dispossessed, this is to be welcomed. It will relate research funding more closely to research quality, and ought to encourage the 'ivy league' to devote more attention to graduate courses, which remain distinctly under-developed in Britain. However, some leading universities may need persuading, through stronger funding incentives, that their contribution to university teaching should be more than serving as finishing schools for bright sixth formers. Funding problem Funding is altogether more problematic. Crudely, higher education spending for the current year will total about Pounds 4.5bn, of which nearly Pounds 1bn will go on student financial support for fees and maintenance. If spending were to increase in line with student numbers, it would rise by some Pounds 1.6bn (at today's prices) by 2000, with an extra Pounds 350m on student maintenance. Research funding could be held down and repayment of loans will reduce the last figure somewhat, but that is the order of addition on current trends. Does higher education justify that much extra - roughly equivalent to the entire budgets for prisons and overseas aid? Put differently, how favoured should universities be in the scramble for extra education cash? Other public services are clamouring for more funds; within education, demands at the nursery and 16-19 level are acute - and popular with the electorate. Greater efficiency There is, of course, room for greater efficiency all round. Polytechnics have led the way in working existing assets harder, while many universities now generate large sums from private sources. Institutions could raise still more of their own cash; their lecture halls could be opened longer and filled fuller; even the sacred long vacation could, perhaps, be turned into an extra term to spread the load. But such methods alone will not support a mass system. They will, on the other hand, impose a greater strain on academic staff, and increase pressure to raise their pay - which, in relative terms, fell sharply in the 1980s. School teachers now have an independent pay review body. The case for extending it to lecturers is almost unanswerable - but will only further increase higher education spending. That leaves students. By international standards, state financial support for British students is exceptionally generous. The government's loans scheme may not be the best way to encourage greater student contributions to their studies. But those opposed to it need to be frank about the extent of their prospective largesse on behalf of the taxpayer, particularly if fees are to continue to be paid in full by the state. Unless, of course, prisons and overseas aid are to be abolished. This is the last in a series on British education policy.</p>

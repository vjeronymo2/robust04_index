			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- The government is  apparently split over how to respond to mounting U.S. pressure  for wider access to Korea's motor vehicle market due to  different interpretations of the wording in a "record of  understanding" exchanged between Seoul and Washington during the  Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations last year.    The Foreign Ministry advocates early tariff concessions on  automobile imports, abolition of limits on showrooms for foreign  cars and approval of advertising as demanded by the United  States, while the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry firmly  opposes lower tariffs and early liberalization of the  distribution market before the scheduled January 1996.    The Foreign Ministry says concessions are inevitable,  pointing to the phrase "reduction in the tariffs on motor  vehicles will be addressed at the ministerial level,"  interpreting "address" as meaning "announce" and therefore a  promise on future cuts.    As Washington, citing the record, is strongly demanding  tariff reductions and predicting Korea will inevitably have to  bow to its request, the Foreign Ministry wants to resolve the  issue quickly.    U.S. Deputy Assistant Trade Representative Peter Collins  referred to the record of understanding to demand immediate  tariff cuts on car imports in trade talks in Seoul early last  month.    The Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry, however, sees  things  differently. It interprets "address" to mean "discuss" as it is  often regarded in business, saying it thus cannot be a promise  on tariff cuts as insisted by the United States.    Even if it is a promise, the reduction refers to tariff  offers because the record was made in the UR negotiations, the  trade ministry argues.    Offering and actual tariff rates may be the same to the  United States, but they are two different things to Korea, the  ministry says, adding that Seoul only needs to change the  offering rates.    In its country schedule, Korea had offered to maintain an  80-percent tariff on motor vehicle imports until 2004.    The Trade Ministry immediately issued a press release that  the government has no plans to lower tariffs on car imports nor  to open the distribution market earlier than scheduled,  contrasting with earlier reports quoting Foreign Ministry  officials as saying that Seoul has decided to accept the U.S.  demand on tariff cuts on car imports.</p>

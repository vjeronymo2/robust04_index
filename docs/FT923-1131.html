			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Bonds: EIB and EBRD join new wave of borrowers after turmoil THE European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday joined the latest wave of borrowers to raise money through collared floating-rate notes, leading to warnings of oversupply in the market for this kind of paper. Yesterday's two triple-A rated borrowers follow in the wake of other top-ranked issuers who came on Tuesday, led by Austria, which brought the first sovereign issue in the sector. Austria's Dollars 400m deal, followed by a similarly-sized offer from the EIB yesterday - both of them brought by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - has helped to extend what had been mainly a retail market into more of an institutional one. The previous wave of dollar floaters had been dominated by subordinated bank issues and names likely to be attractive to retail investors. The EIB's Dollars 400m issue was only the bank's second borrowing exercise since the removal of Italian withholding tax exemption, which had enabled it to borrow at abnormally cheap levels. Yesterday's offer bore a close resemblance to other collared floaters in recent weeks. It has a minimum coupon of 5 per cent to attract investors who want a pick up over current US interest rates and a maximum of 8 1/4 per cent. The coupon is 25 basis points below Libor in between. The all-in borrowing cost to the EIB was not disclosed, but one banker commented that it had probably had to pay around 50 basis points more than it would have paid before the tax change, when it could have expected to borrow at around 70 basis points below Libor. 'They've had to change their (borrowing) targets substantially,' this banker said. The sudden flow of floating rate notes in the past two days, following a subdued period in the Eurobond markets owing to the turmoil in Europe's financial markets, threatens to give the market a serious case of indigestion. While issues such as those from Austria were taken up quickly, there were reports of others being left with underwriters. Traders pointed, for instance, to the Dollars 200m issue on Tuesday from Landeskreditbank Baden-Wurttemberg (LKB). The maximum coupon of 8.5 per cent was aggress-ively priced, traders said, leading to less interest than had been seen for some of the other issues. Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Spain's troubled Dollars 1.5bn issue, which was priced on Tuesday after a delay of a week, settled yesterday at around its launch spread of 55 basis points over US Treasuries. Underwriters to the issue said that the decision to increase the spread from the 45 basis points indicated when the bonds were first offered a week ago had been the only realistic way of assuring that the deal would be a success. 'There's no question of us not living up to our commitment,' one underwriter said. In the changed circumstances of the past week, the issuer had no choice but to accept a higher yield to ensure a successful launch, he said.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Dorling Kindersley flotation funds to lift organic growth DORLING KINDERSLEY, the British publisher which specialises in highly illustrated reference books for international markets, will be floated on the stock exchange with a market value of Pounds 85m-Pounds 100m. DK's pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, said the flotation would raise Pounds 25m before expenses. The offer price is expected to be announced on October 23, with dealing beginning a week later. Mr Peter Kindersley, chairman and chief executive, said the new funds would be used to continue organic growth, particularly in the US, and to provide back-up material for the group's educational titles. Up to 75 per cent of the new shares will be placed firmly with financial institutions. The remaining shares will be provisionally placed, but will be subject to clawback by financial intermediaries for sale to private investors. The flotation is being sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, with Cazenove as broker. DK said its growth in the year to next June was expected to be substantial, but not at the very high rate of the last five years. In the 12 months to June 30 this year, the group's pre-tax profits doubled to Pounds 7.5m on sales up by 66 per cent to Pounds 70.9m.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Changes to Address Federal Approvability. Significant changes in today's rule include deletion or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision of certain sections which exist in the Districts'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current rules, as well as the inclusion of new sections to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address federal requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Federal new source review at 40 CFR 51.165 applies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain source categories which were exempt from District new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source review requirements. Therefore, such exemptions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluded. Some of the District rules allow trading between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different precursors of a secondary pollutant. As EPA does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently allow trading between either of the ozone precursor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria pollutants addressed in this rule, this rule does not,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as proposed, allow such trading. In addition, 40 CFR 52.3000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains wording which emphasizes the federal enforceability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an Authority to Construct and its validity for the life of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source. In order to match EPA's enforcement authority over past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations, and to be consistent with requirements in EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operating Permits Program (40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)), today's rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires retention of records for five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  This rule contains certain other provisions which are not in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current District rules. A subsection is included in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule to address the minimum offset ratio for emission reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved from mobile sources. Furthermore, the ERC Authorization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes provisions to certify that ERCs are surplus at time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use, that prior shutdown credits are federally approvable, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that ERCs from non-permitted sources are surplus, permanent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforceable, and quantifiable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Changes to Address Federal Implementation. Some significant changes in the APCD rule are necessary for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal implementation. Today's rule excludes all references to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements contained in state law. All district fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements are removed and are replaced with a provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing EPA to collect fees. Upon delegation of authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement and enforce any portion of this NSR rule, EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cease to collect the fees associated with that portion of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, and the delegated agency will calculate and collect fees in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the fee rules of that agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Language was added to section 52.3001 to provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to request a public hearing as provided by 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 124.12. Language was also added to section 52.3000 to allow for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition to the Environmental Appeals Board for review and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconsideration within 30 days of any final decision issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to this NSR rule, including decisions made by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delegated agency pursuant to this NSR rule. A petition for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review can also be filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in section 307(b) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Because this rule is explicitly intended for preconstruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review for ozone precursors, it does not reference other criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutants nor District operating permits programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The ERC Authorization section of this Rule allows sources to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the offset requirements of this Rule through use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing District banking system. Functions of the District  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Banks and District Priority Reserve Banks are not affected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's Rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e. Dual Permit Application and Review.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's proposed NSR Rule does not replace the Districts'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing permitting programs. New or modified sources of ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precursors must continue to meet the applicable District NSR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. This may result in sources of such pollutants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having to apply for permits from both the EPA and the District in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the source is located. <FOOTCITE>100</FOOTCITE>  As a practical matter, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because EPA has maintained the structure and requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing District Rules, by meeting the requirements of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``bumped up'' rule, the source will have also met the District NSR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Additional preparation in the form of permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications, modeling, or research on the part of the applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be minimal, if required at all. EPA has no statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to repeal or supplant the existing State or local laws,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nor would this be desirable since the existing District  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitting programs regulate the emissions of pollutants not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 100 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Sources must follow this ``dual'' permitting scheme in any area that does not have authority to implement federally mandated permitting programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One difficulty EPA has encountered in proposing this ``dual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system'' is how to operate federal emission reduction credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``banks'' that meet federal requirements and still preserve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity of existing District banks. As required by the Act and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set forth in section 40 CFR 52.3001 of this rule, new sources or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications that emit ozone precursors above an established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold must obtain offsets. Under current District programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reduction credits can be certified and obtained from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District banks to meet offset requirements. However, to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> creditable for use as offsets under this rule, EPA must ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the credits in the District banks meet federal approvability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria as set forth in the Emission Trading Policy Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ETPS, 51 FR 43815) and in the General Preamble to Title I at (57  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 13553).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The ERC authorization process described in today's rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would allow emissions reductions to be certified directly by EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and would also allow sources to use ERCs which have previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been certified by a District rule and authorized to meet federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSR requirements. EPA requests comment on today's proposal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative methods that would preserve the integrity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District banks under the proposed ``dual'' permitting system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f. Operating Permits. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The permits issued by EPA under today's NSR rule will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expire upon issuance of a District operating permit. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Districts are encouraged to include the requirements contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits issued by EPA, pursuant to this rule, in their operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits since sources must continue to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of these EPA issued construction permits. Districts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must include conditions contained in permits issued pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule in any operating permit issued under a program adopted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or Title V of the Act, as discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section III.J of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

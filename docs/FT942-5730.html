			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Yemenis back peace call as war goes on Feuding North and South Yemen yesterday endorsed the United Nations call for a ceasefire in their month-old civil war, but continued to battle around the southern stronghold of Aden. Northern forces were reported to have taken the town of al-Hawtah, 21 miles north of Aden, and then to have advanced at least four miles further south. Battles were also raging on other fronts near Aden. Forces loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh launched two missiles against the port city at dawn. One exploded over the Sheikh Othman district, wounding 20 worshippers at a mosque. The north's carefully worded acceptance of the UN ceasefire call appeared to be a gesture to world and particularly Arab opinion. But the Sanaa-based government did not specifically say it would stop fighting. Mr Abdul Rahman Ali Al-Jifri, vice-president of the breakaway south, earlier condemned the northern missile attacks and appealed to the international community to bring more pressure on the North Yemeni leadership to stop the war. He acknowledged the south's position was serious and that the next 24-36 hours would be crucial in its fight against the north. The UN, meanwhile, named former Algerian foreign minister Lakhdar Brahimi as special envoy to try to end the fighting. The Security Council resolution on Wednesday called for an immediate ceasefire, an arms embargo on the warring parties and despatch of a UN fact-finding mission. The north had stepped up its drive against the south over the past week, trying to achieve a military victory before international pressure can be brought to end the war. The sound of heavy explosions resounded through Aden yesterday, as southern jets resumed bombing runs from the airport, attacking northern troops based at Zinjibar, about 45 miles east of Aden. Though bombed by northern jets nearly a month ago, Aden airport remains operational for military aircraft and has provided the backbone of the south's defence. Southern military officials said they still had air superiority over the north. Among civilian casualties, eight children were reported injured on Wednesday after a bombing raid on Aden by two northern jets aiming at an oil pipeline. The jets dropped Soviet-made bombs containing 30-40 smaller explosive canisters. Similar bombs loaded with nuts and bolts hit Aden a week ago, causing extensive civilian injuries, western observers said.</p>

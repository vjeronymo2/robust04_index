			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 30 Jan (DPA) -- According to a document  written by one of the rebel leaders, which was published in  Mexico City today, the Zapatist guerrilla movement that took up  arms in the southern Mexican State of Chiapas on 1 January is  preparing for direct dialogue with Manuel Camacho Solis, the  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. In the  letter addressed to LA JORNADA newspaper in Mexico City,  "Subcommander Marcos," the Zapatist National Liberation Army's  (EZLN) spokesman, revealed that the so-called Clandestine Indian  Revolutionary Committee [Comite Clandestino Revolucionario  Indigena] had recently met to appoint its delegates to the  meeting.    At San Cristobal de las Casas yesterday Camacho Solis  announced his formal acceptance of the negotiation agenda  proposed by the guerrilla movement. The agenda includes the  assessment of the economic, social, and political problems that  prompted the Indian revolt, a search for solutions, and a  permanent cessation of hostilities. The peace commissioner, who  was appointed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, also  stated that he is willing to negotiate with the guerrillas as a  "political force in the process of being organized" in response  to the rebels' request that they be accepted as a "belligerent  force."    In his letter dated 26 January, "Subcommander Marcos"  reveals  that in the past few days the top rebel directorate discussed  the appointment of its delegates to the meeting with Camacho  Solis, which indicates their willingness to hold a dialogue even  prior to Commissioner Camacho's announcement.    "The conditions for the dialogue have been given," Camacho  Solis stated yesterday. He also warned the guerrillas that the  current "dilemma" is to "agree to peace with democracy" or  suffer the consequences of a "toughening" of the conflict. In a  confidential letter, Camacho Solis had already proposed to the  EZLN the possible cites, established guarantees, and necessary  logistics for the meeting. There is still no date for the  meeting, but, according to Mexico City media, it is imminent.    Meanwhile, General Miguel Angel Godinez, commander of the  counter insurgency troops in Chiapas, reiterated today his  support for the Army and the negotiation policy implemented by  the Salinas de Gortari administration. "When we received the  order to stop (the unilateral cease-fire), we did so immediately  because we understand that we are fighting Mexicans who are our  brothers. It's good that the cease-fire happened, and it opened  the door to negotiation," he told a Mexico City newspaper. It  is also good that those people (the EZLN) accepted the dialogue  and that our top authorities have decided all the necessary  measures to further this dialogue and obtain peace through  political means and not with weapons," he emphasized. He added  that when the rebel leaders and Camacho Solis -- whom he called  "a very brave man" -- meet, Army planes will not overfly the  area to avoid misunderstandings and to contribute to "holding  the dialogue in a clean and above-board manner."</p>

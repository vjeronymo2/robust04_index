			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: THE 5 LITTLE KINGS WHO ARE NO MORE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County supervisors used to be called the five little kings, a  title that in fact underestimated their power.  </P> <P> That was more than a decade ago. Today, the Board of Supervisors is a shadow of  its mighty predecessors. The perks remain and the salary is substantial --  $94,344 a year, going up to $99,297 Jan. 1. But anyone in the county Hall of  Administration will tell you that much of the supervisors' authority is gone.  </P> <P> It's important to understand that as you listen to the rhetoric beginning to  emanate from the Jan. 22 special election campaign for the 1st District  supervisorial seat. The district covers East Los Angeles and part of the San  Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> There are four candidates -- State Sens. Charles Calderon of Whittier and Art  Torres of Los Angeles, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina and Sarah  Flores, former aide to retiring incumbent Pete Schabarum.  </P> <P> I'm sure they'll make a lot of promises. Purer water. No more toxic dumping.  Improved county health care for the poor. Swift punishment for criminals.  </P> <P> But watch out for too many promises. Major changes in the nature of Los Angeles  County government have drastically reduced supervisorial ability to keep  pledges made so fervently on the campaign trail.  </P> <P> The biggest change was voter approval in 1978 of Proposition 13, which limited  the property tax, then the main source of county revenue.  </P> <P> Before that, supervisors spent like mad. Every year, they'd plan construction  projects for the next 12 months. Only after completing the list would they add  up the cost. The final step in the budget process, believe it or not, was  setting the property rate.  </P> <P> Monuments to the big spending days can be seen throughout the county. The  county art museum, swimming pools, branch libraries, parks, the County Jail,  hospitals, health clinics and broad highways were built when the supes didn't  worry about paying the bills.  </P> <P> The lavish construction spending generated political patronage that flowed as  steadily as the water in the fountain at the county Music Center. Building,  architectural and engineering contracts went to friends and political  supporters.  </P> <P> Such patronage built political machines. With their vast network of  contractors, donors, friends, staff members and other associates, supervisors  were big men when it came time to choose candidates for city councils, the  state Legislature or even Congress. The supervisors could kill bills in  Sacramento or get them passed. That era produced their present salary  arrangement. They pushed through legislation tying their pay to that of  superior court judges. When the judges get a raise, so do the supes.  </P> <P> The supervisors were generous to the unfortunate as well as to their political  friends. The needy weren't forced to stand in line all day at county hospitals,  as they are today, nor were the mentally ill turned away from county clinics.  </P> <P> That no-priority, anything-goes style budgeting soon was eating up so much  property tax that the people rebelled. One of the rebels was Howard Jarvis, a  loud-voiced, angry businessman who used to attend those free-spending  supervisorial sessions. The supes dismissed him as a gadfly -- or even a crazy.  So Jarvis went out to the Los Angeles County suburbs, where property taxes were  exploding, and began organizing homeowners. They were the first troops in his  Proposition 13 crusade.  </P> <P> The second most-important loss of supervisorial power was in the area of  regulating land use.  </P> <P> In the fast-growth '50s, '60s and '70s, the supervisors made  multimillion-dollar zoning decisions for vast areas of land under county  control -- unincorporated territory, adding to their political clout.  </P> <P> Now, much of the county has been incorporated into cities, leaving the  supervisors' with a much smaller role in shaping development.  </P> <P> The fact that county government has been stripped of these powers doesn't mean  it will remain the same after the election.  </P> <P> The new supervisor, no matter who wins, will emerge as a political power. As  one of the nation's highest-ranked Latino elected officials, the winner will be  an automatic force in Hispanic politics, a star on the political banquet  circuit.  </P> <P> A new supervisor will change the dynamics of the board. Democrats Calderon,  Molina and Torres are more liberal than Schabarum. Even former Schabarum aide  Flores, a Republican, doesn't share her former boss' hostility to health and  welfare spending.  </P> <P> But don't look for much more.  </P> <P> The Proposition 13 limit on property tax revenues made counties dependent on a  deficit-ridden state government for the money needed for those health and  welfare programs. The five little kings are now supplicants, and there's little  hope of getting much help.  </P></p>

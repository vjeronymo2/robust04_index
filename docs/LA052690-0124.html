			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> MAYS EXPLAINS 'NO' VOTE ON PARAMEDICS  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays, a candidate for the state Assembly,  boasts in a recent campaign mailer that his support for senior citizens is  demonstrated by the city's creation of a special, low-cost paramedic service.  </P> <P> "This is the kind of program we need at the state level," Mays says in his  brochure.  </P> <P> The problem is, Mays voted against the plan when it came before the City  Council in January. It passed on a 4-3 vote.  </P> <P> Mays said in an interview this week that he now supports the so-called FIREMED  program. Mays said he voted against it because he feared the program would cost  the city too much money.  </P> <P> The program's promise of low-cost emergency medical service is based on the  level of participation, and Mays said he was skeptical about the prospects.  </P> <P> Under the program, participants are promised unlimited paramedic and ambulance  service for $36 per year.  </P> <P> "The city was taking a big risk," Mays said. Now, "we're actually getting more  participation than we expected (and) I no longer have that concern."  </P> <P> Mays defended his decision to use the program in his campaign literature  because it is something that he would propose in the Assembly.  </P> <P> "I didn't claim that I voted for it or I had anything to do with it," he said.  "I just said this is a program that could be looked at at the state level."  </P> <P> Mays is running against four other Republicans in the 58th Assembly District  primary. The district includes the cities of Huntington Beach, Seal Beach and  Long Beach. DAVE LESHER  </P></p>

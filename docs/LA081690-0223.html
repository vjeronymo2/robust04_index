			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW DISNEY MINORITY HIRING PLAN;  </P> <P> FELLOWSHIPS: THE STUDIO SAYS IT WILL HIRE 27 WRITERS FOR A YEARLONG PROGRAM  INVOLVING ITS THREE DIVISIONS.  </P> <P> The movie studio that ranked at the bottom of two consecutive surveys on job  opportunities for minority writers is now pursuing one of the most aggressive  minority hiring programs that Hollywood has ever seen.  </P> <P> Walt Disney Studios said it soon will announce the names of 27 writers -- all  of whom are African American, Latino, Asian American or women -- who have been  selected for a new writing fellowship program. The writers will be assigned to  work with the studio's creative teams. Each will be paid a salary of $30,000  for a year's work and training, and the group will be divided among the  studio's three divisions: Hollywood Pictures, Touchstone Pictures and Walt  Disney Pictures.  </P> <P> "The hope is that we'll be able to develop first-rate screenwriters," said  Cheryl Hill, the Hollywood Pictures creative executive who heads the program.  The 27 finalists were recruited from more than 2,000 applicants from around the  country who submitted screenplays, said Hill. "If we happen to produce  something they write, they'll be compensated additionally."  </P> <P> Disney's efforts drew praise from civil-rights groups and the Writers Guild of  America West, which had conducted the surveys of job opportunities for minority  writers in 1987 and 1989. Both surveys showed that writers were being shut out  of the market because of age, sex and ethnicity, said Jeff Wallace, WGAW human  resources coordinator.  </P> <P> "In '87 and '89, Disney came in the worst," Wallace said in an interview  Wednesday. "It's refreshing to see them take this aggressive approach."  Wallace, who has been with the Writers Guild since 1986, said Disney's is the  first such program of its scale. "Some of the studios have responded with  pro-active suggestions, and others have yet to respond."  </P> <P> He noted that Warner Bros. had a similar program in the 1970s on a much smaller  scale and that 20th Century Fox has made an effort to employ minority writers  on its episodic TV shows. "Not to belittle the efforts of any of the other  companies, but so far, Disney is the only company to come to us with a program  of this size. Disney just took the lead."  </P> <P> Wallace commended Disney for not only "responding to the problem with bucks,  but with sending other types of messages (to the entertainment industry). They  sent letters to agents asking for more material representing ethnic  minorities."  </P> <P> No one contacted by The Times on Wednesday could recall a similar-size effort,  and most termed the program unprecedented in the industry.  </P> <P> The American Film Institute's Willard Rodgers, who has headed that  organization's Alumni Assn. Writers Workshop since its founding in 1979, said  he didn't think "any studio in the history of the business has ever had that  many minority writers.  </P> <P> "I was skeptical at first," he said about the studio's dedication. "But I think  they've gotten first-class writers." Rodgers noted that three or four of the  individuals may be from his own AFI workshop. Disney, he said, "has to be  commended very highly."  </P> <P> Disney's program will begin amid a backdrop of heightened awareness of job  opportunities -- or the lack thereof -- for minorities and women in the film  industry.  </P> <P> In early July, the Beverly Hills/Hollywood Chapter of the Nation Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People issued a report suggesting that there are fewer  opportunities for blacks in Hollywood executive suites now than there were 10  years ago. Chapter president Sandra Evers-Manly said the report was based on  surveys and talks with all the major studios. She anticipates issuing a "report  card" for each company's recruitment activities beginning this fall.  </P> <P> Evers-Manly called the Disney program "encouraging and a start in the right  direction" to correcting the situation for groups "who have not been  traditionally hired. It will show that there has been an abundance of talent  that has not been previously recognized."  </P> <P> Evers-Manly credited Disney "for making a commitment that says, 'Hey, when the  next report comes out, we don't want to be last again.' "  </P> <P> A lack of opportunity for women on screen was documented in a Screen Actors  Guild report issued Aug. 1, showing startling decreases in both women's roles  and relative income. In 1989, it said, 71 percent of all roles in feature films  and 64 percent of all roles in TV went to men.  </P> <P> At the convention of the National Assn. of Black Journalists earlier this  month, the subject of "Blacks in Hollywood" also was a topic for a panel of  entertainment figures, many of whom concluded that blacks must not rely on the  studios to advance their image and economic status.  </P> <P> However, Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of the panelists, said  he believed that the major entertainment companies "must change the way we do  business and (must) create opportunity." He acknowledged the company's previous  poor record and said Disney management had made correcting it a priority.  </P> <P> Disney's Hill attributed the push for establishing the fellowship to  Katzenberg's "real aggressive position" on the issue.  </P> <P> She said the names of the individuals chosen will be announced at a later date.  They will report to work Sept. 17.  </P></p>

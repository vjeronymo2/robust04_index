			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Extensive helicopter surveys across the entire range of habitat types present in Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, resulted in the sighting of some 2,400 animals. Actual population numbers are likely to be considerably higher. It is not possible to derive an estimate of absolute numbers for Queensland, but sampling of potentially suitable habitats yielded an average density index of 0.77 crocodile/km of waterway. Surveys in 1977&hyph;78 resulted in a population estimate of about 2,000 crocodiles beyond the hatchling stage for Western Australia. The population was estimated at 2,500 crocodiles beyond the hatchling stage when it was resurveyed in 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Over-utilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Population estimates of saltwater crocodiles in Australia were not made prior to 1970. Over- exploitation for the skin trade and persecution as undesirable wildlife began in the late 1940's and did not subside until hunting was banned in 1972. The export of saltwater crocodiles and their parts from Australia was prohibited in 1972 by an amendment of the customs regulations. By that time, many accessible populations had become seriously threatened with extirpation. With the enactment of state and territorial protection laws [Wildlife Conservation and Control Ordinance (1962)_Northern Territories; the Fauna Conservation Act (1974)_Queensland; and the Wildlife Conservation Act (1950)_Western Australia], the populations showed an immediate response and have tripled in numbers since surveying began in the late 1970's (ANPWS 1990, op. cit)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the 1985 meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES, the Australian saltwater crocodile population was transferred from Appendix I to Appendix II, pursuant to resolution Conf. 3.15 on ranching. This provides for trade in saltwater crocodiles bred in captivity or raised on farms under approved management plans. The transfer was recommended by the Australian Council of Nature Conservation Ministers and IUCN Crocodile Specialist Group. The Australian CITES proposal to transfer the Australian population of saltwater crocodile to Appendix II to allow trade under the ranching provision was based on a series of experimental egg harvests and quantification of the impacts of those harvests. No discernible impact of this egg harvest has been detected on the number of crocodiles in subsequent age classes. Australia allows a regulated annual harvest of crocodile eggs for farm operations under approved management plans. The effects of the egg harvests are quantified and assessed through monitoring programs in the harvested areas. Approval to harvest eggs incorporates a commitment that if any decline in the wild population were to occur, a larger number of 1-year old crocodiles would be returned to the wild than would have survived had no eggs or hatchlings been removed from the wild. At the present time, only the Northern Territory and Western Australia have approved management plans under which the harvest of eggs is allowed for ranching operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to information provided by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS 1990, op. cit.), the capture and relocation of nuisance crocodiles can only be authorized by State government personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Northern Territories, nuisance animals are caught alive and relocated to farms whenever practical. In other cases, they are destroyed by Northern Territory Conservation Commission personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Western Australia, problem crocodiles are captured and removed, or where the level of risk to humans is unacceptable, permission to kill the crocodile may be given. In both States, those problem animals relocated to farms are individually marked and, if not required for captive breeding, are available for harvest after they have been maintained in captivity for a minimum of 30 days. In Queensland, crocodiles may be removed to provide breeding stock for closed-cycle farms. Nuisance animals may be removed to provide breeding stock or destroyed where other options are not available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Traditional harvest of crocodiles and crocodile eggs for food by Aborigines of the Northern Territory is allowed. However, the low level of traditional harvests is not considered a threat to the populations. Traditional use does not include commercial trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

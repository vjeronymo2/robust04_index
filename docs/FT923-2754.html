			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Trinity ahead of City forecasts with Pounds 7.89m TRINITY International, the Chester-based publisher of the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo, announced a 14 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.94m to Pounds 7.89m for the six months to June 27. Mr David Sneddon, chief executive of the group which has local and regional papers in north-west England, North Wales, Canada and the US, said yesterday he was particularly pleased by the performance of the group's UK newspapers despite the recession. 'We took costs out a long time ago,' said Mr Sneddon, who added that display advertising at the Liverpool Echo was more than 16 per cent up during the first half. The results were better than expected and the share price rose by 9p to close at 250p. This year Trinity has turned itself into a more concentrated media company. In January it sold its papermaking and packaging division to Danish Paper Packaging for Pounds 27m in cash. In July the purchase of Scottish and Universal Newspapers from Lonrho for Pounds 45m was completed too late to be included in the first half results. The company said that integration of the Scottish titles was going well. Turnover of the continuing Trinity businesses increased by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 49m. Earnings per share rose by 5.1 per cent to 8.2p and the dividend is 2.7p compared with 2.5p. Trinity warned that its Canadian newspaper businesses were still experiencing competitive pressures which 'together with continued dollar weakness will have some impact on profitability.' However, the new management in Canada was 'aggressively addressing the competitive position.' Trinity said it was confident that results for the full year would be satisfactory provided there was no material worsening of market conditions. In the year to December 1991 Trinity made pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.3m. This year analysts are expecting between Pounds 16.2m and Pounds 16.6m. Trinity is also looking at acquisition prospects in the newspaper industry.</p>

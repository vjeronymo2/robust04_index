			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Drayton Asia withdraws its reconstruction proposals THE BOARD of Drayton Asia, the Far East investment trust, is dropping the reconstruction proposals it formulated in an attempt to defeat a bid from EFM Dragon Investment Trust. Drayton Asia said it had abandoned the proposals because CIN, the manager of the British Coal Pension funds, had said it would vote against the plans. CIN has a 20.1 per cent stake in Drayton Asia; the proposals would have needed 75 per cent approval. CIN also has a 20.8 per cent stake in EFM Dragon and a controlling interest in Edinburgh Fund Managers, which runs the rival trust. Drayton said it invited EFM Dragon to participate in its proposals and explore ways of modifying them to offer shareholders the option of receiving Dragon shares and cash. Dragon rejected the approach. The Drayton proposals would have offered shareholders a choice between a unit trust and a new split capital investment trust. Mr Ratan Engineer, chairman of Drayton Asia, said 'shareholders should continue to reject the bid until they are offered at least a suitable cash alternative.' However, Mr Iain Watt of EFM Dragon, said that Drayton was in 'complete disarray'.</p>

The supply break was due to administrative problems at  Nafta, the Russian exporter, MOL said.    The break, which "was not the first example of a halt of  supplies", did not affect work at Hungary's oil refineries and  resulted only in rescheduling a 40,000-ton delivery to Hungary,  the officials said. Last year, Hungary imported 5.1 million  tonnes of crude from Russia and this year's imports were also  planned to exceed five million tons, they said.</p>

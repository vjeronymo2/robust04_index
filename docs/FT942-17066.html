			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / World Trade News: Protests grow in India over Gatt accord Hundreds of thousands of protesters staged a rally in New Delhi yesterday, in the biggest demonstration so far of public opposition to the Uruguay Round agreement on world trade liberalisation. The meeting, organised by the right-wing militant Hindu Bharatiya Janata party, followed another on Tuesday called by left-wing groups, which also attracted more than 100,000 people. At both events, speakers condemned the Uruguay Round draft accord as an instrument of oppression foisted by rich countries on the developing world. They said the agreement would pave the way to new economic enslavement of India. At yesterday's rally, Mr Arthur Dunkel, former director-general of Gatt Trade, was burnt in effigy. The rallies highlight fears in India and other developing countries that the US and other rich countries will use the new World Trade Organisation, which is being established to replace Gatt, to impose one-sided conditions for trade with third world nations. The public protests have not persuaded the government of Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to change its mind about approving the Urugay Round pact at the Gatt meeting in Marrakesh next week. Like most other developing country leaders Mr Rao has accepted that the benefits of the agreement, in terms of greater access to world markets, outweigh disadvantages, such as opening India's markets to foreign companies faster than he would like. But the recent US move to link trade pacts to social issues including minimum wage levels, pollution controls and human rights has angered India and other developing countries. The US action gave fresh impetus to the organisers of this week's Delhi rallies.</p>

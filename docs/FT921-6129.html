			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls on profit-taking and rise in jobless data Wall Street US EQUITIES retreated yesterday on sporadic profit-taking and disappointment about a rise in weekly unemployment claims, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.87 down at 3,269.45, having spent the day in negative territory, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.49 to 413.86. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, however, bucked the trend. Building on Wednesday's sharp gain, the index added 1.55 at 633.95. Turnover on the New York SE came to 215m shares. The only economic news of the day was broadly bearish, with the Labor Department reporting that an extra 7,000 people had filed claims for state unemployment insurance during the second week of the month. The figures make it more likely that the February employment report, due out on March 6, will show a further deterioration in job market conditions. Warner-Lambert dropped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 in turnover of 3.8m shares on news that the US Food and Drug Administration had raised questions that could delay marketing approval for the company's Lopid SR drug, which is used to regulate cholesterol. The ADRs of UK drugs group Glaxo were heavily traded for the second consecutive day, shedding a further Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 28 1/8 in volume of 4.4m. Glaxo has been in the news in Europe, after Denmark's Office of Fair Trading said it was requesting the European Commission to investigate the company's pricing policies. Philips jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 20 3/8 in busy trading after the Dutch group turned a big 1990 loss into a healthy profit for 1991. Trading in Conagra shares was delayed during the morning because of an order imbalance on the sell side, sparked by news that the stock had been downgraded by Goldman Sachs. When trading reopened, Conagra fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 27 7/8 . Chemical Waste Management put on Dollars 1 to Dollars 20 7/8 after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy', arguing that the shares, currently trading at a 15 per cent premium to the market, are undervalued based on earnings projections. On the over-the-counter market, Vitesse Semiconductor climbed Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 20 after the company backed market estimates that its second-quarter earnings would reach 7 cents a share, a big improvement on the previous year's quarter. US Bancorp rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 23 after the regional banking group agreed to buy 49 branches in northern California and Nevada from BankAmerica (up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 43 7/8 ) and Security Pacific (Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars 36 5/8 ) for Dollars 70m. Canada THE Toronto market ended little changed as gains in gold shares countered losses in the metals and minerals sector. Most other groups were steady. Analysts said the market was digesting Wednesday's 35-point upturn in the composite index following the release of the Federal Budget. The index closed just 3.6 firmer at 3,584.1. Rises led declines by 331 to 235 after volume of 33m shares. Toronto-Dominion Bank dipped CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 17 after lower first-quarter earnings.</p>

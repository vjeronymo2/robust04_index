			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (20): Taking the partnership route - Japan: A look at the importance of the YSX project Officials, researchers and financiers of the Japanese aerospace industry were today gathering for a meeting that has become an annual ceremony - to discuss whether the country should once again seek a place in the world commercial aircraft industry. At issue will be a plan to build a small passenger aeroplane, the YSX, which the industry and its guardians at Miti - the ministry of international trade and industry - have been nurturing for the past five years. Although still just a vision in the eyes of planners and manufacturers, the YSX has already caught the Japanese public's imagination. The interest shown in the aircraft is understandable, given the traditional Japanese fondness for national projects and symbols of industrial might. But the YSX is not just a symbol of Japan's resolve to establish its credibility within the industry. It is the third attempt by some of the country's most highly regarded manufacturers to build and market an aircraft on a commercial basis; and the stakes are high. For the bureaucrats at Miti who are backing the project, it is not just a question of pride, although that, too, is important. Unlike some of the more shining examples of Japan's manufacturing prowess, the aerospace industry, despite good intentions and recognised skills, has been something of a blemish on the country's industrial record. The ministry, more famous for its successes in industrial planning than its failures, is expected to increase the amount of money available to the project next year to Y1.1bn, which will cover the costs of a feasibility study that has been carried out since 1989. The increase, from Y550m this year, at a time when government coffers have been reduced by one of the longest recessions since the war, represents a strengthened commitment to a project that could lose millions and create another blemish on its record. For the five leading Japanese aerospace manufacturers participating in the YSX programme, the risks are also daunting. 'The initial development costs for commercial aircraft are extremely high, and it takes about 10 years to make profits, so we have to be cautious,' emphasises Mr Yutaka Hineno, general manager of MHI's aerospace and special vehicle headquarters. 'It is not going to be easy.' In the past, the industry has had little joy in its attempts to develop and market commercial aircraft. The only two designed and built in Japan - a 64-seat twin-propeller airliner called the YS-11 and a short take-off and landing plane called Asuka - have been embarrassing commercial failures. Manufacturers, however, claim that it is not for lack of technical ability that the industry has lagged behind those in the US and Europe. Japanese technical capabilities have been tested through the substantial amount of subcontracting work they have done for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, and on joint development projects with Boeing, such as the 777 and 767. The latter, in particular, provided Japanese companies with experience in building the aircraft's body. 'At first, Japanese companies did not have any speciality, but after the Boeing 767, Japanese companies are probably good at body work,' claims Mr Hineno. He believes that the real stumbling blocks to the growth of Japan's aerospace industry have been a domestic market that is too small to support a leading industry, and the ban on Japanese exports of defence products. But additionally, there is the bitter truth which the YS-11 fiasco - it went out of production in 1972 after 12 years, because it was unprofitable - taught both the industry and Miti: the Japanese industry lacks the marketing expertise and the credibility needed to sell commercial aircraft globally. Although the YS-11 was actually respected as an aircraft, industry officials explain, nobody was willing to take the risk of buying expensive planes from Japanese manufacturers, which had no established record. To avoid the same mistake, the industry and Miti have consented to have a western partner on their next endeavour, the YSX. 'We have to team up with an established partner, like Boeing or Airbus, to sell the plane, because we don't have the marketing ability and need to provide after-sales services,' concedes Mr Hineno. The latest indications are that the preferred partner is Boeing, with which the Japanese aerospace industry has a long relationship. But the question facing the industry then would be whether it could shed the junior-partner role it has always been relegated to in its dealings with the US company. The inability of Japanese aerospace companies to win more than medium-technology work from Boeing - such as wing-flaps - has earned the industry a reputation as a permanent subcontractor to the US company. An attempt was made to play a more prominent role in the development of Boeing's 777 jet by taking a 21 per cent stake in the project. However, even MHI, the leading Japanese company in the industry, admits that there is a long way to go before the industry can claim partnership with Boeing. 'We see it as joint development, but others say it is subcontracting,' concedes Mr Hineno. 'Japanese companies will only be able to increase their share of a project by improving their labour capabilities, facilities and technology.' For example, Boeing has always kept work on the main wings largely to itself. Wing work needs large-scale manufacturing capacity, which does not exist in Japan, he explains. Even if the Japanese industry manages to take the lead in a commercial venture, it is likely to face fierce competition on the global market, where there are several other projects to develop a small passenger jet. For the industry, and for Miti, there are few options. 'The project is unlikely to go ahead if it appears that it won't be profitable,' says an official at the ministry. Yet the country's defence budget, where the industry derives 75 per cent of sales, is shrinking; and industry and government agree that aerospace manufacturing must be retained for the technological skills that it generates for a variety of industries.</p>

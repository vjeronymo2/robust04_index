			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Move to avert rail strike expected TALKS BETWEEN British Rail and the RMT transport union are expected to try to avert the second 24-hour rail strike planned for Friday April 16. The RMT's executive yesterday decided to allow a breathing space before the next stoppage is due to take place so that a 'negotiated settlement' might be reached with British Rail. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said yesterday: 'The opportunity is there if BR want to take it.' He stressed that his union's dispute is with the British Railways board and not the travelling public. 'As a responsible trade union we respect the fact that many thousands of families and individuals will be setting off to enjoy a break this (Easter) weekend. We do not intend to disrupt that holiday,' he said. Mr Knapp added that the RMT was 'willing to resume negotiations to find a resolution of the dispute'. The union is asking BR for a guarantee that it will not seek compulsory redundancies among its members and for a ban on the employment of contractors on the railway network. Mr Paul Watkinson, BR group personnel director, expressed dismay at the decision to hold a second 24-hour strike and said he would be in touch with the union to see 'once again whether there is scope to resolve the situation through serious talking with a will to reach a solution'. BR appears concerned to reach a settlement of the dispute, which is costing the railway industry Pounds 10m for each lost day, rather than simply to toughen its stance against the RMT. Aslef, the train drivers' union, is due today to announce the result of its ballot on a 24-hour strike and other action which could lead to further disruption.</p>

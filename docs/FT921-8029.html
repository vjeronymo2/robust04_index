			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Miniscribe fraud award overturned A JURY award of over Dollars 550m against Hambrecht &amp; Quist, the San Francisco investment banking group, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the international accounting firm, in a fraud case brought by former investors in Miniscribe, the now defunct computer disk drive manufacturer, has been set aside by the Texas judge hearing the case. The parties agreed to an undisclosed out-of-court settlement. The judge ruled the jury verdict against Coopers &amp; Lybrand was 'contrary to the great weight and preponderance of the evidence'. The accounting firm said it was unaware of allegedly fraudulent activities by former managers at Miniscribe. The case was brought by an investment management firm on behalf of former Miniscribe bondholders. The jury awarded Dollars 20m in actual damages and Dollars 530m in punitive damages to investors who had purchased about Dollars 18m in bonds on the basis of misleading financial statements from Miniscribe. Jurors assessed Dollars 250m in punitive damages against Mr Q. T. Wiles, Miniscribe's former chairman, who served as a director of Hambrecht and Quist until 1989. Coopers &amp; Lybrand said the decision to dismiss the verdict corroborated its stand that it was the victim of fraud by Miniscribe and that any failures on its part were based on information deliberately misstated by Miniscribe.</p>

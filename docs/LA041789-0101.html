			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOCCER STADIUM WORKER SAYS HE DEFIED POLICE ORDER TO OPEN GATE  </P> <P> A gatekeeper said today that he refused police orders to open an outer gate and  allow thousands of late arrivals to pour into a soccer stadium where 94 fans  were crushed to death. Fans and officials said police opened the barrier.  </P> <P> South Yorkshire police, who were in charge of Saturday's club semifinal at  Hillsborough stadium, came under mounting attack as Liverpool ordered a week of  mourning for victims who went to watch the city's team play Nottingham Forest.  </P> <P> Fans and officials said officers responded inadequately and far too slowly when  spectators were crushed against a steel anti-riot fence in a standing-room-only  area.  </P> <P> Gatekeeper Jack Stone told the Yorkshire Post that he refused police orders to  open a 16-foot-wide outer gate. Survivors said about 4,000 fans outside were  pushing at turnstiles.  </P> <P> Stone would not confirm survivors' reports that police officers opened the  concertina gate. But he told the newspaper: "You know as well as anyone whose  fault it was."  </P></p>

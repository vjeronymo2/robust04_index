			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Money Markets: UK prices in cuts WITH ONLY three days to go to the British government's Autumn Statement, traders in the sterling cash market priced a full percentage point cut in base rates into their cash market operations yesterday, writes James Blitz. However, futures contracts in sterling and other European currencies fell back on a mixture of profit-taking and slight disappointment that there had been no easing of official credit policy in the UK and France. The Bank of France did not change the money market intervention rate, currently standing at 9.35 per cent, in yesterday's securities repurchase operation. The sterling cash market was again hit by the liquidity problem that affects the market when there is a high expectation of interest rate cuts. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 950m at the start of operations, but only Pounds 51m was removed in the early round. Traders were unwilling to offer bills in the run-up to what one commercial bank dealer called 'the most publicised rate reduction in the history of mankind'. In the morning, the one-month cash rate was trading well below the Bank's estab-lished rate for a 21-day repo, explaining the market's reluc-tance to offer bills. The over-night rate peaked at 15 per cent. Once this level had been reached, dealers were happier to borrow cash from the Bank at established rates, and lend on the 'overnight'. This brought out more bills in the afternoon, although there was late assistance of Pounds 430m. Three-month money closed at 7 1/8 per cent offered, down from Friday's 7 5/16 per cent. One dealer did not rule out the possibility that three-month money could go below 7 per cent before Thursday. The December short sterling contract, which expires on December 16, fell back 14 basis points from its opening level to close at 93.60. This can still price in a 200 basis-point fall in base rates before the year's end, and the decline reflected slightly gloomier sentiment across the world rather than any creeping bearishness in UK markets. One commercial bank dealer said the price adjustments were due to a rise in 3-month dollar cash rates to 3 3/4 per cent, compared to the Fed Funds rate of 3 per cent. Tighter US conditions preceded this week's big Treasury Bond issues, which are expected to show a rise in yields.</p>

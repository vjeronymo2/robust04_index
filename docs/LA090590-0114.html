			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ON THE PREP PATH;  </P> <P> FACING A FAMILY'S TRAUMA PUTS SPORT IN PERSPECTIVE  </P> <P> There is little swaggering among the football players at Cypress High School.  Unlike many football teams, excess bravado seems nearly nonexistent. Egos  remain fixed to reality. The macho-quotient runs low.  </P> <P> Cynics might point out the reason for this is that Cypress -- a team that is  12-24 in the past four years under Coach John Selbe and has not had a season  above .500 since it went 6-4 in 1981 -- has had little reason to put on airs.  </P> <P> But that is not necessarily the case. Cypress finished 5-5 last year, fourth in  the Empire League. Not a championship team, but not a pooch, either.  </P> <P> But one situation has taught the team more about maturity than any late-game,  third-and-one situation ever could.  </P> <P> Three years ago, standout sophomore tackle Joe Toohey learned that his  15-year-old girlfriend was pregnant with his child. Shortly after its birth,  the baby, Alyssa, was diagnosed as having histiocytosis x, a rare disease that  affects the immune system. In infants, the disease is similar to advanced  leukemia.  </P> <P> In December, after spending much of her first year in the hospital, Alyssa  died.  </P> <P> Two weeks later, Toohey's father was diagnosed with cancer of the bladder. He  has been hospitalized the past seven months, and has since lost his bladder to  the disease and his right leg to complications. He will undergo more surgery  Thursday.  </P> <P> Today, Toohey, 18, is one of three varsity assistants at Cypress. Along with  two other standouts from last year's team, Ramon Reid and Jayson Bern, Toohey  helps coach the offensive and defensive lines.  </P> <P> Reid and Bern, also all-league selections last year, have faced disappointment  in their athletic careers. Last fall, Reid sustained a career-ending knee  injury and Bern suffered a broken neck vertebra that left him temporarily  paralyzed. But each admits Toohey's problems have put theirs in perspective.  </P> <P> During the season opener last September, Cypress defeated Kennedy, 7-6, with  Toohey keying the defense on a late-game goal-line stand.  </P> <P> The following Monday, Toohey was awarded the game ball. Another ball was  presented for his daughter, who had become the team's inspiration.  </P> <P> After the presentation, the players hugged Toohey. "They just wanted him to  know they were there for him," Selbe said.  </P> <P> Selbe, who made frequent visits to the hospital to see Alyssa, has on his desk  a framed photograph of himself with Toohey, his girlfriend and the baby. Alyssa  died a month after the photo was taken.  </P> <P> The Cypress players and coaches attended the funeral.  </P> <P> "You would like to believe," Selbe said, "that all this stuff that we tell the  kids about handling adversity has helped Joey in some way. . . . This is one of  those situations where you really hope it has."  </P> <P> Patricia Toohey, Joe's mother, says her son's involvement with coaching has  given him a sense of stability.  </P> <P> "Our home life is so torn up right now, at least he's got Coach Selbe and his  friends on the team," Patricia Toohey said. "He's had his share of bad days,  but thank God he has that team for support."  </P> <P> There's no question it has had an effect on the Cypress players and on the team  as a whole. "It made us think," said senior lineman Youssef Semaan. "And it  bonded us together even more than we already were."  </P> <P> Selbe says Toohey's tragedy gave them a sense of perspective.  </P> <P> "We're a family," Selbe said. "We've been with him through all his tough times.  . . . What happened to Joey made them realize there's more to the football  experience -- there's more to life -- than playing games and scoring  touchdowns."  </P> <P> A moving thought for the football-frenzied weeks to come.  </P> <P> Add Cypress: For Selbe, the only on-campus coach on his staff, hiring three of  last year's players as assistants was an unusual but necessary means of  replacing three assistants who took jobs elsewhere.  </P> <P> "We really needed coaches, and when I asked them, the kids were interested,"  Selbe said. "Right now, I'm coaching coaches, and I'm coaching kids."  </P> <P> Certain adjustments had to be made by both sides.  </P> <P> Players cannot call Toohey, Reid or Bern by their first names, even though many  consider the three their closest friends. And off-field socialization is to be  kept to a minimum.  </P> <P> Said Semaan, one of Reid's best buddies: "We'll go to the movies, Coach Reid  and me, but he still wants me to call him Coach Reid.  </P> <P> "During Hell Week, when it got real tough, I wanted to say 'Leave me alone! Get  out of my face!' But Ramon -- I mean Coach Reid -- he'd push me even harder.  That's when I knew I wasn't getting a break this year."  </P> <P> Trivia question: Which Orange County schools return more than one all-Southern  Section football player?  </P> <P> Included in the Southern Section cross-country preview, a 15-page informative  packet sent to all coaches, is a section titled:  </P> <P> "23-Point Defensive Game Plan for Lawsuit-Conscious Coaches."  </P> <P> What, no videotape edition?  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Newport Harbor (kicker Josh Klein and wide receiver George  Greenwalt) and Santa Margarita (linebacker Mike Farris and defensive back Josh  Ireland).  </P></p>

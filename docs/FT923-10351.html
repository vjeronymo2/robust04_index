			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / US space station kept alive by House THE US House of Representatives has voted to keep alive the Dollars 40bn American space station project, despite criticism both of its cost and of its scientific utility. Although opponents of the costly project had hoped their cause would profit from a new eagerness to tackle extravagant government spending, the House voted 237:181 (almost exactly the same margin as a year ago) against cancelling the station. 'In difficult economic times, the Congress stood up and did what's right for the future,' said Mr Daniel Goldin, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), who has led ferocious lobbying to preserve the space station. But Congressman David Obey charged that many in Congress had been swayed by Nasa contracts in their districts. 'Nasa has successfully salted enough contracts all around the country. That's how they think they can continue to save this programme,' he said. Nasa says the space station already provides more than 75,000 jobs in 37 states. Of the 24 states which have received more than Dollars 1m in such contracts, House delegations from all but five voted on Wednesday night in favour of continuing the station's funding. Even so, the House voted only Dollars 1.7bn for the space station in the 1993 fiscal year - Dollars 500m less than the Bush administration had requested. A Senate committee yesterday voted Dollars 2.1bn for the project, which would probably fall behind its aim for launch in 1995 if it received only the Dollars 1.7bn agreed by the House. 'The story is: 'Look up, America. Don't look around',' Congressman Bob Traxler, another leading opponent, intoned with irony. 'Forget what you see in your cities, the rural areas. Forget the poverty, the privation. See that glimmer up in the sky? It's got eight people up there. Isn't that wonderful?'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif after </F> President Husni Mubarak's meeting with members of the National  Democratic Party's [NDP] Political Bureau in Cairo on 4 April--  recorded]    [Text] During his meeting with members of the NDP Political  Bureau, the president discussed the working papers of the  national dialogue and the results of the meetings that took  place between the NDP and leaders of the Egyptian political  parties. These papers contained the viewpoints, ideas, and  concepts of the Egyptian parties on the national dialogue from  the perspective of the objectives and mechanisms of this  dialogue.    During this meeting, President Mubarak affirmed many  principles. First, that national dialogue is a dialogue among  all the political parties and the constitutional institutions in  which intellectuals, thinkers, unions, federations, and  universities take part. Second, that the National Democratic  Party is a party to this dialogue. It cannot impose opinions on  it. Its responsibility, as the party of the majority, is to  provide the opportunity for the dialogue to succeed and to make  available to every side all the information and statements  regarding the issues open for discussion. All the political,  economic, and social issues of the homeland are open to dialogue  for the present and future of Egypt. So that the call for the  dialogue starts off on the right course, President Mubarak has  decided to form a minicommittee called the Committee To Prepare  for National Dialogue. It will include 25 members selected by  the president from among the leaders of the political parties,  unions, intellectuals, and those who have an opinion. The  committee will state its views on:    1. Identifying the general committee for national dialogue  and the names of those personalities who are expected to be  invited to join in the national dialogue.    2. Proposing the objectives and issues of national  dialogue.    3. Studying the method of action of this general  committee, or general congress, as well as its subcommittees,  specializations, the method of convening it, and the  administration of its meetings.    4. Proposing and providing the groundwork for the  statements that should be made available to serve the issues the  national dialogue will address.    5. Proposing a venue for the general congress and the  various committees of the national dialogue.    President Mubarak will invite the members of the Committee  To  Prepare for National Dialogue to a meeting when he returns from  his upcoming visit to Japan and China.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARIZONA ENACTS LAW TO ESTABLISH DR. KING HOLIDAY  </P> <P> Gov. Rose Mofford signed legislation Wednesday designating a paid holiday for  state employees to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., just hours after the  Arizona House passed it.  </P> <P> The late-afternoon signing of the bill culminated a 15-year political struggle  over a King holiday.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, the House passed the bill, 35 to 25.  </P> <P> Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat, proclaimed a day honoring the late civil  rights leader in 1986. His successor, Republican Evan Mecham, rescinded the  order before it was to have taken effect and the ensuing uproar led to protest  marches, boycotts and cancellations of conventions in the state.  </P> <P> The new law designates the third Monday of January to be observed as Martin  Luther King-Civil Rights Day. It repeals an earlier measure that substituted a  King Day for Columbus Day on the state's calendar of paid holidays.  </P> <P> Because it also cancels a November referendum on the issue, the law is likely  to touch off a drive to put the matter to a popular vote.  </P></p>

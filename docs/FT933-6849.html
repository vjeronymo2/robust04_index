			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Cash flow behind rise at Kerry KERRY GROUP, the west of Ireland-based meat, dairy and food ingredients company, achieved a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 13.6m (Pounds 12.8m) for the six months to June 30. Turnover was marginally higher at IPounds 394.4m. The profits increase was largely due to strong cash flow of IPounds 29m and lower interest rates in the US, UK and Ireland, where Kerry has a geographically even spread of business. One Dublin analyst said the result was 'evidence of the strong cash flow the company can generate even without any major acquisitions. Currency movements have masked volume growth in the business, which has gone up by about 4 per cent. 'The second half result will probably be even better as interest rates drop further still and volume growth will be better reflected in the figures'. The group has expanded rapidly over the past five years through acquisitions, with turnover and pre-tax profits now running at three times 1987 levels. Acquisitions in the first half of this year have been relatively modest with new businesses added in Canada, the UK and Ireland. However, the group said: 'Our strategic plan for further expansion in the US is taking shape. We are looking at a number of opportunities and we hope to announce some acquisitions during the second half of the year'. The tax charge rose from IPounds 950,000 to IPounds 2.5m which the company said was due to the ending of a number of tax concessions enjoyed in the past, and the widening geographic spread of the business. 'This will be a typical charge now going forward from here' the company said. Earnings per share increased by 15.6 per cent to 7.03p. The interim dividend is lifted 15 per cent to 0.91p (0.79p).</p>

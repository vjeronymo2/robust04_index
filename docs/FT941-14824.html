			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Kazakhstan pays with oilfields The US-Turkish company United BMB and Germany's Siemens have signed a Dollars 581m contract to build a 950MW natural gas-fired power plant in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, writes Steve LeVine in Istanbul. Company officials said the deal involved no cash. The Caspian Sea republic has granted the two companies three proven oilfields that, over a 10-year period, are expected to make up the contract price plus interest and the cost of oilfield development. About 30 test wells have been drilled in the fields, located in the Aktubinsk region, and they are estimated to contain 60m tonnes of recoverable oil, according to BMB's chairman, Mr Ali Riza Bozkurt. The consortium, to be led by Siemens, will build the combined-cycle plant, capable of operating on natural gas or kerosene, over a three-year period in Aktubinsk. United BMB will build the plant, and Siemens will supply the technology, including turbines and electrical equipment. Construction is to begin after the consortium and its government partner choose an oil company to help develop the field, after which a production-sharing agreement must be signed with Kazakhstan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "It Does Not Fulfill Anyone's Dreams; </F> Unofficially on the Budget"]    [Text] "This budget has been presented by a  government formed by the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the  Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and was established as a result of  our decisions. We should help the budget with our actions." This  is the way Aleksander Kwasniewski appealed to the SLD Sejm  deputies during the Wednesday [5 January] session of the SLD  Deputies Club. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak is said to have  tried to explain to the PSL's Sejm deputies "how this kind of  domestic debt came about and how the budget corresponds to  keeping election promises." Most of the opposition Sejm deputies  as well as the Union of Labor and some trade unionists who are  members of the SLD intend to take a look at the budget draft in  the Sejm commissions, even though they basically think it is  bad.    The Pawlak government's budget draft was the main  preoccupation of Sejm deputies in their unofficial talks,  especially during sessions of the various parliamentary clubs on  Wednesday. But there was not too much fuss about it. The draft,  which "fulfills nobody's dreams" but which could not be any  other way (as Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and finance  minister, told his deputies) was perceived with calm before its  first reading. "As far as I know, this is a special kind of law,  which cannot be rejected at its first reading. It must find its  way to the commission," said Jerzy Osiatynski of the Democratic  Union [UD], who added that UD cannot approve of this budget  because it is an instrument for implementing an economic policy  that is different from that of UD.    Leszek Moczulski, chairman of the Confederation for an  Independent Poland, called the draft a budget "of national  disaster," and he also said that his party has not yet decided  on a course of action, but it does not rule out submitting a  motion for rejecting the draft at its first reading.    Borowski said during a session of the SLD Sejm Deputies Club  that he hopes the PSL "will approve of the draft even though it  will not be happy with it." Someone from the audience said at  the beginning of the PSL Sejm Deputies Club's session that the  budget is not satisfactory because it is not a budget of  transformations. According to Janusz Piechocinski, in its  statement in the Sejm, the PSL will be asking questions on the  meaning behind the budget--and on what it is supposed to lead  to--in the context of a four-year term of office by the  government. They will also be asking what proportion of  election-time promises the budget fulfills. "Borowski will have  to respond outright: We will do this and this but not that or  that because these will be included in the next budget."    "The PSL expects," he added, "that, while presenting the  draft in the Sejm, Borowski will make it clear that its shape is  a result of necessities, including servicing both the foreign  and the domestic debt."    While answering questions from SLD members about to what  extent the budget is a continuation and to what extent it  represents change, Borowski jokingly replied that it is a "new  budget to the extent of 3 percent because this is by how much  revenues exceed what would have been in a draft submitted by  Hanna Suchocka's Cabinet." He said the latter revenues are  somewhat "tightened up."    Kwasniewski made an appeal to "think positively" about the  draft and to reconcile the "harsh economic reality with social  expectations." He also said that, on the issue of submitting the  budget before the commission, just as during the entire vote on  the budget, a strict, clubwide discipline will be enforced in  the SLD. Stanislaw Wisniewski, deputy chairman of the All-Polish  Trade Unions Agreement, told RZECZPOSPOLITA later that, in that  case, he may be absent from the vote. He will not oppose the  budget during its first reading, but he does not have great  hopes that the commissions will manage to improve it  significantly. That is why he will be counting on 30-40 SLD  members to support his position during the final vote on the  budget. Another deputy chairman, Waclaw Martyniuk, thinks it is  just simple "trade union rhetoric," while, regarding the vote,  he will... at this point he snapped two of his fingers.</p>

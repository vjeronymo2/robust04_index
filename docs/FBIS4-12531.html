			<p>BFN     [Text] Top Kashmiri leaders met the prime minister in New  Delhi last night in a bid to remove bottlenecks impeding the  political process in the state. The minister of state for home,  Mr. Rajesh Pilot; the former state chief minister, Dr. Farooq  Abdullah; the pradesh [state] Congress-I chief, Mr. Ghulam  Rasool Kar, met Mr. Narasimha Rao soon after their arrival in  the capital from Srinagar yesterday evening. The Jammu and  Kashmir governor, General Krishna Rao, who also arrived in New  Delhi yesterday, is likely to meet the prime minister and other  central leaders today to apprise them of the situation in the  state.    [Hong Kong AFP in English 1832 GMT on 8 Apr in a New  Delhi-datelined report adds: `An umbrella group of Kashmiri  Moslems Friday said it was ready for talks to end the separatist  violence in the Indian state, where 11 people were killed the  past few days.    `The All Party Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference said it had  come  to New Delhi on "an important mission" and was prepared for  negotiations "without reservation and without prejudice."    `Four leaders of the Conference, which includes nearly 30  groups sympathetic to the Moslem separatist campaign in Kashmir,  arrived here on their way to Vienna for a meeting between  Kashmiri leaders of India and Pakistan.    `The Conference officials said the release of Kashmiris from  Indian prisons would "create the right atmosphere for holding a  free and frank dialogue."    `It was not clear whether the leaders would meet with  government officials here.    `The Hurriyat Conference has previously refused to accept  anything short of independence for Kashmir, a picturesque state  whose ownership is bitterly contested by arch foes India and  Pakistan.    `On Friday, the Hurriyat Conference leaders held a  closed-door meeting here with Karan Singh, son of the former  Hindu king of Kashmir state who agreed to the Indian union in  1948.    `"We exchanged ideas and shared perceptions" with Karan  Singh, Conference spokesman Maulvi Abbas Ansari said. "Karan  Singh does owe a duty to the people of Kashmir ... as a genuine  and forthright seer in politics."    `Karan Singh told reporters that the visit of the Moslem  leaders to the Indian capital was a positive sign. "It shows  they have realised the importance of negotiations and this  implies violence cannot solve problems."']</p>

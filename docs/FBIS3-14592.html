He made the remark  at the opening of a fund-raising campaign at the Tel Aviv  Museum. Our correspondent Eyal Eisenstein reports:    [Begin recording] [Eisenstein] The stabbing in Petah Tiqva  was nationalistic in nature. It is an inseparable part of the  overall current situation, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said  today. More people will be hurt and murdered, Peres said, if we  do not bring about a basic change in the situation.    [Peres] This is yet another terrible bloody incident, part  of the current situation. I do not believe that the incidents,  the stabbings, the killings, can be stopped without basically  changing the situation. Courage is needed to see things as they  are, to see their roots, and to reach the necessary conclusions.    [Eisenstein] Regarding the impact of last night's incidents  in Jabalyah on the political process, Peres said that the  killing of the six members of the Fatah Hawks will make the  talks very difficult, but they will open today and continue.  Peres added that he is certain the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  soldiers who killed the Gazans had no malicious intentions and  acted responsibly. We are only clever after the fact, the  foreign minister said.    [Peres] Primarily, I have every respect for the soldiers who  serve under impossible conditions. I believe that we should  offer the Army a political solution before we pass judgment on  their military performance. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Australia's treasurer quits unexpectedly: Dawkins' announcement greeted with surprise in political and financial circles Mr John Dawkins, the Australian treasurer, yesterday astonished both the political world and financial markets by saying he was resigning. Mr Dawkins' announcement in the House of Representatives at the close of the year's parliamentary sittings had not been foreshadowed by any immediate controversy. Only hours beforehand, he had been detailing next year's budget process to parliament. The treasurer's position had appeared shaky during the late summer, when the Keating government's budget was stalled for two months in the senate by minor parties who hold the balance of power there. But Mr Dawkins - once one of the closest political associates of Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister - weathered this storm, and recently won support from both the cabinet and the minor parties for a revised budget process. By bringing the budget date forward to May, and seeking to have bills passed by end-June, the government hoped to avoid similar debacles in the future. The 46-year-old treasurer said yesterday he was resigning at a time of his own choosing. 'It's a time which I think. . . is the right time for me. . . to pursue other interests - what, I don't know.' Mr Dawkins added that he had informed Mr Keating of his desire to move to the back benches 'as a step to leaving parliament at some time between now and the next election'. He holds the Fremantle seat in Western Australia. The prime minster's office said the successor would not be announced until next year, and Mr Dawkins would continue as treasurer until then. Mr Keating, addressing parliament shortly after Mr Dawkins' announcement, added: 'I will miss him and I will miss him very much from cabinet.' Mr Dawkins has been in parliament for 20 years and was one of Mr Keating's staunchest supporters during the Labor party leadership battle in 1991. However, the relationship between the two men is thought to have been affected by Mr Dawkins' poor handling of the summer's budget crisis. At the height of those troubles, Mr Dawkins incautiously remarked: 'Whenever it becomes necessary for me to leave Fremantle (where his family lives), get on a plane and come to Canberra, the prospect of political retirement does well in my mind.' This led to a frenzy of resignation gossip, although the possibility was denied at the time. Nevertheless, suspicions that Mr Dawkins lacked the inclination and political adroitness to deal with the difficult senate lingered. It was noted then, for example, that he had bought land in South Australia, possibly with a view to establishing a winery, and that he and his wife were expecting their first child, who was subsequently born in late October. Mr Dawkins, who holds an economics degree from the University of West Australia and was trade minister during the mid-1980s, has been a fervent believer in Australia's need to develop a more export-oriented economy. He has come under fire recently from unions and the Labor party caucus for putting more emphasis on the budget deficit than on social issues such as unemployment. Yesterday, news of his resignation sent the Australian dollar down from about USDollars 0.6745 ahead of the announcement to about USDollars 0.67, although some dealers suggested that this was a knee-jerk reaction, and that the currency could stabilise if investors concluded that the reasons for Mr Dawkins' departure were largely personal. Speculation over Mr Dawkins' replacement began immediately. Front-runners include Mr Ralph Willis, the finance minister who held the treasurer's job briefly under Mr Bob Hawke's administration; Mr George Gear, the assistant treasurer; Mr Bob McMullan, the arts and administrative services minister; and Mr Laurie Brereton, who is industrial relations minister and a close colleague of Mr Keating.</p>

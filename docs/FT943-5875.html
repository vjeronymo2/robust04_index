			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Opportunities in lire tempt borrowers The Eurobond market saw a number of small, mainly retail-driven offerings yesterday in a variety of currencies, continuing the trend of recent days. The Italian lira market saw several offerings. Borrowers are being tempted into lire by profitable arbitrage opportunities caused by high investor demand, syndicate managers said, and investors by historically high coupon levels and the flatness of the yield curve in the three to 10-year area. However some syndicate managers questioned the timing of these deals in the lira market, which they said is nearing saturation point. Nestle Finance France launched a L150bn offering of two-year bonds with a coupon of 11 per cent, which lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation said performed well, despite aggressive pricing. In the dollar sector, Okobank launched a Dollars 150m offering of perpetual bonds callable after five years and yielding 150 basis points over six-month Libor for the first five years, and 300 points over thereafter. Syndicate managers said the deal was well priced and performed well. Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the issue was mainly bought by institutional investors although there was also good retail demand. SNCF, the French national railway, tapped the D-Mark market for the first time in 11 years with a retail-driven DM300m offering of five-year bonds aimed at Swiss and Benelux investors. The National Bank of Hungary came to the Swiss franc market for the first time this year with an issue of SFr150m five-year bonds, increased from SFr100m, offering a coupon of 8 1/4 per cent. The bonds were sold primarily to banks with strong retail distribution in continental Europe, lead manager Merrill Lynch said. Argentina is expected to come to the Eurobond market in the next few days, in a deal lead-managed by Paribas Capital Markets, with an offering of CDollars 100m three-year bonds.</p>

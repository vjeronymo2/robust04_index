Ryabova, Kurchatov </F> Institute Russian Scientific Center, Moscow; UDC 541.141.771.53]    [Abstract] A study examined the effect of sodium tungstate  on the photographic properties of high-resolution photographic  materials for holography and selected nuclear photographic  materials. The possibilities of partially replacing the silver  halide in these emulsions by sodium tungstate was also studied.  It was discovered that when 80 percent of the silver halide in  the photographic material was replaced by sodium tungstate  (i.e., when the material's silver halide content was reduced  from 9 to 1.5 g/m[.sup]2[/]), its photographic properties  (specifically, its light sensitivity) actually improved.  Similarly, type MR nuclear photographic material also became  more sensitive after 60 percent of its silver halide was  replaced by sodium tungstate and was not otherwise adversely  affected by the substitution. The sodium tungstate-containing  photographic materials remained stable after thermostatted aging  at 50C and 65 percent humidity for 3 days. The sodium  tungstate-containing silver halide photographic materials also  manifested a significant increase in optical density when their  temperature was increased at the moment of exposure. This  increase in optical density was observed throughout the entire  light wave interval from 225 to 525 nm. When a light-sensitive  layer containing sodium tungstate was heated to 115C, its  optical density increased in comparison with that recorded at  20C. For radiation at wavelengths of 325, 350, 375, 400,  and 475 nm, the ratio of the two optical densities measured at  115 and 20C (i.e., D[.sup]115[/]/D[.sub]20[/])  amounted to 50, 11, 15.5, 15, and 20, respectively. The amount  of fog in the photographic materials with and without sodium  tungstate was about the same. After protracted storage of 6-12  months or more, however, more fog developed on the sodium  tungstate-containing photographic materials than on the films  without sodium tungstate. It was concluded that sodium tungstate  acts as a catalyst of the silver compounds' decomposition  process. When an antifogging agent was used or when the films  were stored at reduced temperatures, however, the amount of fog  in the sodium tungstate-containing photographic materials  remained about equal to that in the films with no sodium  tungstate.

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subdued in response to falls abroad Wall Street HEAVY LOSSES on overseas markets set the tone for a subdued day's trading on US stock markets yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.40 at 3,337.58, having spent all but the final few minutes of the day a few points below Friday's close. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished up 0.53 at 419.41, while the Amex composite was down 1.72 at 388.41, and the Nasdaq composite 0.60 lower at 573.14. Turnover on the NYSE was very light at 143m shares. Overnight prices in Tokyo fell to their lowest levels for six years, a sell-off which triggered declines in most European markets. Against this background, it was no surprise when US markets opened lower and even another solid rise in bond yields, further pushing down long-term interest rates, failed to lift investors' mood. Trading activity was light, typical of a mid-August week, with many investors away on vacation. Among individual stocks, McDonnell Douglas climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 37 1/2 after the defence and aerospace group unveiled a major restructuring, which will include the consolidation of its six military aerospace companies into two groups, the sale of its helicopter unit and the closing of its Ohio plant. Procter &amp; Gamble fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 after reporting net income of Dollars 339m for the April-to-June quarter, higher than the Dollars 304m reported a year ago but slightly below analysts' estimates. The company's final quarter took full-year profits to Dollars 1.87bn. TJX rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 20 7/8 after the specialty retailer reported second quarter earnings of 26 cents a share, up from 20 cents a share a year earlier. Hewlett-Packard, savaged by selling last week in the wake of disappointing earnings, bounced back yesterday with a gain of Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 60 3/8 . IBM, which also suffered last week, recovered another Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 88 1/4 in active trading. The ADRs of British Airways rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 49 5/8 after analysts predicted first quarter pre-tax profits of Pounds 80-Pounds 90m. Storage Technology plunged Dollars 6 1/8 , or 18 per cent, to Dollars 27 1/8 as investors reacted negatively to the news released late on Friday that the company has delayed the testing and production of its Iceberg data storage system. On the Nasdaq market, Novell rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 in turnover of 1.8m shares on details of a pact in which Microdyne will develop and market network connectivity cards certified through Novell laboratories to be optimised for NetWare local area networks. Canada TORONTO stocks ended mixed in quiet trading. According to preliminary data, the TSE 300 index rose 2.48 points, or .07 per cent, to close at 3,408.78. Declines led advances 269 to 229, volume of 16.7m shares was below Friday's 19.6m, and trading value was CDollars 186.7m against CDollars 242.6m. Eight of the 14 stock groups closed higher. The transportation group posted the day's biggest decline, off 1.92 per cent on index.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Budget likely to introduce 'tax manifesto': Lamont expected to ease the burden on savings and inheritance MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, is expected to balance immediate tax cuts designed to restore consumer confidence and spending in next week's budget with a 'tax manifesto' for the 1990s according to ministers. A Budget package which maps out a long-term strategy of tax reform and offers a clear choice to the electorate was signalled by Mr Lamont's senior colleagues yesterday as the latest opinion polls underlined the scale of the task facing Mr John Major in the coming general election. Measures to ease the tax burden on savings - particularly those built up by the less well-off - and Mr Major's determination to cut the burden of inheritance tax were singled out as likely starting points. But there was also a suggestion that Mr Lamont could signal the eventual abolition of capital gains tax. The comments by ministers - a response to Labour's charge that the government plans to use higher borrowing to 'bribe' the voters with income tax cuts - will fuel speculation that the March 10 Budget will signpost a range of new measures to encourage savings, to reduce inheritance tax and to promote investment. Ministers admit that they have been stung by the force of Labour's onslaught on Budget tax cuts and by the link the opposition has made between lower income tax and higher public borrowing. There is also concern that some on the right of the Conservative party will be dismayed by a projected public sector borrowing requirement next year of substantially more than Pounds 20bn. Mrs Margaret Thatcher, former prime minister, is known to be unhappy with the sharp increase in borrowing, but has made it clear that she intends to do nothing in the campaign which could be interpreted as helping the Labour party. The opposition has been cheered by a Mori survey in yesterday's Sunday Times which was the third opinion poll in a week to show a slight shift towards Labour and an increase in Liberal Democrat support while the two main parties remained broadly neck-and-neck. The same poll showed a drop in Mr John Major's popularity - hailed by Labour as a sign that 'the Teflon is starting to peel off'. Labour has consistently sought to pin the blame for the recession on Mr Major in his roles both as prime minister and as chancellor. The 'satisfaction index' - the difference between those satisfied and dissatisfied with a politician's performance - for the prime minister is now plus 4 per cent, compared with plus 13 per cent in January, but still ahead of Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, whose standing is minus 18 per cent. Overall, Mori showed Labour on 40 per cent, the Tories on 39 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent. In a letter to constituency officers, Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman, warned party workers that 'we have a fight on our hands', but expressed confidence of victory 'if we defend our record, set out our vision and explain how Labour would destroy the economic prosperity on which we all depend'. The Tories will step up that attack today with a return to the theme that a Labour government would mean higher prices, as well as higher taxes and unemployment.</p>

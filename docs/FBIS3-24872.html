			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Huambo correspondent Lourenco Bento] </F>   [Text] At the beginning of January the National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and Luanda government  teams resumed their marathon talks on political issues with a  view to achieving a general accord that will put an end to the  Angolan conflict.    In light of the progress made by the two teams concerning  military issues, notably a cease-fire agreement and the  formation of the future armed forces, the Luanda government  should have announced a unilateral cease-fire as a show of good  faith. Given that UNITA had already announced its unilateral  cease-fire, such a measure would have allowed a general  cease-fire to have been in place throughout Angolan territory,  and the Lusaka peace talks could have continued without cannons  firing away on the battlefield. That did not happen, though.    The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor  Party  [MPLA-PT] has a negotiating team in Lusaka, but inside the  country the Futungo de Belas Palace leadership is determined to  continue its military offensive against UNITA-controlled areas.  It has been receiving massive military aid from Russia, Brazil,  and Spain. It has also been joined by mercenaries of various  nationalities, thereby showing complete disrespect for the peace  efforts being made by UNITA -- which sent a team to Lusaka to  negotiate peace -- by the UN special representative in Angola,  and that portion of the international community that means well,  all of which are interested in a peaceful settlement to the  conflict that has been devastating the country.    The events that have been marking the daily lives of  Angolans  clearly show that, far from wanting peace for Angola, the Luanda  government is rather more interested in a military solution.  That position has been made all the clearer in recent  statements by unelected Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos  Santos, the top Futungo de Belas chieftain, and Joao de Matos,  People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola chief of  General Staff, when he addressed a ceremony where new officers  received their stripes. Joao de Matos noted on that occasion  that those officers would now lead their military units on the  combat fronts.    Taking into account the fact that the Angolan people  anxiously want peace and that the Angolan economy is in chaos --  and showing every tendency to deteriorate even further -- it  would have been expected that the sole combat front should have  been Lusaka. All honest people wanting peace in Angola have  turned their attention to the Lusaka peace talks. Eduardo dos  Santos and his warmongering sidekicks are insisting on shellings  and air bombardments, but such acts can only worsen the people's  already very depressing social and economic conditions.    Jose Eduardo dos Santos continues to show quite clearly that  he is only concerned with staying in power. He did not obtain  the necessary 51 percent of the vote, so he usurped power by  carrying out tribal massacres at the end of October and in the  first days of November 1992. Those events led to war, causing  confusion that has been used by the Futungo de Belas Palace  leadership to enrich themselves. Despite all that, the Angolan  people remain hopeful about the Lusaka peace talks which, they  hope, will provide the correct solutions to the grave problems  facing Angolan society.    Through its concessions, UNITA has been making negotiation  possible in the Zambian capital. Despite many provocations by  the MPLA-PT forces, the Armed Forces for the Liberation of  Angola, FALA, have continued to observe the unilateral  cease-fire declared by UNITA. UNITA has recognized the Bicesse  Accord and the results of the fraudulent September 1992  elections. Furthermore, UNITA has also accepted the UN  resolutions on Angola. Such courageous steps reflect UNITA  leadership's good will and have ensured progress at the Lusaka  peace talks.    The MPLA-PT government had been reluctant and had continued  to stick to its obsolete theories, which reflect its desire to  keep Angola and all its people under its totalitarian and  monolithic regime, but it has been forced to give in. Now,  there is talk that an accord has been reached concerning the  future national police force issue. For a long time, the  Angolan people did not have a police force that defended their  interests, so now they are happy about this important step  forward at the talks.    For the better part of a month, the UNITA negotiating team  defended the creation of a new national police force that will  serve the Angolan people, contrary to what has happened so far,  where the so-called police force is an army pursuing social  instability in the country.    The Angolan people were happy to learn that UNITA will  substantively participate in the future national police force.  No one will be detained without having undergone trial. The  Futungo de Belas leaders got us used to having the police rob,  detain, and kill people without trial. Such a confused  situation's days are numbered. A national police force with a  substantial UNITA presence will be a source of pride to the  Angolan people, and it will serve all citizens. There will be  respect for the law and for public order.    Now that discussions on the national police dossier have  been  wound up, other fundamental political issues are to be viewed,  notably the political and administrative [words indistinct] the  status of opposition political parties, freedom of the press, a  government of national unity that fosters national  reconciliation, the status of UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro  Savimbi, and a redefinition of acting President of the Republic  Jose Eduardo dos Santos' powers. Those are, among others, the  issues that the negotiators must contend with from now on.    May good sense prevail! May Angolans be able to understand  each other for the sake of higher interests! Let us all unite  behind the same ideals! There will be peace, national  reconciliation, and peaceful coexistence because the Angolan  people desire them.    Lusaka is the beacon of hope.</p>

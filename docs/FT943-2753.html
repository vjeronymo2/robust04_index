			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: 44% rise in malt sales helps Macallan-Glenlivet to Pounds 2.6m A surge in sales of Macallan single malt whisky helped Macallan-Glenlivet lift interim pre-tax profits by almost one-fifth from Pounds 2.16m to Pounds 2.58m. In a Scotch market that remains sluggish after the recession, Macallan single malt sales rose 44 per cent overall with the UK and US showing gains of more than 30 per cent. 'This is some kind of realisation of all the work we've done over the years,' said Mr William Phillips, managing director. All of its more than 25 export markets were profitable. Several analysts, surprised by the jump, attributed some of the rise to restocking by Macallan's distributors and the effect of new distribution agreements made in recent years. Sales to drinkers were thought to have risen more slowly. The second-half advance would be more moderate, Mr Phillips added, but the trend was to a 'significantly higher level of growth' than in the past. On turnover of Pounds 7.14m (Pounds 6.49m) for the six months to June 30, operating profits rose 25 per cent from Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 2.34m thanks to increased volume and cost savings. Net interest received slipped from Pounds 279,00 to Pounds 233,000. The interim dividend is increased to 0.41p (0.36p) from earnings per share of 1.57p (1.37p). New fillings, purchases by blenders of Macallan's newly distilled spirits, fell by 30 per cent from a year earlier. The decline, which began several years ago, should bottom out this year, Mr Phillips said. Sales could begin to recover next year but would certainly do so in 1996. Confident of growth, Macallan's has stepped up its whisky stocks and is finishing off the fitting out of a 35m litre warehouse built in 1989.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / NHS cleaners covered by Tupe The contracting-out of National Health Service cleaning work to private companies is covered by the European Union's transfer regulations, which protect the pay and conditions of workers for at least one year, according to a Liverpool industrial tribunal. Following an Employment Appeals Tribunal ruling in another case last year it had been assumed that the Transfer of Undertakings, Protection of Employment (Tupe) regulations would not generally apply to NHS cleaning. But the latest judgment, which concerned contracting out at Walton Hospital to Taylorplan Services, has ruled that it is covered by Tupe.</p>

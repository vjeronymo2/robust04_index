			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Homosexual protection reinstated A judge in the US state of Colorado struck down yesterday a measure that would have banned all state laws to protect homosexuals, Reuter reports from Denver. The measure, which arose from a citizens' initiative and became an amendment to the state constitution in November 1992, set off a national boycott and has cost the state millions of dollars in revenue from conventions. Various groups declined to hold gatherings in Colorado while the amendment was in place. Denver District Court Judge Jeffrey Bayless ruled the measure unconstitutional yesterday. He had earlier blocked implementation of the amendment until his final decision. The measure would have repealed existing ordinances designed to protect homosexuals from discrimination while prohibiting the enactment of similar laws in the state.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Ford to meet union leaders FORD has called meetings with leaders of its UK employees UK tomorrow which may presage a cut of up to 10 per cent in its 97,400-strong European workforce. Ford said it would set out its view of future prospects after reviewing the voluntary redundancy programme which has has already led to the shedding of 3,587 jobs in its British plants this year. The company is understood to be preparing a series of further restructuring measures across Europe. Mr Jimmy Airlie, negotiator for the AEEU engineering and electrical union, said the union feared the worst 'but our position remains that we will not accept compulsory redundancies'. However, a planned union ballot at Ford's plants for industrial action against any compulsory redundancies will probably be postponed until next month while the outcome of tomorrow's meetings is assessed.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EXECUTION SET APRIL 3 FOR HARRIS;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: THE CONVICTED MURDERER'S LAWYERS, CONCEDING THAT THEY ARE "UP AGAINST  THE GUN NOW," ARE STILL PURSUING POSSIBLE APPEALS TO KEEP HIM FROM THE GAS  CHAMBER.  </P> <P> Murderer Robert Alton Harris, convicted of the 1978 killings of two teen-age  San Diego boys, was ordered Monday to die April 3 in the gas chamber at San  Quentin, setting the stage for California's first execution in 23 years.  </P> <P> San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez announced the date at a  four-minute hearing Monday, a procedural formality that had been expected since  last month's rejection by the U.S. Supreme Court of a broad challenge to  Harris' death sentence.  </P> <P> The April 3 date actually is Harris' fourth scheduled execution date, but his  first in eight years, San Diego prosecutors said. This time around, after more  than 10 years of appeals, even Harris' San Diego lawyers conceded Monday that  the end may be near.  </P> <P> "We're really up against the gun now," attorney Charles M. Sevilla said after  the hearing.  </P> <P> Sevilla said he and Charles M. McCabe, Harris' other lawyer, will file a  request "fairly soon" with the California Supreme Court to put off the  execution while it considers a new appeal the attorneys filed with the court  Jan. 5.  </P> <P> In that appeal, Harris contends, in part, that it would be cruel and unusual  punishment to kill him because he has changed for the better in prison. Even if  the state Supreme Court agrees to hear the new appeal, Harris must still  persuade the panel to put off the execution now that the date has been set.  </P> <P> "We hope the court is not losing patience with us," McCabe said. "We are not  being dilatory. We are not simply trying to delay  </P> <P> the inevitable. There are strong constitutional issues that need to be  resolved."  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that Harris, whose appeals have been turned down four times  by the U.S. Supreme Court and whose death sentence was affirmed in 1981 by the  California Supreme Court, long ago exhausted any conceivable legal grounds for  appeal.  </P> <P> But Louis R. Hanoian, a deputy attorney general handling the Harris case, said  it is possible that Harris' lawyers could orchestrate further delay. If the  state Supreme Court rejects Harris' new appeal, defense lawyers are virtually  certain to turn to the federal courts for mercy, Hanoian said.  </P> <P> "I'd like to think that we're near the end of the road, but as long as there  are courts willing to listen to arguments, I can't judge whether we're near the  end of that road," Hanoian said.  </P> <P> Harris, 37, said in an interview last week with a San Diego radio station that  his "spirits are up" but he tries not to think about San Quentin's gas chamber.  Still, he said, "If it does come to me dying, then I'll just have to die."  </P> <P> Harris was arrested July 5, 1978, by Steve Baker, a San Diego police officer  who did not know at the time that Harris' victims were Baker's son, Michael,  and Michael's friend, John Mayeski.  </P> <P> The 16-year-old boys had been eating hamburgers in the parking lot of a Jack in  the Box in San Diego's Mira Mesa neighborhood when Harris kidnaped them at  gunpoint so that he could steal their car and use it in a bank robbery.  </P> <P> He ordered them to drive to a canyon near Miramar Reservoir, where he killed  them. Later, he finished their half-eaten hamburgers.  </P> <P> A San Diego Superior Court jury convicted Harris of murder in January, 1979. He  was sentenced to death by San Diego Superior Court Judge Eli Levenson in March,  1979.  </P> <P> During the nearly 11 years he has been on Death Row, Harris' case has  progressed farther through the court system than that of any of California's  272 other condemned prisoners. Sevilla said Monday that he recognizes that "a  lot rides on this case."  </P> <P> If Harris actually is put to death, Sevilla said, an "emotional barrier will be  broken which will psychologically open the doors for many more (executions) to  come."  </P> <P> Prosecutors, analyzing every detail connected to Harris' execution date, said  the choice of April 3 was a good one. It is near the end of the 60-day time  frame the law gave the judge in which to pick a date, meaning there could be no  argument that Harris did not have every opportunity to protest, Hanoian said.  </P> <P> In addition, April 3, the 57th day and a Tuesday, is a better option than  Friday, April 6, the 60th day, because bringing San Quentin "back to normalcy"  after Harris' execution would be easier during the week with a full complement  of guards, rather than on a partly staffed weekend, Hanoian said.  </P> <P> Executions at San Quentin traditionally have been held on either Tuesday or  Friday.  </P></p>

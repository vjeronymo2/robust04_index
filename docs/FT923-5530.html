			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Lloyd's council wins clear vote of confidence MEMBERS of Lloyd's of London have given a decisive vote of confidence in the council, the insurance market's governing body, and support for wide-ranging reforms. Results of a ballot announced yesterday show that four out of five Names - the individuals whose wealth provides the market's capital - back the council's commitment to improve the market's management and regulation. The vote will help Lloyd's as it seeks to persuade Names to remain members after a period of controversy which has severely undermined its credibility. The ballot was held following an extraordinary general meeting last month, called by dissident loss-making Names. These Names, largely external members who do not work in the market, have suffered disproportionately from its recent heavy losses, which totalled Pounds 2.06bn in 1989, the last year for which figures are available. Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, said: 'I'm not going to make a song and dance about it but this is a resounding vote of confidence in the council.' Out of the market's 32,628 Names, 23,398 took part in the ballot, with 18,508 voting in favour of a resolution backing the council. Four other motions tabled by opponents of the council were rejected, although by lesser margins. But Mr Richard Astor, a legal adviser to the dissident Names, said the group was not disheartened by the result and vowed to continue his campaign for more radical reform and a break with the present management. Without the votes of some 6,000 working Names - who hold jobs with Lloyd's agencies and brokers - the council would have lost at least one of the motions, Mr Astor claimed. He said that his group would seek a further egm next month. However, the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents over 9,000 Names, welcomed the vote which it described as 'the end of a chapter. The majority of Names want the market's business to go on.' Meanwhile, in a separate development Chatset, the independent company which analyses Lloyd's business, says it expects the market to post losses of Pounds 1.5bn in 1990 when results are reported next year. This compares with its earlier forecast of Pounds 1.2bn losses.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jose Otero] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Mulino requested yesterday the  support of countries in the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) for Panama  to be given the seat of the next NAM heads of state summit in  1999, to "show to the world the country that is to manage the  Canal in the next century."    Mulino made this request during his main speech before the  11th NAM Foreign Relations Ministers meeting currently being  held in Cairo, Egypt.    "I hope my successors at the foreign ministry will support  and honor Panama's request to be the seat of the NAM heads of  state summit in 1999," Mulino emphasized.    The foreign minister added in his speech that, if this  request is granted, Panama will secure its most important  commitment to the world.    Mulino called on all NAM member countries to prepare and  back  the initiative unanimously as a homage to the Panamanian people.    "We advance, without having any time to loose or any margin  for errors, toward the historic commitment of receiving the  Panama Canal on 31 December 1999," Mulino added.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEUTERING PETS  </P> <P> Like death and taxes, it's a certainty! Only a few more months and our Orange  County Animal Shelter will be inundated with unwanted puppies and kittens --  sweet, tiny furry creatures whose only crime was being born.  </P> <P> As one who used to work at the shelter, I still carry the sorrowful memory of  looking out the upstairs windows to see the throngs of pet owners waiting in  line for the gates to open -- waiting for the county to take on the  responsibility of their "throwaways."  </P> <P> The purpose of this letter is to remind citizens that now is the time to have  their pets spayed and neutered. Most folks aren't intentionally cruel or  thoughtless -- they just never "get around to it." The "it" in this instance is  such a simple solution: no food or water for the pet after midnight; a morning  drop-off at the vet; an evening pickup; a quiet night at home and voila!, a  happy, healthy pet and the knowledge that you have been a responsible pet owner  who will never, never have to think about all the little babies who would  otherwise have to be put to sleep. . . . No! Let's use the correct terminology  -- murdered.  </P> <P> Cost can no longer be an excuse when many animal organizations are there to  help, financially and otherwise, the Animal Assistance League for one.  Referrals to low-cost vets, and even half-price certificates, are available. No  transportation? There are volunteers in this county who will work with you on  this.  </P> <P> No, good people, there are no acceptable "excuses." The time is now! Please  make your phone calls. Volunteers are waiting to help.  </P> <P> PEG RICHIE  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

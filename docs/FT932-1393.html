			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / World Trade News: A restructuring in danger of being for nought - The Slovak steel industry up against EC barriers / Trade Across Europe THE official of the East Slovakia Iron and Steel works (VSZ) at Kosice was pleased: 'If you know anyone who wants to buy a complete slabbing mill in good condition, let us know, because from next year we won't need ours any more.' During the past three years, VSZ has invested more than Sk6bn (Pounds 143m) to modernise production which by the end of 1994 will be fully based on continuous casting. Restructuring has made the plant the most modern in eastern Europe. Some western consultants believe it is one of the most efficient in Europe. However, quotas and restrictions on imports into the European Community threaten to undo the achievements of three years of restructuring. Decisions made 900 miles away in Brussels are causing problems for the company which must pay back money borrowed for its modernisation and which will need to borrow yet more - from foreign banks - to complete its restructuring programme after its privatisation last year. Managers say it is ironic that restructuring the plant was done partly to meet western concerns about over-production. 'When we signed the (EC) association agreement we guaranteed we would reduce (raw steel) production, and introduce new technology to improve efficiency and quality, and raise environmental protection,' says Mr Milan Uhliar, commercial director. Raw steel production has dropped from 4.4m tonnes three years ago to 3.6m. The workforce has been reduced with most cuts taking place in the steel division which employs 11,000 compared with 15,000 in 1991. Restructuring was done with the help of western consultants, contractors and equipment. 'It's been good business for western companies,' says Mr Stefan Link, head of the chairman's office. But last year the company had to pull out of several hard-won contracts because of EC restrictions. 'We had contracts, production was planned, but then we got notice in August we would have to cut back to meet (EC import) limits. We had to cancel the contracts, and of course it hurt,' says Mr Adam Gasko, general manager of VSZ Inziniering, the engineering arm of the VSZ group. The fear in Kosice is that the Community will give in to growing political demands for protection. The company says the collapse of traditional markets in the former Comecon trade bloc, and a sharp decline of 20-30 per cent in domestic consumption caused by recession and reduced demand from the weapons industry - once a big customer - have left it with no alternative other than to sell in the west. Managers hope EC restrictions will be eased, but they are not optimistic. Yet freer access to European markets is important for the company as well as for the regional and national economy - making it a test of the Community's stated commitment to encourage the development of market economies and democracy in the former communist states. VSZ accounts for more than 20 per cent of Slovakia's hard currency earnings; it has 29,000 employees of which 24,000 work in Kosice where it provides directly and indirectly a living for a large proportion of the regional capital's 250,000 inhabitants. The problem is that western Europe is in recession, which has encouraged moves to protect domestic industries and jobs against non-EC producers. Already, the former Czechoslovakia which split into separate Czech and Slovak republics on January 1 this year, has faced tough EC import restrictions. Yet in volume terms, Czech and Slovak steel imports into the Community represent only a small proportion of EC imports. 'What Slovakia sells (to the EC) represents less than 1 per cent of the EC's total consumption of flat (steel) products,' says Mr Uhliar. EC quotas for this year will allow Czech and Slovak imports into the Community to rise by about 36 per cent compared with 1991, but this is a brutal cut on 1992 imports. Czech and Slovak imports of steel products into the EC were 434,000 tonnes in 1991, rising to 798,000 tonnes in 1992. This year's quota is 589,000 tonnes - a 26 per cent cut on 1992, though imports will be allowed to grow in 1994, to 655,000 tonnes, and 1995, to 745,000 tonnes. Last year, about 75 per cent of VSZ's production of flat steel products was exported, nearly a third to the EC. German, French and Italian companies complain they face unfair competition from low costs and subsidised east European producers, but that accusation only brings a smile of derision from Mr Uhliar. 'The position is exactly the reverse. Unlike in Germany where the government gives money to (steel) companies, we don't receive anything. If the state subsidised us as it is claimed, we wouldn't have any financial problems.'</p>

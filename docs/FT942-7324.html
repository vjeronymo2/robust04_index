			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Lamont urges Tories to move to the right Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, yesterday warned the Tory party it must move to the right to meet the electoral threat from a Labour party which may soon be led by Mr Tony Blair. In a speech which contained a number of coded attacks on Mr John Major's leadership and undisguised compliments for Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Lamont called for a new round of cuts in spending on the welfare state. He also warned that further reduction in interest rates could jeopardise the hard-won gains on inflation of the past few years. In one of a number of thinly-veiled swipes at Mr Kenneth Clarke, his successor at the Treasury, he suggested the next move in interest rates should be up rather than down: 'The level of interest rates appropriate to ease the economy out of recession is clearly not appropriate when all the indications are that the economy is growing quite rapidly.' Mr Lamont insisted that the government's electoral prospects could best be advanced by offering the prospect of tax cuts and a return to the radicalism of the Thatcherite 1980s rather than by competing with Labour for the centre ground. Mr Lamont rejected a recent suggestion by Mr Clarke that the welfare state should be strengthened, and criticised the cabinet's hesitancy over the privatisation of the post office. He stressed that reducing the burden of taxation would require more savings in public sector expenditure.</p>

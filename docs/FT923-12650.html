			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / German Interest Rate Rise: Germany faces investment fall and slower growth THE Bundesbank's action will expose the German economy to the risk of falling investment, slower recovery and increased long-term interest rates, German bankers, industrialists and economists warned yesterday. However, the Bonn government, which routinely supports Bundesbank decisions and is careful to show respect for its independence, gave few clues to its real feelings. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said he expected the discount rate rise would 'help bring monetary growth nearer to the target range without burdening economic development in east and west Germany'. Others were more outspoken. Mr Klaus Friedrich, soon to take over as chief economist at the Dresdner Bank, said the decision was 'brave but wrong'. He took issue with the anti-inflationary arguments of Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president. All experts agreed inflation was heading down in any case, he said, and there was no need for the extra downward pressure which would come from yesterday's interest rate increase. Mr Willi Leibfritz, chief economic analyst at the respected Ifo economics institute in Munich, said he thought the central bank's move might have been less dramatic had economic growth not been so strong in the first quarter. He accepted the bank's top priority had to be control of monetary growth. However, the move represented a risk to recovery. Investment in construction and plant could be hit, demand would be depressed, profits be reduced and the period of economic weakness could be prolonged, Mr Leibfritz suggested. 'It is certainly very difficult to find the balance between fighting inflation and fighting economic down-swing. 'After last December's discount rate increase, long-term interest rates fell, and it is possible the Bundesbank expects a similar effect this time. But I rather expect long-term rates could increase a little or at least not be reduced,' he added. The BDI federation of German industries said it doubted that the rates increase would damp monetary growth quickly. 'The measures need time to work,' it said. Meanwhile, the risks to Germany's performance should not be under-estimated. Economic reconstruction in the east relied on heavy investments. The ZDH association, representing small businesses, said its members, with limited if any access to capital markets, would be hit hard by inevitable increases in overdraft charges and suffer liquidity problems. Despite the doubts, all branches of industry accepted that the bank had to act. The BDI said that while there was no ideal solution, 'the considerable over-stepping of money supply targets demands a clear stability signal. 'Only tight money can guarantee a stable currency'. The following is the text of the statement issued by the Bundesbank yesterday (translation by Reuters): The Central Council of the Bundesbank, at its meeting today in the presence of Economics Minister Jurgen W Mollermann, conducted a review of the 1992 money supply target and the current situation in monetary policy. It made the following decisions: The German Bundesbank maintains the money supply goal established in Decemeber last year, which envisages an increase in M3 money supply of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent from fourth quarter 1991 to fourth quarter 1992. The assumptions which were the basis of the money supply goal at that time are not essentially different today. The discount rate of the German Bundesbank will be raised with effect from July 17 from eight per cent to 8.75 per cent. With this measure, the Bundesbank aims to stem price pressures, monetary growth and excessive growth in credit volume and also to strengthen confidence in maintaining the stability of the mark in the currently difficult conditions in united Germany.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- GERMAN INTEREST RATES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1931: Creditanstalt 1933: Hitler takes power 1939-45: Second World War 1948: Birth of the D-Mark 1949: Federal Republic established 1958: D-Mark becomes convertible 1961: First D-Mark revaluation 1966: Chancellor Ludwig Erhard forced out by high interest rates 1969: Second D-Mark revaluation 1973: Bretton Woods system collapses 1979: European Monetary system set up 1982: Chancellor Helmut Schmidt quits after Bundesbank tightening       causes recession 1990: German reunification 1991: Maastricht treaty agreed  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / A verdict but no conviction: A review of the English criminal justice system is unlikely to fulfil expectations In three weeks, the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice will deliver its verdict on the health of the English criminal justice system. Set up two years ago after a series of miscarriages of justice, the commission, chaired by Lord Runciman, was charged by the government with carrying out the most far-reaching review for more than 100 years. The legal establishment hopes not only for a report that could help restore public confidence, but for a blueprint for the next century. 'The judiciary has the highest expectations,' according to Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice. But doubts have surfaced about what the report will achieve. Many lawyers believe that, by tackling everything from police investigations to the problems of long fraud trials, the commission will not have had enough time to examine the issues - some far from clear cut - in depth. Lord Williams of Mostyn, QC, last year's bar chairman and Labour's legal affairs spokesman in the House of Lords, says it is a 'watershed'. But he has doubts about what it can accomplish: 'I hope to goodness they've had enough time.' The political impetus for change has been the need to restore confidence in English justice. But the government's hands will be tied both by public spending contraints and competing political priorities. The best hope for concrete proposals is on the question of miscarriages of justice. Studying the events arising out of the IRA's 1974 mainland bombing campaign should have enabled the commission to identify several factors that contributed to the wrongful convictions of the so-called Guildford Four, Maguire Seven and Birmingham Six. The commission is likely to recommend the creation of an independent tribunal to take the investigation of suspect cases out of the hands of the Home Office. It is also expected to recommend the establishment of an independent forensic science service, to give the defence access to forensic facilities enjoyed only by the prosecution at the moment. Such firm recommendations are, however, likely to be the exception rather than the rule. Much of the evidence received by the commission has been conflicting. Disputed confessions, for example, are central to most alleged miscarriages of justice. A change in the law, to prevent a defendant from being convicted on a confession unless it is made in the presence of an independent third party or supported by other evidence, would seem an obvious recommendation. Yet this has proved a controversial area. The commission found that, in nine out of 10 cases in which confessions were central to a case, there was corroborative evidence. In the remainder, the police could have produced it if needed, but had chosen not to in order to save time and money. This, say some, shows that a requirement to produce corroborative evidence in all cases is an unnecessary expense; others say that, if corroborative evidence is available in most cases, the police should be required to produce it. While high-profile issues such as ways of preventing miscarriages of justice are expected to lead to firm recommendations, the bulk of the report is likely to concentrate on cutting costs and increasing efficiency. It will also have to tackle the delicate question of the balance between the powers and rights of prosecution and defence. Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, believes the best way to cut costs is to reduce the number of cases that go to the Crown Court for jury trial. She has urged the commission to recommend the abolition of the defendant's right to choose jury trial for offences that can be tried either by magistrates or in the Crown Court. Of the 120,000 cases committed by magistrates to the Crown Court each year, about 35,000 end up there because the defendants have elected jury trial. The average daily cost of a Crown Court trial in 1992-93 was Pounds 6,850. The costs of a trial in a magistrate's court is estimated at less than half that figure. However, the DPP's proposal is unlikely to find favour with the commission, mainly because the right to be tried by one's peers is strongly supported by the judiciary. Lord Taylor calls it 'an inalienable right going back to Magna Carta'. Mrs Mills can expect more support for her call for a formal system of plea bargaining, where an accused can secure a lighter sentence in return for a guilty plea. At the moment, guilty pleas do generally lead to reductions in sentences, but the process is informal and arbitrary. The prosecuting authorities, judges and the bar want an open system, under which defendants are guaranteed a sentence discount for a guilty plea secured at the earliest opportunity. The DPP sees plea bargaining as the best means of tackling the waste caused by 'cracked trials' - trials that are aborted (and move immediately to sentencing) when the defendant changes his or her plea to guilty at the last minute. In such cases, all parties will already have prepared for a full trial. Some 70 per cent of defendants committed by magistrates to stand trial on a not-guilty plea change their plea to guilty at the Crown Court. About a third of them enter a guilty plea on the day of the trial or just before, causing a cracked trial. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, leads the government's support for formalised plea bargaining. Mr George Staple, director of the Serious Fraud Office, sees it as the solution to problems of long and complex fraud trials. 'By avoiding the contested trial, with all that it implies in terms of expense and time and manpower, a plea of guilty is the single most effective means of shortening the process,' he says. But Lord Roskill, the former law lord who chaired the 1986 Fraud Trials inquiry, is opposed to formalised plea bargaining: 'The real objection is that it enables people to buy themselves off.' He is also concerned that plea bargaining may induce the innocent to plead guilty or feel there is pressure on them to do so. The result could be to encourage miscarriages of justice. This concern is shared by Justice, the law reform pressure group. A further difficult question for the commission is how to correct the perceived imbalance between prosecution and defence: protecting the rights of the defendant while ensuring that the prosecuting authorities have the armoury to bring the guilty to justice. Many judges, including the Lord Chief Justice, believe the odds are weighted too heavily in the defendant's favour. Few defence lawyers agree, although the opinion of the judiciary may carry more weight with the commission. Some inroads are likely into the defendant's right to silence: the right not to say anything in his or her defence, either to the police or in court. The central issues are whether the court should be able to draw inferences from an accused's failure to explain alleged criminal conduct before trial, and whether the so-called 'ambush defence' - where an accused remains silent throughout an investigation but offers an explanation at trial, taking the prosecution by surprise - should be outlawed. The commission's research found that silence may have hampered the conviction of the guilty in only 2 or 3 per cent of cases. Nevertheless, the number of people who argue that the innocent have nothing to hide by giving an explanation is growing. The commission will probably recommend that the defence be required to disclose its case early in the pre-trial proceedings. Controversy over this and other issues, coupled with the government's apparent reluctance to see radical reform of the system now, mean the commission will not produce the hoped-for blueprint. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the former home secretary, has indicated the government intends to treat the report as a consultation exercise. If it accepts the commission's ideas, further detailed study of the practical implications is likely before any legislation. With the recent climbdown over a means-related fines system (withdrawn in May after only seven months) fresh in the memory, the government will not be rushed into action. Two years ago radical change seemed imperative. Now any reform looks likely to be at the margin.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has said that the  PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terror organization is acting  on behalf of Greece.    At Istanbul Ataturk Airport Mentese was replying to  reporters' question on recent explosions in Istanbul.    [Begin recording] [Mentese] They are trying to operate in  the  large cities and tourist sites. PKK is also acting on behalf of  Greece. We, however, will continue to take every possible  measure. We will be vigilant. As you can see I discussed these  issues with the governor and security director of Istanbul.    [Unidentified reporter] What kind of measures are being  taken? There have been frequent bombing incidents.    [Mentese] These are difficult measures. As you can see  anyone can come and place a small package. It is difficult to  prevent such incidents. Such incidents occur in London, New  York, and other U.S. cities. We want such incidents to never  happen in Turkey. The PKK leader, however, has given directions  for bombing incidents in Istanbul. Measures are being taken,  you should not be worried or concerned. [end recording]</p>

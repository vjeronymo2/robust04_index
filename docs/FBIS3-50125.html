			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During today's news conference of the Socialist  Party of Labor [PSM], Deputy Chairman Tudor Mohora presented the  stance of his party regarding the recent negotiations between  the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and the PUNR  [National Romanian Unity Party] intended to set up a coalition  government and the talks among the parties that support the  current government, which concluded on Friday [21 January]  evening.    The PSM believes that the negotiations between the PUNR and  the PDSR should be continued and concluded. Regardless of their  outcome, those negotiations have had a beneficial effect so far  in the sense that they have highlighted the need to clarify  relations among the ruling party and the parties that support  the government, Mohora emphasized.    As far as the PSM is concerned, that party is not interested  primarily in who the new members of the government will be, but  rather in the way the new executive will govern. In that sense,  the PSM has said that an agreement should be concluded in  writing among all the parties supporting the new government.  The document should establish the way and the means by which  they will support the act of governing. The PSM has also  requested that an anticrisis program should be urgently  elaborated.    During the talks that concluded last Friday they also  proposed the establishment of a political pact that should be  open for all parties, regardless of whether they are represented  in parliament or not, which should comprise a number of  political ideas that are acceptable for all, without, however,  being connected to the act of government.    Mohora also mentioned the fact that, during the talks last  Friday, the idea emerged to set up an alliance of the parties  that support the government and they discussed the possibility  of establishing a multi-color government in the long run.    In the conclusion of the news conference Mohora announced  that PSM Chairman Ilie Verdet is currently in Paris, where he is  attending the proceedings of the French Communist Party  congress. During their stay in France the PSM leaders intend to  contact left-wing political groupings from other countries, our  correspondent Anca Ionescu reports.</p>

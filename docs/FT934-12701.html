			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Cragnotti inquiry Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the Rome businessman closely linked to the Ferruzzi family, has been advised he is under investigation for alleged falsification of financial information, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The move coincided with police raids on Mr Cragnotti's offices in Milan and Rome and the removal of documents for inspection by Ravenna magistrates. The latter, along with Milan magistrates, are conducting twin investigations into the affairs of the collapsed Ferruzzi empire, Italy's second largest private group. Mr Cragnotti, chairman of the Lazio football team, currently runs his own agri-business and foodstuffs trading company.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The taoiseach [prime minister], Mr.  Reynolds, has said following the clarification of the Downing  Street Declaration he believed we're now getting closer to the  day when we will have a complete cessation of violence.    On the question of the involvement of loyalist  paramilitaries  in the talks process, Mr. Reynolds said this was a matter for  the Unionist population, but if there was a cessation of  violence he wanted to see everyone around the table. He said it  must be an evenhanded approach. The taoiseach was speaking in  County Mayo.    [Correspondent] The taoiseach is in Mayo campaigning in the  by-election and the European election. A short time ago he said  he welcomed the comments of Unionist leader Jim Molyneaux about  loyalist involvement in the peace process. If there is a  cessation of violence then who represents the Unionists will be  a matter for them, but he said he favored everyone being at the  table. This must be an evenhanded equal approach if there is a  cessation of violence.    On the Sinn Fein response to the clarifications by the  British government, the taoiseach said he accepted that they  needed more time, but he said there is no time left to stop the  killing. It must happen now.    Overall Mr. Reynolds said, the peace process was now back on  the rails and he believed we were edging closer to the day when  we will have a complete cessation of violence.</p>

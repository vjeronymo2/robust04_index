			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tunstall forecasts 21% growth to Pounds 6.4m AN INCREASE of 21 per cent in pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.4m and a 1p lift in the dividend for the year ended September 30 1993 was yesterday forecast by Mr Michael Dawson, chairman of Tunstall Group, the Yorkshire-based supplier of emergency and security systems, as it announced big expansion moves. The shares closed 20p higher at 560p. The forecasts corresponded with the announcement of the formation of Mion Electronics, a wholly owned subsidiary, to take over the existing contract design and manufacturing business. Mr Dawson said the expansion of this division follows a year of significant growth and a continuing strong order book by Tunstall Electronics. Mion intends to build a 6,600 sq m factory near Barnsley, South Yorkshire. Total capital expenditure over the next four years on land, buildings and new equipment would be about Pounds 11m with a further Pounds 1.5m required for working capital. It was anticipated that over 400 jobs would be created within two years. The funding would be financed by a regional assistance grant of Pounds 2.5m from the Department of Trade and Industry and, subject to contract, by a five-year loan of Pounds 5m from the European Coal and Steel Community. Mr Dawson said the contract manufacturing activity had the potential 'to produce significant profit growth' for the group. Tunstall's estimated 1992-93 results for contract manufacture shows turnover of Pounds 3.6m (1991-92 actual Pounds 400,000), percentage gross margins of 30 (23) and profits before interest of Pounds 500,000 (nil). Pre-tax profits would total Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 5.3m), sales Pounds 44.5m (Pounds 40.5m) and earnings per share 26.4p (21.6p). Cash balances were expected to stand at Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 4.3m). The directors would propose a final dividend of 4.5p (3.75p) making a total of 7p (6p).</p>

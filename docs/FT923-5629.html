			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Lira trades below ERM floor THE ITALIAN lira fell below its permitted limit against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, as the German currency moved to the top of the ERM grid for the first time since October 1989, writes James Blitz. Several factors pushed the lira below its lower band limit of L765.40 to the D-Mark yesterday. Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank council, said that current economic data did not justify a cut in leading German interest rates. An opinion poll on the likely outcome of France's referendum on Maastricht next month showed a majority 'No' vote is in prospect, underlining fears of a realignment. The lira closed in London at L765.70, below its floor, despite intervention from the German, Italian and Belgian central banks. According to Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in London, the Italian currency was sold by major corporate investors inside Italy as well as the usual punters. 'This has been a serious sell-off,' he said, 'which will not easily be turned around.' The lira's problems are at the heart of what are now the biggest strains inside the ERM since the realignment of 1987. In normal times, the D-Mark, which is the hardest currency in Europe, should be at the centre of the grid so that the monetary policies and exchange rates of other countries can be adjusted around it. Yesterday, it was at the top of the grid, showing the strongest positive divergence of any currency against its central ecu rate. That means it is straining against all currencies, pushing three of them - the lira, sterling and the French franc - towards their bilateral ERM floors against the D-Mark. Sterling managed to hold on yesterday, closing down a 1/4 pfennig at DM2.7875. But the Dutch central bank, which traditionally shadows the D-Mark closely, raised its special advances rate to 9.70 per cent from 9.60 per cent to keep in line with developments. Yesterday, EC governments ruled out an EMS realignment in a statement by the EC's Monetary Committee, firming the Italian currency in late American trading. A joint statement like this suggests that there will be co-ordinated EC intervention to support currencies. But will mutual intervention work ? With the D-Mark at the top of the grid, the onus is on the Bundesbank to push D-Marks into the financial system, upsetting its M3 Monetary supply targets. The burden is all the greater since Italy said yesterday that its foreign exchange reserves had dropped by a third in the month to June.</p>

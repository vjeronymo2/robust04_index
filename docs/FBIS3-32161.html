Also, in the north, groups of Indians entered the towns of  Cayambe, Otavalo, Ibarra, San Gabriel, Huacas, and Cristobal  Colon and blocked the Pan-American Highway, thus preventing the  movement of vehicles.    As a result of the demonstrations in Quito, approximately 50  people are under arrest and, at the orders of the police  commissioner who according to the law must punish them for  breaking the law, will be fined between 60 and 120 sucres and  serve four days in jail.    Approximately six aerial incursions took place between 1 and  2 February over Quito, especially over places where students  were protesting. The aircraft dropped tear gas bombs to  disperse the demonstrations.</p>

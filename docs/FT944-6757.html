			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Can the Treasury bond market hang on to last week's gains in the face of evidence that the US economy continues to grow strongly? The first test comes later this week, with the National Association of Purchasing Management index on Thursday and November employment figures on Friday. An unexpectedly high NAPM reading a month ago set the stage for the Federal Reserve's last interest rate rise. This month, the index is likely to match or even exceed the 59.7 it hit then. The real news, though, may not be in the headline number but in the prices paid component of the index, where future inflation may lurk (this hit 79.9 in October and is expected to climb further). Non-farm payroll growth, meanwhile, is generally expected to have jumped again after October's brief lull, with job gains of 250,000 or more in November. These figures will be preceded on Wednesday by the third-quarter GDP report: at anything from 3 to 3.4 per cent, the growth rate may have moderated from the second quarter but is still above the Fed's target rate. Of course, the bond market may shrug off such news, confirming a newly-discovered confidence in the Fed's determination to stamp on inflation. But that would represent a real change of heart from the rest of this year.</p>

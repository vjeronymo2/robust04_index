			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: General Mills hit by price cutting General Mills, the US food manufacturer that escalated competition in the US breakfast cereal market by slashing its prices from the beginning of May, yesterday reported a 6 per cent fall in underlying earnings per share in its fourth quarter ending May 29. The company put the blame squarely on the price cuts, saying they had reduced the quarter's earnings by 10 cents a share. However, it said this was a short-term effect resulting from the need to compensate retailers for the reduction in shelf prices of existing stocks. Initial response from consumers and grocery customers to the cuts had been positive, General Mills said, and earnings per share in the current year were expected to show good progress. The shares put on Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 55 1/4 . Recent practice in the US cereals market has been to escalate prices and then discount them back by offering consumers coupons, half-price deals and other promotions. In April, General Mills announced it was departing from this practice by cutting promotional spending by Dollars 175m a year and passing some of the savings on to consumers through price cuts averaging 11 per cent. Yesterday it said unit volume of its Big G cereals business was up 9 per cent in the fourth quarter. Group sales were ahead from Dollars 2.01bn to Dollars 2.14bn and net income rose from Dollars 67.5m to Dollars 105.5m. Excluding unusual items in the previous year's fourth quarter, however, earnings per share fell from 71 cents to 67 cents. General Mills said the year as a whole had been disappointing because of escalating promotional activity in the US cereals market. Sales rose from Dollars 8.13bn to Dollars 8.52bn and net income from Dollars 506.1m to Dollars 556.8m. Excluding unusual items, earnings per share edged up from Dollars 3.45 to Dollars 3.50.</p>

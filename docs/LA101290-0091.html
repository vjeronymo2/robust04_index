			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PHYSICIANS GROUP BUYS BURBANK HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Doctors at Burbank Community Hospital on Wednesday completed an agreement to  purchase the ailing facility from the nonprofit foundation that owns it as part  of a financial strategy the doctors hope will boost falling revenue.  </P> <P> And when the hospital changes hands, so will its name.  </P> <P> Doctors said the new name will be Thompson Memorial Medical Center, in honor of  the hospital's founder, Elmer H. Thompson.  </P> <P> The transaction was approved in principle in August, hospital Administrator  William Daniel said. Under the terms of the agreement, Gateway Healthcare of  Burbank Inc., a partnership of doctors, will take control Dec. 1 from the  nonprofit Burbank Community Hospital Foundation.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the group needs to raise $600,000 to $700,000 as operating  capital, Daniel said. The purchase price of the hospital's operations and  equipment, about $2 million, will be paid over 10 years, Daniel said, and the  structure will be leased from the foundation.  </P> <P> Daniel said the physicians group will attempt to enter into limited  partnerships with investors to raise the funds.  </P> <P> Dr. Roberto Beaton, chairman of the physicians group, said in a prepared  statement that the hospital will expand its outpatient services.  </P></p>

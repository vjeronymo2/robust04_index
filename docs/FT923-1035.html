			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: US insurer shares fall on cut in pay-out SHARES in Continental Corporation, the New York-based insurance group, plunged nearly 19 per cent to Dollars 24 1/2 , down Dollars 5 5/8 , yesterday after the company cut its dividend and announced Dollars 320m of pre-tax charges, partly because of recent hurricane losses. Continental, the 11th-largest US insurer in terms of property/casualty premium volume, estimated its pre-tax loss from Hurricane Iniki would total around Dollars 55m after reinsurance. It previously announced a Dollars 55m loss from Andrew. Mr John Mascotte, chairman, said the group would protect its capital position by reducing its exposure to future catastrophe losses and getting out of both the reinsurance business and local business in overseas markets. It expected to take a third-quarter pre-tax charge of Dollars 120m from this withdrawal and would also take a Dollars 200m charge from hurricane losses and the cost of restoring its catastrophe reinsurance protection. It aimed to lock in more than Dollars 100m of realised capital gains during the quarter and would be cutting its quarterly dividend from 65 cents to 25 cents.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN DEFENSE OF CABO  </P> <P> As frequent visitors to Cabo San Lucas, our experience has been totally  different from criticism that appeared in your Letters section recently.  </P> <P> Prices are not sky high in most places. We were there in May and had many  delicious meals for under $10. Cabo is still a place of great natural beauty  with a superior climate and a picturesque bay, crystal-clear water and clean,  uncrowded beaches. It's so inviting and romantic that we can't wait for our  next trip.  </P> <P> HARLEY and KAY PATTISON  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

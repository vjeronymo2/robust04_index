			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Round the World Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. Arnie writes: Although Lucy prefers Margaritas and soul to gluhwein and yodelling, Austria feels like home after 2 1/2 months in the US. Apart from some wintry weather in Soll and Westendorf, where we skied in a couple of blizzards, the skiing has been blissfully warm and the scenery superb.  The hills and mountains of the Tyrol are alive with the sounds and smells of spring. Skiing in low resorts such as Kolsass, Weer and Igls is all but over, but the snow is still good in Obergurgl, Mayrhofen and Axamer Lizum. And in Alpbach we enjoyed a near-perfect day.</p>

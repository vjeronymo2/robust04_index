			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAPP MOVIE  </P> <P> I happened to catch the Times Shopper article on Sami crafts by Jennifer Merin  in the June 24 Travel Section.  </P> <P> By fortuitous coincidence, I discovered a Lapp (Sami) movie at the Laemmle Fine  Arts Theatre: "Pathfinder." The movie recounts a 1,000-year-old Lapp legend of  a young boy who saves his people from murderous invaders and features Lapp  actors speaking the Lapp language. It's a fascinating view of another time and  culture. Anyone who found your article on the Sami traditional techniques in  craft-making interesting would enjoy "Pathfinder" as well.  </P> <P> SEAN BAINBRIDGE  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

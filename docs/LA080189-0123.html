			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARSON RULED TO BE CAUSE OF FIRE AT TUSTIN MEATPACKING PLANT  </P> <P> A $1-million fire that destroyed a 40-year-old meatpacking plant in the Old  Town section of Tustin was caused by arson, fire officials said Monday.  </P> <P> The 7,440-square-foot wooden building, which until recently had been the Old  Tustin Meat Company, was "virtually destroyed" in the blaze that erupted about  8 p.m. Sunday and burned until 1 a.m. Monday, according to Capt. Hank Raymond,  a spokesman for the Orange County Fire Department.  </P> <P> "Fire investigators have uncovered physical evidence indicating arson," Raymond  said. Raymond would not say what material was used to start the blaze, only  that it began in the rear of the building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Building Was a Maze  </P> <P> The fire was difficult to control because the building, which had stood at 200  El Camino Real since the early 1940s, was a maze of added-on rooms and air  pockets.  </P> <P> "We would knock the fire down in one area, and it would crop up in another  space," Raymond said. "The heat and smoke were so dense that you could only see  one foot in front of your face."  </P> <P> About 100 firefighters from the Orange County, Costa Mesa, Newport Beach,  Huntington Beach and Westminster fire departments battled the blaze, officials  said. Cork-lined walls and cardboard boxes helped fuel the fire, Raymond said.  </P> <P> At different times during the five-hour blaze, flames shot 30 feet into the  sky. "We were concerned about embers coming down on structures a block away,"  Raymond said.  </P> <P> While much of the building was gutted, some machines had been covered with  debris and were salvageable, Raymond said. The exact amount of damage may go  over $1 million when a full inventory of the meat becomes known, Raymond said.  </P> <P> No other structures were damaged, but one firefighter was slightly injured when  a light fixture fell on him, according to Raymond.  </P> <P> John Prescott, father of Tustin City Councilman Earl J. Prescott and a longtime  Tustin resident, said the core of the building was an adobe structure built in  1942 or 1943 as a meat locker for ranchers and local families during World War  II.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Significant Site  </P> <P> When Tustin was a small farming community everyone had a freezer locker to keep  meat, Prescott said. "I'd been in there hundreds of times."  </P> <P> Earl Prescott said the City Council was considering naming the building a  historically significant site.  </P> <P> The meatpacking plant had been purchased about eight months ago by Steve  Mendel, who was operating the Pacific Meat Co. in the building.  </P> <P> Fire officials are asking that any one with information about who may have been  responsible for the fire should call (714) 744-0505.  </P></p>

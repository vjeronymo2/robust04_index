			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> 4.7 AFTERSHOCK TRIGGERS SLIDE ON MT. BALDY, NO NEW DAMAGE  </P> <P> A wide area of Southern California rolled today with a 4.7 aftershock of  Wednesday's earthquake, triggering a rockslide on Mt. Baldy Road but no reports  of significant damage or injuries.  </P> <P> The quake shook Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties.  It also hit Orange County before President Bush addressed a noon anti-drug  rally.  </P> <P> The aftershock had a magnitude of 4.7 and struck at 9:26 a.m., said Robert  Finn, spokesman for CalTech in Pasadena. An aftershock at 2:52 a.m. measured  2.5.  </P> <P> "It was scary and I'm shaking. But nothing fell or flew this time," said Melina  Manning of Ontario, two miles south of the epicenter. "All the pans and the  lights swayed back and forth. It was mild compared to the other day but very  scary, especially because your nerves are shot from the other day."  </P> <P> The aftershocks came as Southern Californians bounced by Wednesday's 5.5 quake,  the largest to hit the region in more than two years, were sweeping up after  millions of dollars in damage.  </P></p>

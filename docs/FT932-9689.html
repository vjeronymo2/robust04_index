			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / PM defends pace of Czech reforms CZECH economic reforms have progressed well, but Prague faces difficulties in its relations with western Europe, according to Mr Vaclav Klaus, the republic's prime minister. 'We are not facing an economic crisis, the worst is behind us,' he said in an interview with Lidove Noviny, the Czech daily. He rejected forecasts of a sharp rise in unemployment and difficult times as economic reforms take hold. Mr Klaus said some reforms had been delayed for practical reasons and not for lack of will to transform the economy. The recent introduction of a bankruptcy law had been delayed by at least six months because of the dissolution of the former Czechoslovakia. Housing reform had also been more difficult to implement than expected. But the radical reform of property relations had been accomplished successfully and without social upheavals, Mr Klaus continued. 'In all countries of central and eastern Europe (social instability) has been much worse.' He was more cautious about the Czech Republic's relations with the European Community. 'I am a Euro-pessimist,' Mr Klaus said, noting what he saw as the growing power of protectionist lobbies within the Community. Prague wants to join the Community this decade, but officials have been increasingly irritated by EC ceilings on Czech and other east European exports to the Community. These limits affect steel, textiles and agricultural produce.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bozo Masanovic: "Succession Talks Must Continue"] </F>   [Text] (From our correspondent) Geneva, 9 February --  Slovenia wants to resume the negotiations on the division of the  assets of the former Yugoslavia. In a special memorandum  addressed to Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg,  copresidents of the peace conference, it states that the FRY  [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] must be prevented from  employing obstructionist tactics at the next session of the  working group on succession. By rehashing the debate on the  definition of the property of the former federation, the FRY  delegation seeks to delay the division of assets among six  successor states. Slovenia is proposing a four-point agenda.    At the meeting with Owen and Stoltenberg, Dr. Bebler  [Slovene  ambassador to Switzerland] explained how Slovenia proposes to  get the succession talks out of deadlock. At the same time he  expressed the opinion that to renew this process it is necessary  to secure the support of the copresidents and the United Nations  Security Council, which could, by adopting a resolution,  threaten the FRY with extension of the present economic  sanctions to include the property of the former federation in  foreign countries if the FRY delegation continues its delaying  tactics. These assets abroad could be frozen or put under the  control of the United Nations or the countries on whose  territory the property of the former Yugoslavia is located until  the succession issue is resolved. Bebler said that without a  clear threat we cannot expect progress at the negotiations,  which are becoming futile.    Thorvald Stoltenberg, who listened carefully to the Slovene  ambassador, promised to review the Ljubljana proposals. He and  Lord Owen will study the recommendation to call up the next  round of negotiations on the division of the "inheritance" of  the former federation and proposed their ideas for unblocking  the process. The working group on succession of the former  Yugoslavia, headed by Danish Ambassador Alf Joensson, was  supposed to meet in Geneva in the middle of February, but this  deadline is probably unrealistic.</p>

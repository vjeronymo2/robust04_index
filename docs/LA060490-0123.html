			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHINA STUDENTS, POLICE CLASH DURING PROTESTS  </P> <P> Police closed off roads leading to Beijing's university area today after a  protest in which hundreds of students hurled bricks and bottles at security  forces on the anniversary of the bloody suppression of the pro-democracy  movement.  </P> <P> Rifle-toting police set up roadblocks near universities in northwest Beijing  and stopped most cars from entering.  </P> <P> All foreign journalists were turned back.  </P> <P> One Western reporter saw three truckloads of riot police, armed with shields  and rifles, entering the university area. Security forces armed with AK-47  rifles also patrolled near Beijing University.  </P> <P> About midnight Sunday, Western reporters outside Beijing University heard glass  breaking and students clapping. Students hurled bottles and other objects at  security forces on the street beneath their dormitory windows, setting off a  campus rally of about 1,000 students.  </P> <P> The protest was the boldest anti-government demonstration since troops crushed  the pro-democracy movement one year ago, and it defied the heaviest security  Beijing has seen since martial law was lifted in January.  </P></p>

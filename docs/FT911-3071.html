			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Cash call at Pressac to fund US expansion PRESSAC HOLDINGS, the circuit board, electronic and electro-mechanical component maker, is jumping on the rights issue bandwagon and raising Pounds 5.7m net, principally to fund US expansion. The group intends to spend Pounds 5m on upgrading its Alabama circuit board assembly factory. The new plant is expected to be installed by March 1992. The offer, of up to 8.16m new shares, will be on a 1-for-2 basis at 75p apiece. The shares, which fell 12p before the announcement, closed down 9p yesterday at 89p. Mr Geoff White, chief executive, said that the proposed investment would enhance Pressac's position as a supplier of flexible printed circuits to the automotive industry. Net reduction of group debt of approximately Pounds 6m would be between Pounds 600,000 and Pounds 700,000. A month ago, Pressac reported a slight rise in interim profits to Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 1.02m). At the time Mr Roger Boissier, chairman, said that the US recession was 'particularly affecting' the automotive industry but argued that it would be 'short-sighted to delay an investment programme because of the present economic decline'. The issue has been underwritten by Baring Brothers with Rowe &amp; Pitman acting as brokers. All the company's directors are to take up their entitlements in full except for Mr Jeffrey Cullis who is to sell sufficient rights nil paid to enable him to subscribe for the balance of his entitlement.</p>

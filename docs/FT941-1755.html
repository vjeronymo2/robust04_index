			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Fall in orders for US durable goods Orders for US durable goods fell 2.5 per cent between January and February, more than expected in financial markets, but the decline mainly reflected a sharp drop in aircraft orders, which tend to be highly volatile on a monthly basis. Excluding transport, orders were flat in February and up 8.6 per cent from the same period last year. Excluding defence as well as transport, orders edged higher last month. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the figures, adjusted for special factors, were consistent with 'sustained economic growth'. He said orders for non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft - regarded as a good guide to civilian investment trends - rose 5.3 per cent last month. 'The manufacturing sector continues to expand,' said economists at CJ Lawrence, a New York broker. 'Both durable goods orders and shipments are on steep uptrends.' They predicted a sharp rebound in aircraft orders this month. Most analysts are anticipating a strong rebound in economic growth in March after disruptions in several sectors as a result of severe winter weather earlier in the year.</p>

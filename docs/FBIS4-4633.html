			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ho Yong-pom] </F>   [Text] Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong strongly  indicated on 3 April that the ROK and the United States may  change their existing policy of demanding the special envoy  exchange as a precondition of North Korea-U.S. talks by saying:  "Although the special envoy exchange between the North and the  South still remains a precondition to the third round of North  Korea-U.S. talks, a broad discussion including the de-linking of  the two is possible and should be done." Attending a discussion  meeting on the North Korean nuclear issue among opposition and  ruling party lawmakers held at Academy House in Suyuri, Seoul on  the afternoon of 3 April, Vice Minister Hong said: "It will be  more advantageous to omit the precondition of the special envoy  exchange and adopt a package deal of `guaranteeing the  diplomatic relations with the United States under the condition  of the assurance of nuclear transparency' because the latter  provides a more justifiable basis for imposing stronger  sanctions in case North Korea refuses nuclear reinspection."    Vice Minister Hong's remarks are noteworthy because it has  been learned that the government has been recently reviewing a  plan to simultaneously hold the special envoy exchange between  the North and the South and the third-round North Korea-U.S.  talks if North Korea accepts additional inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency.    Vice Minister Hong backed up the speculation that the  de-linking is being studied by saying, "Behind-the-scenes  dialogue for the third-round North Korea-U.S. talks is still  underway between working-level officials of the two sides. For  now, we do not intend to propose dialogue to the North first."    Vice Minister Hong also said, "Had the nuclear issue not  come  up, our government would have followed its policy to actively  help the establishment of diplomatic relations between the North  and the United States from the very beginning of the regime."</p>

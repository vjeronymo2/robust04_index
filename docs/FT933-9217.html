			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Brazilians again put off sale of indebted Cosipa THE BRAZILIAN government has postponed privatisation of the loss-making Cosipa steel mill for the third time, after failure to reach agreement over the company's big debts to Sao Paulo state. The sale of Cosipa, due today, cannot go ahead until the national commission overseeing the reduction of the government's role succeeds in renegotiating the company's equivalent of Dollars 301m in unpaid sales taxes owed to Sao Paulo. The commission has proposed that Cosipa repay the debt over eight years through increasing instalments. However, Governor Luis Antonio Fleury Filho of Sao Paulo, says he will only accept the commission's proposal if his state's terms for renegotiation of its own debts with the federal government are accepted. According to the finance ministry, Sao Paulo has debts of more than Dollars 10bn - a figure Mr Fleury hotly contests. Mr Andre Montoro, commission president, said yesterday: 'The sale of Cosipa is in the hands of the governor.' Mr Montoro admitted that Cosipa's minimum sale price, fixed at Dollars 229m, may have to be reduced if its debts to Sao Paulo are not restructured. Aside from those, Cosipa owes Dollars 91m to Banco do Brasil and a further Dollars 1bn to other assorted creditors. The Dollars 1bn debt was recently refinanced. The latest delay is raising fresh doubts over the commitment of President Itamar Franco to privatisation. There have been nine cancellations of sales so far this year and the programme is moving very slowly. However, Brazilian finance ministry officials say that they are anxious to get Cosipa off their hands as its debts are costing the government more than Dollars 1m a day in interest payments. New privatisation rules are expected to be announced by the Brazilian government next month. These may include share placements on international markets.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER'S MESSAGE FOR SHAMIR'S NEW GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> Are my ears deceiving me or did I hear Baker imply that the new Israeli  government might be something less than sincere in its claim to be longing for  peace! From a Palestinian's perspective nothing is being done any more  ruthlessly with the advent of this new government than has been done almost  every day for the last 40 years! The Palestinians have been chased off their  land, beaten, detained, tortured, deprived of their human rights, their civil  liberties.  </P> <P> It does, however, seem as though Baker is sincere in his desire to see some  relief for the Palestinian people and that is a welcome relief for all caring  people in this country and the world.  </P> <P> Baker has displayed a great deal of human compassion and political  responsibility.  </P> <P> Maybe the vision of Baker can serve as a lesson to us all: What the Israeli  government is doing today and what it has been doing for the last 40 years is  wrong. What is different now is that the people of the world (including Baker)  are growing more and more impatient and intolerant of this kind of behavior.  </P> <P> JOE FLEMING  </P> <P> South Gate  </P></p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (1): System distinctions begin to vanish -  While the PC has become the leading agent for change, Paul Taylor finds that office equipment is combining features to become multi-functional Digital technology is transforming the way companies do business. This is most evident in the office where networks of powerful personal computers, wireless telephony and high-speed communications links are re-shaping the way we work. Data processing and digital telecommunications in particular have changed the way information is collected, manipulated, analysed and stored. Now these technologies are converging, bringing the integrated digital office closer. In the process they are enriching the office environment by bringing new value-added services, such as video-conferencing, electronic mail, electronic data interchange (EDI) and multimedia, to the desktop. The most dramatic change since the early 1980s has been the arrival of the personal computer and workstation. Today an estimated 100m PCs and workstations are in use across the globe. Each new microprocessor generation brings more power to the desktop at the same or lower prices. The accelerating pace of silicon engineering means that most desktop machines now have the power and storage capacity of yesterday's mainframe machines. Such high performance machines are required to handle the sophisticated and power-hungry software developed by Microsoft and others. Increasingly these PCs are hooked together using hard-wire and wireless telecommunications links to form local and wide-area networks (Lans and Wans) which can share data and peripherals like printers, computer-based fax machines, scanners and other equipment. This process of computer platform substitution - from mainframe to desktop PC and mid-range machines called 'servers', has become known as 'downsizing', or 'rightsizing'. The fact that the PC has become an indispensable business tool and an agent for change in the workplace is reflected in a study* of the European market undertaken by Context, an IT research firm, and published recently by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The authors note that in spite of recession and cutbacks, the PC market has grown by 12.5 per cent in unit terms in 1992 and by about 14 per cent in 1993. 'Projections for 1994 are that demand will continue to rise and that unit growth could increase by more than 20 per cent on 1993,' the report says. 'The reasons for this sustained growth are simple. Business in the 1990s cannot compete without the efficiency and technology provided by computers. The PC best fulfils these requirements in a form that is versatile, flexible, powerful and, most important of all, affordable. The massive price reductions of the past two years have played a vital part in promoting continued growth in the sale of PCs.' The PC may have improved office productivity, but it has not led to the creation of the paperless office some had predicted. At least 80 per cent of information used in the office is still stored on paper, rather than electronically. The growing use of electronic trading and EDI in the UK and elsewhere has begun to cut into the stacks of documentation which business transactions generate, but progress is slow. In the US more than a third of companies are expected to buy document management systems this year and new hardware such as digital optical scanning, storage and retrieval devices have begun to appear in offices. But so, too, have new paper generators such as high-volume electronic demand printers which link directly to computers, digital offset presses and digital copiers which scan a hard copy once and allow image manipulation before reproducing multiple copies. Other digital multi-functional office equipment is also beginning to appear, blurring of distinctions between individual devices. Most of these devices combine some or all of the features of a facsimile machine, photocopier, laser printer and scanner. Meanwhile, other bottlenecks in the office communications infrastructure have been attracting attention. In particular the lack of flexibility, inefficiencies and unnecessary costs imposed by hard-wired telecommunications links are being challenged by new wireless alternatives - in much the same way that cellular telephones and mobile data have begun to change perceptions of telecommunications outside the office. A growing number of businesses are using digital cellular telephony, portable computers and mobile data networks to exchange information between the central office database and mobile employees such as salesmen or engineers. Now within the office, several PABX (private automatic branch exchange) manufactures have launched digital cordless voice systems. Similarly wireless Lans linking desktop computers, workstations and other devices, without the need for fixed cabling have begun to appear. Meanwhile the volume and variety of information requiring delivery to the desktop is set to grow rapidly as desktop video-conferencing and multimedia applications become increasingly commonplace. Some computers now come fully equipped for video-conferencing, allowing users to transmit live video images of themselves to other, similarly- equipped users, and to see on their PC the person they are talking to. But for the moment most PC users will have to buy a special kit if they want to carry out a video-conference in a window on their screen. In order to deliver these multimedia services across networks, new high speed, high capacity packet-switched technologies, such as ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), have been developed. As they are adopted, the remaining distinctions between office voice and data lines are likely to vanish. The rapid pace of change means corporate and other information technology users are having to spend increasing amounts to remain in step with new technology. The annual Price Waterhouse information technology review** published last month and based on a survey of 1,000 information technology executives, found that IT spending jumped by 15 per cent last year across the corporate sector - a sharp increase given the low inflation rate and far above the 0.2 per cent increase that the same organisations had predicted at the start of of 1993. The survey found IT spending to be closely tied to restructuring. Two-thirds of organisations claimed to have programmes in place and 28 per cent of IT executives said they were themselves the main architect of change in their organisation. 'This study confirms that managers in major companies are now re-thinking their operations and re-equipping their IT systems to fit new market conditions,' says Jane Lucien-Scholle, head of the IT practice of Price Waterhouse Management. The survey also highlights the marked trend away from mainframe-based systems to PC-based client-server networks. Client-server computing was the most popular of the new and emerging technologies and has been implemented by 58 per cent of the respondents and was ranked number one in offering the greatest potential benefit. Other new technologies popular with the executives included document image processing and workflow systems which are being used by organisations with high volumes of paper which need to be stored such as credit card receipts and cancelled cheques. 'All these findings point in the same direction,' says Ms Lucien-Scholle. 'Management is looking very deeply into the competitive implications of IT. They want change, but are resisting superficial responses. They are investing, but they also want value. 'The ways in which they spend these very large sums and adapt their organisations to exploit new systems are likely to have a critical influence on competitive performance and profits in the years ahead.' *The European Market for PCs and Printers, Economist Intelligence Unit, 15 Regent Street, London SW1 4LR.

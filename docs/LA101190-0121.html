			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS  </P> <P> "Things Change" (1988), directed by David Mamet. 100 minutes. Rated R. An  Italian shoemaker (Don Ameche) agrees to take the rap for a mob hit but gets  one last fling with the low-level Mafioso (Joe Mantegna) assigned to protect  him.  </P> <P> "The Thing" (1951), directed by Christian Nyby. 87 minutes. No rating. Among  the first in a spate of '50s sci-fi films, this black-and-white movie is said  to have inspired many contemporary filmmakers and movies. There's wit in the  script: the alien turns out to be a vegetable, of all things. MARK CHALON SMITH  </P></p>

The sources said Japan will likely resume such aid by the  end  of March, while continuing its suspension of new official loans  to Myanmar in light of the continued house detention of  opposition leader Aung Sang Suu Kyi.    One source said Japan's grant assistance would not go to the  Myanmar Government, but for projects being implemented at the  grass- roots level by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).    The sources said the Japanese Government has already  notified  the United States of its intentions. Washington has strongly  criticized the Myanmar junta over alleged human rights  violations.    A number of requests have already been received from NGOs  operating in Myanmar for project funding, the sources said.    Each project approved will likely be supported to the tune  of  several millions of yen, they said.    Japan considered a possible resumption of official loans in  January, when Myanmar's national convention to debate a new  constitution was resumed, the sources said.    The idea was dropped, however, when it became clear there  remained no sign that Aung San Suu Kyi would be released, they  said.</p>

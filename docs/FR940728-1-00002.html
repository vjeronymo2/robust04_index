These regulations would clarify the existing regulations to specifically state the requirement that, if the employee has a break in service ending after 1986, the employee's past service must include some service covered by CSRS to be excluded from automatic FERS coverage. The regulations are necessary to clarify the current regulations and to conform to OPM's guidance since implementation of FERS. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before September 26, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send comments to Reginald M.

Siegelman, (202) 606&hyph;0299. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The general rule that a Federal employee who is covered by social security is automatically covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) unless the employee is excluded from FERS coverage by statute or regulation is stated in section 842.103 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. (FERS coverage is available only to employees covered by social security.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> See generally <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  definition of employee under 5 CFR 842.102.) However, our current coverage regulations present many of the statutory exclusions to FERS coverage in terms of election rights that belong in part 846 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. To simplify the regulations, we propose to revise sections 842.101 and 842.104 to limit the scope of subpart A of part 842 to automatic FERS coverage, leaving the regulation of all transfer issues to part 846. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 8402(b) of title 5, United States Code, establishes the statutory exclusions from coverage under FERS. The regulations implementing this provision are contained in section 842.104 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. These proposed regulations seek to clarify the regulations and eliminate redundancies in a manner consistent with OPM's implementation of FERS since the system's inception. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 8402(b)(1) of title 5, United States Code, excludes certain senior officials from automatic FERS coverage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute applies to senior officials who were placed under mandatory social security coverage at the beginning of 1984 and who have continuous service since December 31, 1983. Proposed section 842.104(b) would use essentially the same language as our current section 842.104(c) of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, to implement this paragraph. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 8402(b)(2) of title 5, United States Code, provides two mutually exclusive sets of exclusions from automatic FERS coverage. Subparagraph (A) applies to employees who reenter service on or after January 1, 1987 (the general effective date of the FERS Act of 1986) after a break in service. Subparagraph (B) applies to employees not covered by subparagraph (A), specifically, employees who have served continuously since December 31, 1986. OPM has applied this approach to the exclusion since the inception of FERS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees who have had a break in service ending after December 31, 1986, are excluded from automatic FERS coverage if they satisfy the two-part test under subparagraph (A). The two-part test requires both some service (at least 1 day)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> covered <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Foreign Service Retirement System (FSRS) and at least 5 years of civilian service creditable under CSRS rules as of the last separation from service. Proposed section 482.104(c) would revise our current section 842.104(b) of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, to clarify our existing regulation that implements this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

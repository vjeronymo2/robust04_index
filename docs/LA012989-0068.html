			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRRELEVANTLY OUTFITTED  </P> <P> In the midst of the present political and social changes this country is going  through, I feel (and I would assume the majority of the people not involved in  the hoopla surrounding the inauguration also feel) that who wears what to which  function has absolutely no relevance to events and problems in the real world  and indeed the outfits (and perhaps their wearers) will be forgotten in the  not-too-distant future.  </P> <P> It is with this idea that I skimmed your article in the View section ("The  Great Gown Dust-Up," by Bettijane Levine, Jan. 20), and I expended that much  effort having first seen the inauguration earlier in the day on television and  feeling that Mrs. Quayle's attire was rather forgettable except for the hat,  which made the entire package unattractive. Marilyn Quayle, you're no Jackie  Kennedy.  </P> <P> L. SCOTT HERMAN  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- Leaders of the  newly-founded Hungarist Movement (HM) applied for registration  at Budapest Metropolitan Court on April 25, but they insist that  they regard themselves as an existing organization, irrespective  of the court's decision, journalists were told in Budapest on  Wednesday [27 April]. The movement was set up by leaders of the  "Federation of Persecutees of Communism", the Hungarian National  Front, and the World National Popular Rule Party: Gyorgy Ekrem  Kemal, Istvan Gyorkos, and Albert Szabo, respectively.    The three HM co-presidents said they identify at least  partly  with the ideas of Ferenc Szalasi's arrow-cross party. At the  news conference, Szabo called Szalasi an ideal of Hungarian  youth.    (Szalasi -- 1897-1946 -- led the Hungarian arrow-cross  party-Hungarist movement. Hitler helped him to power on October  15, 1944, and he introduced a reign of fascist terror in the  country. The Hungarian people's court sentenced him to death as  a war-criminal, in 1946.)    According to Istvan Gyorkos, the Hungarist Movement had to  be  founded to counter strengthening left-wing influence, because  the national parties have made a compromise and fail to  represent the nation's interests. He said the court must  acknowledge their movement if it registered the Zionist  Federation and the Masonic Lodges.    In response to questions from the press, Gyorkos insisted  that Hungarism was not responsible for the Holocaust, because in  1944 the arrow-cross party controlled only a few counties in  Transdanubia, and he claims it was the Hungarists who prevented  Jews in the Budapest ghetto from being deported.    The movement currently has about 500 members and many  sympathizers, HM leaders informed the press.</p>

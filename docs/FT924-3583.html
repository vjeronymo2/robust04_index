			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Letter: Esoteric, burdensome index Sir, The sole purpose for which my fund managers turn up to work is to achieve above-average investment performance - whether it be gauged from beating an index or making superior returns to our competitors'. Our UK department has achieved significant success in this objective over the years. The additions to the FT-A All-Share Index list in your paper on December 4 include such esoteric names as TR Pacific Investment Trust, EFM Dragon Trust, Foreign and Colonial Germany Investment Trust, Martin Currie Pacific Trust, German Smaller Companies Investment Trust, Abtrust New Dawn, etc. Our clients investing specifically for UK investment in our UK funds would not appreciate it if our UK fund managers invested in a selection of these investment trusts. The inclusion of these 100 per cent overseas investment trusts in the FT-A All Share Index places an additional and unnecessary burden on our UK fund managers in years when the UK market underperforms other world markets, particularly if I reviewed their salaries on how they have performed against the FT-A All Share Index. Martyn Arbib, chairman, Perpetual, 48 Hart Street, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire RG2 2AZ</p>

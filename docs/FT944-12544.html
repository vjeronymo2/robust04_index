			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Heron rebels renew bid opposition Dissident bondholders opposed to the sale of Heron International, Mr Gerald Ronson's private property company, have vowed to fight on against the purchase plans by HNV Acquisition, the US investment group. Following publication of the formal offer document, Mr Gary Klesch, managing director of Klesch &amp; Co, which has been opposing the deal, said: 'This is highly, highly, highly conditional. There's the litigations, the valuations and other things besides. Nothing we have seen has changed our minds over this deal.' HNV, led by US investor Mr Steven Green, made its initial offer several weeks ago, during which time the group and its advisers have been negotiating with some of Heron's 82 creditor banks in order to gain acceptance. The US group is offering Pounds 142m in cash to the banks and bondholders who hold around Pounds 374m of debt. Swiss Bank Corporation, HNV's bankers, has already secured the agreement of around half of Heron's creditor bankers, which are owed some Pounds 200m. Their debts are secured on properties in the UK and Spain. The document shows the UK properties as having assets valued in excess of Pounds 200m. However, the Spanish business has only net assets of Pounds 400,000. Under the terms of the agreement, HNV will put up to Pounds 17m of capital into the Spanish operations. The document also shows Mr Ronson's salary package for the year to March 30 1994 at Pounds 1,049,000, down from Pounds 1,537,000 in 1993. Under last September's refinancing, Mr Ronson agreed a five-year Pounds 800,000 per annum salary package and the fall from the previous year reflects the lower renumeration. Mr Ronson will continue as chief executive under the HNV plan, a move which has caused some consternation, particularly among rebel bondholders. 'I'm staggered by what they are continuing to pay that guy,' said Mr Klesch. Unusually, the offer document includes four pages of litigation in which Heron is involved, including an Dollars 88m (Pounds 56m) lawsuit relating to the group's ill-fated purchase of Pima, a US financial services group, and a Dollars 39m suit outstanding brought by another US group, Stratagem. In all, there are 16 outstanding litigation cases against Heron, or its directors. Meetings have been set for the bondholders and banks to approve the HNV offer. The banks are likely to be supportive, having approved HNV as the preferred bidder last June, but the bondholders may not be. It was the bondholders' decision last April to demand payments on their bonds that forced Heron to seek a buyer. Lex, Page 22; Background, Page 24</p>

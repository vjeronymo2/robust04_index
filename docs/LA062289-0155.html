			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYPARK CLERK IS SUSPENDED; MAN SOUGHT IN PICK NINE CASE  </P> <P> A mutuel clerk has been suspended and another man could face criminal charges  in connection with a scheme involving the $1.38-million Pick Nine betting pool  at Hollywood Park on June 14.  </P> <P> Dean Bailey of Hawthorne, who has been a member of the local mutuel clerks'  union since 1971, was suspended Wednesday for "conduct detrimental to racing."  He allegedly gave a canceled Pick Nine ticket to an alleged accomplice who has  been identified as James Farebaugh of La Crescenta, who in turn allegedly sold  shares in the ticket to as many as six other patrons for a total of about  $3,000 and then left the race track.  </P> <P> Tickets that have been canceled by Hollywood Park's AmTote betting machines  appear no different than valid tickets. When a ticket is canceled, clerks are  required to tear or cut the ticket and secure it for collection at the end of  the day.  </P> <P> The ticket in question -- which sold for $4,860 -- had all nine winners on the  June 14 program. The scheme came to light when the bilked patrons began  demanding their winnings.  </P> <P> "We have creditable and corroborative evidence that (Bailey) intentional ly let  this ticket back on the floor," said Bobby Taylor, Hollywood Park director of  mutuels. "He was suspended indefinitely as of last Friday, and excluded from  the grounds of the race track."  </P> <P> Investigators for the California Horse Racing Board also are looking for  Farebaugh, who could be charged with fraud.  </P> <P> In addition, track officials are going over Bailey's log tapes -- records of  all bet transactions at his window -- from both the current Hollywood Park  meeting and this year's Santa Anita meeting to see if there were any other  instances of suspiciously canceled tickets on large betting pools.  </P> <P> In a statement issued through Joe Stellino, president of the local clerks'  union, Bailey declined comment on his suspension.  </P> <P> However, Stellino said that Bailey is almost certain to lose his state license  to work as a mutuel clerk.  </P> <P> "Based on what they have, it doesn't look good for him," Stellino said.  </P> <P> Special investigator Jeff Crandall of the CHRB said that a hearing will be held  next week to seek revocation of Bailey's license.  </P> <P> Crandall also is preparing a criminal complaint against the alleged accomplice  Farebaugh, charging fraud. There is no criminal complaint being considered  against Bailey at this time, Crandall said.  </P> <P> "This occurred on our property," said Crandall, formerly with the state police  in Oakland. "As state investigators, we have the jurisdiction to work with the  district attorney in filing a felony complaint."  </P> <P> Crandall acknowledged that the "syndication" or reselling of tickets already  purchased from a mutuel window is a relatively common occurrence.  </P> <P> "There's no case law establishing that it's illegal to buy a ticket like that,"  Crandall said. "But to sell it is something else. It's a tout. It's against the  law."  </P> <P> The patrons who paid for shares of the canceled ticket and thought they had won  might take civil action against Hollywood Park, according to one member of the  group.  </P> <P> "Some of these victims in this case are not really cooperating as you would  expect victims to cooperate," Crandall said. "The whole point is, if you're  going to buy a pari-mutuel ticket, you'd better buy it yourself."  </P></p>

Since then the situation has  become even more threatening: There have been several fires,  trains have been halted for a long time, and it has become  impossible to get to certain stations at rush hour. Despairing  metro officials sent this letter to B. Yeltsin, in which they  urge the government to take immediate action to help save the  Moscow metro.    Dear Boris Nikolayevich!    For four years now, with the active assistance of the Moscow  government, our labor collectives have been fighting for the  right to build and operate the metro in a normal fashion.    This struggle stems from the need to resolve the matter of  obtaining stable financing for capital investments for the  development, rebuilding and modernization of the metro.    Every time we have to try to prove that financing the  metro's  development is not simply a concern of the city itself, but also  of the Moscow region and the Russian capital, in that the metro  is a key CIS transport and passenger-service hub that carries up  to 9 million passengers each day.    For more than 63 years, all outlays for the metro's  development have been borne by the state in the form of planned  central capital investments, since the city alone cannot afford  this. Construction of the metro never ceased even during the  grimmest war years, when the German fascists were just 30  kilometers from Moscow.    And now, despite the instructions of the Russian government,  the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics is again failing to  provide the required capital investment ceilings for the metro's  development in 1994, without which the Russian Ministry of  Finance cannot transfer funds to the metro.    Nor is the problem of indexing capital investments to the  sharply rising inflation rate being solved in a timely fashion.  The transfer of funds by the Russian Ministry of Finance is  often delayed and extremely irregular. The failure to resolve  the issue of allocating funds to repay indebtedness on credits  in 1993 has put the metro in an exceptionally grave financial  situation.    As of January 20 1994, the metro owed 33 billion rubles for  work performed by contracting and design organizations and for  trains and equipment installed by supplier plants.    The financial operations of construction, design, and  machinery-building organizations for which the metro is the sole  client (the Moscow Metro Construction State Joint-Stock Company,  the Moscow Metro Reconstruction firm, several joint ventures in  which the Transportation Engineering Construction firm is a  partner, the State Metro Transport Design Institute, the Moscow  Metro Design Institute, train-building plants in Mytishchi and  St. Petersburg, the Escalator Plant in St. Petersburg, and other  organizations) have been essentially paralyzed.    The Mytishchi and St. Petersburg machinery plants have  halted  work to modernize train cars' fire-safety systems. Contracting  organizations have also stopped replacing escalators, fire  alarms, and other equipment.    All these things are jeopardizing passenger safety.    Work to develop the metro has essentially come to stop,  raising the question of halting the city's social development.    A volatile, prestrike atmosphere has arisen in the labor  collectives of the Moscow Metro Construction State Joint-Stock  Company and in other organizations.    The halt to financing of the metro's development is already  leading to the collapse of unique construction and design  organizations involved in building the metro and of the electric  train and escalator plants in St. Petersburg and Mytishchi,  which are the only plants of their kind not just in Russia but  also in the CIS as a whole and whose sole customer is the Moscow  metro.    Under these circumstances, it is hard to assess the  socioeconomic consequences of the step taken by Russian Ministry  of Economics for the city and the entire Moscow region.    In view of the inadmissibility of an interruption in the  construction, operation, and modernization of the metro, its  exceptional social importance for the city and the Moscow  region, and the lack of any alternative solution to the very  difficult transportation problem in the city, the 40,000-strong  labor collective of the Moscow metro and the Metro Construction  State Joint-Stock Company asks you, Boris Nikolayevich to  urgently instruct:     -  the Russian Ministry of Economics to notify the Russian  Ministry of Finance of a capital investment ceiling of 635  million rubles in 1991 prices, which, according to the metro's  calculations, amounts to 1,400 billion rubles in 1994 prices;    -  the Russian Ministry of Finance to resolve, in January 1994,  the matter of transferring 33 billion rubles to the metro to  repay indebtedness on credits and, in approving the federal  budget, to provide in the first quarter of 1994 for the  financing of capital investments to develop the metro in the  amount of 350 billion rubles, with a view to repaying 1993  indebtedness on credits and making down payments on the purchase  of construction materials, equipment, rolling stock and cable  products.       [Signed] Ye. Dubenko, director of the Moscow Metro V. Pskov,  chairman of the Metro Railroad Workers Trade Union Committee Yu.  Kopelev, general director of the Moscow Metro Construction State  Joint-Stock Company N. Reymid, chairman of the Railroad Workers  Trade Union Committee</p>

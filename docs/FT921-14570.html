			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Judge to probe township killings A JUDGE appointed to investigate South Africa's political violence said yesterday he would probe newspaper allegations that the defence force was behind killings in black townships, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. Judge Richard Goldstone, chairman of a commission of inquiry set up under terms of a national peace accord last September, said in a statement that he had been asked to investigate by Mr Roelf Meyer, the defence minister, and the black opposition African National Congress. The Weekly Mail reported 11 days ago that the defence force was funding front organisations which instigated violence in townships. It has accused the government of helping the Inkatha Freedom Party, locked in a long-running feud with the ANC. About 4,800 blacks have been killed in the last two years in township violence.</p>

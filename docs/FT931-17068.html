			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Bank staff sit personality tests: NatWest uses psychometrics on life insurance sales recruits ABOUT 1,500 National Westminster Bank staff have been recruited for the bank's new life insurance sales subsidiary after undergoing personality tests as part of the selection process. Recruitment to NatWest Life, which is expected to become one of the 20 largest life insurers in Britain in its first year, has involved some of the broadest uses of psychometric testing of employees yet seen in high street banking. Psychometric testing requires job applicants to answer questions designed to test motivation and personality. Several banks, including Barclays and Lloyds, are considering using the tests to select employees who are suited to selling financial products. The banking code of practice introduced this year places some restrictions on such selling. Traditional bank recruitment has relied on clerical staff and managers having obtained basic academic qualifications. Personality tests have been thought irrelevant because bank staff have performed a mixture of office tasks. But NatWest Life, which is being launched this month with capital of Pounds 105m, has used psychometric tests and interviews to select its sales force. About 1,500 have been recruited from the bank's branch network. Mr Lawrence Churchill, chief executive of NatWest Life, said the subsidiary had 'stronger requirements on personal qualities than for the average member of branch staff'. It needed employees who were self-starting and sociable. NatWest Life, 92.5 per owned by the bank, is a joint venture with Clerical Medical. It is NatWest's first venture into offering tied insurance rather than independent intermediary advice through NatWest Insurance Services. The subsidiary will sell its own insurance products through 2,700 NatWest branches. Its sales force will be divided into about 1,500 advisers selling insurance, and 200 financial planning managers who will give other investment advice. The bank hopes NatWest Life will emulate the success of other clearing bank subsidiaries selling tied insurance, including Lloyds Bank's Black Horse Financial Services subsidiary, which sells Lloyds Abbey Life products. Mr Churchill said it hoped to sell 200,000 policies in its first year. He said NatWest believed insurance sales could eventually form 'a significant proportion of profits'. Most of the 1,500 sales staff have transferred from NatWest Insurance Services.</p>

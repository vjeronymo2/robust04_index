Here is journalist Benito Cuadrado with  more information.    [Cuadrado -- live by phone or recorded] The CTC's secretary  general pointed out that Villa Clara's union activities are  exemplary, but that decreases in production such as those  exhibited on the tobacco plantations in (Manicaragua) and in the  fishing sector must be avoided because the nation needs those  resources to increase its economic potential.    The CTC national secretariat expressed interest in the  sugarcane harvest strategy in Villa Clara; the cane planting,  which will exceed 170 caballerias this month; and the progress  of the potato campaign. The goal is to obtain over 6,000  quintals of yield.    Ross Leal, who is a member of the Politburo, said that those  who accomplish their respective missions must be acknowledged  and encouraged because these times call for labor feats, and the  people of Villa Clara always walk that path.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sinan Yilmaz] </F>   [Text] Ankara--Discussion about the operation carried out  by the Turkish Army in Northern Iraq on April 12, and  suggestions that it was unsuccessful, have not lasted long.    The economic stabilization package and the controversy over  the formation of new government have caused the Kurdish question  to be temporarily forgotten. But the conflict has not come to a  halt. On the contrary, the number of confrontations has  increased. Following the decisions taken during the PKK's Third  National Conference, it is clear that the army is determined to  finish the matter by the end of the summer by means of an  all-out war. But the outlawed Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK)  also decided to declare all-out war in March. These decisions  have created impassable obstacles to democratic or political  solutions and have also signalled that the year 1994 will be of  crucial importance in the history of this question. Statements  issuing both from the army and from the PKK suggest that there  will be a further escalation of violence and that more blood  will be shed before the end of the summer.    As of April, parallel to the operations initiated by the  army, there has been an increases in PKK activities. Meanwhile,  the unsolved murders which have become characteristic of the  Southeast region have suddenly begun to increase. We mentioned  in our previous articles that the PKK had launched some  diplomatic initiatives as part of its strategy, primarily in an  attempt to get European countries to put forward proposals for a  solution, and that the PKK was waiting for the outcome of these  initiatives. The period of waiting is about to end.... It has  been impossible to get a definitive report on the result of the  operations which the Turkish army has launched against the PKK.  Both army and PKK sources claimed to have inflicted heavy  casualties--a familiar tactic. The army has announced that 4500  PKK militants have been eradicated, and that camps like Shive,  Haftanin and Mezi have been destroyed and are unusable. However  it is a known fact that the PKK had not used those camps  following the operations carried out by the army in 1992.    In other words, the army had launched assaults on  uninhabited  camps. Meanwhile, according to the reports received from the  region, minor clashes only have taken place and not the  large-scale engagement that has been spoken of. The PKK  militants have managed to protect themselves with hit-and-run  tactics and their losses have not matched what was claimed by  the army.    The PKK have also boasted of major successes in order to  establish a psychological superiority. They claim to have  killed 630 soldiers, of whom 30 were ranking officers. Their  statements also reported that many tanks had been destroyed and  that a number of helicopters had been shot down.    While the army and the PKK both continue to come up with  false statistics, it is at least clear that the army has failed  to get the results it was looking for from its cross-border  operations. It also seems that talk about the creation of  buffer zones was mistaken because a significant proportion of  the forces moved to the region have since been withdrawn.  However airborne operations are still being carried out, and  statements insist that the PKK will be finished until the end of  summer. The army has now to come to terms with the fact that a  package of democratic reforms is in preparation. Following the  press coverage of the telephone conversation between Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller and True Party (DYP) ministers Necmettin  Cevheri and Bekir Sami Dace, it has also been made public that  the term of office of the chief of General Staff, Gen. Dogan  Gures, will be extended for another year and that Ciller and  Gures have agreed on a democratization package. It's clear that  the democratization package that the Social Democrat People's  Party (SHP) had earlier announced contains only proposals made  some time previously. What is important here is the fact that  the chief of general staff has agreed with the prime minister  about the preparation of a democratization package. The prime  minister has also announced that the deputy prime minister,  Murat Karayalcin, also supports the package.    It is quite evident that 1994 will be critical for the  Kurdish question. But it is also certain that the army will not  be able to finish off the PKK this summer. Democratic reforms  prepared in such circumstances will not be workable, and a  package worked out jointly with the army does not look like a  genuine remedy for anything.    It is not a prediction to say that violence will further  increase, because the army has already launched an all-out war,  and so has the PKK. Meanwhile, within the last month, incidents  such as unsolved murders and the abduction or execution of  citizens have increased. A considerable number of people have  also lost their lives in mine blasts.    Within the PKK organization, hardliners have completely  taken  control. Despite PKK Leader Abdullah Ocalan's calls for peace  and his instructions that soldiers should not be attacked, the  decisions taken at the PKK's 3rd National Conference are  designed to escalate the violence.    The most important decision taken at the conference, which  met between March 5 and March 15, 1994 is "to stage all-out  revolutionary war in response to the enemy's all-out war of  destruction." In order to organize the guerrilla forces better,  those who attended the conference decided to establish a general  staff. This signalled that the hardliners in the organization  have gained strength and that the violence will increase further  in the near future.    The most important decisions of the Third National  Conference  may be summarized as follows: "The struggle which the PKK  carries out has left the stage of strategic defense and entered  that of strategic balance. It is inevitable that we escalate  our struggle in response to Turkey's declaration of all-out war.  Consequently, all economic, political, military, social and  cultural organizations, institutions, formations -- and those  who serve in them -- have become targets. The entire country  has become the battlefield."    With the decision for centralizing the military structure of  the PKK under a general staff, the PKK aims to build a popular  army 50,000 strong. The front line now includes the western  regions and the PKK has decided to allow the members of the  National Liberation Front (ERNK) to take part in the action.  Even this decision on its own can be interpreted as meaning  that the violence will now escalate, because ERNK members were  previously confined to support services, propaganda and  logistics.    Striking at various military and economic targets will now  also involve ERNK members, who are primarily based on  metropolitan areas.    It was further decided at the Third National Conference to  set up state assemblies and state governments and to establish a  separate judiciary in mainly Kurdish areas.    Other targets and aims were also listed at the conference:  "The liquidation of all parties and associations which represent  imperialism. Putting out of action all radio and TV channels,  newspapers and magazines which are the tools of special warfare.  The liquidation of imperialist cultural and educational  organizations in various forms. The liquidation of all the  legislative and executive organizations and representative  offices of the Turkish republic. Rendering the judicial system  inoperable. Eliminating all local collaborators and agents  working for the Republic of Turkey in Kurdistan. "All the  financial organizations and institutions which finance the dirty  war which the Turkish republic is waging in our country. Under  the heading are included tourist facilities, mines, oil  pipelines, power stations, factories, the arms industry,  transportation and communications systems, and economic  organizations both large and small. Their destruction and  expropriation is what is important. The entire army, which is  the basic instrument of imperialism in Kurdistan, is a target.  All the special units, special teams, counter-guerrilla units  and village guards are targets. All the internal security  units, the police force, the National Intelligence Organization  (MIT) and civilian defense units are also targets." In view of  these decisions, it is likely that attacks in the western  regions will be aimed increasingly at tourist centers and  certain economic facilities. It is likely, too, that as the  ERNK become involved in front-line activities, violent and  bloody actions will be seen in the cities. This, in turn, will  make the possibility of a political solution recede even  further. Both sides have committed themselves to violent  solutions. One side will have to admit defeat by the end of the  year. Which one is as yet unknown...</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shulamit Aloni, Israeli "Minister of </F> sciences and communications," by Muhammad al-Hinnawi in  Jerusalem; date not given]    [Text] [Al-Hinnawi] The world is astonished, actually  shocked, by the failure to agree on the start of the Israeli  withdrawal and the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement  on 12 December. What are the reasons and what do you think is  happening?    [Aloni] Let me stress at the beginning that this government  has decided to do all it can for peace. This is our choice and  the clock will never go backward. We are, indeed, ready to  honor our commitments under the Gaza-Jericho first agreement.  We want the Palestinians to lead and run their own lives in the  self-rule territories. But the Palestinians and the world must  know that Israel now is not speaking with one voice. We are  divided. The government wants true peace, but it only  represents one segment of the people. There are other segments  who do not believe and do not want peace. They believe that God  has given the sons of Israel this entire territory and that the  Palestinians have no place among them. But thank God, they are  not a majority. We are the majority, but their voice is louder.  This is the kind of conflict we have in our society.    [Al-Hinnawi] Very well, but what is your and your party's  position concerning this conflict?    [Aloni] Our policy is clear. I agree to give up all the  territories occupied following the 1967 war. The Palestinians  have a right to set up their own state in the West Bank and  Gaza, but this is not the government's viewpoint, because it  knows that the Israelis are living in fear. Some of the fears  are justified and some are not. For 15 years, the previous  Likud governments continued to emphasize to the people the need  to not trust anyone and that this justifies the occupation.  This is the reason why the extremists brand us as traitors and  agents of the Arabs. We suffer from Israeli extremism the same  way you suffer from Arab extremism.    [Al-Hinnawi] But aren't you concerned by the eroding support  for the peace agreement with the Palestinians and the Likud's  sweeping victory in the municipal elections, particularly since  some of the constituencies have been Labor strongholds for  decades?    [Aloni] Actually, I am not disturbed. The erosion you are  referring to following the signing of the agreement is natural,  particularly with the continued confrontations in the occupied  territories. This week, support for the agreement started to  return to what it was the day after the agreement was signed.  There are 148 in favor and 146 against [not further explained].  I expect the number of supporters to increase in the coming  weeks. As for the Likud's victory in the municipal elections,  this has nothing to do with the agreement. Municipal elections  are about individuals, not policies, and in these elections the  Israeli voter gives his vote to the person he thinks will  provide the best services to the city or the village he lives in.    [Al-Hinnawi] What do you think is the real problem behind  the  Israeli Government's insistence on controlling the crossing  points between Egypt and Gaza and Jordan and Gaza? What is the  reason for shrinking the Jericho area to be given to the  Palestinians? Don't you see that this insistence on the part of  the government will harm the chances of peace?    [Aloni] The fact is that the Israeli public now cannot agree  to leave the question of borders outside Israel's control,  because the time is not yet ripe for this. Confidence must be  built first. In addition, the Declaration of Principles did not  include any reference to these points. I understand Yasir  'Arafat's position. He wants to gain as much as he can for his  people after all these difficult years. The Israeli Government  is surprised every day by 'Arafat's increasing demands. The  same is true for Jericho. Under the agreement, we agreed to  hand over the city of Jericho and the camps around it to  'Arafat, but now he is demanding the Jordan Valley, although the  agreement absolutely did not mention it. No one among the  Israelis thought of abandoning the area north of the Dead Sea  and up to the Damya bridge during this stage.    [Al-Hinnawi] Does your party hold that same view?    [Aloni] If it were up to me I would have immediately agreed  to relinquish all the occupied Palestinian territories to the  Palestinian people and let them establish their own state. But  I am a member of the government and bound by their policy,  although my views are well known. But this is what will happen  eventually. Therefore I say to 'Arafat: Be patient just a  little more. You have been patient for a long time and will not  wait more than you already have. Let us proceed one step at a  time. We have to be realistic and act according to the signed  agreement.    [Al-Hinnawi] News reports, particularly those carried by  REUTER, have said that Israel has presented to Egypt a map  detailing the huge wealth hidden under the sands of Sinai,  including the uranium used in making atomic bombs. As minister  of sciences, what do you think of these reports?    [Aloni] Your report is correct, although it is not complete.  We indeed presented this map to Egypt as a sign of the goodwill  and confidence in relations between the two sides. What was not  published was that we discovered that Egypt has a similar map  and that it knows everything about Sinai's wealth.    [Al-Hinnawi] Reports say that Israel has actually reached a  peace agreement with Jordan but it has not been announced as  yet. What is the truth about these reports, and what is the  latest on talks with Syria?    [Aloni] An initial agreement has indeed been reached with  Jordan. There are no problems with Jordan. But King Husayn is  waiting for progress in negotiations with Syria before he  announces the agreement. As for Syria, I believe that we have  reached common ground and that talks will resume very soon. We  are willing to make everything possible to reach an agreement  with Syria.    [Al-Hinnawi] What about the problem of settlements in Golan?    [Aloni] I admit it is a problem. It was caused by the fact  that the previous Labor government allowed settlers to live in  Golan. So, the government has made some commitments to the  settlers. The situation is different in the West Bank  settlements, which were built with the Likud's permission. But  we will find a solution. We should not forget that when the  Labor government permitted the building of settlements in the  Golan, the international situation was totally different from  what it is today. The Soviet Union was a superpower and it was  furnishing Syria with weapons. The situation is different now  and I believe that we will find a solution. I would like to  tell Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad that he has a great  opportunity to go down in history as the leader who contributed  to the establishment of peace in the region. Israel is prepared  to relinquish Golan if al-Asad is willing to establish real  peace.    [Al-Hinnawi] How do you envision regional cooperation after  the establishment of peace, particularly since there has been  much talk lately about a Middle East market?    [Aloni] I believe that the beginning should be something  like  the Benelux cooperation among Belgium, Netherlands, and  Luxembourg. Cooperation can start among Israel, Palestine,  Jordan, and Syria. This can later be followed by cooperation  involving the Middle East states similar to the European Common  Market. I think that this will be the picture in the end. As  minister of communications, it pleases me to say that there are  telephone lines linking Israel with all Arab states. The  citizen in any Arab state can pick up the phone and contact  Israel directly. This was inconceivable just a few years ago.  I believe that Egyptian diplomacy has played a great role in  bringing views closer so that peace and prosperity can prevail  in the region.</p>

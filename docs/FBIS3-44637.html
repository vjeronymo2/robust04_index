How to carry out macroeconomic  regulation and control? People do not have completely identical  viewpoints on these questions. Hence, many of the problems  occurring in the current macroeconomic management have something  to do with this situation.  <H5>  I. The Necessity of Macroeconomic Regulation and Control </H5>   History and reality prove that market economy needs  macroeconomic regulation and control. Capitalist market economy  has existed for several hundred years. So has macroeconomic  regulation and control, though it varies in scope and degree.  What needs our special emphasis is that macroeconomic  regulation and control in capitalist market economy has not  weakened, instead it has become stronger and stronger as history  has developed to its present stage. The newly emerging  industrial countries since World War II lay greater emphasis on  and pay more attention to the role of macroeconomic regulation  and control than the old-line capitalist countries, and have  consequently achieved remarkable results. The cause lies in  several points: 1) The problem of overall economic balance,  that is, the balance between aggregate demand and aggregate  supply; 2) the problem of big economic structures such as the  proportion between industry and agriculture, the proportion  between various industrial departments, the relationship between  industry and trade, and the relationship between production  development and construction of infrastructure; 3) the problem  of competition on an equal basis, that is, opposing monopoly and  maintaining fair competition on an equal footing; 4) the problem  of the relationship between equality and efficiency, that is,  maintaining social justice and equality and preventing  over-polarization while ensuring a certain efficiency; 5) the  problem of public services or social consumption, such as basic  public utilities, elementary education, public health and  national defense and security; 6) the problem of the natural and  social environment in economic development, such as the  ecological balance, resource protection, environmental  protection, and the protection of citizens' lives and property.  The solution to all these problems depends mainly on the  government's macroeconomic regulation and control rather than  mainly or completely on the spontaneous acts of enterprises and  individuals under the influence of the market mechanism. It is  a general law that market economy needs macroeconomic regulation  and control, and socialist market economy is no exception.    Why should market economy pay attention to and strengthen  macroeconomic regulation and control under the condition of  socialism? This is determined by its own characteristics.  First, public economy, especially state-owned economy, plays a  leading role in social economy. It needs to concentrate all  social forces to carry out overall, major economic construction  that concerns the national economy. This not only requires the  strengthening of macroeconomic regulation and control, but also  makes it possible to carry out macroeconomic regulation and  control. Second, it is to eliminate poverty and move toward  prosperity together. Being the inherent requirement of the  socialist system, it sets a higher demand for the relationship  between efficiency and equality than in other countries that  practice market economy. Consequently it will depend more on  macroeconomic regulation and control over the state's policy for  income distribution to solve this problem. Third, the  transition from a highly centralized planned economy to a  socialist market economy. It is a long process of exploration.  It is not possible to depend solely on decentralizing powers to  enterprises to achieve this aim. It should depend on  macroeconomic regulation and control and powerful administrative  interference by the government. Fourth, in the process of  modernization from a big agricultural country which depends on  its 800 million peasants to feed the nation, it is neither  possible nor necessary for us to follow the old road of  long-term development taken by countries in Europe or America.  Instead, we should take a quicker road of development with  Chinese characteristics. This requires that the government play  a greater and more forceful role.  <H3>  II. The Content and Scope of Macroeconomic Regulation and  Control </H3>   Planning, finance and banking are the three important  aspects  of macroeconomic regulation and control by the state in market  economy.    1. Planning. Capitalist countries also make plans. However,  plans made by different countries vary in form and scope. Some  newly emerging industrial countries practice that type of  economy which attaches great importance to planning, with the  government playing a guiding role. What we want to do in the  practice of market economy is to give up the old system of  planned economy thoroughly. But it is by no means the case that  planning is not needed. We need to replace highly centralized  mandatory planning with guidance and policy-oriented planning.  The stress of the state plan lies in determining the strategic  goals for the national economy and social development in a  rational way, doing a good job in economic development  forecasts, control over total supply and demand as well as  programing of major structures and layout of productive forces,  focusing necessary financial and material resources to carry out  major construction, and using economic levers comprehensively to  promote the long-term, stable and coordinated growth of the  national economy. Practice has proved that this kind of  planning is highly necessary and workable.    2. Finance. It is the main means of state macroeconomic  regulation and control. By means of financial revenue, the  state can regulate the aggregate social supply and demand. It  can also regulate the economic structure, regional structure and  social distribution and redistribution. At present, the  principal problems in our finance are: Revenue levying is not  efficient, while its payment is far from sufficient. There have  been great losses in taxes. The relationship between central  finance and local finance has not been straightened out. The  growth of central financial revenue lags far behind that of the  national economy, being unable to meet the needs of state  macroeconomic regulation and control. In expenditure, economic  expenditure is not clearly separated from construction  expenditure, with each crowding out the other. Consequently the  efficiency of utilization is low. To solve these problems, it  is necessary to practice a unified taxation system as well as  the system whereby enterprises pay tax plus a percentage of  profits, to strengthen supervision of tax collection by law, to  practice the system of tax sharing and to increase the  proportion of tax revenue going to the central government. It  is also necessary to produce dual budgets and handle well the  relationship between feeding the people and construction. What  needs pointing out especially is that the state power of  financial control and its use is the material basis for the  realization of macroeconomic regulation and control. Power of  financial control chiefly refers to the proportion of national  revenue in the GNP and the proportion of central revenue in the  GNP. Since the reform and opening up to the world these two  proportions have decreased quickly. The proportion of central  revenue has decreased by a large margin. Consequently it makes  it difficult for state macroeconomic regulation and control to  achieve good results due to the loss of effective financial  support. It also makes it difficult to carry out a lot of  reform measures (including price, wage, and other reforms)  smoothly and in a timely manner due to the lack of financial  backup. Some people of insight in the West have long since  discovered that China is a country with the most diverse  financial resources and the weakest central finance control  capacity in the world. It is because of a solid financial basis  that those Western countries that practice market economy, like  the United States and Japan, can more effectively realize  government macroeconomic regulation and control. This point is  worth our learning.    3. Banking. It is the economic means and measure for state  macroeconomic regulation and control. The government controls  the overall supply and demand for currency, the total scale of  credit investment and the aggregate import and export amounts by  way of monetary policies and measures such as issuance of basic  currency, credit loans, interest rates and exchange rates. At  the same time it affects the microbehavior of enterprises. At  present, the main problems existing in our banking sector are:  The central bank, with no independence or definite functions,  finds it difficult to establish its authority; the coexistence  of the policy-oriented function and business-oriented function  in specialized banks leads to inaccurate action; there is too  much intervention in local banks by governments at various  levels; the dual exchange rate system confuses import and export  trade. The ways to solve them are: Establish an independent,  authoritative central bank as soon as possible; organize and  establish state policy-oriented banks; change specialized banks  into real commercial banks; limit illegal intervention in banks  by local government with laws and polices; change the exchange  rate system and gradually practice the system of a free exchange  rate. What needs pointing out in particular is that the  confusion that has occurred in the present monetary system has a  lot to do with the above-mentioned problems. Moreover, it also  accounts for the fact that banks and monetary institutions get  involved directly or indirectly in the purchase and sale of  shares and securities, real estate business and non-monetary  profit-making activities. There are two types of relationship  between banking and the securities sector. One is the American  model, that is, banks and securities are established separately.  The other is the West European type, that is, banks can run  securities business at the same time. As for the relationship  between banks and enterprises, there are three types. One is  the American type, that is, banks are strictly separated from  enterprises. Neither can hold shares in the other. Another is  the German type, that is, banks can hold shares in enterprises,  but not the other way round. Still another is the Japanese  type, that is, both enterprises and banks can be mutual  shareholders. Each type has its own merits and demerits. As  there are no definite responsibilities or relationship between  the central bank and specialized banks and between  policy-oriented banks and commercial banks in our country and  the laws concerning banking institutions and their operations  are not perfect, for a certain period of time banks and monetary  institutions should be forbidden to get involved in securities  exchange and other activities of non- monetary investment and  management. Otherwise, it will be really difficult to establish  normal order in the monetary market.    The contents of macroeconomic regulation and control in  socialist market economy also include industrial policy, price  management, infrastructure construction, state asset management,  etc. Through the formulation of industrial policies, the state  provides enterprises with guidance in the choice of industries  for investment, quickens industrial adjustment and replacement  and promotes the upgrading and modernization of the industrial  structure. Price management is one of the important functions  of the government. Price reform should be carried out in order  and step by step under government control, especially when price  relationships are not yet straightened out. Even later, after  price relationships are basically straightened out, prices of  some important products concerning the national economy and the  people's livelihood should be controlled directly by the state.  As for the construction of large-scale infrastructure, major  projects like communications hubs and city public utilities,  which require big investment with long construction periods and  low profit, and even losses, should mainly depend on investment  from the government. State assets need government management all  the more.  <H3>  III. Problems in the Present Macroeconomic Regulation and  Control </H3>   At present, the main factors affecting the efficiency of our  macroeconomic regulation and control are: 1) The basic numbers  are not clear. There exists the phenomenon of "holding  something back," that is, no matter whether it is industrial  output value, investment scale, financial revenue, or enterprise  or personal income, a rather big leeway is left when reporting  it to the higher authorities. And there exists another  phenomenon in undeveloped areas, that is, targets, output,  production value, revenue etc. are exaggerated; they are  "inflated" to varying degrees. It is not a bad thing for  localities, enterprises and individuals to store wealth.  However, the problem is that the state has no idea how big the  leeway left by the localities is, how much falsity there is in  their reports and how large the margin is between the state  statistics and the actual figures. It is easy to make mistakes  in macro-decisionmaking because of unclear base numbers and  judgments based on unreliable data. 2) The means for  macroeconomic regulation and control are not perfect and  effective. The ways and means of economic management are many,  but few are really effective. Scale management is still one of  the chief means we now use to control aggregate quantities in  society. However, scale limits have been broken time and again  both in investment in fixed assets and in credit. According to  estimates by people in financial circles, actual credit loans  completed are about one-fourth higher than the reported figure.  The over-scale investment and low standard in duplicate  construction of quite a number of localities directly affect the  growth of the overall efficiency of the national economy. It is  difficult to realize the efficiency of the macroeconomic  regulation and control because we have not found a means for  scale management that meets the demands of market economy. 3)  The power and responsibilities of both the central and local  governments are not definite; neither is there any clear  division of work between them. The present situation is that  the lower the administrative level, the greater its ability to  guide and control the economy, whereas the higher the  administrative level, the weaker its ability to guide and  control. 4) Orders are not obeyed nor prohibitions observed.  There is a saying: The experience of success gained by local  authorities is: "Do not do whatever the central government asks  you to do and do whatever it asks you not to do." If things go  on like this, the central government will lose its authority  while local governments go their own way. It will be impossible  to give full play to the advantage put forward by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping, that is: "Socialism focuses its strength to do big  things." It also directly affects the overall efficiency of the  national economy. To deal with the above- mentioned problems,  emphasis should be laid on doing a good job in the construction  of the following four systems:    First, build a scientific, national economic statistics  monitoring system that meets the needs of the healthy  development of market economy, strengthen macromonitoring of  basic statistics work and improve the scientific reliability and  accuracy of statistics monitoring in order to reduce errors in  macro-decisionmaking.    Second, build a sound macroeconomic regulation and control  system that meets the needs of the development of socialist  market economy. The various economic levers should be adjusted  in accordance with the complexity and particularity of the  targets of regulation during the transition of the economic  system so as to ensure timely, appropriate and effective  adjustment. Especially at present, we should intensify the  application of financial means. As the present financial system  is far behind this need, the step of reforming the financial  system should be quickened.    Third, establish and perfect as soon as possible a  responsibility-power division system, divide the financial power  and administrative power reasonably between the central and  local governments, and set a definite division of work and  responsibilities so that each exercises its function to do a  good job in whatever it should take care of.    Fourth, speed up the establishment of a system to guarantee  effective implementation of the macropolicies, strengthen the  construction of a legislative and law-enforcement contingent,  strengthen supervision, and administer according to law so as to  maintain the inviolability of state policies and regulations and  thoroughly change the situation in which laws are neither  observed nor seriously enforced.</p>

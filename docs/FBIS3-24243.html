Taran: "The Stockholders of Tatpromstroybank </F> Did Not Miscalculate"]    [Text] The news that the joint-stock industrial  construction bank of development of the Republic of Tatarstan  (Tatpromstroybank) was among the top 100 banks of Russia for the  second time in a row (it is the only representative of Tatarstan  financial institutions on the rating chart) arrived just in  time--a conference of the stockholders of Tatpromstroybank  convened yesterday at which the results of last year's operation  were summarized and reference points for the current year were  charted.    Rafael Mingazov, chairman of the bank's board of directors,  had no reason to be ashamed in front of the founders and  stockholders when presenting his report on the work  accomplished. The bank's balance sheet turnover, total assets,  and credit deposits increased fivefold. While bank profits grew  twice as fast as the volume of credit extension, increasing by a  factor of 11. In the words of R. Mingazov, the bank succeeded in  achieving this primarily by accelerating monetary turnover, not  by setting high rates for credit.    The reliability and prestige of Tatpromstroybank is  confirmed  by the fact that more than 2,000 enterprises and entrepreneurs  became its clients last year and 17,000 individuals became  depositors.    As we know, it was decided at the previous stockholder  conference to increase the bank's authorized capital to R1.5  billion. In July of last year this task was accomplished, and  towards the end of 1993 the authorized capital of  Tatpromstroybank had grown to R3 billion. The bank directors  have proposed to the stockholders that the level of authorized  capital be raised to R10 billion, especially since the Russian  Federation Central Bank adopted a resolution establishing the  minimum amount of capital at R2 billion, to be increased over  the course of five years to R10 billion.    Tatpromstroybank's borrowers are predominantly state  enterprises. They account for more than 63 percent of the  credits, mainly short-term credits. Long-term credits increased  fourfold in terms of absolute amount, but their rate of growth  decreased. This is explained by virtue of the overall crisis in  the economy and the striving of bank directors to accelerate the  turnover rate of resources. The share of long-term credits was  reduced from 10 to 7 percent.    Nonetheless, R. Mingazov states that the bank saddled itself  with obligations to distribute long-term resources for providing  credits to the Yelabuga Motor Vehicle Plant and defense  enterprises amounting to over R12 billion. The bank's income  from these transactions is entirely minimal, however--3 percent  annual interest.    In order to soften the blow inflicted upon enterprises by  the  nonpayments crisis, Tatpromstroybank has established direct  corresponding accounts with 16 banks of the near abroad and 15  of the far abroad, which include financial enterprises of the  United States, Germany, England, Switzerland, Turkey, and Korea.  In order to regulate the use of ready cash in 1994, it is  planned to introduce plastic cards for obtaining cash through  automatic teller machines.</p>

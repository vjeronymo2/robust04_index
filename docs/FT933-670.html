			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Observer: Maurizio who? After almost two years of trading insults, Investcorp and Maurizio Gucci have struck a deal, the most intriguing part of which has Gucci emerging as an adviser to the Bahrain-based merchant bank. In July, Investcorp, which had 50 per cent of the shares in the luxury goods company, instigated legal action against Gucci, who had management control and the remaining stake; it alleged mismanagement and breach of contract by dint of his having pledged his shares to a bank. Not the most propitious start for an enduring relationship, so the post may therefore simply be a face-saving exercise. So, if Gucci is not to be too preoccupied achieving synergies between Investcorp's growing clutch of luxury goods companies, what will he do now that he is some Dollars 170m the richer? Callers to Gucci's plush Milan headquarters yesterday could be forgiven for thinking they had been misrouted. Barely 48 hours after the ink was dry, the former chairman appeared little more than a memory at the firm which bears his name. The persistent might now try St Moritz, that repository of idle multi-millionaires, where Gucci maintains a home. While the skiing may not have started yet, it's not a bad place for counting banknotes.</p>

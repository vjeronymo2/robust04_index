			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: A new relevance for an old set of values - The changing Japanese market While Japan endures its worst slump in share prices and turnover since the 1960s, international investors might get some comfort from the fact that Japanese equity valuations are finally coming into line with their overseas counterparts. In the past, investors in Japanese equities were forced to disregard financial ratios due to the gross share price inflation in Japan. But now that the asset inflation factor of the late 1980s has been eliminated by the squeeze on liquidity, international valuations have become relevant. The Nikkei average has fallen 56 per cent from its peak in the late 1980s, and its price/earnings (p/e) ratio has fallen from 75 to 38. With Japanese shares at their cheapest since the early 1980s, investors have a chance to pick up blue chips at bargain-basement prices. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel in Tokyo, says that blue chip manufacturers are now on a multiple of 35, down from a peak of 66, and compared with 22 a decade ago. The consolidated p/e ratio for Sharp has fallen to 28 from an all-time high of 35, while the multiple for Matsushita Electric Industrial has declined from 20 to 16. Current levels indicate that Tokyo share prices have returned to a more normal relationship with overseas stock markets. The p/e ratio for the Nikkei average now stands at 38 compared to 23 in April 1982, while that of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 has risen from 8 to 25. However, Japanese p/e ratios remain distorted by several factors, such as the low liquidity created by Japan's stable shareholding structure - some 40 per cent of stocks are believed to be held by long-term investors. Strategic equity stakes are held by companies belonging to the same group - 'keiretsu', or business partners. Main relationship banks are also stable shareholders, as are life insurance companies, which usually manage the pension fund of the company in which they have a stake. Individuals own only 20 per cent of all listed companies, while corporations, including financial institutions, own more than 70 per cent. Cross-shareholding distorts the stock market's p/e, which is calculated by dividing the total capitalisation by the total net earnings. Since most listed companies own shares in other listed companies, it would not take the total capitalisation to buy the whole market. For example, when buying shares in Matsushita Electric Industrial, one would also be buying into its listed affiliates. The total capitalisation of the Tokyo stock market is estimated at Y275,000bn (Dollars 2,043bn). However, this figure is inflated by 40 per cent, since only 60 per cent of the market is free to float. Accounting differences are also cited as a reason for high p/e ratios in Japan. Japanese companies tend to understate earnings due to their accelerated depreciation policy. Furthermore, Japanese companies are only required to report consolidated figures if subsidiaries contribute more than 10 per cent of group assets, sales and net income. As profits can be manipulated by shifting income between subsidiaries, and to special reserves, earnings figures are not always reliable. Some of the accounting differences can be narrowed by using consolidated income instead of parent earnings. This will increase earnings, the denominator for the market p/e, by some 20 per cent. With some of the 'distortion' factors stripped out, the p/e for the Tokyo market works out at just under 20. The figure remains open to debate since cross-shareholdings can improve business relationships, and profitability. In some cases, quantifying accounting distortions is virtually impossible, since earnings manipulation does not appear in company statements. Advocates of the price to book (p/b) ratio - the share price relative to net asset value - say that Japanese companies look attractive by this measure. The number of shares whose p/b ratios are less than 1 has increased as a result of the stock market's slump. The consolidated p/b ratio for Matsushita is now 0.8, and 0.91 for Hitachi. Some analysts argue that since Japanese companies do not revalue their assets, the p/b ratio only reflects the share price movements. Other commonly used valuation methods are market capitalisation to sales, and price to cash flow. Using such measures, Japanese industrial blue chips appear to be fairly valued compared with overseas counterparts. According to James Capel, the market cap/sales ratio for Honda is 0.3, compared with 0.2 for Ford Motor and 0.3 for BMW. The price/cash flow ratio for Toshiba is 5, while General Electric is 11.9 and GEC is 8. However, with investor confidence severely battered, and evidence of a slowing economy adding to the gloom, valuations may look even cheaper in a few months' time. If the economy takes longer than expected to recover, even blue chip manufacturing companies face the risk of a further downward revision in sales, profits and cashflow.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Murdoch in boardroom coup at Antena 3 MR RUPERT Murdoch, the Australian-born media group owner, yesterday joined forces with a Spanish magazine publisher and Mr Mario Conde, president of the Banesto banking and industrial group, in a boardroom coup at one of Spain's commercial television channels, Antena 3 TV. A board meeting in Madrid yesterday elected Mr Antonio Asensio, president of the Grupo Zeta publishing group, chairman of Antena 3 after the resignation of Mr Javier Godo, the Count of Godo, who founded the channel nearly three years ago and who is owner of Spain's oldest newspaper, La Vanguardia. Mr Murdoch and Mr Conde were also elected to the board. The move came after Mr Murdoch and Mr Asensio formed a joint venture and bought up to 25 per cent of Antena 3 from minority shareholders. Mr Conde is separately understood to have bought a further 20 per cent of the channel. The stealthy stock purchases, reportedly worth some Dollars 100m, were financed by Banesto. Antena 3 owns the daily newspaper, Ya, which circulates mainly in Madrid. Mr Murdoch's holding company, News International, has held a 25 per cent stake in Grupo Zeta for some time. Zeta bid for and failed to win one of the three private TV licences the Spanish government awarded in 1989. The government has to approve the new ownership and while it was said to be irritated by the coup - it views Mr Conde as a potentially dangerous conservative political rival to the ruling socialist party - officials at the prime minister's office said the new shareholdings would be respected. Earlier this year, Mr Conde signed an agreement with Mr Godo under which Banesto would take stakes in Antena 3 TV and La Vanguardia. But after pressure from the government and journalists on La Vanguardia, he reneged on the deal.</p>

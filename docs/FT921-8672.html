			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / The week that was: Seven days the Tories would rather forget This has been a ghastly week for the Conservatives. They have been obliged to abandon hopes of a recovery in the economy during the first half of this year. Ministers now accept that there will be few signs of an end to the recession before election day. Yet the game is not over; indeed it has hardly begun. Assuming an election on April 9, there are still nearly eight weeks of politicking to go. That gives the Tories time in which to press home their advantage as the party in government. They will need to use the opportunity well. On Thursday three successive items of depressing economic news fell like hammer-blows on Conservative morale. First, seasonally adjusted unemployment rose in January by 53,000, nearly twice the anticipated figure. It was the biggest monthly increase since August; the previous downward trend was reversed. The worst-affected areas seemed to be in marginal constituencies at present held by the government. Second, it was announced that some 75,000 homes had been repossessed by mortgage lenders last year. The number of householders in arrears with their mortgages is still climbing. Many of those affected are likely to be new entrants to the housing market, tempted by the government's promotion of home ownership during the second half of the 1980s, and most particularly by the Lawson binge of 1988. The third piece of bad news was that manufacturers had cut their capital spending by 15 per cent compared with the previous 12 months. This was followed by yesterday's figures indicating that factory output fell by 1.2 per cent between the third and fourth quarters of last year, and 5 per cent over 1991 as a whole. The government now has to acknowledge that this is turning out to be the longest recession since the war. That is the economists' technical term. I would call it a depression. As this seeps into the public consciousness it could, in theory, result in a melting away of support for the Conservative party. That could put Mr Neil Kinnock into 10 Downing Street, for while Labour might not pick up sufficient additional votes to win the election, the Tories could easily drop enough to lose their majority. So much for the gloomy side of the Conservative story. There is, however, reason for the government to take heart. Average earnings for those in work  -nine-tenths of the labour force - have increased by about 7 1/4 per cent. The retail price index rose by only 4.1 per cent in the year to January, principally as a result of the slump. The 3 per cent addition to real income is not uniformly spread but it will have had a positive effect on most voters' pockets. Mortgages whose rates are revised annually will have come down in January and February; historically such movements have always increased Conservative support. More to the point, the government has it in its power to buy our votes, or try to. The general expectation is of a half-point cut in interest rates, probably around the time of the Budget. That could be followed by a tax-cutting bonanza, with a penny or two off the standard rate of income tax combined and an increase in the tax thresholds, the whole to be festooned with individual goodies for particular interest-groups. A month ago such a Budget would have been described as a shameless piece of political chicanery, which would be correct. Four weeks from now a giveaway Budget would be defended by government supporters (and businessmen who fear Labour) as a reasonable relaxation of fiscal constraints at this time in the economic cycle. Another billion or four on the public sector borrowing requirement is easy to shrug off, if it saves high-earners from Labour's proposed 59 per cent rate of personal taxation. This is not to say that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will necessarily live down to the worst expectations of him. His record to date suggests the opposite. His monetary and fiscal rectitude since he took office last November match the performance of the then Mr Roy Jenkins, who lost the 1970 election for Labour by staying virtuous to the very end. Anyway, the political advantage of an irresponsibly generous tax-cutting budget is not clear. Labour could spell out what it would do with the money saved by not making the income tax cut. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, is preparing a shadow budget, whose effect as a counterblow is unpredictable. But then - you never know - the Tory manifesto might surprise everyone and actually offer some radical policies. Meanwhile, we must await a decent run of opinion polls to see whether the political stalemate has been broken. If there is to be a Labour government with an overall working majority Mr Kinnock's party needs to start piling up significant opinion poll leads today, and hold them until polling day. There is no sign of a wave of enthusiasm for Labour of the magnitude required to give the party such a sustained lead. On the contrary, the biggest question of 1992 politics is why Labour is not 10 points ahead. The answer is partly that Mr John Major is more popular than Mr Kinnock, partly that the Tories are still the party most trusted to get the economy right, and partly that Labour's me-too campaign has failed to gather momentum. The polls will probably resettle at the break-even 40 per cent Tory, 40 per cent Labour, 15 per cent Liberal Democrat at which they have stood for the past couple of months. The most likely outcome of that is a hung parliament with the Conservatives the largest party. Then the game would really begin.</p>

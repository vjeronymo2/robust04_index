			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC STORM BRINGS AREA CHANCE OF RAIN  </P> <P> A small Pacific storm will bring cloudy skies and a 50% chance of showers to  Orange County today, but provide little relief from the drought, the National  Weather Service predicted Monday.  </P> <P> "There is a small system moving through. However, it is not going to give us  what we need," a weather service spokesman said. "This certainly won't affect  the drought. We could catch up later this year, you never know."  </P> <P> The front moving through Southern California this morning could bring a  quarter-inch of rain along the coast and one-half to three-fourths of an inch  in the mountain areas. Snow is predicted above 5,000 feet.  </P> <P> As the front moves east into the deserts, forecasters say, the chance of  showers will diminish from 50% to 30%, leaving partly cloudy skies tonight.  Clear, cool and windy weather is expected Wednesday.  </P> <P> Lows will be in the upper 40s except for some inland valleys, which could get  temperatures as low as 35. Highs will be in the low 60s. Winds up to 15 m.p.h.  will come out of the south and shift to west-to-northwest with velocities of 20  to 30 m.p.h. by this afternoon.  </P> <P> Nationally, a low-pressure system stretched along the East Coast from Canada  through New York, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania and Maryland into Virginia,  bringing rain and raising temperatures into the 40s and 50s. Intermittent rain  and fog clouded parts of the Washington area.  </P> <P> Light snow and freezing rain made end-of-the-holiday traveling hazardous in the  Great Lakes region, the upper Ohio Valley and parts of the northern Atlantic  coast.  </P> <P> A cold front brought rain to much of the South, where temperatures were  generally mild. Meanwhile, a dry air mass covering much of New Mexico,  Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana drove temperatures down overnight  Sunday and early Monday, to the teens in the Texas Panhandle and the 40s in the  Rio Grande Valley.  </P></p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Technology: Multimedia beats a path to Hollywood How would you like to play golf on the Augusta National course, with Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer as your partners? They will be like old friends, exchanging comments with you on the tilt of the green. You will be able to do this without stirring from your arm chair and with no more exertion than flicking a few switches on a remote device. Or choose a film from a catalogue of thousands and arrange to view it after dinner. Order a pizza if you don't want to cook tonight. Welcome to the world of 'interactive multimedia' - a confluence of computer, communications and consumer electronics technologies that promises to transform your television set into a multi-functional entertainment, information and communications device. This is the vision that is spurring executives from US computer companies to beat a path to Hollywood. International Business Machines and Time Warner are said to be talking about a joint venture. John Sculley, chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, is exploring synergies with the movie industry. The huge potential of interactive TV is also the driving force behind AT&amp;T's plans to enter the digital satellite broadcasting equipment market and forge alliances with cable television companies. There are also start-up companies with big ambitions. TV Answer is developing a system that would allow customers to pay bills and order products. USA Video is testing a system that can send a film from a 'video library' to a customer's TV over phone lines. Interactive multimedia is not a new idea. Hardware and software companies have been talking about it for years but failed to identify a mass market. Industry debate has focused upon technical standards and whether the personal computer or the television should be the 'platform' for multimedia. Breathing fresh air into these long-winded arguments is a growing consensus that a relatively simple application of multimedia technology may be the key to creating mass-market appeal. 'Movies on demand', a service providing consumers with the opportunity to view at any time a film of their choice from a catalogue of thousands, is now seen as the 'Trojan Horse' that will bring multimedia into the home. By providing the convenience of any-time viewing and a far broader selection than the local video store, cable and broadcast television services aim to steal a large portion of the Dollars 14bn (Pounds 8bn) annual US video rental and sales market. The critical technology for 'movies on demand' is digital signal processing  -the technology at the core of other multimedia applications. To pipe thousands of movies through a cable television network, or broadcast them via satellites to regional cable operators, the signals must be compressed, without loss of quality. At the receiving end the signal must be decoded to provide a high-quality image. Once digital signal processors are in place, other applications become possible. These might include an electronic library, video games or educational programmes. Fibre optic cables that can carry a bigger load of signals than conventional copper cables may also play a part in bringing interactive multimedia to a mass audience. Switching systems, much like those used to direct traffic on telephone networks, will also be needed. Satellite broadcasting may also play a role, although in the US, where 60m homes are connected to cable television systems, direct broadcast is not expected to be the primary method of delivering interactive TV signals to the home. There are potential stumbling blocks to the development of interactive multimedia services. Although most of the technology challenges have been met, the cost of a signal processing device that would sit on top of the TV set is prohibitive - over Dollars 1,000. In the US, regulatory issues might also prevent telephone or cable TV companies from expanding into each others territory. Yet the momentum building behind interactive multimedia seems unstoppable. The advent of digital high-definition television, in the mid-1990s, with sharper pictures and clearer sound, can only accelerate the trend.</p>

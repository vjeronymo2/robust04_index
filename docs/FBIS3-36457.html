Lower Chamber Expects Dubinin  and Gerashchenko Today"]    [Excerpts] Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin and  Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko have been invited to  address the State Duma today. This was confirmed yesterday by  deputies from the Agrarian Party, who held a press conference  "On the performance of the agro-industrial sector in 1994."  [passage omitted]    As the press conference was under way, the government's  presidium was holding a meeting at the White House to consider a  decree of the same name. Gennadiy Kulik, deputy chairman of the  State Duma's budget committee and former agricultural minister  of the USSR and the RSFSR, who had just returned from the White  House, told his colleagues and the press some details about the  meeting.    Two drafts -- from the Agricultural Ministry and the Economy  Ministry -- were submitted to the government for consideration.  According to Mr. Kulik, although there are significant  differences between the drafts, it was nonetheless decided to  merge them into one document to be agreed upon. Mr. Kulik said  that the Agricultural Ministry's draft required the state to buy  100 percent of grain, oil-bearing crops, sugar beets, meat,  milk, and wool to be produced in 1994. The government agreed in  principle, but an argument broke out about the expected amounts  of the produce.    Viktor Gerashchenko did not agree, however, with the  suggestion that the repayment of government debts to the  agro-industrial sector should be dragged out as long as  possible, and said that they would be repaid in the first  quarter of this year, Mr. Kulik said. Agricultural enterprises  will get a total of 1.3 trillion rubles; although they insisted  that the sum be indexed, however, they did not manage to push  the idea through. Nor did they receive the desired credits to  the tune of 8.5 trillion rubles in the first six months  (including 4.2 trillion to pay for fuel) to ensure the spring  fieldwork and to carry the livestock through the winter period.  The agro-industrial sector will get only 1.2 trillion in  credits in the first quarter.    So, Viktor Chernomyrdin has so far fallen short of  satisfying  agricultural appetites in full, although the "agrarians" trust  him and think that "the castlings in the government have made it  possible to forgo the question of no-confidence in it." This  was also stated at yesterday's press conference.</p>

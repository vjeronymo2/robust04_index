			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Increased losses at Waverley Cameron An inadequacy of working capital following a substantial reduction in its banking facilities was cited by Waverley Cameron as the reason for heavy trading losses in the year to end-March. The net loss before tax of this office equipment and stationery group grew to Pounds 1.43m, against Pounds 617,000 last time. Turnover fell from Pounds 45.9m to Pounds 26.9m and losses per share increased from 1.56p to 2.32p. Again there is no dividend. The company said that the withdrawal of its banking facilities had left it with no option other than to cease trading in its BTS subsidiary, which has since been placed in administrative receivership by its bank. Also, in order to ensure continuation of facilities for the remainder of the group, Partners, its stationery retailing subsidiary, had been sold for Pounds 2.2m and RMG, which covered the office products side, was sold for about Pounds 2.9m. This disposal was largely responsible for an extraordinary charge of Pounds 5.15m. Having completed these two disposals the directors intend to concentrate on developing the group's building and property activities.</p>

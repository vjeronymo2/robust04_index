In its latest issue, the bilingual weekly referred to the  crimes committed by Jalal Talebani's Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan (PUK) against members of the Islamic movement in  northern Iraq.    According to the weekly, the PUK "attacks were seen as an  attempt by Talebani, under the aegis of the U.S. and its allies,  to squeeze groups who have no sympathy towards his pro-Western  approach."    Noting that the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) has remained  neutral in the conflict, it said there remains no doubt "about  the meddling by U.S., Britain and France whose troops are  serving their national interests in Iraq's northern no-fly zone."    It referred to Talebani's Washington visit in 1992 and his  talks about establishing an opposition government in the  northern no-fly zone.    Stressing that Washington's policy is to get rid of Kurdish  groups, it said "the West makes use of Kurds as a leverage to  put pressure on Saddam Husayn's government and influence  developments in Iraq.    "To any analyst there is an important question unanswered.  If there are troops to protect Kurds from attacks by Saddam's  army in the northern no-fly zone for humanitarian reasons, why  are there no troops to protect Shiite Muslims in marshlands in  southern Iraq for the same reason?"    It said that Washington considers Muslims as troublesome and  dangerous for America's interests and perhaps for this reason  the anti-Iraq alliance abandoned the idea to topple Saddam's  regime.    The weekly concluded that there is no accurate evidence to  prove that the West supports the establishment of an independent  state for Kurds but that their meddling in northern Iraq is  threatening the regional security and integrity.</p>

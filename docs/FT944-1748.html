			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Conservative Party Funding: Top companies reduce contributions - How the Conservative party raises money from industry has long been one of the great puzzles of UK political life. In a special report, Peter Marsh, with William Lewis, Jimmy Burns, Roland Adburgham and Robert Peston, unravels some aspects of the mystery / Corporate Cash Gifts Cash gifts to the Conservatives from Britain's biggest 100 companies have fallen sharply in the past five years, as big business has become increasingly reluctant to support the government publicly. Donations last year from the biggest 100 UK companies - ranked by stock market capitalisation at the end of September 1994 - were down 34.3 per cent in real terms compared with 1988, the comparable year in the general election cycle. An analysis of 20 big Conservative donors outside the biggest 100 companies shows similar trends. Total Tory donations from all companies and individuals over the period have, however, more than kept pace with inflation. This shows that the party has had some success in making up shortfalls in gifts from big companies by taking in more cash from unidentified sympathisers. A survey of the annual reports of the biggest 100 companies showed 36 gave to the Conservatives in the eight years of the survey from 1986 to 1993. Between the general elections in 1987 and 1992 only 11 of the 36 increased their gifts at above the rate of inflation, while 25 showed a fall in real terms. Sir Derrick Holden-Brown, former chairman of food and drink giant Allied-Lyons, now Allied Domecq, said: 'It is much more difficult for the Conservatives to extract money from companies compared with a decade ago.' Allied Domecq cut its donation to zero last year after giving more than Pounds 1m since 1979. To smooth distortions, the analysis by the Financial Times concentrated on cash gifts in two three-year periods, 1986-88 and 1991-93, around the last two elections. Donations tend to rise ahead of a general election and go down immediately afterwards. Based on this analysis, payments by the top 100 companies fell a real - inflation-adjusted - 16.3 per cent in the five years between the elections. In nominal terms donations rose 10.2 per cent. Over the eight years from 1986 to 1993 the biggest 100 companies provided Pounds 10.13m, or 12.2 per cent of the Pounds 82.81m donations from all companies. When the cash from the 20 additional big donors is added, the figure comes to Pounds 16.31m, or 19.6 per cent of the total. Between the two three-year periods donations to the Tory party from all sources rose 33.3 per cent in nominal terms or 1.4 per cent in real terms. Where the extra cash came from is a mystery since the Conservatives do not break down the sources of cash gifts. The only way researchers can get a clue is by looking through the reports of UK-registered companies, which by law have to disclose political donations. Between 1986 and 1993 donations accounted for four-fifths of Conservative Central Office's income of Pounds 103.26m. The rest of the income came from payments by constituency associations and money raised from such activities as subscriptions, conferences and book sales. Over the eight years, Central Office's income rose a relatively healthy 16.2 per cent in real terms - but spending rose even faster, which explained the Tories' Pounds 15m overdraft at the end of the party's last financial year in March. In the eight years from 1986 to 1993 Allied Domecq was among the biggest givers from the top 100 companies, providing Pounds 611,100. But between the two three-year periods the company's donations fell from Pounds 266,200 to Pounds 120,000, a fall of 54.9 per cent in nominal terms and 65 per cent in real terms. Among the other 24 companies of the top 100 which failed to match inflation, food company United Biscuits cut back 12.2 per cent in real terms. Between 1986 and 1993 it gave Pounds 778,500 but this year it is likely to give nothing. Two other big donors, Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation and industrial conglomerate Hanson, gave Pounds 730,000 and Pounds 692,000 respectively between 1988 and 1993. Both failed marginally over the period to match their payments with inflation but remain committed to the Tories. Mr John Crossman, P&amp;O company secretary, said the Tories were generally 'helpful' to the business world. Mr Richard Whitaker, company secretary of General Accident, the insurer, said a significant factor in the 78 per cent real-terms fall in the payments had been the Labour party's move away from leftwing policies. This had reduced the threat to business of a non-Tory government. Others said that as the recession had hit profits they saw fewer reasons to support the Tories. Of the 11 companies which increased donations in real terms, Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewer, showed a 17.9 per cent increase. The company said it would 'probably' match its annual Pounds 50,000 donation of the past two years with a similar payment this year. Tomkins, Rolls-Royce, Legal &amp; General, Glaxo, GKN and Forte all also more than matched inflation over the period. In the analysis of 20 big donors, the payments of just eight companies kept pace with inflation over the eight years. They included four big City companies - Caledonia Investments, Robert Fleming, Baring Brothers and Hambros. Taylor Woodrow, the construction company which has given more than Pounds 1.3m since the late 1960s, cut its donations 45.3 per cent in real terms over the eight years. The company, which gave Pounds 124,500 in 1992 and Pounds 5,000 last year, said it was unlikely to return to making big payments. Mr John Marshall, chief executive at John Mowlem, another construction company to cut back, said: 'We are not budgeting for any donation in the immediate future. The trend from shareholders is not to approve of companies making political donations.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TORY PARTY DONATIONS: HOW COMPANIES HAVE CUT BACK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                          Real terms %           Total                                    1991-93 on           1986-                                       1986-88            1993                                     (constant       (Pds'000)                                   1994 money)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BIGGEST 100 COMPANIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Tomkins                                 715.5           213.5 Rolls-Royce                              76.7           257 Legal and General                        24.1           214 Scottish &amp; Newcastle                     17.9           380 Glaxo                                    17.6           455 Forte                                     9.6           562.5 P &amp; O                                    -0.6           730 Hanson                                   -2.1           692 Tate &amp; Lyle                              -6.2           231.7 Ass'ted Brit.

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Fishing fleet gets smaller The size of the UK fishing fleet is dwindling, and scenes like the one above at Newhaven, East Sussex, are becoming less common. Now the Sea Fish Industry Authority, the statutory body which promotes the industry, is saying that the country is losing its capacity to build and repair fishing vessels, threatening the competitiveness of the fleet, Alison Maitland writes. It should be building three times more big fishing boats a year to prevent the fleet ageing, the authority says in a report published today. But only 37 yards built fishing boats in 1992 compared with 68 in 1987. Yards undertaking repairs fell by 12 per cent in the same period. Employment in construction and repairs dropped by 37 per cent overall, while more than half the workforce left the industry in Scotland and Northern Ireland. 'The trend is worrying because the UK fleet is, on average, already fairly old and current rates of new building and withdrawals are not enough to stop it ageing further,' said Mr Peter Chaplin, chief executive of the Edinburgh-based authority. 'Unless we reverse the trend,' he added, 'our fleet will continue to age at the same time as our European neighbours are taking steps to modernise.' The average age of boats over 10m is now 22 1/2 years, the report says. Britain should be building about 76 boats of this size a year, while withdrawing 190 old vessels a year to meet the 19 per cent reduction in fleet capacity required under European Union rules. The report says that too many boats under 10m are being built.</p>

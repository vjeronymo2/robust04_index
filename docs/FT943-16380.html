			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / The Full Employment Debate: New consensus rethinks the unthinkable - The TUC today hosts a conference on employment to mark the 50th anniversary of the wartime white paper on jobs Full employment, or at least talking about it, is back in fashion. Today's Trades Union Congress conference to mark the 50th anniversary of the wartime coalition government's white paper on employment policy - with its commitment to 'maintain a high and stable level of employment' - would have been unthinkable a decade ago. The attendance at Looking Forward To Full Employment of Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, is testimony to a new consensus about the urgency of reducing unemployment which spreads far beyond the labour movement. Mr John Philpott, director of the Employment Policy Institute think-tank, contrasts the annual 1984 Mais lecture by the then Mr Nigel Lawson - now Lord Lawson - which blamed unemployment on rigid labour markets and relegated it to a 'residual' of economic policy-making - with the 1994 Mais lecture by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Mr Clarke not only said that unemployment must now be the 'main preoccupation' of economic policymakers but added that he shared the white paper's commitment to maintain a high and stable level of employment. In 1984 registered unemployment was rising rapidly towards 3m, yet by the time of this year's lecture the figure was still high - at 2.6m - but was falling rapidly. The apparent lesson of the 1987 and 1992 general elections, that mass unemployment had ceased to be a central political issue - especially when the trend was downward - no longer seems to apply. This may have something to do with the demise of the jobs-for-life expectations of the middle classes. The agenda is, in any case, now open. A decade ago the papers for such a conference would have been peppered with calls for a massive expansion in demand and huge state-backed employment programmes. The conference papers - mainly by centre-left academics but representing a wide range of views - scarcely mention such things. Indeed, the introductory paper by Mr John Philpott indicates that supply-side measures are the most appropriate form of attack. He says the conference should be seen as a contribution to the 'middle way'  -between the deregulated US model with high job creation but meagre social protection, and the regulated European model with low job creation but more generous protection. This is where the consensus usually breaks down - with the left believing that the European model can still create jobs even with high costs, and the right saying that there is a trade-off between protection and job creation. But Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, now says there are limits on how far Britain can go in reducing unemployment by allowing incomes to fall sharply. Similarly, the TUC papers propose a range of employment-friendly reforms to the tax and benefit system while trying to take account of how radically the pattern has changed since 1944. But several TUC papers reject the idea of topping up low wages in favour of a high minimum wage and a hefty dose of labour market re-regulation. The tension between such policies and rapid private-sector job creation is not discussed, however. Also no paper looks at job creation from an employer's point of view, and there is little acknowledgement of the wider dimensions of full employment.</p>

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Intervention fails to bolster dollar: Sterling dragged down; Dollars at record low against DM; Wall Street falls 50 points CONCERTED intervention by the world's central banks to buy the dollar yesterday failed to stop the currency falling to an all-time low against the D-Mark. The dollar's slide upset bond and share prices on Wall Street. After a hectic day's trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 50.79 at 3,254.10, its lowest point since early April and its biggest one-day fall this year. The decline in the US currency also helped to push down sterling against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism. The pound was trading in New York last night within two pfennigs of its permitted ERM floor before rallying near the close. Although the US Federal Reserve, acting with 15 other central banks including the Bundesbank and the Bank of England, intervened to buy dollars for D-Marks, the US currency fell through DM1.4430, its all-time low set in February 1991. In New York, the dollar closed at DM1.429, almost 3 pfennigs below its high of the day, while against the pound, it finished at Dollars 1.955. By continuing to sell the dollar in spite of the intervention, investors pushed up the D-Mark's exchange rate against European currencies. As a result, the pound remained weak, but picked up from its lows in New York to end at DM2.801. Earlier, sterling closed in London at DM2.7975, down a pfennig on the day. If the pound falls to its ERM floor of DM2.7780 next week, either the Bank of England will be forced to intervene and buy sterling or the government will support the pound by raising UK base rates. This will show dealers that they can get a better return for their sterling investment than they would by buying D-Marks. Talks on actions that may be needed are likely this weekend. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is due back tomorrow from holiday and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is due back at the Treasury on Monday. Dealers in the sterling money markets seemed convinced a rise in UK base rates was imminent. Three-month money in the sterling cash market was offered at 10 1/2 per cent, half a percentage point above UK base rates. Short sterling futures fell by over 20 basis points and were clearly pricing in a rise of  1/2 a percentage point in base rates. In yesterday's intervention, the central banks spent D-Marks worth an estimated Dollars 1bn, buying dollars at around DM1.4480 in a generally thin market. Dealers are now uncertain at what level the Federal Reserve will intervene to hold the currency. Operators at one of the biggest foreign exchange trading banks in London said the dollar was still under a lot of pressure last night. Technical analysts say they are in uncharted territory because the dollar has never been at these low levels. The selling of dollars pushed the D-Mark's rate up against other European currencies. The lira fell to 762.2, close to its floor against the D-Mark of 765.0. The Bank of Italy may have to raise interest rates again if it is to stop the currency hitting its floor.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, the leaders of the Organization of Eastern  Caribbean States [OECS] got down to their first working session  of the 23rd Authority meeting in Castries, St. Lucia. The  meeting is scheduled to come to a close tomorrow.    Today began deliberations on a host of issues, including the  preparation of maritime boundary delimitation negotiations,  World Bank reports, and the follow-up on the just concluded  Global Conference in Barbados. The Authority meeting, which was  attended by all but one OECS leader, namely Prime Minister  Nicholas Braithwaite of Grenada, yesterday welcomed its newest  family member in the person of Antigua's newly elected Prime  Minister Lester Bird. Mr. Bird addressed yesterday's official  openings in his capacity as representative for the delegations.  While noting that this time his role was different, he did,  however, indicate that the task was not new, having had years of  practice.    [Begin Bird recording] I wish to thank the chief minister of  Montserrat and the prime minister of St. Lucia for the warm  words expressed by both of you on my election to the prime  ministership of Antigua and Barbuda. As many of you are aware, I  have been attending conferences of heads of government of the  OECS from its inception. Indeed, you accorded me the distinct  honor of allowing me to be the first chairman even though I was  not a prime minister. In that sense, I spent the last 14 years  in this council impersonating a head of government. And many of  you spent the last 14 years in complicity. I am pleased that by  (electing the government a party) which I have the honor to  lead, the people of Antigua and Barbuda have chosen to relieve  not only me of the role of impersonator, but you of the role of  collusion.    On a serious note, I have placed on record my profound  thanks  to OECS heads of governments past and present, who over the last  14 years, have treated me with such great consideraton. Mr.  Chairman, it is fitting for me that the first OECS heads of  government conference I should attend as prime minister is held  in St. Lucia. For on this island, (around) your wise and mature  guidance, Mr. Chairman, our countries have together made many  practical decisions which have advanced the economic and  political interests of our subregion.

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Forte to retain Harvester Forte has taken its Harvester restaurant chain off the market after failing to find a buyer prepared to pay the price it was asking. Forte was hoping for a price of more than Pounds 120m for the 78 Harvester restaurants. It is believed that the highest price offered was Pounds 110m. Among the potential buyers believed to have expressed an interest in the chain were Whitbread and Allied-Lyons. Forte said it would now invest in the chain. Sales are currently believed to be almost 10 per cent up on last year. The group also said it had completed the sale of its 50 per cent stake in the UK chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken to Pepsico for Pounds 40m cash.</p>

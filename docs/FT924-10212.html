			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Placer Dome rises 133% to Dollars 33m PLACER Dome, Canada's biggest gold producer, has reported a big rise in profits for the third quarter and first nine months, mainly because of record production and lower operating costs. Third-quarter net profits rose 133 per cent to USDollars 33m or 14 cents a share, from USDollars 14m or 6 cents a year earlier, on revenues of USDollars 264m, up 5 per cent. Nine-month net profits advanced 45 per cent to USDollars 68m or 29 cents, from USDollars 47m or 20 cents. Revenues rose 11 per cent to USDollars 771m. Gold sales jumped 21 per cent to almost 1.5m oz while the average realised gold price dipped 7 per cent to USDollars 372 per oz and cash cost of production averaged USDollars 188 per oz. Placer achieved greater mill output and better grade control and gold recoveries. Low cost mines increased production while exchange factors were favourable. Placer may extend the big Dome mine in Canada and plans to buy 50 per cent of Chile's Zaldivar copper deposit for USDollars 100m. Cost control and the search for new gold reserves are top priorities.</p>

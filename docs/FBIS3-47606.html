			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 13 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia is  disappointed that Israel is deliberately delaying transfer of  power to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho on the  West Bank, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Thursday.    Malaysia hoped Israel would be sincere and committed to the  peace agreement which it signed on Sept 13 with the Palestine  Liberation Organistion (PLO) giving limited self rule in the two  areas, he said.    The new year has come and a Palestinian government should  have been in place in the two areas, he told reporters before  giving a cheque for RM13.6 million (about U.S. $5 million),  being a donation from the Government of Malaysia, to Palestinian  Ambassador Ahmad al- Farra, here.    Malaysia hoped the agreement would be implemented as soon as  possible, he said.    He said Malaysia would continue to support the aspirations  of  the people of Palestine to have their own independent homeland  with Jerusalem as the capital.    Abdullah said Malaysia was the first country to give direct  financial aid to the Palestine National Council authority to  develop the Gaza Strip and Jericho when the two areas were  returned to the Palestinians.    The donation represented Malaysia's fulfillment of a pledge  to the PLO to help it redevelop the two areas, he said.    Malaysia is also ready to give all necessary aid to  Palestine  in the development of its human resources and institutions under  its technical cooperation programme, he said.    Ahmad al-Farra said the financial aid reflected Malaysia's  strong support for the Palestinian cause.    He said there were four main factors which had stalled the  transfer of power in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    The factors were related to the side of the area in Jericho  to be turned over to the Palestinians, who is to administer the  border area between Jericho and Jordan and the Gaza Strip and  Egypt, security for the Jewish community in Gaza Strip and the  question of Jerusalem.</p>

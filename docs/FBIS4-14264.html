			<p>BFN     [Text] The government today categorically assured  Parliament that it will not give in to any pressure on the NPT  [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] issue, neither will there be  any change in India's stand that the NPT should be universal and  nondiscriminatory.    Allaying apprehensions expressed by opposition members on  the  London talks between Indian and U.S. officials, the  parliamentary affairs minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla, in the Lok  Sabha and the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman  Khurshid, in the Rajya Sabha made it clear that there is  absolutely no rethinking on the NPT issue. Mr. Shukla said  there is no secrecy about the talks and it was held in London  only because it was convenient to both the sides. Describing  the talks as preparatory to the prime minister's forthcoming  visit to the United States, he urged the members to ensure that  both Parliament and the people strengthen the hands of Mr.  Narasimha Rao in safeguarding the nation's interests. Mr.  Shukla said that whenever summit meetings are planned, such  preparatory talks are held to discuss various points which will  come up.    Mr. Salman Khurshid said that government will abide by the  Rajiv Gandhi action plan on nuclear disarmament; and earlier  raising the issue during zero hour in the Lok Sabha, Mr.  Saifuddin Chaudhary and other opposition leaders demanded a  statement on the London talks, as it has created apprehensions  in the minds of the people because of various press reports  about the secrecy of the meeting. Raising the issue in the Rajya  Sabha, Mr. J.P. Mathur, BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], said that  utterances by the U.S. officials have hurt the self-respect of  the country.</p>

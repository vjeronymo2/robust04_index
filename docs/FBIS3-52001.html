			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities monitored through 27 January.  Source is listed in parentheses following each item:    Finance Minister Fernando Illanes signed a loan agreement  for  32 million German marks -- $18.6 million -- with the German  Government. The funds will be used to supply electricity to  Larecaja Province and La Paz Department and potable water to  Oruro Department. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 31 Dec 93 p B2)    Fedor Perez, deputy director general of the General Customs  Directorate, DGA, reported that the DGA collected 946 million  bolivianos in 1993, a 17.9 percent increase compared with 1993.  But he said this was less than national budget estimates due to  international agreements signed with Colombia, Ecuador,  Venezuela, Peru, Argentina, and Chile that provide for the  reduction or exemption of tariffs.

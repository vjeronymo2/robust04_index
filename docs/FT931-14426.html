			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Key posts for rail sell-off are filled THE GOVERNMENT yes-terday chose a lawyer and a former merchant banker for two positions at the centre of its plans for implementing the privatisation of British Rail. They are Mr John Swift QC, an expert in competition law who is to become the rail regulator, and Mr Roger Salmon, a former director at merchant bank NM Rothschild who is to become director of passenger rail franchising. Mr Swift, 52, will play a key role, ensuring that train operators - passenger and freight - get fair access to the railway tracks at an acceptable price. He will also be responsible for protecting rail passengers' interests. Mr Salmon, 46, who is now chairman of Cuff and Co, a family business, will be responsible for franchising private-sector companies to take over the operation of BR's passenger services and making sure they fulfil their obligations once the franchises are awarded. The latest appointments follow the government's decision last month to install Mr Bob Horton, former chairman and chief executive of British Petroleum, as vice-chairman of BR with special responsibility for setting up Railtrack, the state-owned authority that will own BR's tracks. Completion of these appointments emphasises the government's determination to press on with rail privatisation in spite of sharp criticism of its plans from the rail lobby, opposition parties and some Conservatives. The last obstacle to the introduction of the necessary legislation appeared to have been cleared yesterday when the paving bill completed its passage in the Lords. That means the government is on course to introduce the privatisation legislation, known as the Railways Bill, to the Commons on Thurs-day. Mr Robert Adley, chairman of the Commons transport committee which is hearing evidence on the government's plans, intends to anticipate the bill tomorrow by publishing an interim report of the committee's findings. Mr Adley, a Conservative backbencher and railway enthusiast, has made no secret of his hostility to the government's proposals. The report is, however, expected to adopt a measured tone.</p>

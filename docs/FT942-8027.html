			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Management: A Sony manager's tale Sony's reorganisation has been good news for Yoshihiko Yanagimoto, a 42-year-old general manager of one of the group's eight new in-house companies. The reshuffle has streamlined his responsibilities, which previously included development and marketing of any sort of product linked to personal information hardware from personal computers to CD-Rom. 'There was never a clear sense of direction because everyone was involved in everything,' he says. Now he is in charge of developing personal communication hardware around Magic Cap, a new communication software that integrates electronic mail, facsimile, telephones and paging systems. The other assignments he previously held have been shifted to the in-house Computer Systems Business Company. Yanagimoto says this has allowed him to concentrate on the planning and developing of one theme. It has also meant that Sony itself is more focused on its plans in the next generation information and communications area. Meanwhile, the creation of internal 'companies' has shifted power to the heads of groups from the central administrators. 'We are having to deal less with the corporate headquarters since most of the decision making is done within the (in-house) company,' says Yanagimoto. The removal of extra administrative layers has also meant that decisions made at headquarters rather than the individual internal companies are processed much more quickly than before. 'I was always aware of the size of the company getting in the way of new business decisions,' he says. Sony's changes have not worked well for everyone. Unlike Yanagimoto, who has retained his old responsibilities in the same product area, and looks over the same number of subordinate staff, some managers have been given completely new assignments without staff directly under them. 'There are some people who are discouraged with their new mission,' he says.</p>

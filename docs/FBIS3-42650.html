STRUGGLE FOR PEACE </H5>   All wars end. So did this one.    And peace came.    And this peace was new, although its images strangely  resembled something.    At the beginning of summer, at the famous Chermen Circle  border point, where Ossetians and Ingush come together for  official meetings and quiet business negotiations, and where  hostages and information are exchanged, representatives of the  North Ossetian Ministry of Health transferred to the Ingush  Ministry of Health under the supervision of specialists from the  Russian Ministry of Health five patients from the republic  psychiatric hospital. They were being transferred to, as they  say, where they belong--all five were Ingush.    It was a sunny day; the patients looked well cared for. "We  took better care of them than of our own," said the chief  physician from Vladikavkaz. The parties were clearly happy with  each other, expressing a willingness for a new "dialogue." The  general atmosphere of complacency was nearly spoiled by patient  Magomed A. He cried, not wanting to leave behind his hospital  roommates and the doctors he loved. How could Magomed A. know  that the impossibility of shared habitation of Ossetian and  Ingush mental patients was now codified in law by a special  decree of the North Ossetian parliament? After all, the man is  mentally ill.    During the five-day Ossetian-Ingush war, the Chermen  boarding  house for the feeble-minded remained an island of wisdom in the  crazy slaughter. When normal citizens left the village after  shooting at each other for a while, the feeble-minded took their  fate into their own hands, demonstrating an exemplary common  sense and mutual aid. Dividing people by ethnic origin proved  beyond what their feeble minds could grasp. That is how the  Russian military found them upon entering Chermen--all together.  There is a rumor that this boarding home also is to be  disbanded--Ossetians to one side, Ingush to the other.    And there was not a single person in good mind on that day  who would look around and ask: What exactly are we all doing  here?    Only a deprived mind can grasp the peace that came. One  Russian republic defeated by armed force another Russian  republic. And Russia itself, as if the war was between Nicaragua  and Guatemala, "forged the victory" for one of them.    Ingush in Vladikavkaz and Prigorodnyy Rayon of the North  Ossetian SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] were partly  exterminated and completely pushed out, deported beyond the  borders of Ossetia. The North Ossetian press likes to compare  the tragic events of last year with the Hitlerite aggression.  The style of articles and speeches is a matter of taste, but,  using the suggested analogy, we should extrapolate it to the  area of practical ideology: In those times, Hitlerites,  capturing some Soviet cities and burying some of its residents  in ditches, hung a poster--"Judenfrei," Jew-free. In Ossetia  they do not hang "Ingush-free" posters, but in a letter to  IZVESTIYA a well-intentioned female resident of the republic  writes: "The air in Vladikavkaz has become cleaner without the  Ingush."    Was it that long ago that Ossetian writer-democrat Kosta  Khetagurov defended the dignity of the mountain  people--Ossetians and Ingush--from the ignorant snobbishness of  the bureaucratic press in Vladikavkaz? Now all 33 writers in the  republic appeal to the people from the pages of SEVERNAYA  OSETIYA with a proposal to hold a referendum on the topic:  "Should we or should we not live with Ingush on our land?" The  engineers of human souls advise--let us not. The organizing  committee of the second congress of Ossetian people presented an  ultimatum to the Russian president: "The issue of joint  habitation of the Ingush with Ossetian people should be removed  from the agenda... Otherwise the committee reserves the right to  rouse our people to an armed struggle."    And finally the session of the republic's Supreme Soviet  turned the thesis voiced by the writers into law. The decree of  the North Ossetian Supreme Soviet on the impossibility of joint  habitation of Ossetians and Ingush, which has no analogy in  modern history, with the exception of Nuremberg racist laws  passed under Hitler, placed every Ingush outside the law on the  territory of North Ossetia. This prompted the current head of  the Provisional Administration, V.D. Lozovoy, to appeal to North  Ossetian deputies:    "I have to express my regret that you have not supported the  proposal to dismiss the ill-conceived thesis of the  impossibility of joint habitation. I ask you once again to come  back to it and think again. You represent the proud and wise  people of your republic. I understand your demand for justice,  but there is no such thing as two justices, just as there are no  two truths. There is only one truth. You have today a great  historic chance to show your wisdom, so that you may later look  honestly into the eyes of other people and your children, and be  remembered kindly by your grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  Find in yourself the wisdom and courage to arrive at a just  solution and place yourself above political expediency in the  name of and for the good of your people."    V.D. Lozovoy found strong and precise words, but they did  not  touch the deputies. Perhaps the deputies would have given it a  thought had they heard such a speech from an all-Russia rostrum,  but no one delivered it there. In interviews with journalists,  including foreign ones, A. Galazov does not advertise  Vladikavkaz laws. He only reminds them that he cannot guarantee  the safety of Ingush returning to Prigorodnyy Rayon. Buses  carrying Ingush to four villages within the pale of settlement  set by the presidential decree are pelted with stones. This is  how the citizens apply the law of their Supreme Soviet. They are  not hooligans or thugs, storm troopers or Nazis; they are simply  doing their public duty. That is why village gatherings on the  standard topic "No to Joint Habitation!" resemble well-rehearsed  party meetings.    Although things did go too far, and it is indeed easier for  the Ossetians to live without the Ingush. Blood has been spilled  by both sides. One hundred five dead Ossetians is a big loss not  only for their loved ones--it is a perceptible loss for a small  nation. Bloodshed does not make anybody better. The Ingush also  nurture an image of Ossetians endowed with inhuman vices. Hate  is seldom fair; it always goes overboard. A year of such  peaceful coexistence did not do well by both peoples.    All wars end in peace. A make-believe war was followed by a  make-believe peace. Imaginary, but not bloodless. In the postwar  year about 100 have been killed from both sides, their murderers  never found. What it was--terrorism, hooliganism, revenge,  provocation, robbery--who knows?    And with all the effort that went into strengthening peace.  All those people who tried over the past year to reconcile the  Ossetians and the Ingush--elders, women, religious figures,  Kirsan Ilyumzhanov, people's diplomacy and regular diplomats;  even the Confederation of Mountain Nations, having had enough of  fighting in Abkhazia, was ready to don "blue papakhas"; and now  finally President Yeltsin.    All to no avail.    I will permit myself to share a personal impression, since I  was present at the beginning of the Pyatigorsk-Kislovodsk  process conceived two and a half months after the tragedy by the  chairman of the Chamber of Nationalities, R. Abdulatipov, and S.  Shakhray (State Committee for Nationalities and Federation  Affairs) under the umbrella of the Senega Forum social movement.  One expected a gathering of wise, experienced people from  different North Caucasus republics, who had accumulated  historical experience of joint habitation; people who  undoubtedly had things to say, who knew how to make peace  between two peoples and organize their living together. The  result of this formal undertaking were two meetings: one for  everybody in Pyatigorsk, with short speeches by representatives  of social movements in the Caucasus; and another, the next day,  in a posh Kislovodsk hotel behind closed doors, and only for top  republic officials. At such forums the only outstanding feature  usually is the banquet. Besides, the troubles of the two people  were so close to the door that our gluttony looked like a feast  amidst plague.    At the next meeting in March (this time without any kind of  public representatives), the Kislovodsk agreements were adopted  under the ambiguous heading "Agreement on Measures for a  Comprehensive Solution of the Problem of Refugees and Forced  Migrants on the territory of Ingush Republic and North Ossetian  SSR."    It soon became clear, of course, that Ruslan Aushev's  understanding of "comprehensive solution" was full-scale  resettling assistance to Ingush refugees; while Akhsarbek  Galazov, on the contrary, saw it as inclusion in the number of  refugees of everyone who had come to North Ossetia: from South  Ossetia, Georgia, and Tajikistan; Cossacks from Chechnya and  Ingushetia; Meskhet Turks from Central Asia; and others. For  these refugees Moscow provided substantial amounts of money. S.  Khetagurov, chairman of the North Ossetian Supreme Soviet,  reported to his compatriots with satisfaction: "We have received  a nice infusion."    The obvious military inequality of the sides found  continuation in the obvious diplomatic superiority of the  Vladikavkaz team. Legends abound among the Ingush regarding the  powerful Ossetian lobby in Moscow. From circles close to the  Ingush Republic leadership comes a tale of an incredible event.  An edict (No. 407) was signed by the president of the Russian  Federation; Point 4 envisaged the transfer of all power on a  territory where a state of emergency is imposed to the  Provisional Administration, that is, in essence it introduced  federal rule; the decree had a cover letter to the parliament  attached with a request for approval, and--behold the miracle:  While the decree was en route from the Kremlin to the White  House, Point 4 disappeared; the signed decree had a completely  different point. And everything in Prigorodnyy Rayon remained as  it was.    "I am not a politician yet--I am only learning," says Aushev  about himself. "I have one advantage over many politicians--I do  not hold onto power. I do not need it. I have had enough  battles, enough of giving orders; I have had enough power for  several lives to come..." Aushev had also, however, learned a  few lessons, and his next steps were more cautious. As to  decisiveness, he had always had plenty of that--suffice it to  recall his resignation from the job of deputy head of the  Provisional Administration in charge of Ingushetia. Is it that  he did not get along with Shakhray? "No," said Aushev. "Shakhray  is an intelligent and competent man, but there is nothing to get  along about--the problems are not being dealt with." He said  that and flew back to Moscow. The Ingush, however, did not let  him go and elected him the first president of their  first--tentative as it was--state. One wants to believe that in  the process of learning to be a politician Aushev will not learn  too much, as others do, and will not suppress his  straightforward and honest self; and anyway, if he becomes more  "sophisticated," he will not be understood by his people, who  also have only one advantage: Having never had their own state,  they have not yet been washed out in the lye of our developed  socialism.    Aushev, a professional military man, needs peace; he needs  to  give his people a breather, give them back a taste for life. The  ceremonial combination of the words "struggle for peace" has  real meaning for Ingushetia.    It looks as though V. Polyanichko learned something in the  zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. This is a rather  subjective feeling, and I have no way of verifying it: I was  probably one of the last journalists to talk to him. On Saturday  he invited me to visit him in Vladikavkaz at the beginning of  the following week, so that we could have a more detailed  conversation, but on Sunday he was killed. His murderers have  not been found (although the opportunity to do so was there);  there are different versions, including one that Polyanichko got  curious in Vladikavkaz about machinations with nonferrous metals  and sales abroad. This version recently got into the press and,  as I hear it, caused considerable interest in Vladikavkaz; I  will refrain from guesswork, however. It is a fact that he did  get involved in the Ingush problem, however, and over the short  period in his job as the head of the Provisional Administration  he succeeded in making perceptible progress. The most important  of his accomplishments was that, having studied the issue, he  reported to the president, and the latter for the first  time--and in presence of others, at that--had a tough  conversation with Galazov. After that came a joint appeal of  President B.N. Yeltsin and Chairman of the Council of Ministers  V.S. Chernomyrdin to the peoples of North Ossetia and  Ingushetia, urging them to show mutual generosity, restore  good-neighbor relations, and engage in constructive  peace-building work.    On Saturday 31 July an emergency congress of peoples of  Ingushetia was held in Nazran. Polyanichko apparently was a  little late; he found a place, unnoticed, somewhere in the back  row. He did not speak, just listened. When everybody rose,  however, it was no longer possible not to notice him--his height  and bearing were truly of a general's proportions. He was  satisfied with the congress, and although there had been some  rather scathing speeches, it looked like a burden had been taken  off him--perhaps he had been told something and expected worse.  Not knowing that I had visited these parts before, he started  telling me not to worry, that everything was going in the right  direction, the people here were good, they understood everything  correctly. It was then that he said a phrase I quoted in my  current report from Nazran--that the Ingush unfortunately keep  looking back too much on their ill-starred fate, but one cannot  go forward while looking back. I detected in his words (partly  to my surprise, because Polyanichko's reputation in our circles  was not the greatest) ordinary empathy, the desire to do  something for these people.    He actually was already doing something, even set up a  foundation for refugee assistance, and firmly supported their  return to their places of previous habitation. On Tuesday a  meeting of a joint commission was scheduled in the Kabarda city  of Terek; the parties were to approve the choice of four  villages in Prigorodnyy Rayon to which Ingush would return  first. The meeting took place, but this was another stalling  maneuver. His death delayed the choice of these four villages by  half a year--they were named only in December, after B.N.  Yeltsin's trip to North Caucasus. But to name does not mean to  implement. Polyanichko was a doer. Colleagues in the Provisional  Administration remember him as a very strong, tough, courageous,  but also kind man. They remember his words, phrases.  Correspondents once asked him under what circumstances he could  order the troops to open fire, and he said: "Only in a salute!"  He once said to someone: "The people are smarter than all the  governments and administrations...".    But these are the words of a man who decided to listen to  the  people not only at rallies. Now rural gatherings are taking  place in North Ossetia; they protest President Yeltsin's decree  on returning Ingush refugees, for starters, to four population  centers in Prigorodnyy Rayon. Among the counterarguments  presented by the "people": first issue an official opinion on  the aggression, and find and convict the murderers. But, as  gathering organizers know very well, we are talking about the  first 15,000 persons "vetted" by the procuracy and commissions;  there are no criminals among them. Which means that perhaps the  problem lies elsewhere?    Of course, the truth about the armed conflict is needed. One  of the reasons it is slow in coming is surely not the main  one--how to tell it without insulting either side; first they  want to smooth it out, average it, squeeze into the framework of  interethnic conflicts... But in any case, to make the everyday  existence of 64,000 people, predominantly children, contingent  on making this assessment public is both heartless, economically  inexpedient, and simply absurd.    Everything came to the fore during B.N. Yeltsin's trip.  Pressure, bargaining. You leave us Prigorodnyy Rayon, and we  will return your people there in a measured way. But bargaining  is bargaining; the more desirable way it is to do it within the  framework of the law, and this is what is nowhere to be found.    All wars leave winners and losers. This war does not have  any  winners; there is only one winner--Akhsarbek Galazov.    Of course, the time will come when the Ossetian people will  give him his due, but time not only comes--it passes; this is  what he is counting on.    Two months before the armed conflict the anti-Galazov  opposition appealed to the president of Russia to "look in  detail not only into the political situation but also into facts  of intentional exacerbation of interethnic tensions, and to  monitor the use of finances directed by the Russian government  to North Ossetia." People familiar with the political kitchen in  Vladikavkaz warned: "In North Ossetia the split between the  corrupt, amoral, and thieving authorities, on one side, and the  people on the other already occurred a long time ago..."    Where is this opposition now? Meanwhile, Galazov was first  proclaimed "man of the year" in North Ossetia, and has now been  elected the first president of the republic. The democratic  opposition to the regime fell silent and, in order not to be  accused of betraying the nation, either stepped aside or merged  with the authorities in a single national-patriotic impulse. In  the list of results of the five-day war in Prigorodnyy Rayon  this may be arguably the most important one.    It is not enough, however, to win over the opposition. A.  Galazov's genetic memory prompts him with words worthy of  Stalin: "Organs of internal affairs and state security should  conduct a resolute struggle against provocateurs and whisperers  of all suits and colorations." In short, the opposition is  threatened with Kolyma.    Of course, it is hard to understand: Ossetia has always been  distinguished by its intelligentsia, and Ossetians are  justifiably proud of the many names that have brought fame not  only to the little republic but to all Russia as well. It is not  hard, however, to deceive the intelligentsia, because it is  happy to deceive itself. And it is not necessary to look for  examples abroad of how entire nations have been deceived by  false ideology and the propaganda serving it. What about us, in  the entire former Union--was it long ago that we awoke? And  could we hear the voice of Sakharov if we still had the beat of  military bands and television and newspapers reporting daily  that the enemy is right on our doorstep?    There are, however, arguments no music can drown--the  economy. Perhaps despite all the denunciations North Ossetia is  flourishing under Galazov, and the regime, no matter how bad it  smells to the opposition and merely decent people, nevertheless  is providing a carefree life for its citizens, and for  Russia--considerable revenue for its treasury? Let us not touch  on the carefree life now--this is a topic for a separate  conversation; regarding revenue for the treasury, though, there  are indeed precise quantitative data. In one of the June issues  last year SEGODNYA published an interesting table of differences  between the amount of federal taxes and the total subsidies  issued to the regions in per capita figures. With the exception  of the Republic of Komi, North Ossetia received more than  anybody else from the common treasury last year and contributed  the least to it. To show more graphically how big this hole in  the federal pocket is, it should also be pointed out that all of  them together--Tuva, Tatarstan, Dagestan, Kalmykia, Karelia,  Buryatia, Sakha-Yakutia, Mari El, Kabardino-Balkaria, Bashkiria,  Chechnya, and Ingushetia plus Kamchatka and Irkutsk Oblast--made  less of a dent in Russia's kitty than this one little republic  in the North Caucasus. In a certain sense it is we, the Russian  taxpayers, that armed this region in such a fashion that in  terms of quantity of military hardware per capita it has no  equal in the world. It is you and I who paid for the murder of  each Ossetian and each Ingush who died in the senseless and  historically futile conflict.    One must give Galazov his due. To stand for his convictions  is not his motto. Galazov is a successful and pragmatic  politician.    He always remembers his goal. He may, of course, guess  wrong,  shoot himself in the foot occasionally--the style of inertia is  still great, but he will shake it up, will try to forget, and  will try to make others forget--and those who should forget, do;  the rest of them do not matter.    Just look at how he has managed to complicate the already  complex problem of refugees by packaging it with words like  "phased," "through nonviolent means," "comprehensive," "places  of compact habitation." How many obstacles did he erect--but  they are still coming back. Life goes on. There are already  2,500 Ingush living in Chermen, and 1,500 in Kartsa, right next  to Vladikavkaz. Spontaneously, without waiting for the  negotiations to be completed, 10,000 persons returned to their  burned homes. It is this simple invincibility of life that  Galazov did not take into account, and so he began to fall  behind. And one can no longer say that he is not behind the  events in politics, too, considering that in Vladikavkaz during  the days of the anniversary of the tragic events all the talk  was about heroic deeds, glory, the readiness to deflect another  aggression, while Nazran during the same memorial days did not  forget to say words of gratitude to Ossetian neighbors who saved  Ingush families in their homes--and there were hundreds of such  incidents; it is a pity that the names of these people still  cannot be said openly in Vladikavkaz. Because they (not "compact  resettlement") are the hope; they are the true victory of life  over enmity.</p>

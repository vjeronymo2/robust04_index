			<p>BFN     [Text] New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert returned to  Ioannina at noon today folloowing a two-day tour to North  Epirus, during which he visited villages and towns where the  Greek minority lives. In a news conference at Ioannina, Evert  called on the Albanian leadership to respect the human rights of  North Epirotes. Good relations with Greece, Evert said, are to  Albania's benefit. He said that it is inconceivable for  relations between the two countries to be at the level of  serious misunderstandings on the eve of the 21st century.    Referring to Turkey's involvement in Greek-Albanian  relations, Evert said that if something like this were to  happen, Ankara would have chosen a wrong direction. Finally,  Evert said that he will visit the Albanian capital only if the  five Omonoia [organization of the Greek minority of Albania]  officials of the Greek minority, currently in Tirana prisons,  are freed.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Wish List: Philippines former first lady Imelda Marcos on Tuesday made a  holiday appeal to go home from exile in Hawaii. "You can be sure that with your  former first lady, former mother of the country, when I come home, Christmas  will not be for a day.  </P> <P> I will make it Christmas every day," she said in a statement sent to  Philippines media. The government refused to allow the late President Ferdinand  Marcos and his family to return from Hawaii, where they fled when he was ousted  in 1986.  </P> <P> * Best Friend: The Wisconsin Humane Society will honor Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.)  for helping a stray dog he spotted on a Milwaukee freeway Dec. 2. Aspin picked  up the spaniel and unsuccessfully searched the surrounding neighborhood for its  owner. He then cared for the dog until its owner responded to a newspaper  advertisement appeal.  </P> <P> * Tables Turned: Advice columnist Dr. Ruth Westheimer has been discussing other  people's private lives for years. But now a little secret about Dr. Ruth  herself is out: She doesn't sleep in the same bed with her husband, Fred. The  tidbit was revealed when the couple booked a Caribbean cruise, asking for  separate beds. Dr. Ruth pooh-poohed the whole thing, saying it's just that Fred  snores too loudly.  </P> <P> * No Papering Over: The Ronald Reagan Library is nearing completion near Simi  Valley with a target date of Feb. 6, the former President's 80th birthday, but  it looks as though his papers won't be available for a number of years.  Reagan's White House papers are the property of the federal government, and the  National Archives has five years to process them. Until Reagan, former  Presidents owned their papers, except for Richard M. Nixon, whose documents  were made government property by special legislation after the Watergate  scandal.  </P></p>

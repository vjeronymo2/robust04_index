			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Government Spokesman Raphael </F> Gamzou [name as published], in Jerusalem, and PLO representative  to Rome Nimr Hammad, in Rome, by Franca Zambonini; date not  given: "The Torn Peace" -- first two paragraphs are FAMIGLIA  CRISTIANA introduction]    [Text] That thin fabric that Israel and the PLO [Palestine  Liberation Organization] had begun weaving six months ago has  been torn in a week of bloodshed. In Hebron, a Jew has  massacred dozens of Palestinian Arabs praying in the mosque, in  Beirut, Lebanese Christians have been butchered during a church  service, and in New York, a Lebanese has opened fire on orthodox  Jewish students, two of whom are at death's door. Meanwhile, a  sequence of further deaths in the occupied territories, which  are once again in revolt, is adding, drop by drop, to the trail  of blood. Agreements, negotiations, and expectations have gone  by the board, reason and history have retreated in the face of  raging fanatism. Does peace remain an impossible dream?    Advisor Raphael Gamzou, spokesman for the Israeli  Government,  and Nimr Hammad, the Palestinian representative in Italy,  answered this question from, respectively, Jerusalem and Rome.    [Gamzou] In the long term, I am optimistic. All the parties  concerned know full well that there are no alternatives.  Negotiation remains the only way open. Breaking off means  rewarding the extremists.    [Hammad] The massacres have opened people's eyes to reality.  The front is everybody's now. The future of the peace is in the  hands of the Israeli government. Six months have gone by since  that 13 September when the Washington agreements were signed,  and nothing has changed. All we have seen is delays in their  application. If the Hebron massacre induces Prime Minister  Rabin to be intransigent with the settlers and persuades him to  withdraw them from the settlements, there will be greater  grounds for optimism. But if Rabin thinks that the PLO has no  choice but to negotiate at all costs, he is making a mistake and  giving greater grounds for pessimism.    [Zambonini] Is it feasible to disarm the settlers  completely,  as the PLO has demanded as the first condition for resuming the  negotiations?    [Gamzou] Total disarmament is impossible and unacceptable  for  us, even after the Hebron massacre, which has filled us with  grief and shame. Every day brings acts of terrorism on the part  of the Islamic extremist of the Hamas movement, and the settlers  must be in a position to defend themselves. But the government  has already begun disarming the hard core of fanatical Jews and  it has ordered their expulsion from the territories and the  administrative arrest of the leaders of the extremist movements,  such as the Kakh.    [Hammad] The measures adopted by Rabin are a cosmetic  operation that does nothing to treat the real sickness that the  settlements represent. What does disarming only the extremists  mean? All the settlers are extremists, because their movement  has a precise ideology: that of Eretz Yisrael [name as  published], the Land of Israel that they consider theirs by  divine right. Rabin must understand that this ambiguity is  playing into the hands of the extremist fanatics. It is true  that Rabin has freed 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. But why did  he wait so long? Shall we need another massacre before he takes  another step forward?    [Zambonini] PLO Chairman 'Arafat has called for an armed  international force to be sent in to protect the Palestinians.  The government of Israel has said no. Was it right or wrong to  do so?    [Hammad] It was very wrong. We called for an armed  international force because the Israeli army gives us no  guarantee of protection. Quite the contrary. Israeli soldiers  have killed more than 20 Palestinian demonstrators over the last  week. Even before the Madrid talks that opened the way for the  peace negotiations two years ago, the European Community had  proposed an international presence in the cities, the villages,  and the Palestinian refugee camps, accompanied by the withdrawal  of the Israeli troops from the occupied territories. The  proposal was accepted neither by Israel nor by the United  States. These rigid stances are tombstones for peace.    [Gamzou] The Israeli Government was right to say no. The  best way ahead is direct negotiation between ourselves and the  PLO, without foreign interference. We had already reached an  understanding on the first part of the Oslo Agreement, on  autonomy for the Gaza and Jericho areas. But then the  psychopath from Hebron ruined everything. Now we have an  explosion of Palestinian rage, which is quite understandable.  We are putting our money on American mediation and the  multilateral negotiations that have the task of building the new  Middle East. Article 3(d) of the supplementary protocol to the  Oslo Agreement provides for a temporary international presence  in the Gaza and Jericho areas to supervise the implementation of  the agreements. This article may help us find a compromise  between the PLO's requirements and our own. I would not rule  out an agreement on a certain nonmilitary international  presence, but it must remain within the context of the  negotiations between the PLO and ourselves.    [Zambonini] Have the tragic events of the last few days  weakened 'Arafat's position?    [Gamzou] Definitely, just as they have weakened all those  who  support him in his decision in favor of dialogue. But our  government, too, is having difficulty with public opinion,  because the Palestinian terrorist attacks have continued even  after the recognition of the PLO and since the start of the  negotiations. There has been a succession of victims.  Nevertheless, we have said that we shall carry on with the  negotiations as if there were no terrorism, and we shall  continue fighting terrorism as if there were no negotiations.    [Hammad] The whole of the PLO has been weakened. After the  signing in Washington, the opinion polls showed 68 percent of  Palestinians in favor of the agreements. Today I am not sure we  would reach 50 percent. We have regressed to a worse position  than before. The lay portion of the Palestinian movement, which  was pursuing the political solution of "two peoples, two  states," has failed to get results, and the hope of peace has  thus become more remote.    [Zambonini] What is the alternative?    [Gamzou] There is no alternative to the negotiations. We  have learnt in the last few days what great damage a minute  fraction of extremists can do to the peace process. In the  Knesset last week, all the parties, from the Right to the Left,  voted the same motion condemning all forms of extremism is the  strongest terms. Such great unanimity had never been seen  before in our parliament. This is a sign that, regardless of  political divisions, the overwhelming majority of Israeli  society is united in the quest for peace.    [Hammad] The alternative is a tragic one. The Middle East is  entering a new phase in which anyone can grow a fundamentalist's  beard and launch a new war. Rabin does not have the strength to  dismantle the settlements, claiming that it would provoke a  civil war. In this way, he stands firm on his principles and  wants to force the PLO to accept them, while the settlers can  destroy what we are laboriously building up to create a climate  of mutual confidence. We are stuck in a blind alley, while the  extremists have the upper hand.</p>

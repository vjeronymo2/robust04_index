			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: Yeltsin maps out the tough road to reform MR BORIS YELTSIN has always asserted that control over the economy and faster progress of reforms were the indispensable elements for resolution of the country's crisis. In his address to the nation on Saturday night he mapped out how this might be done. What he outlined was a programme for authoritarian reform of the kind many of his advisers have long advocated. It blends a populism with a stricter application of controls and discipline, and seeks to bring the main economic actors under central control to ensure that they fulfil their reforming duties. To begin with, Mr Yeltsin will soon issue a decree giving citizens the right to own land: special vouchers are likely to be issued which would give citizens the right to purchase land. For those wishing to become small business owners, preferential credits and tax breaks will be offered. Bankruptcies, he said, would go ahead. Indeed, a programme of 'show' bankruptcies has been prepared for some time. He promised enhanced unemployment compensation for the victims of these bankruptcies - and it is to this where some of the new foreign assistance now being considered by the Group of Seven industrial countries may be directed. Mr Yeltsin said the struggle against inflation and the limiting of the money supply will be toughened - though he gave no details. The core issue is the lack of control on the part of the government of the central bank: though Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, is now part of the government (together with the heads of the state pension fund, the Federal Property Agency and the statistical service) and there is still no agreement on strategy. This will be a critical test of the new regime. Citizens who now see their savings disappear under the impact of 30 per cent monthly inflation will get compensation - not in cash, but in shares in enterprises and in land. A new effort is to be made to cut out abuses, especially in the privatisation of companies - where those with the largest clout have forced special deals at the expense of the voucher-holding population. The local heads of administration in autonomous republics and in regions are to be made 'directly accountable to the president and the Russian government' because of 'numerous instances of leaders in executive power hindering the implementation of political and economic reform'. This should mean that these people have nowhere to hide before the central government's all-seeing eye: but it will depend heavily on whether the central government has the competence to bring them to book. The programme would break a number of blocks en route to the market which have been erected by parliament, by the laws passed over the past year and a half and by the constitution itself. Like much else in the president's statement, it breaks through the encircling bonds and proposes a relatively unimpeded road to reform. But it is two-headed: it also puts enormous responsibility on the president and the government for actions and programmes which they must now effect; which they can no longer blame parliament for blocking. Even if they really have shunted parliament aside, they must work with the same cumbersome bureaucracy, mutinous local leaders, distrustful population, ailing infrastructure and reluctance on the part of foreigners to invest. They have not lightened their load: they have increased it.</p>

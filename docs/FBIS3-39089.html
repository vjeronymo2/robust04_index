Sweden should also  be ready to allow its defense forces to serve the EU's common  foreign and security policy."    So said French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure,  who visits Sweden on Friday [11 February] for talks with the  Swedish Government.    DAGENS NYHETER met him in Brussels during a break in the  meeting of EU foreign ministers. In the interview Alain  Lamassoure returned time and time again with an almost religious  passion to the EU's need for a common foreign and security  policy. But he also left the door ajar on the possibility of  special regional support for northern Sweden, spoke about the  problems the fall in the value of the krona has caused French  industry, and denied that France is the villain of the  membership negotiations and a constant opponent of Sweden.    Anyone who has followed the negotiations might otherwise  have  easily formed the impression that France is the country which is  at the head of the resistance to Sweden's negotiating demands.  It was France which long blocked the question of snuff; France  took a tough line against Sweden's demands relating to car  exhaust emissions; France is doubtful especially about  agricultural support for farmers in northern Sweden.    But Alain Lamassoure gave assurances that France "is happy"  about Sweden's membership application and is adopting "a  well-disposed attitude" to Swedish demands. However, in the  past France did have its fears about Sweden as an EU member, he  said: "From the beginning we had major worries about the EU's  common foreign and security policy."    However, France's concern that neutral Sweden would slow  down  the EU's march toward the common foreign and security policy  which France considers to be extraordinarily important has been  allayed. Alain Lamassoure said: "Yes, after we listened to the  Swedish leaders, especially your prime minister who visited  Paris a few months ago, and after Sweden adopted the declaration  in which all the applicant nations commit themselves to  adjusting their legislation so that it falls in line with the  needs of the common foreign and security policy."    When Sweden's membership negotiations started, European  Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel stressed in his speech that the  Riksdag has stated that Sweden's military nonalignment continues  to exist.    Alain Lamassoure did not give a direct answer when asked  whether nonalignment is possible for Sweden as an EU member:  "Neutrality and nonalignment no longer have any meaning. The  world is no longer divided into two blocs," he said. "Today all  EU member nations must be involved in shaping a common foreign  and security policy and should be ready to put their military  capacity at the service of this policy."    [Hedstrom] Must Sweden join the WEU?    "Yes, in the longer term," Alain Lamassoure replied. "At  present it is not compulsory. According to the Maastricht  Treaty, member nations can either be members of the WEU or  observers. Observer status can be permitted, but it is only  provisional. We hope that Sweden can become a full member of  the WEU, which is in a way the European Union's military defense  arm."    The meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels is negotiating  regional policy with Sweden for the first time. The EU foreign  minister has given the thumbs-down to so-called Objective 1  support -- the EU's special support for poor regions -- to  Norrbotten while Sweden is standing firm on its demand for  special regional support for Norrland.    "We consider that Sweden has a geographical handicap because  of the latitudes in which the country lies. Sweden has a right  to have a regional policy which compensates for this handicap.  What has not been resolved is how this is to be combined with  the EU's regional policy," Lamassoure said.    "Our approach is that we want to find a solution which  corresponds to Sweden's needs without again opening up the  discussion within the EU. We have devoted months to discussing  which regions would receive Objective 1 support. If we let  Norrbotten receive Objective 1 support there would be a great  risk that we would receive new demands from regions within the  EU.    "If it is possible to find a different solution, we would  prefer that. But I am not worried, because I consider that when  it comes to these problems it ought to be possible to find a  solution."    [Hedstrom] Is a special solution, which does not directly  correspond to the EU's current rules -- an "Arctic" fund, for  example -- possible?    "We are in the process of looking at this together," Alain  Lamassoure replied.    When the Volvo-Renault deal collapsed, the French president  hinted that this could have an effect on the EU negotiations  with Sweden. But Lamassoure denied that the breakdown of the  marriage between the two car companies had caused bad blood.  Something that has bothered France more is the increase in  French imports of Swedish wood and paper products since the  collapse of the Swedish krona made it possible to reduce prices.    But unlike the Finnish authorities, the Swedish authorities  have been "cooperative" on this question and agreed to a  mechanism for checking on developments, and for this reason  there is no risk that the negotiations will be affected.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 4 (XINHUA) -- China Securities  Regulatory Committee (CSRC), the country's top securities  watchdog, has nullified a recent decision of the Shenzhen  securities authorities.    The Shenzhen decision would have allowed trading in 1994  bonus shares issued by former wholly state-owned enterprises six  months after they were issued.    This is allowed for individual shareholders, but not for the  50 percent of shares held by the enterprise on behalf of the  state, nor for the 30 percent of the shares which may have been  bought by other enterprises.    "Trading of state shares is an important issue concerning  the  readjustment of the government securities policy," said Zhu Li,  the CSRC spokesman.    "Local securities offices or stock exchanges have no right  to  make any decision disregarding present relevant government  rules."    So far, trading in shares other than those held by  individuals is banned because it involves aspects of transfer of  national property rights.    Zhu said that the CSRC had not been notified of the decision  by Shenzhen securities office until the Beijing body read it  today in a Shanghai newspaper.    But he said that the issue of allowing trading in those  shares was now under heated discussion.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Stefan Kozlowski, chairman of the </F> Presidential Ecological Council, by correspondent Ryszard  Bobecki; place, date not given]    [Text]    Bobecki: How much does protection of the  environment cost us in Poland?    Kozlowski: We already spend more than 12 trillion  zlotys [Z] a year for that purpose. Our index of outlays is  climbing steadily. Not so long ago our expenditure on  environmental protection represented 0.5 percent of the national  income, whereas now this has risen to a little above 1 percent.  It is a new sphere of economic activity, and its development  rate is quite dynamic.    Bobecki: Does the Presidential Ecological Council  endeavor to secure guarantees for pro-ecological investment  projects?    Kozlowski: The government is reluctant to extend  its guarantees for ecological investment projects.  Consequently, we intend to achieve a situation in which the  National Fund, which is our richest source of funds, would  extend certain guarantees to those Western companies which  intend to invest in Poland. We have already lost a number of  opportunities for securing foreign capital for investment  projects because of the absence of government guarantees. This  difficulty should be resolved as soon as possible.    Bobecki: Could you share with us your personal  reflections on certain matters which you have been monitoring  closely for a number of years now? How do we look compared with  the rest of the world?    Kozlowski: Compared with the rest of the world, we  are relatively busy in the field of pro-ecological activities.  Much busier than our immediate neighbors -- except perhaps for  the former East Germany. But that is because they receive  colossal sums of money for environmental protection from the  western part of Germany. Poland is undoubtedly in the forefront  of our group as regards setting up integrated financing,  organizational, and information systems, and it could continue  to play this leading role in the future. There has been  considerable and noticeable improvement in many areas. The  construction of a number of effluent treatment systems has  contributed to improved water purity in many of our rivers,  while decreased production in certain sectors of our economy  caused a reduction in atmospheric pollution and a drop in the  content of sulphur in the atmosphere.    However, a new area of environmental risk has emerged in the  agricultural sector. Fertilizers washed down from our fields  into ground waters are causing an environmental degradation of  our lakes. Another great problem is caused by small industrial  producers who notoriously ignore and bypass the requirements of  legal regulations devised to protect the environment. Our  liberal legislation allows virtually anyone to set up an  industrial enterprise without the need to comply with any terms  or conditions. In consequence, such enterprises become a  nuisance and a potential danger not only to their immediate  neighbors. Small industrial companies situated around Warsaw  are particularly aggressive.    I am very much concerned about certain moves made by the  State Agency for Agricultural Property. It has been selling --  into private hands -- landed properties constituting some of our  most valuable sites of special scientific interest, since only  unspoiled natural areas are of interest to buyers nowadays.  Most recently, the agency has offered a number of... lakes for  sale! We believe that this should not be tolerated. Lakes  could at most be rented out, not sold. The practice of selling  lakes to private buyers contravenes basic principles of regional  land and economic management and goes against the state's  obligations to society, not to mention the fact that it also  constitutes a threat to our most valuable natural resources.  This underlines the fact that we lack satisfactory control  mechanisms for regulating privatization schemes in agriculture.  At the same time, we still lack a properly standardized  procedure for ecological auditing to be carried out whenever a  given enterprise undergoes a privatization process. Even the  most major companies are privatized without an assessment of  their potential for causing ecological damage. We have not been  able to work out suitable solutions despite the work of the  joint commission of the Ministry of Ownership Transformations  and the environmental protection sector. When it comes to the  reform process, we are definitely not forceful enough in  introducing ecological protection mechanisms into privatization  transformations.    Bobecki: What causes this inability to be more  forceful?    Kozlowski: The fact that legislation work on the  drafting of a new ecology law has been checked. In the 10th  [old] Sejm we drafted and passed four laws, but another five are  still awaiting action. The subsequent dissolution of the First  [new] Sejm did not help to advance our work. This hiatus is  very dangerous, because we have only reached the halfway mark in  our work on the transformation of the ecology laws.    Bobecki: Which are the most important ecology laws  that the new Sejm should pass as soon as possible?    Kozlowski: A truly dramatic situation obtains in  our water management sector: We have no relevant legislation on  water resources and their management, and Poland simply cannot  function without such a law. We have no legislation concerning  extraordinary environmental hazards. The chemical, transport,  and (foreign) nuclear energy industries pose a whole range of  dramatically increasing ecological risks. We have no adequate  laws, organizational structures, or procedures to resort to in  cases of specific extraordinary hazards endangering the  environment. We have no law on industrial waste materials.  Poland is at present virtually deluged with industrial waste.  We struggle with this problem in every single parish and every  single city in the country. These questions must be resolved as  soon as possible, because speed is absolutely essential here.  The fact that successive parliaments have been unable even to  initiate a debate on these issues is highly alarming, to say the  least. Another example, this time somewhat bizarre, concerns  the situation in the sphere of game shooting and hunting laws.  Two successive parliaments have failed to sort out things in  this complicated area, and such issues as questions of property  and ownership relating to game shooting and hunting and the  principles of managing game stocks in Poland are still  unresolved.    Bobecki: Is our present legislation relating to  ecology really as defective as that?    Kozlowski: It is. All legal acts concerning the  sphere of ecology were originally devised to fit the  requirements of a totalitarian state. Now we must adapt all  legislation concerning the sphere of ecology to the needs of a  free market economy.    Bobecki: Thank you for talking to us.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets ZURICH Ares-Serono, the Geneva-based human fertility drug specialist, has much to talk about at its annual press conference today, writes Ian Rodger. Hard hit last year by pressures from governments on drug prices, it has nevertheless boldly intensified its commitment to pharmaceuticals in recent months. The diagnostics division has been sold, minority shares in the Israeli beta interferon subsidiary Interpharm have been mopped up and big investments have been made in new plant. Tomorrow the directors of Logitech, the world's leading maker of mice, scanners and other peripherals for personal computers, face the press. Net profit trebled to SFr27.8m in the year to March 31. But an unexpected sales slump in the three months to March showed again that the PC sector can spring a surprise at any time. Last Thursday's news of a Pounds 124m provision at Rothmans International has added an additional negative factor to the assessment of Richemont, the Swiss group that controls Rothmans and a gaggle of luxury goods companies brought together in Vendome, a new holding subsidiary, last summer. Richemont reports results for the year to March 31 on Friday. Net income was broadly flat at Pounds 96.6m in the first half, but the group warned in December of weaker sales of luxury goods in some markets. FRANKFURT The Daimler-Benz supervisory board is expected to meet on Wednesday to elect a successor to Mr Edzard Reuter, the management board chairman, who steps down next year. Mr Juergen Schrempp, head of the Daimler Aerospace subsidiary, is widely tipped for the job. Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, holds its annual news conference tomorrow and Audi's AGM is on Wednesday. MADRID Sevillana, the electricity distributor in the south of Spain, which last month reported a 17 per cent increase in first-quarter after-tax profit, holds its shareholders meeting on Wednesday. Last week, James Capel downgraded the stock, saying that the Spanish government's official estimate of the sum owed to the company in respect of its 50 per cent stake in the Valdecaballeros nuclear plant under moratorium had been set at Pta170bn, substantially below the Pta258bn included in its books. Banco Popular meets its shareholders on Thursday. The bank, more than 50 per cent-owned by non-Spanish institutional investors, has reported a 7.3 per cent rise in net profits for last year. Hoare Govett, which recommends the stock, along with that of Bankinter, says that both offer an almost irresistible combination of high rates of profitability, strong balance sheets and low market ratings. PARIS The market, under pressure since the start of the year, found no respite last week, writes Alice Rawsthorn. Analysts and economists are convinced, however, that on economic fundamentals the CAC-40 should recover over the summer. But there is concern about the Paris market's vulnerability to gloomy economic news from the US and Germany and also to the political uncertainty in France itself in the approach to next spring's presidential elections. 'The political situation is a factor,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French economist at Salomon Brothers. 'The presidential campaign raises the risk of various candidates pledging themselves to more expansionary policies to recapture lost votes from the demagogues: Philippe de Villiers and Bernard Tapie.' TOKYO Continued uncertainty over currency fluctuations are expected to keep investors away from the stock market, writes Emiko Terazono. Figures this week are likely to provide further evidence that the economy has bottomed, but may also reveal that previous expectations of an imminent upturn may have been over optimistic. Industrial production data on Wednesday are expected to show weak output in May, while Tuesday's May unemployment figures are likely to highlight continued sluggishness in the labour market. HONG KONG Domestic politics may dominate hearts and minds in Hong Kong this week, but it is unlikely to have anything more than a marginal impact as investors' attention remains firmly on the US dollar, interest rates and long bond yields, writes Louise Lucas. Retail investors have gained the upper hand in the absence of institutional buyers and international players and there is scope for an upwards spike, albeit on thin turnover, in the event of progress on talks between Britain and China over the colony's future.</p>

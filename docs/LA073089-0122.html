			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE: EXOTIC ENCORE;  </P> <P> FOR DOMAINE DE LA ROMANEE-CONTI, ONE FINE VINTAGE FOLLOWS ANOTHER  </P> <P> THE TIME TO take tarts is when they are passing," folk wisdom says, "for (the  tray) may not come again." And with the releases of 1986 Domaine de la  Romanee-Conti wines, now is the time to take. Providing, of course, that one  can spend between $89 and $300 per bottle.  </P> <P> The '85 vintage was spectacular. The big question among wine lovers was whether  the '86 wines would be just as good.  </P> <P> In June, 1988, I had tasted the 1986 La Tache in the cellars with Aubert de  Villaine, co-owner of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. I found it awesome in its  young perfection. The pleased, always restrained De Villaine said that he  believed the '86 wines to be some of the best the Domaine has made.  </P> <P> Then, this past February, I and 145 Southern California restaurateurs,  hoteliers and wine merchants took part in a "pre-arrival" tasting of the '86  wines.  </P> <P> Anticipation and nervous excitement were tangible at the tasting. Tasters had  to decide rather quickly which and how much of the wines they wanted to order,  because quantities are always limited. The Domaine has only 49.7 acres on which  its wines are produced, and only 8,600 cases of the 1986 vintage were made.  </P> <P> The '86s are surprisingly good, dispelling gossip in the trade that bad weather  had taken a toll. Vineyards of the Domaine are always among the last to be  picked in Burgundy, and De Villaine daringly delayed harvest until the grapes  were consummately ripe. De Villaine had gambled that the rain that fell in  September would cease in October. October brought beautiful weather; the gamble  paid off.  </P> <P> "Nothing is more difficult than simplicity," De Villaine said last year. That  simplicity accounts for the jewel-translucency of these Pinot Noir wines, which  have subtlety that approaches fragility. Their aromas and bouquets of exotic  complexity range from black currants, violets and faded roses to tar and orange  peel -- ever-changing in the glass. Each becomes a memory-index standard of  excellence.  </P> <P> The Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Burgundies may be expensive, but they are  perfect for toasting a special occasion. Here are my notes:  </P> <P> 1986 Echezeaux ($89). Surprisingly brick-edged ruby in color with scents  suggesting a smoky Lapsang souchong tea, this wine has a tongue-wrapping  richness and depth; 17 points out of a possible 20.  </P> <P> 1986 Grands Echezeaux ($149). This classical Pinot Noir wine has some berriness  and a long aftertaste that is awesomely impressive; 17/20.  </P> <P> 1986 Romanee-St. Vivant ($155). Although the bouquet suggests that this wine is  a closed bud, this is a full-bodied wine with elegance and rare finesse; 17/20.  </P> <P> 1986 Richebourg ($185). Very full, rich, almost languid in its lingering  complexity. A superb wine; 18/20.  </P> <P> 1986 La Tache ($199). Already wholly gentle, its Pinot Noir breed evident, this  wine is well balanced. It has wonderful fruit flavors, easily capturing  affection for its nobility; 18/20.  </P> <P> 1986 Romanee-Conti ($290). Notably superior from the rest of the wines, this  one defies description, combining all the pleasures of red wine in one glass of  ever-changing delight; 19+/20.  </P> <P> (Suggested retail prices subject to variation.)  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Travel to Slovakia Possible without </F> Visa"]    [Text] Slovakia is the first of the "Visegrad group" of  countries to agree to visa-free travel for its citizens and  citizens of Russia in both directions. An intergovernmental  agreement was signed here today which introduces liberal  conditions for travel under a general civil passport. This  applies to all people who travel to Russia or Slovakia with an  invitation for private or official business and for tourism or  medical treatment for a period of up to 30 days. Visas will  only be needed by those people who intend to look for work or  change their permanent place of residence.    "The agreement which has been signed," Foreign Minister  Eduard Kukan stated in an interview with your ITAR-TASS  correspondent, "will help to deepen mutual contacts and  cooperation between the two countries' citizens. This is  dictated by the mutual interests of Slovakia and Russia but is  not evidence of a new emphasis in Slovakia's eastern policy."</p>

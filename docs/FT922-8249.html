			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Arts: I puritani - Opera Bellini's last opera comes back to the Royal Opera House after an absence of 28 years. The return promotes good cheer on many levels. On a simple one, there was on Tuesday the unfamiliar pleasure of hearing a Covent Garden audience brim over with noisy enthusiasm long after the first-act curtain had fallen and the house-lights had risen. More significantly, there was the immense reward of hearing and seeing a marvellous opera worthily done. This is a temperate appraisal; and indeed, there are flaws to regret in the performance - small flusters in the stage presentation, clumsy chorus drill (compensated for by choral singing more vigorous than the recent house norm), one big disappointment in the cast-list. On the whole, though, the experience surges to grand, house-filling life in a way that restores our vision of I puritani as one of the peaks of Romantic opera. Restoration of the sort is no simple matter. This is an opera written for a quartet of great singers, not just a prima donna; a tissue of exquisite vocal melodies not neatly parcelled in discrete solos but made part of expansively developing structural patterns; and a Romantic music-drama, often derided for its soft-headed way with English history and its lapses of simple logic, that is nevertheless capable of carrying an extraordinarily powerful emotional charge. It needs passion, technical finesse, commitment, clearheadedness. It doesn't often come off. It did on Tuesday. June Anderson, Giuseppe Sabbatini and Andrei Serban, producer of the 1982 Welsh National Opera Puritani staging here adopted by Covent Garden, are the chief architects of that achievement. The force of the general argument against borrowed productions - that they tend to lose artistic life-blood away from their original circumstances of generation - is softened (though not essentially counteracted) by the occasional successful borrowing of this kind. It looks handsome on the Royal Opera stage: a marriage of clean lines and vivid images, Civil War verismo and heightened Romantic psychodrama. It unfolds with urgency graded to match the atmospheric intensities of the score. Serban himself has not been around to supervise the transfer, but in his place Jonathan Eaton skilfully recreates the complexities of motivation in which the original show abounded. The scene with the wedding veil into which the polonaise is studded is played with chamber-ensemble closeness of focus; around the abandoned Cinderella coach (a splendid poetic image) that forms the centrepiece of Act 3, a deeply moving drama of healing and reconciliation is built up. The production inspires Miss Anderson: that much is plain from the spontaneity and unforced glow of her characterisation, easily the freshest and most appealing she has given in London. Elvira is a role she has sung in many theatres: that much is also plain from the sheer expertise with which she 'plays' the vocal line, making the most not just of its bravura but of its simplest expressive effects, tossing in decorative details and high notes with a lightness that adds its own airy eloquence to the drama. The amplitude of her soprano tells wonderfully in ensembles; in the opera's long middle act one begins to note its lack of colour variety and warmth - but also the deftness with which she varies lyrical sentences and paragraphs. Sabbatini is an Italian tenor with style. The voice is not large, not startling in natural beauty of timbre; but it possesses virile Italianate vocal 'juice', and is used with a care for honeyed elegance of phrase-shading and emotionally affecting utterance that caresses Arturo's music, highlights its most ardent expressive facets. His treatment of the extravagant high notes put in for Rubini - not the celebrated famous F sharp but all the Cs, C sharps and Ds - shows admirable taste; he never yells, never blares, always maintains the musical shape. With his glittering eyes, sharply Roman profile and alert bearing he makes the species of Bellini tenor hero seem one of opera's most elevated. The remaining members of the Puritani quartet are less remarkable. Robert Lloyd's bass counsellor is sung and acted with gentleness, authority and distinction, in tones too monochrome to do full justice to the Chopin-esque elegy of 'Cinta di fiori'. I fear the much-hyped Dmitry Hvorostovsky has been ill-advised to tackle so demanding a bel canto baritone role as Riccardo at this point in his vocal development. He looks handsome, and prowls the stage with generalised Byronic fervour; he is good at suave cantabile lying in mid-range. What he lacks, worryingly, is a secure, resonant top; for the ringing martial close to Act 2 the big guns are audibly missing. Daniele Gatti, a livewire Italian conductor, seems determined to explode singlehandedly all past criticisms of Bellini's orchestration. He gets bright, forward orchestral playing with a firm rhythmic profile  - keen strings, particularly. On Tuesday his interventionist beat tended to drive the singers hard, nipping at their vocal heels, inhibiting the full flow of their phrase-shapes. Enthusiasm of the sort is a fault on the right side: Mr Gatti plainly loves the opera, and urges the audience to share his passion. Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. In repertory until June 4</p>

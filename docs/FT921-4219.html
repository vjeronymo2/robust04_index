			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Winds of change may be gaining pace in Ecuador: Sarita Kendall examines the pre-election mood THERE ARE strong winds blowing everywhere else,' said a leading Quito businessman, 'but not even a breeze here.' That was a little unfair to Ecuador President Rodrigo Borja, who has begun the process of opening-up the country, albeit more gradually than most of his neighbours. Tariffs have been lowered and tax reforms introduced, and Ecuador now finally expects to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and is taking part in regional trade agreements. Nevertheless, the fear that Ecuador is being left behind by political and economic developments in Latin America has strengthened the chances of the two front-running candidates in May's first round of presidential elections: Mr Sixto Duran and Mr Duran, both linked to the private sector. The state apparatus has, if anything, grown in size and power under the current Social Democrat government. Relations between the public and private sectors have been thoroughly acrimonious and were exacerbated by a recent dispute over the price of medicines which led to arrests. Foreign investors are so frustrated by bureaucratic tangles and the slow pace of negotiations that, according to one oil man, 'we sometimes wonder whether they really want foreign companies here.' Despite its rich resource base and stable democratic government since 1979, Ecuador's per capita income dropped during the 1980s, following the Latin American trend. While annual inflation never reached triple figures, it has remained around 50 per cent over the last three years. This year's aim is to reduce the rate to 30 per cent by June, but, with elections approaching, there is pressure to ease off austerity and encourage economic reactivation. It seems unlikely that the government and the banks will make any progress towards resolving the debt problem at this late stage. The total foreign debt stands close to Dollars 12bn, and Ecuador has reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club. But the government's unshakeable proposal for a 70 per cent discount on the Dollars 5.7bn commercial debt, combined with its failure to keep up full interest payments, has left bankers disenchanted. Although banana and shrimp exports leapt to record levels last year, oil still contributes about 40 per cent of foreign earnings and half of fiscal income: lower oil prices are having a serious impact on government finances. Oil production has stabilised at about 300,000 barrels a day, with small new fields compensating for declining reserves in the older structures. But the revamped and inflated state oil corporation has stalled on new exploration contracts. Infrastructure and the public services have suffered as a result of keeping charges dampened down and lack of investment. Low rainfall along the eastern Andean cordillera reduced the water flow into the country's main hydro-electric at Paute to a dribble. Electricity cuts of more than 10 hours a day in early February disrupted industries, services, traffic, lights and homes, while officials argued about who was to blame - not so much for the drought, as for the poor planning and silted up reservoir which foretell future electricity shortages. Mr Borja did, however, enjoy a sudden spurt in popularity as a result of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's visit to Ecuador in January. Quito's residents gave Mr Fujimori an expectedly warm welcome, and both the Ecuadorean military and political candidates have been forced to recognise that the 50-year-old south-eastern border problem is no longer an issue to rouse Ecuadoreans. An 'honourable' solution now seems possible, perhaps involving papal arbitration and Ecuadorean access to the Amazon river. Both Mr Duran, who leads the presidential opinion polls, and Mr Nebot, who is second, apparently favour a border agreement. Those further down the list  -there are 12 presidential candidates in all - probably have little chance of victory, though the run-off system can cause surprises: unless one candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the vote on May 17, when congressional and local government elections also take place, the two leading contenders go forward to a second round in July. Mr Duran, a former public works minister launched by the United Republican Party, presents himself as the friendly, experienced businessman who can get roads built and pull the country out of economic stagnation without radical upsets. Mr Nebot, younger, less predictable and more charismatic, has strong support from the private sector of Guayaquil and belongs to the Social Christian Party. Economic liberalisation, privatisation and attracting foreign investment form part of both candidates' platform. The next president, who will take office on August 10, not only has a backlog of financial and economic problems to deal with, he must also face the fact that Ecuador is no longer such a peaceful backwater. Bomb scares, murders and armed robberies are commonplace. Drug use, drug trafficking and money laundering are increasing and estimates of the drug money filtering through now run from Dollars 500m to over Dollars 1bn. While Ecuador is still seen as a drug transit country rather than a production centre, Mr Borja's successor may have trouble keeping it thus.</p>

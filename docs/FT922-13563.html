			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong It is tempting to blame the 4 per cent fall in the Hang Seng index in the first four days of this week on British politics. Hong Kong investors could not easily ignore the possible impact of the election on UK relations with China, not to mention the choice of a new governor. That may be one excuse for nervousness. But, as with the Hongkong Bank's bid for Midland, it is a minor one. The more immediate impulse has been weakness in Tokyo and, until yesterday, Wall Street. Fears of distress selling by Japanese investors are overdone, but Hong Kong's trade-orientated economy would certainly suffer from a Japanese slowdown. Similarly, US reservations about recovery are scarcely encouraging. The question is how far these factors justify re-rating the Hong Kong market, especially after yesterday's easing by the Federal Reserve. It is too early to conclude definitely that the problems facing Japanese banks make a deep recession inevitable. A weak US recovery is a two-edged sword for Hong Kong. Exports will be weaker, but, since the territory's currency peg forces it to track US interest rates, local borrowing costs will be held down. An expected rise of more than 20 per cent in corporate earnings this year puts the market on an undemanding multiple of about 12. There should be scope for the Hang Seng to resume its upward course, but events in Japan suggest greater caution than before.</p>

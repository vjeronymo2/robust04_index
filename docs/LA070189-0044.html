An autopsy was completed Thursday, and medical  examiners found multiple stab wounds, he said.  </P> <P> There were no suspects, and investigators had been unable to identify the  victim. She was described as black, 20 to 35 years old, wearing a black jacket,  and a pink and black shirt with matching shorts.  </P> <P> Ferrand said detectives were unable to match her description with reports of  missing women.

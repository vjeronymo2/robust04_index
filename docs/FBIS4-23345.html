			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 2 SAPA -- None of the standing  committees that have to approve legislation before it can be  debated in Parliament have been finalised, the head of  Parliament's committee section, Mr Willem Fourie, said on  Thursday. He said the composition of some of the multiparty  committees should be decided "in the next day or so".    There had been delays in getting names of prospective  committee members from parties and there had also been queries  over incomplete or defective lists.    He had been asked to expedite the formation of the  constitutional affairs, education, finance, home affairs,  justice, public accounts and security services committees  because there was apparently legislation for them in the  pipeline.    He had been hoping it would be possible to reduce the number  of committees from 26, or one for each ministerial portfolio, to  about 18.    He made this proposal to the African National Congress but  was told they were "not very happy with that".    "At this point I'm not sure how many there will be  eventually," he said.</p>

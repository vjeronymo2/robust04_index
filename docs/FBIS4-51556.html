			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Two former executive  officials of major contractor Obayashi Corp. pleaded guilty  Monday [25 April] to a charge that they sent a 10 million yen  bribe in 1992 to then Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii, in connection  with a municipal public works project.    Ishii, 68, denied taking any money from Obayashi and pleaded  innocence.    Ishii's accomplice Mitsuo Moriya, 66, who was his one-time  aide and charged with conspiring with the mayor to accept the  bribe on Ishii's behalf, said he took delivery of the money but  denied a prosecution contention that it was a bribe and that the  two conspired to take it.    Ishii, Moriya and the two businessmen entered separate pleas  at their first trial session at the Tokyo District Court on  Monday.    It is the last in a series of trials on alleged payments to  local government officials by major construction contractors.    The two Obayashi executives are Koreaki Hagiwara, 66, former  vice president of Obayashi, Japan's fourth largest construction  firm based in Osaka, and Juichi Konishi, 59, former head of the  builder's Tohoku branch in Sendai.    The two are charged with giving the 10 million yen bribe to  Ishii on Oct. 7, 1992.    Hagiwara and Konishi told the court they gave Ishii the  money  to help his mayoral election campaign, accepting a prosecution  argument their action constituted bribery.    Ishii, who resigned as mayor after his arrest last year, is  also on trial on charges of receiving bribes from several other  major contractors in similar attempts to get orders for public  works projects in Sendai.    A series of bribery scandals has implicated eight  contractors  -- Hazama Corp., Shimizu Corp., Nishimatsu Construction Co.,  Mitsui Construction Co., Taisei Corp., Kajima Corp., Obayashi  Corp. and Tobishima Corp. as well as Daishowa Paper Mfg. Co.    In the series, 31 people, including two governors, two  mayors  and more 20 executives of construction companies have been  indicted.    The only remaining trial related to alleged bribery by major  contractors is that of former Construction Minister Kishiro  Nakamura expected some time between late June and early July.</p>

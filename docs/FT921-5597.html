			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Lloyd's ball bounces in the solicitors' court: A look at the complex collection of cases being prepared on behalf of anxious Names THESE are busy times for Mr Michael Freeman, senior partner in a small solicitors' firm in London's West End. Last week he was in the House of Lords arguing a technical point of law arising from a legal action he is conducting on behalf of 33 Lloyd's Names from the defunct 1981-82 Oakeley Vaughan syndicate. The Names - individuals whose capital backs underwriting at the Lloyd's insurance market - claim Lloyd's was negligent in not closing down Oakeley Vaughan and that it failed to warn them of an unfavourable internal report on their syndicate and its underwriters. Mr Freeman was also busy co-ordinating an action on behalf of more than 600 Names to prevent Lloyd's drawing on the cash deposits or bank guarantees individuals put up to cover loses when they become Names. This move threatens to compromise the market's ability to meet claims. The position was complicated by the decision of Lloyd's to defend the action. but Mr Freeman has to issue individual writs on behalf of each of the Names involved. Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, has warned Names that the actions will fail and add legal costs to the bills they already face. He has also said that Lloyd's would meet insurance claims over the next month that would otherwise be met from the funds deposited by Names, and that Names would eventually have to meet the cost. Faced with heavy losses, many Names cannot afford a protracted legal battle. Many lawyers in the City feel that Mr Freeman's action is unlikely to do more than delay the inevitable - but this may not matter. What Names want most, say many lawyers, is some form of settlement which avoids the need for them to take protracted legal action and offers financial help with their losses. They argue that Lloyd's faces legal action from disgruntled Names on so many fronts that it could crash unless a rescue package is mounted soon to provide the cash to meet outstanding claims. Mr Guy Sutton, a partner with City solicitors Norton Rose, is co-ordinating claims by 150 Names who belonged to the Lime Street members' agency, which has ceased trading. Their claims are typical of potential lawsuits by Names. The allegations about Lime Street include failure to follow instructions, professional incompetence in placing husband and wife Names on the same high-risk catastrophe reinsurance syndicates, and the placing of Names on a higher proportion of high-risk syndicates than was prudent. Some Lime Street Names have joined actions against the syndicates run by Feltrim and Gooda Walker. Most of those actions - like the recently settled Outhwaite litigation - turn on the issue of underwriting negligence. For the rest the only course has been to instruct Norton Rose to write to Lloyd's and request an inquiry into Lime Street. That letter was sent in December, and Lloyd's has set up five inquiries into the biggest loss-making syndicates in 1988, the latest year to report. But Norton Rose says Lloyd's has done nothing about Lime Street except refer the case to its professional conduct department. Mr Sutton believes the crisis at Lloyd's is so serious that the government or the Bank of England will have to step in and provide the cash needed for Lloyd's to pay claims. That would be followed by a rescue scheme allowing Names to escape liability for some losses and pay the remainder over a period of time. He says a rescue package is unlikely to come from 'mutualisation' - spreading losses among Names who have made money in recent years. They will be reluctant to pick up the tab for others they feel have been misinformed, misled or just plain foolish. 'It is very important for the City that Lloyd's survives,' Mr Sutton says. 'To be honest, if it wasn't for the fact that we are facing an imminent election I would have expected some kind of rescue to have been organised by now.' Lawyers themselves have not escaped without blame. There is a view growing in the City that the only people who stand to gain from the present situation were the lawyers. Cynics suspect that in these recessionary times lawyers are only too willing to encourage actions against Lloyd's. This is a little unfair. One thing law firms do not lack in a recession is litigation work. Firms involved in the Lloyd's lawsuits are also, with the possible exception of Michael Freeman, recognised insurance experts. Norton Rose is one of the UK's top 10 law firms by size, and is rated in the top three for commercial litigation. Richards Butler and DJ Freeman are also in the top 50 by size, and Elborne Mitchell is in the top 100 in London. Few Names faced with losses could afford the Pounds 250 to Pounds 300 an hour normally charged by these firms. Because the Names' circumstances vary so much there is no prospect of clubbing together in a group action. If lawyers become bogged down in protracted litigation on behalf of Names, there is a very real prospect that, if they are paid, it may be at a vastly reduced rate. That would render the work barely profitable. Many of the Lime Street Names who clubbed together to instruct Norton Rose to write to Lloyd's have joined the litigation against Lloyd's launched in November by New York lawyers Proskauer Rose under the US 'no win, no pay' contingent fee system. In the UK it appears to be in everyone's interests to reach an out-of-court settlement. If the government does not mount a rescue scheme, there may be much to be said for the suggestion from Mr Ian Hay Davison, former deputy chairman and chief executive of Lloyd's, that an effective arbitration process might provide the best way out.</p>

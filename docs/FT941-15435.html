			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters bounces A much-vaunted deal between Reuters Holdings and Citicorp to acquire the latter's Quotron equity dealing system in the US was announced yesterday and saw the Reuters share price bounce 28 to 1853p in a lifeless market. Most analysts welcomed the deal and Mr Alastair Smellie of US house Lehman Brothers said Citicorp's statement that it proposed to 'guarantee certain operating losses' sugg-ested that Citicorp might actually pay Reuters to take on a business estimated to have lost Dollars 50m in 1993. 'Assuming completion at the right price, this represents an excellent deal for Reuters,' added Mr Smellie. Mr Paul Norris of BZW said: 'This is the last piece in a golden jigsaw of acquiring domestic equity real time information services and a terrific move for Reuters. I can see the shares hitting Pounds 20 over the next month.' The first whisper of the Quotron deal, which is still only agreed in principle, came just before Christmas and sent the shares up to 1880p. Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was hit by a spate of negative stories. The most bearish was the formal launch by SmithKline Beecham of a new drug in the UK. Famvir, a treatment for shingles, is a direct competitor to Wellcome's key product, Zovirax. Although fears of a price war were dispelled recently when SmithKline priced Famvir only marginally lower than Zovirax, bearish analysts said the dosage  -three tablets a day compared with five for Wellcome's product - would undermine Zovirax sales. SmithKline also claimed its product had clinical advantages. There was also news of legal action in the UK against Wellcome, which makes the anti-Aids treatment AZT, or Retrovir. Finally, revelation that results of last year's massive French study into AZT are to be published in the Lancet medical journal shortly renewed worries over the drug's reputation. Wellcome shares dropped 24 to 650p, while SmithKline Beecham 'A' advanced 6 to 407p. SmithKline further benefited from a recommendation by Kleinwort Benson to switch from Zeneca, which retreated 17 1/2 to 825p. Results well ahead of market expectations sent Rank Organisation smartly forward and added to analysts' optimism that the leisure sector is on course for recovery. Rank reported improvements in most of its divisions and was optimistic over prospects for 1994. Leisure analysts upgraded forecasts, with NatWest on Pounds 321m and Credit Lyonnais Laing on Pounds 340m, excluding a one-off Pounds 36m charge for Rank Xerox. The Rank results follow similar outperformance this week by Stakis, the hotels group, and solid figures from First Leisure, the ten-pin bowling and nightclub company. Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court, who yesterday moved Rank to a 'buy', said: 'The leisure sector is at last turning. The upturn is unlikely to be dramatic, but at these levels selected stocks are undemanding.' Rank shares appreciated 20 to 1001p, First Leisure 19 to 310p and Stakis 3 to 78p. Drugs group Medeva forged ahead 14 to 156 1/2 p as the US Food and Drug Administration rehabilitated its US subsidiary, seven months after warning that it did not meet production standards. There were several strong movements among food retailing and manufacturing stocks as investors continued to hunt for bargains. Hillsdown Holdings added 10 at 184p following meetings with analysts on Wednesday. Tate &amp; Lyle moved forward 17 1/2 to 446 1/2 p after a presentation by a US food manufacturer boded well for some of the UK group's American operations. RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, fell 15 to 813p as a surplus of stock in the market was compounded by worries over the price of copper. GKN resisted the impact of a Hoare Govett downgrade, the shares losing only a penny to 568 1/2 p. The broker trimmed its forecast by Pounds 8m to Pounds 92m. Trafalgar House eased 3 to 95p after Swiss Bank Corporation said the ordinary stock was overvalued.</p>

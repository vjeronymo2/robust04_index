			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ludwig Rademacher report: "The Move Toward Instead"] </F>   [Text] Associations of voters, such as the Hamburg Instead  Party will change Germany's political scenery in the 1994  superelection year. They might achieve almost 30 percent of the  votes. This is the result of a poll conducted by the Institute  for Applied Social Studies (Infas).    According to the poll, 6 percent of all voters are sure that  they want to vote for such a group. Another 23 percent think  they will "probably" vote for such a group.    In December, the Bonn-based institute polled 914  representative voters for FOCUS, asking their opinion of the  Instead Party.    The Instead Party was founded in the summer of 1993 by  Hamburg Christian Democratic Union "rebel" Markus E. Wegner. It  only ran in the repetition of the land parliament elections,  which Wegner had finally achieved by court order. The party won  5.6 percent of the votes and entered into a government coalition  with the Social Democratic Party.    Encouraged by the success in Hamburg, voters' associations  in  all laender are now forming Instead Parties; and an expansion  throughout Germany is already agreed. Whether the Instead Party  runs in the Bundestag elections next autumn will be decided  during the summer.    The prospects for the party are good: Every other voter  thinks that the Instead Party is a necessary addition to  existing parties. There might be some skeptical attitudes on the  issue of consistency: 57 percent of those polled think that the  Instead Party "will have disappeared before long." According to  the study, the Instead Party's greatest potential lies with  younger voters. A total of 72 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds  consider such groups necessary, while only 38 percent of those  over 50 think so, and 49 percent of them consider these groups  superfluous. Among the middle-aged, 46 percent think such  groups are necessary, while 33 percent do not think much of them.    On the whole, men are more inclined towards the Instead  Party  than women. The party's potential lies with workers,  self-employed people, and freelancers.</p>

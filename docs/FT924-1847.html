			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / BT customers 'more satisfied' MOST British Telecommunications customers believe the company gives good value for money, a survey by Oftel, the regulatory body, says. The 53 per cent figure, up from 46 per cent last year, reverses a trend over recent years. Only 8 per cent of the 1,905 people polled last month said they were dissatisfied with BT, down from 10 per cent last year. Twenty seven per cent complained of poor value against 37 per cent last year.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Two-part article by 'Abbas Darvish Tavangar, "Experts Deal </F> With the 1373 Budget Bill"]    [14 Mar pp 1, 16]    [Part 1]    [Text] The Majles procedure for dealing with the 1373 [21  March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill can be studied from  various perspectives. One can say that the Majles measures in  this regard are unprecedented in the past 15 years.    The reduction in the expenses of the government and  government organizations, the fight against ostentation and  extravagance, better supervision over government and public  organizations and companies, the emphasis on reducing foreign  exchange commitments and the prohibition on increased prices for  public goods and services can be considered the most important  measures enacted by the Fourth Majles.    The implementation of the First Five-Year Plan plan was done  with economic pressures on the low-income classes. Although  these pressures came from investment in some basic  infrastructure in Iran's economy, since sufficient measures were  not taken beforehand to support the oppressed classes and no  thought was given to fixed incomes, its continuation in the old  way created many problems for the deprived.    Wage and salary increases did not keep up with inflation,  and  the most important law to support the consumer was never  prepared for enforcement during this plan.    Without carefully assessing the effects and consequences of  the decision to increase the prices of public goods and  services, prices increased with or without the approval of the  Economic Council.    Unfortunately, in some cases the reasons for these increases  were not explained to the people.    The question is not whether these increases were the  required  amounts or were made carefully with consideration for the  probable effects and consequences. The issue is, before these  kinds of decisions are taken some thought must be given to  supporting the oppressed and the poor, as the real owners of the  Islamic revolution, and to preventing them from coming under  pressure. It was on this basis that Note 25 in the budget bill  was controversial among the Majles deputies. Ultimately, after  debates and expert studies in the Majles, increases in the  prices of oil by-products (such as kerosene, gasoline and gas  oil) were rejected and raising the price of electrical power for  96.3 percent of household consumers (up to 500 kilowatts) was  accepted. The other items in this note were approved with  adjustments.    Emphasis on reducing foreign exchange commitments in the  year  1373 is another of the characteristics of the budget bill  approved by the Majles. Due to excessive imports, sometimes of  consumer goods, and the emergence of a trade deficit, the  nation's commitments increased. The lack of appropriate  management for the aforementioned commitments created worries  among the people, and this is the main cause of fluctuations in  the prices of goods and services, and especially the foreign  exchange rate on the free market. (1) By the end of the current  year this situation led to about $30 billion in commitments, $15  to $20 billion in debts and $10 to $11 billion in suspended  debts for Iran's economy.    The exalted leader His Holiness Ayatollah Khamene'i  emphasized: "taking the necessary measures for keeping the  country away from foreign borrowing and efforts to break free of  current commitments" (4) [as published] as one of the policies  governing the compilation of the Second Five-Year Plan. In its  study of the 1373 budget, the Majles gave attention to  implementing the order from the exalted leader. The first  measure the Majles took was to make budget approval a  two-consultation procedure. Thus, more realistic revenue levels  were approved and the amount of revenues from oil exports, which  was set by the government at $11.84 billion, was reduced to  $10.154 billion. In the second consultation, based on this same  revenue level, government expenses came down. The designation of  expenses at the level of approved revenues will not prevent  other expenditures from taking place if the nation's foreign  exchange revenues increase.    The second move by the Majles was to cut $1.6 billion out of  the foreign exchange commitments at the end of the year 1373  compared to the first part of this year, which was set in the  government's bill at $1 billion.    The third move was that the foreign exchange reserves  account, which was being kept at the Central Bank without  authorization from the Majles, was put in order by the Majles  deputies. It was decided that 15 percent of the revenues from  the sale of oil would be deposited in this account at the  official rate and would be used solely to pay foreign exchange  commitments. Based on this measure, the government has no right  to spend funds from this account except for this purpose. Of  course other expenditures may be made with Majles authorization.  Footnotes    [.sup]1.[/] Late in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March  1993] the rate for the dollar on the free market was 2,610 rials  [R], and it increased to R2,700 by late in the current year.  With Iran's agreements with Germany and Japan, this rate has  dropped to R2,310 today.    [.sup]2.[/] Paragraph D, Note 11, Policies Governing the  Second Five-Year Plan    [15 Mar pp 1, 16]    [Part 2]    [Text] The management of foreign exchange resources was not  really done well during the First Five-Year Plan. Under the  First Five-Year Plan authorization was given for up to $29.9  million in new commitments for specific projects.[.sup]1[/]  Although no definitive opinion can be given in this regard,  based on the preliminary estimates, $10 billion and at best $15  billion of the commitments created were in accordance with the  designated projects under the Five-Year Plan. The Plan and  Budget Organization has the definitive figures. Unfortunately,  in violation of the law, this organization has not yet announced  its report on the plan's performance[.sup]2[/] to permit  documentation of the figures.    Therefore, the government did not intend to make $30 billion  in commitments in every area, and the claim that the figure 30  was deliberately chosen is correct, but its uses were not in  accordance with the Five-Year Plan. Second, most of the  outstanding debts are usance and short-term debt, although in  the measures approved under the Five-Year Plan, usance purchases  in this form were not to have taken place.    It must be noted that $10 billion in outstanding debt in an  economy like Iran's, which has rich wealth, cannot cause  problems. For this reason, the approach taken to this issue by  the West is more political than economic. Many countries have  several times the amount of debt that Iran has, but nothing is  even mentioned about them.    In any case, the outstanding debts are something that  happened in the past, but since this was not managed well by the  Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs and the Central Bank,  the problems came with it.    The reduction in government expenses and anchoring  government  companies can be said to be the most important characteristic of  the 1373 budget bill. After the reduction in the oil revenues  ceiling in the first consultation, which was necessarily  followed by a reduction in government expenditures, some  government organizations did not cooperate as required. Others  took a position against this Majles decision.[.sup]3[/] At  the same time the respected deputies, despite the lack of  cooperation from some of the government's experts and  representatives, themselves made new decisions concerning the  government companies using expert studies, and one might be able  to say that implementation of these revolutionary decisions in  the government companies will become general.[.sup]4[/]    One of the problems with regard to these companies is that  the real number of them is not given in the budget bills. By the  end of the year 1371 [20 March 1993] 2,221 companies had been  identified, of which 900 are clearly government  companies.[.sup]5[/] Thanks to the inept management of the  Plan and Budget Organization, the number of government companies  was announced as being approximately 400 units.[.sup]6[/] The  surprising thing is that even of this number that was confirmed,  all did not submit their figures for inclusion in the budget  bill. In the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget bill, of  424 government companies, banks and profit-making institutions  affiliated with the government, 284 units submitted their  figures.[.sup]7[/]    Despite the fact that these companies draw from general  revenues all of their profits are not deposited into the  Treasury, yet their losses are imposed on the budget. Because  the government and public companies have more privileges than  other companies, one does not compete with them on equal terms.  The law is not even enforced in many of these companies. The  8,750 reports on failure to obey the law and the 1,066  management violations in 1,567 companies and government and  public institutions support this claim.[.sup]8[/]    Among the reasons there is a budget deficit every year is  these very government and public companies. With their  extravagance and ostentation, they impose the costs of their  uneconomical management on the budget. The budget deficit was to  have been reduced to zero in the year 1372, but this problem  still remains. According to the preliminary estimates from the  Plan and Budget Organization, by the end of the current year [20  March 1994] the budget deficit will be R2,139.[.sup]9[/] If  we add to this figure the R2,500 billion in Treasury imprest  funds and the R3,400 billion in banking facilities these  companies received, the scope of the problem becomes clearer.    In the 1373 budget the Majles made some very good decisions  on government companies and public institutions. No matter how  good the decisions are, however, if they are not implemented or  if they do not have good executive officials, all the efforts of  the Majles and the government will be wasted. Therefore it is  considered necessary to deal with the violator, regardless of  his rank.[.sup]10[/]  Footnotes    [.sup]1.[/] These projects and the amount of their  commitments consist of $10 billion in buybacks, $2.2 billion for  petrochemical projects, $3.2 billion for the Pars gas fields, $3  billion for the Karun 3, Jariani, Chahar Karkheh and Gavmishan  dams, $1.5 billion for the Haft Tepeh, Karun and Kesht complexes  and the sugarcane industries, $7.5 billion for investment in the  1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] budget law and $2.5 billion  to create added value through the construction of machinery and  equipment to produce goods and implement domestic projects.    [.sup]2.[/] Note 34 of the First Five-Year Plan Law: The  Plan and Budget Organization is required to exercise continuous  supervision over the operations of the executive organizations  and to submit a report to the government and the Majles  commissions every six months concerning the progress of  operations and their conformity with reaching the designated  goals in the Five-Year Plan.    [.sup]3.[/] After the approval of the first consultation  on the budget bill and the setting of a cap on revenues, Mr.  Mohammad Khan, minister of economic and financial affairs, again  asked the Majles to bring the 1373 budget into conformity with  the government's bill (RESALAT 11/17/1372 [6 February 1994]).    [.sup]4.[/] Some of the decisions the Majles took with  regard to the government organizations and companies were the  requirement to submit a budget for 16 government and public  companies to the Majles for approval, the prohibition on  expanding the organizational facilities of government companies,  the absolute prohibition on purchasing nonessential and  nonadministrative supplies, the absolute prohibition on paying  designated funds to employees working abroad, the prohibition on  printing calendars, annuals and advertisements offering  congratulations and condolences, the prohibition on buying or  renting private aircraft, the prohibition on creating  representative and administrative offices outside the country,  the prohibition on using government vehicles outside office  hours, and the prohibition on ostentation.    [.sup]5.[/] Report from the Supreme Supervision Council in  the National Auditing Organization, Tir 1372 [22 June-22 July].    [.sup]6.[/] Mr. Rowghani-Zanjani: The number of government  companies is 400 units. Some 2,000 units have not yet been  statistically proven for the government. (RESALAT 9/30/1372 [21  December 1993])    [.sup]7[/] and [.sup]8[/]. Report from the Supreme  Supervision Council in the National Auditing Organization, Tir  1372.    [.sup]9.[/] According to the latest estimate from the Plan  and Budget Organization, the deficit in the general budget for  1372 is R2,139 billion, an increase over the R1,077-billion  deficit in the 1371 budget deficit. IRNA (RESALAT 12/18/1372 [8  March 1994])    [.sup]10.[/] In Part 1 of this editorial the price of the  dollar at the end of the year 1372 was given incorrectly. The  correct price is R1,610.</p>

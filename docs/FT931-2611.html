			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Ahold to increase payout by 10% AHOLD, the Dutch-based food retailer, is to lift its dividend by 10.6 per cent, matching the increase reported yesterday in 1992 full-year results. The company also said that it would conduct a one-for-10 rights issue later this year, with details to be released on April 14. Ahold posted 1992 net profit of Fl 305.0m (Dollars 163m) last year from Fl 275.8m the year before, on sales up 7.3 per cent at Fl 22.3bn. The dual-currency dividend is to be raised to Fl 1.15 and Dollars 0.45 a share from Fl 1.05 and Dollars 0.40 last year. The company said net profit would have been Fl 8.1m higher but for the 6 per cent decline of the dollar against the guilder. Ahold generates half of its annual sales in the US, where it operates four leading supermarket chains. US operating profit rose by 16.8 per cent to Dollars 169.6m, thanks to increased results at three of its four chains. In the Netherlands, where the group's Albert Heijn chain is the market leader, operating results were up 14 per cent at Fl 222.1m. Overall, consolidated operating profit rose by 11.3 per cent to Fl 519.4bn. However, interest expenses increased by nearly 12 per cent to Fl 156.0m.</p>

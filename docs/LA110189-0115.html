			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> LOG CABIN DREAM NOW A NIGHTMARE  </P> <P> When Leo Black found a great deal on some logs a couple years ago, he bought  them and set his heart on building a log cabin in a bucolic setting on the  Central California coast.  </P> <P> But after the real estate deal fell through and the logs sat idle in his  driveway, he found himself mired in less-than-tranquil circumstances, facing  angry neighbors and a pending court order to get rid of his logs.  </P> <P> "There's not much I can do about it," said Black, who placed advertisements to  sell the logs in local newspapers Tuesday morning. "If I can't sell them in 14  days, I'm just going to cut them up and try to sell them for firewood."  </P> <P> About 2 1/2 years ago Black, a 20-year resident of Cypress, bought the lumber  from a shipping company in Wilmington, paying $3,500 for the log cabin kit. He  says the kit included everything needed to build a log cabin, except for the  roof, windows and door.  </P> <P> At the same time, he was trying to buy property near Lake Santa Margarita near  San Luis Obispo. It seemed a perfect match, with the land almost bought and the  cabin kit in hand.  </P> <P> "I could put it together myself, that's my business," said Black, an electrical  contractor employed by De Maria Electric in Wilmington. "I can do it with my  hands. It's no problem."  </P> <P> But when the property sale fell through, problems mounted.  </P> <P> For six months, Black ignored orders from the city of Cypress to remove the  logs from his driveway, where they had been declared a public nuisance. On  Monday, he appealed to the City Council to allow him to keep the 12-foot logs  until January, when he said he would be able to move them.  </P> <P> That motion was denied. Now, he has 14 days to remove the logs or face a court  order allowing the city to remove them and send the bill to him.  </P> <P> "I can't afford to pay the city, there's no telling what they'll charge me,"  said Black, 34. "I'm a single parent with three kids; I can't afford to take  time off and haul them up north."  </P> <P> According to the city Planning Department, the logs violate the public nuisance  ordinance of the city code.  </P> <P> So now, Black says, he has no choice but to sell the logs and hope to break  even while he laments the way his neighbors and the city have handled the  situation.  </P> <P> Eight complaint letters have been sent to the city since April; however, none  of the neighbors involved could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> "I think the worst thing about it was there was this big sign in the yard,  'Public Nuisance,' " Black said. "I felt really degraded."  </P> <P> Black considers himself a good citizen.  </P> <P> He coaches boys' soccer for a city team every weekday and helps neighbors with  their electrical problems when they need him. For the past 10 years he has  lived in his one-story house on the cul-de-sac of New Mexico Lane, and for  seven years before that, he lived directly across the street. He maintains his  garden and trims his lawn just as neighbors do, he said, and has never  complained when another neighbor's front yard was not up to par.  </P> <P> "It seems kind of strange," he said of his neighbors' complaints. "I thought we  were friends."  </P> <P> He said he is trying not to mourn too heavily the loss of his dream of a log  cabin in the country. Originally from Utah, Black called himself "kind of a  country boy at heart" who knows that someday he will be "someplace where  there's mountains and it snows."

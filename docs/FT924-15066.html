			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Egyptians warned on trade plans EGYPT's programme of trade liberalisation and economic reform could be torpedoed by domestic opposition if not supported by a successful Uruguay Round and an effective multilateral trading system, a Gatt report on its trade policies and practices says. Gatt praises Egypt's economic reform programme, introduced in 1990 to push the economy towards market-based export-oriented development. But it warns this could be imperilled by interest groups which have created uncertainty about its success. The reforms are independent of the Uruguay Round's outcome, but 'pressure from such groups may become more difficult to resist if the multilateral trading system is not seen to be working effectively'. Gatt's governing council welcomed Egypt's will to press on with its policies, though high tariffs were criticised. A speedy end to the Round would improve access to developed markets for Egypt's textiles and farm goods.</p>

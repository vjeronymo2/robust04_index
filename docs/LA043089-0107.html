			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: PHYLLIS DILLER TO BE NAMED FOUNDER OF HOPE AT GALA  </P> <P> Phyllis Diller, on the arm of prominent attorney and Anglophile Robert Hastings  the other evening when Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife, Marilyn,  appeared at the Beverly Hilton, is in the spotlight again tonight.  </P> <P> The Founders for Diabetic Research in association with the City of Hope will  bestow the Founder of Hope upon the popular comedian. Beverly Hills  philanthropists Hal and Cynthia Gershman are underwriting the gala. Honorary  chairman Ruta Lee, plus Bob Hope, Rich Little, Jack Carter, Alex Trebek and  Dick Gautier are scheduled to join the tribute.  </P> <P> MUSIC LOVERS: We weren't there, but we were told the highlight of the Los  Angeles Chamber Orchestra Founders Ball at the Beverly Wilshire was the  performance of Mozart's G Minor Piano Quartet K.478 by Andre Previn; Iona  Brown, the Chamber's music director and violinist; cellist Nathaniel Rosen; and  the Chamber's principal violist Roland Kato.  </P> <P> Benefit party co-chair Jennifer Diener and her husband, Royce, will celebrate  with a luncheon for benefit friends Friday in Santa Monica. They'll also be  celebrating Richard D. Colburn's $100,000 contribution to match the recent  National Endowment for the Arts' three-to-one $100,000 challenge grant for the  chamber endowment.  </P> <P> APOLOGIES: In the Hathaway Children's Services benefit photo April 9, Olivia  Newton-John was pictured with Brian Cahill, Hathaway president, not  Newton-John's business partner Pat Farrar.  </P> <P> SUNDAY IN THE PARK: Ever mindful that charities must tap new sources, the  Pasadena YWCA decided to commemorate its 80th year of service to the San  Gabriel Valley by lumping all its fund-raisers into one event.  </P> <P> Today, from 5 to 9 p.m., the Y hopes to raise $50,000 through $100 "park  passes" to "The YWCA Presents . . . Sunday in the Park" at the Pasadena Hilton.  Norma Sandusky-Coombs heads the effort with Yvonne Benson, Carol Bramhall,  Nancy Wheat, JoAnne Burr, Mary Pinola, Sharon Thralls, Betty Rhodes, Adelaide  Hixon, Rosalie Calderon, Joyce Sin Huang, Pat Lachelt, Barbara Martyn, Judy  Norquist, Jean Owen, Jil Sheldon and Gerry Silver.  </P> <P> KUDOS: To Ava and Charles Fries, celebrating the Charles W.

To the  National Center for Hyperactive Children, netting $200,000 on its gift-of-love  dinner.  </P> <P> SOUK-CESSFUL: The Pasadena Art Alliance can be counted on for original  wackiness. And now that its annual Treasure Sale -- Super Souk (a souk is a  Middle-Eastern marketplace) -- is over, they're $77,000 richer, president Sally  Hurt says.  </P> <P> Under chairman Marsha Bohr and committee members Jane Palmer, Edith Maguire,  Betty Urban, Marcy Fowler, Maybelle Wolfe, Betty Duker and Ricki de Kramer,  members collected treasures for months -- including all the costumes that Jane  Brewer and her late husband, Dr. Lyman Brewer, wore to the annual Bachelors  Ball.  </P> <P> Then the group moved in on the former Gene Burton shop on Lake  </P> <P> Street in Pasadena for a two-day sale with Alliance members such as Ann  Barrett, Carolyn Fox, Nancy Burrows, Betye Burton, Sallie Colmery, Peggy Phelps  and Kaholyn McKissick bargaining with customers.  </P> <P> Of course, there's always the preview party: Carol Bramhall, Diane Bedford  (wearing Moroccan wedding garb she purchased on a recent trip to Asia) and  Patsy Ketchum put together a tantalizing party with tabbouleh, lamb in pita  pockets and syrupy baklava.  </P> <P> SPRING LUNCHEONS: They came in bunches last week: Suzanne Marx hosted friends  at the Regency Club including Diane Disney of San Francisco and Ginny  Ueberroth. . . .  </P> <P> Pam King honored Anne Torell, former New Yorker and wife of John Torell, new  chairman of CalFed, with a luncheon, including Lucy Hubbard, Mary Tollenaere,  Kim Rollo, Linda Dickson and Susie Gordinier. . . .  </P> <P> Rose Mary Mitchell hurriedly moved her pink-clothed tables indoors because of  chilly vibes at the drop-in luncheon for friends, including Eileen Zimmerman,  Dee Maecheling, Peggy Galbraith, Joni Baker, Gabriella Barrett, Cheryl Baker,  Penny Bianchi and more; those in woollies were toasty, but those in spring  couture were frosty.  </P> <P> UPSCALE: J. Shelton Ellis Jr., executive director of Gump's, says that La Scala  Museum, adjacent to Milan's famed Opera House, and the government of Italy have  given permission for a major collection of artwork and scores to travel to the  United States. It's to be part of "A Tribute to Italy" Monday through May 20 at  Gump's in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> The opening evening Monday honors the Los Angeles Music Center Opera. On this  black-tie circuit will be Italian Consul Gen. Alberto Boniver; Italian Trade  Commissioner Francesco Paterno; maestro Giampiero Tintori, director, Museo  Teatrale Alla Scala; Peter Hemmings, general director of the Music Center  Opera; and Ellis.  </P> <P> ESCALATION: When Burt Sugarman and Mary Hart exchanged wedding vows on the  Dandeanna yacht in Marina del Rey, well-wishers danced on the moonlit deck to  the Bob Gail hip jazz quartet. Included were Lynda Carter, Robert Altman and  Diedra Hall. . . .  </P> <P> The Chrysalis Center raises funds Thursday at the Biltmore to assist Downtown  Skid Row residents. Johnny Mountain will emcee. . . . The Assistance League of  Pasadena's "Evening of Polo" was chaired by Sharon Pelton, aided by president  Lynn Paulson. It enables the league to maintain its California House for Senior  Citizens. . . .  </P> <P> The Music Center Reachout Committee partied at Doheny Mansion for its 15th  anniversary chaired by Delores S. Kerr. . . . Edie Frere chaired the Emphysema  Foundation "Breath of Life" family day at Magic Castle in Hollywood.  </P> <P> PLAUDITS: To the Huntington Library for outfoxing the weather. Its Christmas  Party was blown out by wind in December; its Easter Egg Hunt was done in by  rain, but Saturday was an OK day for a crowd loving the flowers at the  library's spring luncheon and garden party.  </P> <P> KEEPING UP: Smoke Tree Ranch in Palm Springs has been awash in frivolity such  as the IRS Weekend. The season closes this weekend and that's on the minds of  Anne Barbey, Elizabeth Barnes and John H. Welborne. . . .  </P></p>

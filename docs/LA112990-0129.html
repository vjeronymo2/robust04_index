			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAGLE ROCK PLAN TAKES SHAPE;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE EFFORT WOULD ENCOURAGE PRESERVATION OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS  ALONG COLORADO BOULEVARD AND OUTLAW MINI-MALLS ALONG MOST OF THE STRIP.  </P> <P> On April Fool's Day, 1986, Eagle Rock activist Kathleen Aberman climbed atop a  treasured old Colorado Boulevard commercial building and tried to ward off a  demolition crew. She was hauled off to jail, the brick storefront was destroyed  and a mini-mall was erected in its place.  </P> <P> Since then, community leaders have pursued a less dramatic, more time-consuming  approach to shaping development on Eagle Rock's main commercial street. In  cooperation with city planners, they've put together a set of strict new  building rules called the Colorado Boulevard Specific Plan.  </P> <P> The plan, which is nearing a critical final review by the Los Angeles City  Planning Commission, would impose height limits and new parking and landscaping  requirements. It would also encourage the preservation of historic buildings  and protect adjoining residential areas. Along most of the strip, it would  outlaw mini-malls.  </P> <P> For Aberman, the plan is a culmination of the community outcry that gathered  force after she spent a day behind bars.  </P> <P> "What we learned is, that's not the way to do it," she said. "You have to work  through the system."  </P> <P> To provide a stronger voice on development issues, Aberman helped organize The  Eagle Rock Assn., which is represented on the advisory committee that worked on  the Colorado Boulevard Specific Plan.  </P> <P> When the new development rules are adopted by the City Council, possibly in  mid-1991, Aberman said: "We will breathe a sigh of relief that we don't have to  worry whenever we see that something is for sale and wonder what's going to be  built there."  </P> <P> But one major hurdle remains.  </P> <P> The advisory committee has urged the city to create a design review board whose  membership would consist of Eagle Rock residents and business leaders. The  group would make sure Colorado Boulevard building proposals are consistent with  design guidelines for the area.  </P> <P> Early this year, city planning commissioners approved all other elements of the  building guide. But the commissioners said they would not establish a design  review board for the area unless the community comes up with a well-defined  building style to impose on developers.  </P> <P> Robert Duenas, a Los Angeles city planner, said his department has proposed  design review guidelines that would encourage Colorado Boulevard developers to  use a brick building style, prominent during the early 1900s. Other building  materials may be permitted in some cases, he said.  </P> <P> This design review proposal will be discussed by the Colorado Boulevard  advisory committee at a public meeting scheduled for 7 p.m. today at Eagle Rock  City Hall. The Los Angeles Planning Commission will reconsider establishing the  design review board Dec. 6.  </P> <P> Under the proposed architectural guidelines, developers would be urged to  include design elements that were common on old Eagle Rock buildings, such as  exterior bands or ledges that distinguish between each story.  </P> <P> Jeanmarie Hance-Murphy, a planning aide to Councilman Richard Alatorre, who  represents Eagle Rock, said city planners initially wanted to limit the design  review board's authority to a few blocks where the brick architectural style is  clearly evident. But she said Alatorre believes the review board should have  jurisdiction over a larger central section of Colorado Boulevard within Eagle  Rock, and Duenas said his department now supports that change.  </P> <P> The overall development guidelines would affect the commercial area between  Eagledale Avenue on the west and Eagle Vista Drive on the east.  </P> <P> This stretch is home to an array of businesses, including mini-malls,  carwashes, offices, inexpensive motels and restaurants, car-repair shops and  neighborhood retail stores. The boulevard has a mix of older and modern  buildings, some well-maintained and others in need of repair.  </P> <P> Supporters say the Colorado Boulevard plan will assure orderly construction of  attractive new businesses if the development boom that has occurred in  neighboring Glendale and Pasadena spreads to Eagle Rock.  </P> <P> Under the proposed plan, new buildings at the eastern and western ends of the  strip could be no taller than four stories, or 55 feet. In the central section,  between Windermere and Floristan avenues, the limit would be two stories, or 30  feet.  </P> <P> Strict new sign rules would be imposed, prohibiting gaudy outdoor displays.  Along most of the boulevard, certain types of businesses could no longer be  built, including auto-repair shops, storage yards, drive-through fast-food  restaurants, mini-malls and rescue missions.  </P> <P> The central shopping area would be oriented to pedestrians, with landscaping in  front and parking at the rear of the businesses.  </P> <P> "The character of old Eagle Rock was being destroyed by having parking lots  facing the streets, instead of the quaint commercial frontages on the  boulevard," said Jeff Samudio, an architect who represents The Eagle Rock Assn.  on the advisory panel. "We're trying to encourage developments that would be  compatible with the older buildings that have already been identified as  historic structures."  </P> <P> Samudio and other members of the advisory committee urged the city to allow  angled street parking, wide sidewalks, benches and street medians, similar to  Glendale's Brand Boulevard. But city traffic officials vetoed that idea, saying  angled parking would interfere with the traffic flow on Colorado Boulevard.  </P> <P> The Eagle Rock Chamber of Commerce initially was concerned that rigid new  building rules might discourage new development. But chamber President Kaye  Beckham, who also serves on the Colorado Boulevard committee, said the  organization does not oppose the final plan.  </P> <P> Still, she warned that the primary impact of the new guidelines would be only  on new development and will not immediately rid the street of unsightly or  undesirable businesses.  </P> <P> "We are trying to work with this. But it's not going to happen overnight," said  Beckham, who owns a home health-care business. "It's going to take a lot of  time."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Address from the Ministry of Finance of the Russian </F> Federation to the Citizens of the Russian Federation: "Beware of  Tricksters"]    [Text] At the present time in the securities market a  critical situation has developed wherein unscrupulous  entrepreneurs, taking advantage of the fact that the population  does not have enough experience in questions of acquiring  securities and that the legislation is imperfect for their own  selfish purposes, are unfairly getting rich at the expense of  others and undermining the population's confidence in  conscientious participants in the securities market. In order to  protect the interests of the investors and provide for normal  functioning of the securities market, the Ministry of Finance of  the Russian Federation suggests that all citizens involved  follow the following recommendations when buying and selling  securities.    1. First of all, gather as much information as possible  about  who is issuing the securities you have decided to acquire (that  is, the issuer).    If the issuer is a bank or a credit institution, find out  how  many years it has been functioning, what its authorized capital  is, and the kinds of banking operations for which it is licensed.    2. Make sure that the securities have been through state  registration and attentively study the prospectus for the  issuance of securities registered by the financial organs.    3. Never trust advertising statements. A decision to invest  money in securities may be made only on the basis of a  comprehensive analysis of the prospectus for the issuance of  securities, bookkeeping reports, the nature of the activity of  the issuer, and the overall conditions of the market in which  the given issuer is operating.    4. When completing transactions with securities use only the  services of professional participants in the securities market  (investment institutions with the appropriate licenses).    5. Make certain that the seller is the owner of the  securities or an employee of the owner of the securities. If the  seller of the security is acting on instructions from the owner  of the securities (on the basis of a commission agreement or  instructions agreement) he must be a worker of the investment  institution and have a qualifications certificate of the first  category (that is, it is necessary to demand a Xerox copy of the  license for the right to conduct activity as an investment  institution and a Xerox copy of the qualification certificate of  the first category).    6. It is recommended that the transaction for purchase and  sales of securities be documented in the form of a written  contract which must specify: the procedure for settlements in  the transaction, the procedure for entering the new owner in the  stockholder's register, the procedure for paying the tax on the  operation involving securities, etc.    7. Register the transaction in an investment institution, a  bank, or with the issuer whose securities you are buying.    8. As practice shows, at the present time the most risky  things are to invest money in bills of exchange and to grant  loans through concluding loan contracts. Issuing bills of  exchange and concluding loan contracts do not require either  state registration or the acquisition of any kind of special  permission (license), and this is why these financial  instruments are used most frequently by unscrupulous  entrepreneurs in order to deceive the population. Here neither  the issuer of the note nor the borrower under the loan contract,  as a rule, reveals any information about his financial position  or the nature of his activity. Remember that when concluding a  loan agreement you are entering into civil-legal relations with  the borrower and in the event of a conflict you may defend your  interests only through the courts. The specific nature of the  bill of exchange is such that the absence of even one of the  mandatory requisites makes it invalid.    If you decide to purchase bills of exchange you should know  that the most reliable ones are bills from large banks and  banking syndicates.    9. Remember that investing funds in nonstate securities  practically always involves a risk. The fact that the securities  you buy have been registered by the state is no guarantee of a  return on the money you have invested or of the reliability or  profitability of these securities. The main axiom for investment  activity in the securities market is that the greater the  profitability of the securities, the greater the risk.    10. Do not give in to the general tendencies to invest your  money for interest that exceeds the average market interest many  times over.    Remember that the founders of a joint-stock company are  responsible to the other stockholders only within the limits of  their personal contribution to the authorized capital.  Investments in joint-stock companies with small amounts of  authorized capital that have declared issuances thousands of  times greater than their authorized capital are extremely risky.</p>

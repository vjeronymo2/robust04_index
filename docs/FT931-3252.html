			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: SKF to improve delivery times SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, is restructuring its European distribution network to increase stock-handling efficiency and improve delivery times, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. Under a three-year programme, it will cut the number of its European inventory points from 24 to five and build a new central distribution centre for the whole of Europe at Tongeren, in Belgium. The company says the move will save at least SKr250m (Dollars 31.82m) a year.</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / International Company News: Daily News credit approved THE New York Daily News, part of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's crumbling empire, has secured approval from the US bankruptcy courts for a Dollars 10m credit line to normalise operations while a buyer is sought, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The News and its numerous creditors reached a funding agreement with Sterling National Bank &amp; Trust, which earned from the deal the right to be the first of the newspapers' creditors to receive repayments. The deal is believed to have given the newspaper's reorganisation committee more room to put together a plan to rescue the struggling tabloid from bankruptcy. The Dollars 10m credit line allows the News some breathing space. It will now be able to pay some suppliers and continue normal credit practices while considering offers from potential buyers. Among those to have expressed interest are Mr Peter Kalikow, the millionaire property developer who owns the New York Post, a rival tabloid. Mr Kalikow, who filed for personal bankruptcy last year, revealed last Thursday that he was preparing an offer for the News.</p>

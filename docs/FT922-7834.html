			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Bonds: OKB extends offering to Ecu300m BORROWERS in the international bond markets are continuing to issue in the Ecu sector, encouraged by attractive swap opportunities and hopes that investors are feeling more confident about buying Ecu paper. Oesterreichische Kontrollbank (OKB), the Austrian state-backed financial institution, reopened its existing Ecu bond with a further Ecu100m tranche, bringing the total size of the issue to Ecu300m. The bond, which is due February 1994 and carries a coupon of 9 per cent, is being reoffered at 99.84 to yield 9.05 per cent. Lehman Brothers, the lead managers, said the existing paper was trading at 100.00-100.20, yielding 8.97 per cent. Other market participants commented that the pricing seemed fair. The deal is targeted at retail and small institutional investors. However, despite claims that investors are willing to buy Ecu-denominated notes as confidence increases in the ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European monetary union, the lead manager admitted none of the short-dated Ecu deals launched this week have 'been a blow-out', but will take some time to sell. Kommuninvest, guaranteed by the County Council of Orebro, also announced an Ecu100m deal, with an initial tranche of Ecu50m priced at par and yielding 9 per cent. Daiwa Europe, the lead manager, said the deal was aimed at Japanese and European institutional investors. In the US dollar sector of the market, Eagle 1 Ltd, a special purpose vehicle, launched a Dollars 120m floating-rate note bond with a coupon of 110 basis points above six-month London inter-bank offered rate, and priced at par. Isetan, the Japanese department store group, launched a seven-year Y10bn issue with a coupon of 6.2 per cent and a reoffer price of 99.975. Nikko Europe, the lead managers, said the deal has already been placed with Japanese investors.</p>

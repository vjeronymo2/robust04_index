			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> ORIENT EXPRESS TO RERUN FAMED LONDON-ISTANBUL TRIP ON MAY 30  </P> <P> Goodwood Travel said today that next month it will bring back for one journey  only the famous London to Istanbul railroad service aboard Europe's historic  Orient Express.  </P> <P> "For more than a hundred years the Orient Express has symbolized the ultimate  in luxury train travel," said Goodwood Travel, a tour operator based in  Canterbury, England.  </P> <P> "It was made famous by its illustrious clientele, which included members of  European royalty, diplomats, notorious spies and femmes fatales, immortalized  by the film industry."  </P> <P> The Orient Express service, started in the late 19th Century, was discontinued  after World War II, financially unable to withstand the competition from  airlines and faster and cheaper trains.  </P> <P> Goodwood Travel said 100 presumably wealthy travelers will be able to board the  Orient Express' original Pullman cars at London's Victoria Station on May 30  for an Istanbul-bound journey of four days and five nights.  </P> <P> The Pullman cars were discarded after the service was discontinued. The cars  were saved from destruction and restored by two investors and are now used for  leisure trips on the Nostalgie Istanbul Orient-Express and the Venice Simplon  Orient-Express lines.  </P> <P> Goodwood Travel did not disclose the price of the trip.  </P></p>

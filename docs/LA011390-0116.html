			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> CURRENCY;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNCERTAINTY GIVES DOLLAR A BOOST  </P> <P> A wave of uncertainty over Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's political  future pushed the dollar mostly higher in domestic dealings, overshadowing two  bearish reports on the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> Gold prices generally rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late  bid of $414.50, up 90 cents an ounce. On New York's Commodity Exchange,  however, gold bullion for current delivery slipped 80 cents to $413.20.  </P> <P> The dollar took a hit overseas and traded sharply lower in domestic dealings  following negative reports on U.S. inflation and retail sales.  </P> <P> But late in the session, traders said talk that Gorbachev may not survive the  intense political pressure surrounding Lithuanian demands for secession pushed  the dollar higher.  </P> <P> During a trip to Lithuania, Gorbachev promised a referendum on a law that would  require republics to hold their own votes on breaking away, but currency  traders said there were rumors he was not supported by Moscow.  </P> <P> "The speculation is that Gorbachev is not dealing from a large power base  anymore," said Kevin Lawrie, a vice president at Bank of Boston's New York  office.  </P> <P> "And when in doubt, buy the buck," he said, referring to the dollar as the  safe-haven currency during times of political instability.  </P> <P> Despite the uncertainty, Marc Chandler, an analyst with Chicago-based Money  Market Services International, stressed that "the economic fundamentals  continue to work against the dollar."  </P> <P> The inflation and retail sales reports, which point jointly to higher inflation  and an economic slowdown, initially rocked the dollar.  </P> <P> The financial markets interpreted the reports as a sign the Federal Reserve  would not lower interest rates in the near future.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.35 Japanese yen, up from 145.27. Later in  London, the dollar closed higher at 145.40 yen. In New York, the dollar  finished at 145.74 yen, up from 145.45 yen on Thursday.  </P> <P> In London, one British pound cost $1.6705, more expensive for buyers than  Thursday's late $1.6575. In New York, it cost $1.6610 to buy one pound, more  expensive than $1.6598 on Thursday.  </P> <P> Tables begin on D7  </P></p>

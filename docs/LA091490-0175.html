			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> S&amp;L DEALS TOO SWEET, HOUSE PANELIST SAYS  </P> <P> The chairman of the House Banking Committee today described some government  sales of failed savings and loans in late 1988 as "a giveaway" and said many of  the deals should be renegotiated.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's top banking official said the government is  considering ways to renegotiate some of the sale contracts but does not intend  to break them.  </P> <P> In a report released at a House hearing, investigators for the banking  committee said outside investors in troubled thrifts received $78 in assets and  government-granted benefits for every $1 of capital they put up to buy the  institutions.  </P> <P> "These so-called deals bear all the earmarks of a giveaway -- with the  recipients of the government largess being some of the fattest of the nation's  financial fat cats," Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said. "We are hopeful that  there can be renegotiations that rectify some of the excesses."  </P> <P> Gonzalez said his committee will "haunt" the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency  responsible for disposing of failed S&amp;Ls, "until we have hard evidence that  everything is being done to recover as many of the billions as possible."  </P> <P> L. William Seidman, who heads the RTC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,  told the committee that the RTC's efforts "are to minimize costs to the  government within the provisions of the contracts."  </P> <P> "We are not considering breaking the government's agreements," he said.  </P> <P> The committee report concluded that 94 S&amp;L deals completed in late 1988  will cost the government about $71 billion in assistance to buyers of the  thrifts, including as much as $4.2 billion in tax breaks.  </P> <P> The investigators' study focused particularly on the sales of American Savings  Bank FA of California and two giant Texas thrifts, Southwest Savings Assn. and  First Gibraltar Federal Savings Bank.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 18 (BTA) -- The leader of the ethnic  Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) Ahmed Dogan asked  for an appointment with Prime Minister Prof. Lyuben Berov. Mr.  Dogan met today with Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, who  is entitled to head the cabinet during the prime minister's  absence through illness.    Ahmed Dogan wanted to know when he would be able to meet  with  the prime minister personally, Mr. Matinchev said after the  meeting. He said that DPS had certain ideas about structural  changes in Prof. Berov's Cabinet, (which was formed on the DPS's  mandate). However, he declined to give details or comment.    "An overhaul of the cabinet would open new opportunities to  the government, but its performance over the next three or four  weeks will be of vital importance, for it will show whether we  shall ask for such an overhaul," Mr. Dogan said after the  meeting. He said that their ideas about structural changes in  the cabinet were still at the probing stage. Mr. Dogan hopes to  meet with Prof. Berov as soon as he is allowed by the doctors.  Asked whether this will be the first appointment of the prime  minister after his hospitalization, Mr. Dogan answered that he  hoped so.</p>

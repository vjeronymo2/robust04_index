			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Unions to appeal on injury scheme Eleven unions are to appeal against last month's High Court decision that the abolishing of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme by the government was lawful. Their solicitors said yesterday that the unions 'consider the case of great constitutional importance and are extremely concerned about the consequences for its members who are daily exposed to the risks of violent attack whilst doing their jobs'. The new compensation regulations that came into force in April, without the need for parliamentary approval, established a strict tariff where the victim's loss of earnings is no longer taken into account. The unions involved are Unison, the public-service union; the Fire Brigades' Union; the Royal College of Nursing; the Prison Officers' Association; Aslef, the train drivers' union; the CSPA civil-service union; the NatWest Staff Association, the NASUWT teaching union; the TGWU and GMB general unions and the Trades Union Congress. The unions insist Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is abusing his powers by failing to give statutory effect to the more generous compensation scheme approved in the Criminal Justice Act 1988.</p>

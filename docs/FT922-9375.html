			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: South African retail group improves 18 per cent Pepkor, the South African retail group, lifted attributable profits by 18 per cent in the year to February in which it took over Checkers, one of three largest supermarket chains in South Africa. Turnover rose by 118 per cent to R4.3bn (Dollars 1.5bn) following the takeover of Tradehold and its subsidiary Tradegro which controls Checkers. Operating profits was up by only 30 per cent, to R218.3m, reflecting the larger contribution from food sales relative to clothes on which margins were better. Attributable income was 18 per cent up to R93.8m and there were extraordinary profits of R75.3m. Pepkor's results included losses and large write-offs at Tradegro which made an operating loss of R30m on turnover of R2.2bn. It wrote off R46m in rationalisation and other costs related to its incorporation into Pepkor. Mr Christo Wiese, chairman of Pepkor and Pepgro, the holding company, announced that the two companies would be raising R398m through rights issues. Pepkor would raise R262.4m and Pepgro R135.5m. Mr Wiese said Pepkor's 18 per cent growth was satisfactory given the 'extremely difficult trading conditions still prevailing, especially since October 1991'. He forecast a turnaround in trading conditions in the third quarter and said he was confident of satisfactory results for the 1993 financial year. He added it would take two or more years to bring Shoprite and Checkers, the two food stores in the group, up to profitable levels. The dividend was lifted by 15 per cent to 244 cents per share.</p>

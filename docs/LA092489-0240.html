			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRABUCO HILLS TAKES TO AIR TO WIN, 17-0  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills High School went back to basics in the second half to earn a 17-0  victory over Long Beach Wilson on Saturday in nonleague game at Mission Viejo  High.  </P> <P> The victory was Trabuco Hills' first over a Division I opponent in the school's  five-year history, and was a significant turnaround from last week's loss to  underdog Dana Hills.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills' 14-7 loss to Dana Hills was only the third in two seasons for  the defending Division VIII champion, and it also was costly. The Mustangs lost  their best running back, Ben Rooker, to a knee injury that required  arthroscopic surgery last week. Rooker will be out at least three weeks.  </P> <P> Jim Barnett, Trabuco Hills coach, elected to try a grind-it-out, ball-control  offense in the first half, but scrapped the plan when the Mustangs gained only  32 yards and failed to score.  </P> <P> Quarterback Tim Manning, who was sporadic throughout the first half, passed for  128 yards and a touchdown in the second half to spark the comeback. He  completed 14 of 28 passes for 161 yards and one interception.  </P> <P> "We tried the new offense in the first half and couldn't get anything going,"  Manning said. "With Rooker going down, we were missing a big weapon, so we  decided to go back to our basic passing offense. I felt a lot more comfortable  the second half."  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills (2-1) opened a 3-0 lead when Brent Roper kicked a 21-yard field  goal in the third quarter, then clinched the victory by scoring twice in the  fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Manning connected with wide receiver Greg Hughes on a 10-yard touchdown pass  about a minute into the fourth quarter, but Hughes paid the price for the  score, suffering a separated shoulder when making the catch.  </P> <P> Tight end Julian Ford, filling in for Rooker, scored Trabuco Hills' second  touchdown on a 17-yard run with 6:32 remaining. Trabuco Hills had 109 yards  rushing, with tailback Peter Burke gaining 83 yards in 19 carries.  </P> <P> Long Beach Wilson (1-2) managed only 70 yards rushing and completed only two  passes against a strong Trabuco Hills defense that had Barnett smiling  afterward.  </P> <P> "The defense did a great job today shutting out a Division I team," Barnett  said. "Our offense struggled, but they confused us with a lot of different  formations, so we decided to go back to the basic stuff. Ball control isn't my  style, anyway."  </P></p>

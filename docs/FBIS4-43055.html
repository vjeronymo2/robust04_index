			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "D-Day Commemorations: Newfound </F> Goodwill Between New Zealand and France"]    [Text] "Come back any time!" Such was, in the course of  the colorful ceremony held at the New Zealand Embassy in Paris  on Wednesday, 8 June, the cordial invitation made by Mr.  Reginensi, deputy mayor of Conde-sur-Noireau. Mr. Reginensi was  speaking on behalf of his counterparts from some 12 Calvados  municipalities where, on 6 June 1944, there were many "Kiwis"  (New Zealanders) among the landing allied forces. Who was he  talking to? First of all, of course, to some 35 veterans who  had made the "trip to world's end," often with their families,  and who, white-haired or balding and rather self-consciously  wearing their medals, were bent on proving, champagne glass in  hand, that he who still knows how to wet his whistle cannot be  deemed an old man.    The invitation was also addressed to Prime Minister Jim  Bolger, the host of the commemorative ceremony, who was also  "reciprocating" Michel Rocard's 1991 visit in Wellington, under  circumstances less auspicious than this 50th D-Day  commemoration. "The head of the French Government had come to  acknowledge mistakes made in the Rainbow Warrior affair, and his  apologies had been received with the same generosity as had  inspired their formulation," a royal and good-natured Jim Bolger  recalled for us.    Ever since, "bilateral relations have been excellent," said  the New Zealand prime minister, who met with his French  counterpart, Edouard Balladur, and is scheduled to meet with the  president of the Republic. He added: "We were especially  pleased with Francois Mitterrand's announcement that France does  not intend to resume atomic testing in the Pacific. We can only  hope that next year his successor will stick to this position."  Mr. Bolger also notes with satisfaction that "New Caledonia, to  which we are close, is now engaged in a peaceful process of  political change."    No hard feelings about the hard-nosed GATT talks, during  which south Pacific countries had found it hard to understand  some French positions they perceived as "protectionist?" "None  whatsoever! Had our respective positions been in harmony from  the start, we would definitely not have needed seven years of  talks!," Mr. Bolger said. Indeed, it is generally considered  that New Zealand, whose main exports remain farm products, will  be among those countries which will benefit from the new world  trade order as of 1 January [1995], both because of the ensuing  price increases and the opening of new markets for its products.    And the prime minister went back to his guests; the most  prominent among these was Beatrix de Massin, whom he made a  member of the Order of the Queen's Service for hiding for  several days, with the help of her mother, a New Zealander whose  plane had been shot down in Normandy on 12 June 1944. Another  guest of honor was Gerard Whincop, the pilot saved by the  providential French woman.</p>

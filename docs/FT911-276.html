			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Team talks deadlock at Royal Mail NEGOTIATIONS between management and unions on a new framework for industrial relations at Royal Mail, the letters arm of the Post Office, have broken down over proposals for team working. This latest row comes after a decision by the Union of Communication Workers, the main Post Office union, to ballot counter and clerical staff, who work for the Post Office's Counters subsidiary, over a 6.8 per cent pay offer. Mr Alan Tuffin, general sec-retary of the union, has described the offer as 'inadequate'. Royal Mail has wanted to introduce team working into its sorting and delivery activities for some time but failed in its attempt to link the issue to pay during last year's annual negotiations. It became clear from a heated debate yesterday at the union's annual conference in Blackpool that any renewed attempts to push through the proposals as part of this year's pay talks in September could provoke industrial action. Agreement was reached with the UCW last year for a joint review, outside the wage talks, of four issues. The issues are: productivity; automation; team working; and a new framework for industrial relations to fit in with the restructuring of the business. It is planned to replace the 64 divisional districts early next year with nine independent business centres. Discussions on the new framework, as well as the team working proposals, have run into trouble because of UCW objections to, in particular, the role of team leaders. The union has refused to accept that team leaders should have the power to discipline team members. The UCW also fears that particular references to team working in Royal Mail proposals for the new industrial relations framework will undermine the shopfloor role of the union. The management states in a document setting out the plan: 'Team members will be able to express any concerns they may have either individually or jointly to their team leader or team manager. In the first instance issues will normally be discussed with the team leader, who will be responsible for . . . identifying ideas and opportunities for further improvement.' The Post Office said last night that the review was 'fundamental to future working relations with the unions, and the direction we need to take to meet changing customer needs'.</p>

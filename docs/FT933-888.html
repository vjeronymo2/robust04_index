			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Golf bash leaves lobsters under par ORGANISERS of the Ryder Cup were last night clearing up at the Belfry golf course in Warwickshire after one of the largest corporate entertainment bashes of the year. The three-day event, won by the Americans, left some City offices at the end of last week sparsely staffed - even by Friday afternoon standards. Over 30,000 tickets a day were sold, 7,500 of which were for corporate guests. On the course as a whole, 10,000 baby lobsters met their fate yesterday, while 1,000 sides of fresh salmon were dished up over the three days, said Mr Martin Joyce, the general catering manager. An estimated 35,000 rounds of sandwiches were eaten, washed down by around 15,000 bottles of wine each day. Men favour red over white: the overwhelmingly male nature of the event meant that champagne consumption lost out heavily to claret. According to Mr George Griffiths, managing director of Vantage Promotions, the event rated in hospitality terms 'alongside Silverstone, and was bigger than Wimbledon and even the Open Championship'. An estimated worldwide TV audience of 250m tuned in daily and ticket receipts of over Pounds 2m were expected.</p>

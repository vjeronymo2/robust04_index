			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF PGA SENIORS;  </P> <P> PLAYER (65) HAS A BIG LEAD ON THE BIG TWO  </P> <P> Gary Player takes a five-stroke lead into the final round of the PGA Seniors  Championship today, but he's not anticipating having a lot of fun.  </P> <P> "It will be a very nerve-racking day," Player said after posting the low score  of the tournament, a seven-under-par 65 Saturday on the Champion course at PGA  National Golf Club. "It's a very difficult golf course. It won't be my idea of  fun."  </P> <P> But with longtime rivals Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino in the final group, it  should be an enjoyable day for the spectators here and a national television  audience.  </P> <P> Player is at eight-under 208, but Nicklaus, the first-round leader, moved back  into contention with 67 and 213, followed by Trevino at 70-214.  </P> <P> Still, it's probably Player's tournament to lose, despite his protests.  </P> <P> "I don't feel at all confident with a five-stroke lead," he said. "I would feel  better if I was eight strokes behind."  </P> <P> Said Trevino: "I don't see anyone but the three of us winning. For anyone else  to have a chance, all three of us would have to play poorly, and that's not  going to happen, not all three of us."  </P> <P> No one else was under par heading into the final round of the $450,000  tournament, a major championship on the Senior PGA Tour.  </P> <P> Miller Barber, the 1981 winner of the PGA Seniors, was alone in fourth at  68-216.  </P> <P> Of course, Player could have made it all academic had he been able to maintain  his early pace Saturday.  </P> <P> Starting the day tied for the lead with fellow South African Harold Henning at  one-under-par 143, Player eagled the third hole, birdied the fourth, then made  five birdies in a row from the sixth through 10th holes.  </P> <P> He made the turn at seven-under 29 and through 10 holes, he led Nicklaus and  playing partner Trevino by eight shots.  </P> <P> Still, Player refused to look ahead. "There is so much water on the back nine  here, you could make four double-bogeys in a hurry and not play poorly," he  said.  </P> <P> Player made only one, misjudging the wind at the par-four 14th hole. "From the  tee, I thought the wind was right-to-left, so I hit my drive down the right  side of the fairway. But it was left-to-right and it blew my ball into the  water."  </P> <P> He birdied the short 15th and parred the last three holes. "I had 36 on the  back, and I'm just as excited as I could be about it," Player said.  </P> <P> On the front nine, he hit two drivers to the third green and sank a five-foot  putt for eagle. His six birdie putts over the next seven holes ranged from  three to 20 feet.  </P> <P> Player's early performance got Nicklaus' attention. "When I walked up to the  12th tee, I looked at the leader board and saw he was eight under par (for the  day)," Nicklaus said. "I figured it was time to get myself in gear."  </P> <P> Nicklaus birdied the next three holes, on putts of 14, five and 25 feet, then  parred in.  </P> <P> After Trevino made the turn in 36 with one birdie and one bogey -- during which  "I was just keeping score for Gary," he said -- Trevino had four birdies and  two bogies on the back.  </P> <P> "It's going to be fun tomorrow, win or lose," Trevino said. "The last time the  three of us were 'paired' together was during the last round of the Tournament  Players Championship in 1980, and I won."  </P> <P> Frank Beard of Palm Desert remained the low Southern Californian with 76-221,  tied for ninth. Jerry Barber of Los Angeles moved up to a tie for 15th with  71-223. Harlan Stevenson of Bonsall slipped back into the pack at 236 after an  82.  </P></p>

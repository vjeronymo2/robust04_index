			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> GIANTS LOWER THE BOOM, 35-7;  </P> <P> HOGEBOOM IS CUT OFF AT THE PASS AS CARDINALS TAKE A BIG FALL  </P> <P> The New York Giants are 3-0 and once again winning with defense.  </P> <P> Terry Kinard returned an interception 58 yards for a touchdown and the Giants'  defense forced six first-half turnovers in a 35-7 victory over the Phoenix  Cardinals Sunday.  </P> <P> Linebacker Lawrence Taylor, however, cautioned that this Giant defense  shouldn't be compared to the one of a few years ago.  </P> <P> "This is not like the defenses of the past," Taylor said. "We can't just line  up. We have to work hard and force the turnovers. That's the way we start in  the huddle. We talk about turnovers."  </P> <P> The Giants did more than talk against the Cardinals (2-1). They intercepted  four of Gary Hogeboom's first eight passes and recovered two fumbles to move  into sole possession of first place in the NFC East.  </P> <P> "It's just three weeks, fellas," Giant Coach Bill Parcells said. "I'm under no  illusions where we are. What's our turnover ratio, plus nine. That's why we're  3-0."  </P> <P> Coming into the game the Cardinals had been nearly perfect on offense, turning  the ball over only three times while not allowing a sack against Hogeboom.  </P> <P> The Giants, who came into the game with statistically the National Football  League's second-worst defense in yards allowed per game, changed those numbers  for the better.  </P> <P> Besides four interceptions, the Giants' defense also sacked Hogeboom five  times. One by linebacker Gary Reasons resulted in a third-quarter safety and  another by Leonard Marshall was almost a safety.  </P> <P> By then, the Giants had the game well in hand. They built a 20-0 halftime lead  and did not allow Phoenix to score until the final two minutes on a 21-yard  pass from Hogeboom to J.T. Smith.  </P> <P> New York took a 7-0 lead on its first series with Phil Simms (11 of 21 for 202  yards) hitting Stephen Baker on a 39-yard scoring pass play.  </P> <P> It was Baker's first reception of the season and he turned it into a score by  going the final 20 yards after breaking tackles by Roland Mitchell and Mike  Zordich.  </P> <P> Kinard, criticized by Parcells earlier in the week, stretched the lead to 14-0  just 2:22 later by grabbing an overthrown Hogeboom pass and winding his way to  the end zone.  </P> <P> Phoenix didn't score until 1:47 remained and Hogeboom passed 21 yards to J.T.  Smith. Hogeboom finished 19 of 32 for 222 yards.  </P></p>

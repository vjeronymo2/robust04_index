			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONCE-GLAMOROUS FILM PALACE TO FALL TO WRECKING BALL  </P> <P> With each blow from the demolition crew's wrecking ball, a bit of Los Angeles  history will come crumbling down this week.  </P> <P> The California Theatre, the beaux-arts movie palace that was once a gem of the  city's downtown theater district, is scheduled to be razed beginning late this  week and continuing through September.  </P> <P> News of the theater's demolition has created a stir among some in the local  preservationist community, with angry theater buffs charging that the owners of  the 72-year-old building have not tried hard enough to save it.  </P> <P> "This is a good, old building that we think can be restored if the commitment  were there," said Hillsman Wright, whose downtown-based Los Angeles Historic  Theater Foundation was unsuccessful in its attempt to have the city designate  the theater as a historical landmark.  </P> <P> The owners of the California Theatre -- real estate investors and brothers  Steve, Mark and Dennis Needleman -- contend that they cannot rehabilitate the  theater. They said they plan to convert the theater grounds at Main and 8th  streets into a parking lot.  </P> <P> "The theater is a health hazard, an absolute detriment to the area, a drug  hangout," said Steve Needleman.  </P> <P> Even if the theater were rehabilitated, Needleman said, the transients,  prostitutes and junkies who live in the area around the California would  frighten off potential theatergoers.  </P> <P> In many ways, the history of the California reflects the history of the  neighborhood around it.  </P> <P> When the theater was built in 1918, the community was alive with recreational  activity. Theaters, clubs and nickelodeons lined the streets, offering a  variety of diversions.  </P> <P> The California soon became the district's centerpiece.  </P> <P> Goldwyn Pictures bought the theater in 1919 and hired S.L. Rothaphel, the  impresario who would become known to the theater world as Roxy, to run it.  </P> <P> "They were producing their own pictures," said Jill Dolan, a member of the  Historic Theatre Foundation, "so they wanted to feature their own pictures  there so they wouldn't be busts."  </P> <P> However, after decades of premieres and first-run films, the theater went into  a slump. As economic activity in the neighborhood declined, so did the  theater's attendance.  </P> <P> The California became a Spanish-language theater for a while, then was  transformed into an adult-movie house.  </P> <P> Finally, unable to turn even a marginal profit, the California closed in 1987.  </P> <P> "There is no way for that theater to do business in that location," said Bruce  Corwin, president of the Metropolitan Theater Corp., which owned the California  during the 1970s. "The only thing you can do is move on."  </P> <P> Wright's group disagrees. The foundation, which envisions the theater as part  of a revived downtown entertainment district, argues that a rehabilitated  California Theatre could spur economic growth in the surrounding neighborhood.  </P> <P> "The experience in scores of American cities is that by using these theaters  and putting things on stage, people will come back downtown after dark," said  Wright. "They will park their car, eat a meal. Some of them will shop. All of  this serves to provide jobs, create a tax base."  </P> <P> The Needlemans -- and even other preservationists -- insist that the California  could never be a vital part of a local entertainment hub.  </P> <P> Some say that the theater's physical location would hamper its profitability.  </P> <P> "It is not one of the Broadway theaters," said Jay Rounds, executive director  of the Los Angeles Conservancy. "Had it been located on Broadway as part of  that district, it would have been possible to look at the chance of  revitalizing it as a part of that group.  </P> <P> "Efforts were made to find a way to save it, but we haven't been able to come  up with a viable solution. It should come down."  </P></p>

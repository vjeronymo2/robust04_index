			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: China trade bill likely to be vetoed THE US Senate yesterday approved by 59 to 39 a bill to require 'substantial progress' on human rights and arms control before renewing China's most favoured nation trading status, writes George Graham in Washington. The House of Representatives had earlier voted for the same measure by a substantial margin, but the Senate vote is not enough to override an expected veto from President George Bush.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Insolvency case work should go to private sector, report advises The private sector is likely to take over much of the administrative work required to process insolvencies as a result of a report published yesterday. The work is currently carried out by the Insolvency Service, a Department of Trade and Industry agency responsible for dealing with financial failure and tackling fraud in insolvencies. The report to the government by accountants Stoy Hayward advocates that administrative 'case work' be done by private sector insolvency practitioners, leaving the Official Receivers more time for investigations. Stoy Hayward was asked last year to study options for the privatisation of insolvency work. Its recommendations would open up Pounds 31m-worth of work a year to competition between private sector licensed insolvency practitioners, many of them members of the big six accountancy firms. The DTI said Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had told officials to start preparing for implementation of the preferred option, but no final decision had yet been taken. While the DTI's announcement emphasised the benefits of the option for the prevention of fraud, Stoy Hayward's detailed report did find problems with the plan. It would result in the private sector - which would become involved after an insolvency order was made - having a role in setting standards and spotting fraud before handing over work to an Official Receiver. 'If this interface does not work well the investigations of the Official Receiver would be impaired,' says the report. The consultants sent details of the scheme to 78 potential contractors and 42 expressed interest in undertaking work for the Official Receivers. Fees quoted by insolvency practitioners 'may have the potential to provide improved value for money', according to the report. Mr Keith Ellis, a spokesman for the trade unions at the Insolvency Service, said the option, if carried through, would cost 1,000 jobs and undermine efforts to combat fraud. He said case work formed a vital part in the early stages of insolvency work.</p>

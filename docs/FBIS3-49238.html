			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Jan 6 (AFP) -- The threat of  starvation looms over Bosnian Moslems in central Bosnia, UN  officials warned Thursday as fierce fighting in Sarajevo killed  at least seven people, wounded more than 50 others and shut the  capital's airport.    UN military observers (UNMOs) had reported a critical food  situation in some 50 villages in the Kakanj region, where the  civilian population faced starvation, said UN Protection Force  spokesman Major Idesbald van Biesebroeck. "UNMOs haven't seen  anybody who died of starvation yet but it will not take long any  more before that will happen," he said. "In the village of  Ricica, some children are close to starvation," he added.    Croat and Serb forces were largely to blame for delays to  aid  supplies, he said. But he also hit out at the local councils'  food distribution policies, notably in Kakanj, where priority  was given to soldiers, families of soldiers killed in combat,  wounded soldiers and local politicians, with the most deprived  people helped last.    The UN High Commissioner for Refugees civil affairs  spokesman, Larry Hollingworth, confirmed the report: "Without a  shadow of doubt the situation is desperate."    In December the UNHCR was able to deliver only 17.9 percent  of the region's food requirements, he said. Hollingworth said  he had no direct proof aid was being confiscated by troops from  all three armies, but added: "(With) no other aid coming (in)  and soldiers looking healthy, what can one conclude?"    In Sarajevo, an artillery battle and ground fighting erupted  as the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army and Serb units resumed  their struggle for the Serb-held Grbavica district. Government  forces recently won territory in Grbavica from the Serbs holding  the area located along the Miljacka river, a foreign military  expert said.    Two civilians were decapitated by shell fragments in  separate  incidents and two other people, including a Bosnian soldier,  were killed in the fighting, said doctors at the city's two  functioning hospitals. Some 42 people were reported wounded,  including a two-month old baby. [passage omitted]    Sarajevo airport reopened briefly early Thursday but was  closed again almost immediately due to the fighting and no  flights were able to land. Aid flights were suspended late  Wednesday after a rocket hit the runway. [passage omitted]    Foreign ministers from the Organisation of the Islamic  Conference are to meet Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in  Geneva on January 17, the eve of the resumption of peace talks  on Bosnia, blocked over Moslem demands for more land.</p>

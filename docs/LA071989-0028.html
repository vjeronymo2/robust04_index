			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> President Bush, in a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, has  echoed the statement of Secretary of State James A. Baker III that the idea of  a "greater Israel" should be abandoned, National Public Radio said in a  broadcast from Washington. Baker's exhortation, in a speech on May 22, was  attacked by friends of Israel in Congress. The network said Bush endorsed  Baker's call on Israel to give up any idea of annexing the West Bank of the  Jordan River, occupied by Israeli troops since 1967, to stop new settlements in  that territory and to reopen Palestinian schools.  </P></p>

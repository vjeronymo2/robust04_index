			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Reality of Edouard Balladur's France Sir, I note with some surprise your choice of Mr Edouard Balladur as the FT's 'Man of the Year' ('Sang froid in the heat of battle', December 31). May one presume that your editorial staff have little experience of living in France? That not too many members of your staff have felt directly the effects of what is probably the most inappropriate monetary policy dreamt up by a postwar European government? Not too many friends or relatives among the 3.3m unemployed? Not much contact with the 5,300 businesses a month which have failed as business investment last year collapsed to its lowest level since the official Insee state statistics institute records began? Is it safe to suppose that relatively few of your editorial staff have a current account with the state-owned Credit Lyonnais, insure their homes with the state-owned insurance companies, or that you equip your offices with the technology supplied by the nationalised Bull? Is it your view that the re-structuring of burgeoning state bureaucracies such as Air France should be sacrificed, in your own words, because 'one crisis at a time was enough' and it was more politic at the time to keep the riotous farmers off the streets? Finally, would your editorial team feel so well disposed towards the French prime minister were its members taxed at the top French marginal rate or 56.8 per cent?

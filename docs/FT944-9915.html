			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Major faces fresh challenge from Tory Eurosceptics The Conservative party faced another damaging row over Europe yesterday, with right-wingers predicting that up to 20 MPs may oppose a controversial European bill to be introduced in the next parliamentary session, starting this week. But Tory Eurosceptics are themselves split on how to respond to the bill, which will increase Britain's contributions to the European Union's budget. Some Maastricht rebels are arguing that Eurosceptics should not vote against the forthcoming measure, known as the European Community (finance) bill, but should keep their powder dry until the 1996 EU inter-governmental conference. They predict that no more than six Conservatives will in the end oppose this year's bill. As MPs began preparing to return to Westminster for Wednesday's Queen's Speech, rumours continued to circulate about a possible challenge this month to the leadership of Mr John Major. While some rightwingers would welcome such a challenge, others yesterday dismissed the prospect. Mr Major will tonight use his annual speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet in London to deliver a wide-ranging address covering the economy, domestic issues and Northern Ireland as well as foreign affairs. Downing Street officials said last night that the speech would be more than usually a personal creation. Eurosceptics last night responded cautiously to a letter sent to all MPs by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, seeking their support for the forthcoming bill. Mr Bill Cash, Conservative MP for Stafford, said the arithmetic set out in the letter - which admitted that the measure would result in net costs for the UK - was being given a 'very thorough investigation'. He said the letter put 'the best gloss on an extremely unsatisfactory situation'. Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East, said it might be counter-productive for ministers to seek to 'raise the temperature' in their promotion of the bill. He said Britain's net contribution to the EU was set to rise from Pounds 1.7bn in 1994-95 to nearly Pounds 3.5bn in 1995-96. Mr Major secured cabinet backing last week for a battle plan for the bill. He urged ministers to make clear to critics that the cost was estimated at only Pounds 75m next year, and a maximum of Pounds 250m by 2000. Right-wingers acknowledge that their prospects of overturning the government's 14-strong Commons majority and blocking the bill depends on Labour's position. Labour said last night it was still considering its options.</p>

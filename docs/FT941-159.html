			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Ativan users fail in legal aid appeal More than a thousand people who claim to have been adversely affected by the tranquilliser Ativan have lost their appeal against a decision to withdraw legal aid funding of their action against the manufacturer. The announcement by the Legal Aid Board, the reasons for which have yet to be given, was an 'enormous blow' for 1,200 litigants, said solicitor Mr Paul Balen. They would now not have the opportunity of seeing the full defence of John Wyeth &amp; Brother and all its documentation. He said the decision could be challenged by application to the High Court for judicial review. Ativan was introduced into the UK in 1972. Litigants claim there was a risk that long-term use of the drug could lead to tolerance dependence and substantial problems when it was withdrawn.</p>

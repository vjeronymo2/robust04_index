			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITAIN TO LIFT EMBARGO ON NEW INVESTMENT IN S. AFRICA;  </P> <P> APARTHEID: LONDON GOES IT ALONE AFTER FAILING TO PERSUADE THE EUROPEAN  COMMUNITY TO EASE SANCTIONS.  </P> <P> Britain failed Tuesday to persuade the European Community to ease sanctions  against South Africa and announced that it would unilaterally lift an embargo  on new investment.  </P> <P> "There was no consensus on a lifting of sanctions," an Irish government  spokesman said at the end of a one-day meeting of EC foreign ministers.  </P> <P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd announced immediately afterward that  Britain would unilaterally lift the embargo on new investment. "I cannot see  any reason for delay," he said.  </P> <P> He said Britain had tried to avoid going it alone by offering to delay lifting  the embargo if all 12 EC nations pledged to lift it jointly when the South  African government ends its state of emergency. But he said the others refused  to agree to this compromise.  </P> <P> The Irish spokesman said the EC would consider the issue again when the South  African government lifts its state of emergency and frees all political  prisoners.  </P> <P> The EC decided to send a three-member delegation from France, Ireland and Italy  -- the past, present and future presidents of the organization -- to South  Africa.  </P> <P> Britain and Portugal argued strongly for sanctions to be eased now to encourage  Pretoria's white-run government to enact further reforms, officials reported.  </P> <P> British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the West's most outspoken opponent of  sanctions against South Africa, wants to gradually lift the EC's mild  embargoes.  </P> <P> She argues that unless South Africa President Frederik W. de Klerk can show  some positive international response to his legalizing of the African National  Congress and the release of Nelson R. Mandela, he could be toppled in a white  backlash.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1990, Congress directed appointment of a Wolf Management Committee, composed of three Federal, three State, and four interest group representatives, to develop a plan for wolf restoration in the Park and central Idaho (Pub. L. 101&hyph;512). That committee provided a majority, but not unanimous, recommendation to Congress in May 1991. Among the measures recommended was a declaration by Congress directing reintroduction of wolves in the Park, and possibly central Idaho, as special nonessential experimental populations with flexible management practices by agencies and the public to resolve potential conflicts. Wolves and ungulates would be intensively managed by the States with Federal funding; thus, implementation was expected to be costly. Congress took no action on the committee's recommendation which would have required an amendment to the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In November 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;154), Congress directed the Service, in consultation with the National Park Service and Forest Service, to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to consider a broad range of alternatives on wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. In 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;381), Congress directed the Service to complete the EIS by January 1994 and indicated the preferred alternative should be consistent with existing law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service formed and funded an interagency team to prepare the EIS. The team participants were the National Park Service; Forest Service; States of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana; USDA Animal Damage Control; and Wind River and Nez Perce Tribes. The Gray Wolf EIS program emphasized public participation. In the spring of 1992, the news media and nearly 2,500 groups/individuals interested in wolves were contacted to publicize the EIS process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In April 1992, a series of 27 ``issue scoping'' open houses were held in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, as well as 7 other locations throughout the United States. The meetings were attended by nearly 1,800 people, and thousands of brochures were distributed. In total, nearly 4,000 people gave comments on EIS issues. In July 1992, a report narrating the public comments was mailed to 16,000 people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In August 1992, 27 additional ``alternative scoping'' open houses and 3 additional hearings were held in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Hearings were also held in Seattle, Washington; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Washington, DC. Two major newspapers with circulation in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho (total circulation about 250,000) distributed a copy of the alternative scoping brochure in the Sunday edition. Nearly 2,000 people attended the meetings, and nearly 5,000 comments were received on methods for managing reintroduced wolves. Public comments typified the strong polarization of concerns regarding wolf management. A report on the public's ideas and suggestions was mailed to about 30,000 people in November 1992. In April 1993, a Gray Wolf EIS planning update report was published. It discussed the status of the EIS, provided factual information on wolves, and requested the public to report wolf observations in the northern Rocky Mountains. It was mailed to nearly 40,000 interested individuals residing in all 50 States and over 40 foreign countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public comment period on the draft EIS (DEIS) began on July 1, 1993, and the notice of availability was published on July 16. The DEIS documents were mailed to potentially affected agencies, public libraries, interested groups, and anyone who requested a copy. Additionally, a flyer containing the DEIS summary, a schedule of the 16 public hearings, and a request to report wolf sightings was inserted into the Sunday edition of 6 newspapers (combined circulation of about 280,000) in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. In mid-June 1993, the Service mailed a letter to over 300 groups, primarily in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, offering a presentation on the DEIS. This resulted in 31 presentations to about 1,000 people during the comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the DEIS public review period (July 1 to November 26, 1993) over 160,200 individuals, organizations, and government agencies commented. The magnitude of the response shows the strong interest people have in wolf management. In early March 1994, a summary of the public comments was mailed to about 42,000 people on the EIS mailing list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final EIS was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on May 4, 1994, and the notice of availability was published on May 9, 1994. The EIS considered five alternatives (1) Reintroduction of Experimental Wolves (2) Natural Recovery (No action), (3) No Wolves, (4) Wolf Management Committee Recommendations, and (5) Reintroduction of Nonexperimental Wolves. After careful review, the Service's proposed action was to reintroduce gray wolves designated as nonessential experimental into the Park and central Idaho.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

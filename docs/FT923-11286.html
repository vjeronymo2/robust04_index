			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: With-profits bonds sales boom Sales of single-premium with-profits bonds continue at a phenomenal rate - even though they cannot quite match the sales of National Savings' First bond. The Prudential announced its results for the first six months of 1992 this week which were boosted by Pounds 350m taken in by its Prudence Bond. The Pru says it is happy with the business it is writing and has no plans to withdraw the bond. Equity &amp; Law has confirmed that its with-profits bonds will be available until August 17 - they have not, as might have been implied last week already been withdrawn. Its bond has attracted more than Pounds 300m since launch in February last year, and the company wishes to maintain a mix of business. Equity &amp; Law may re-enter the market later.</p>

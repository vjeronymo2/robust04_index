			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 7 KYODO -- Japanese International Trade  and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata said Saturday [7 May] that  Japan will send a trade expert to the former East Germany to  help promote exports from the region. Meeting with his German  counterpart Guenter Rexrodt, Hata said the expert from the  semigovernmental Japan External Trade Organization will look  into possible export products in the region for a year, a  Japanese official said. Rexrodt told Hata that the former East  Germany needs foreign assistance and he expects the Japanese  trade expert to bring good results, the official said.    Touching on stalled Japan-U.S. talks on a new trade  framework, Hata reiterated Japan's opposition to U.S. demands  that Tokyo set numerical targets to measure progress in reducing  Japan's trade surplus with the United States.    Rexrodt said there must be progress in opening Japan's  markets, but noted that he opposes setting numerical targets as  sought by the U.S. as Japan does. Hata and Rexrodt are in the  Polish capital to attend the third meeting of economic officials  from the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations and from  officials from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union on  East-West trade issues.</p>

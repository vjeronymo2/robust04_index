			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Home Affairs Minister Dr. Mangosuthu </F> Buthelezi by SABC correspondent Denzil Taylor; place and date  not given; on the "Newsbrief" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Buthelezi] It's a very historic thing which I  thought I wouldn't see in my lifetime, so from that point of  view I think it's a very emotional thing, that we are opening  Parliament -- and that we are in Parliament with a black  president as the head of state.    [Taylor] And your role within the Parliament? How do you see  that?    [Buthelezi] That is going to be very difficult, because as a  student of constitutional law I know that there is joint  responsibility in cabinet and in this case, of course, it is the  constitution which decrees that: This is the vote I got then we  have so many portfolios in cabinet -- so then, of course we have  different parties, actually, I mean the National Party, IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC -- have different policies,  but of course on the Reconstruction and Development -- I mean,  we have no problems with that because on the face of it there is  nothing wrong. I think every government would like to do all  those things for its people, so it's almost [word indistinct]  really, since it's a question of the wherewithal, where the  money's going to come from.    [Taylor] Are you happy with the amount of portfolios you  got,  and specifically yours?    [Buthelezi] I was not even keen to go into cabinet myself.  In fact the caucus had to push me to go into it because of the  problem I have just outlined to you.    [Taylor] Are you not happy with the number of portfolios you  got?    [Buthelezi] No, I mean, I did not even expect...I did not  even expect that. I have stated before elections that our  (?part) is in opposition politics, but the constitution decrees  otherwise.    [Taylor] And your role with President Nelson Mandela -- do  you see that as a smooth one or a rough ride from here on?    [Buthelezi] Well, you know, Dr. Mandela and myself have been  friends for nearly 60 years now and on the face of it we get on  very well, as friends, as former colleagues, and so on, but of  course our parties now and then are in conflict you see. For  instance, I mean, the parties -- people down there may be more  in conflict than he and I are in conflict.    [Taylor] There is the problem with the Natal-KwaZulu -- the  ANC says that it is not happy with its portfolios that it's got  or the amount of portfolios. It would have liked to have joint  control over things like defense, police, and stuff like that.    [Buthelezi] Only one person can hold a portfolio for the  services, you know, only one person and Dr. Mdlalose has decided  to nominate such a person and I say, as I said yesterday, that  inasmuch as the state president, Mr. Mandela, had offered me  Health, but decided to...the following morning to take it away  from me, I never ran to the press to complain about that because  that wasn't my prerogative, so in the same way it is the  prerogative of Dr. Mdlalose to nominate the members of cabinet.</p>

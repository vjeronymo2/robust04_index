			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Clothes retailers show pressure on profits MOST CLOTHING retailers are making little or no profit in the highly competitive UK market, according to a report by Verdict, the retail consultancy. The sector had its third consecutive year of sales decline in real terms last year. Sales rose 0.7 per cent to Pounds 17.3bn - but fell 1.2 per cent in real terms. The effects of weak demand have been exacerbated by rising costs, widespread discounting and overcapacity. Verdict estimates that clothing sales space has grown by 25 per cent since 1982 but says many big retailers, such as Burton Group, Next and Sears, have reduced their outlets. Sales of specialist retailers fell faster than the market average last year, with mail-order companies and market stalls reversing the trend of and recovering market share. Even Marks and Spencer, by far the biggest clothing retailer, lost market share last year. Its 15.4 per cent share was 0.1 percentage points lower than in the previous year. The report says, however, Marks and Spencer has been better able to defend its margins because of its low cost-base, buying power and refusal to indulge in widespread discounting. The report suggests it is no coincidence that three of the strongest-performing clothing retailers - Littlewoods, C&amp;A, and River Island  -are all private companies, which have similarly been able to adopt longer-term trading strategies during the current downturn.

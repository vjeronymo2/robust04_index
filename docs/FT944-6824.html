			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / A chip or two off the old barriers: Michael Smith explains why progress in opening up Europe's energy markets has been slow Five years after launching a campaign to liberalise Europe's energy markets, the European Commission has made only limited progress in increasing competition among electricity and gas producers. Amid concern over the effects on consumers of dismantling what are in many cases state-owned monopolies, many energy companies have stubbornly resisted attempts to open up the market. Liberalising markets will be high on the agenda when European Union energy ministers meet in Brussels tomorrow. The Commission regards the creation of a free market in power and gas as one of the most important elements in creating a single market for goods and services. 'How can you ask, say, the chemicals or metals industries to compete without access to energy on similar conditions?' asks Mr Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, director-general of the EU competition directorate. 'What is at stake is the credibility of the internal market and the competitiveness of European industry.' One reason for the slow progress in liberalising European energy markets is the relative lack of competitive or public pressure. The need to deregulate parts of the telecommunications market was clear to most EU member states, as technological changes made existing national and European regulations less relevant. And consumer pressure for cheaper air fares encouraged progress in the airlines industry. In the absence of such pressures, there are powerful lobbies against greater competition. National energy monopolies have encouraged their customers to believe that change in gas and electricity markets might threaten safe delivery of supplies and push up prices. To many consumers, the scope for competition looks limited because it makes no sense to have rival electricity grids and gas pipe networks. There is also opposition to change from the workforces in the gas and electricity companies, which amount to 1m people in the EU. Concern about potential job losses is heightened by the experience of the UK electricity market, one of the first to be deregulated, where some companies have shed more than half their staff. A single energy market would not necessarily break up large integrated monopolies. But it would remove their monopoly rights to gen-erate power and supply it to the customer. The Commission argues that such competition would make utilities more efficient: prices would fall and become more uniform across the Union. It has adopted a two-pronged approach for achieving this. The first prong involved forcing countries to end statutory monopolies enjoyed by national utilities to import and export gas and electricity, which the Commission says are illegal under EU law. Several cases are progressing through the courts, though none has yet concluded. The second prong is legislation to improve competition within member states. A proposed directive, first drafted in 1992, would require energy companies to 'unbundle' themselves, by separating the financial accounts of their production, transport and distribution arms. This would make it more difficult for these companies to subsidise loss-making parts of their businesses out of the profits from their monopoly over distribution of energy. New companies would then find it easier to enter the market, if they could see that they were able to undercut the energy utilities in particular parts of the business. The main stumbling block to agreement on the directive is what is known as 'third party access', obliging energy companies to allow competitors to use their networks for an 'appropriate' charge. Thus PowerGen, the privatised UK generator, could supply electricity to French industrial companies through the French national grid. Currently, if it wants to export to France, PowerGen can do this only by selling power to Electricite de France, the monopoly power company. Third-party access is opposed by most European power and gas companies, with the support of many members of the European Parliament and some of the larger governments. They argue that energy needs special protection from competition, because of the size of investment needed in the industries. Long-term planning would be more difficult if they were subjected to full competition, endangering security of supply, at a cost to at least some customers. There are also fears of cherry-picking - that large energy users might be picked off by foreign energy companies, leaving the national company with the less profitable users. In Italy there are fears that if other countries were to supply large energy users in the north, the poorer south could be left to shoulder the costs of the indigenous system. And companies in countries such as Germany and Belgium fear they could not compete with their counterparts in, say, France, because of different regulatory, taxation and social regimes. Some German companies say they are not against third-party access in principle, and are as efficient as their foreign competitors. But their prices are higher as a result of an obligation to buy expensive German coal. Similarly, Mr Michel Loncour, a strategy manager at Tractebel, the Belgian energy company, says that competition will be unfair if companies operate under different national rules: 'Europe needs harmonisation on issues like environmental protection, the security of nuclear plants, taxation, subsidies and the cost of capital,' he says. The Commission is currently considering a common energy policy for Europe, but agreement is politically difficult and some years away. That offers little immediate help in creating a free energy market. The Commission could consider formulating a final directive around the concessions already made by opponents of more reform. For instance, most countries would probably agree to unbundling the accounts of electricity monopolies and introduce competitive tendering for new plants. In an attempt to win agreement on third-party access, the Commission has agreed the idea of a 'negotiated', rather than automatic, right to access to power networks. This would allow host companies to refuse access on the grounds that security of supply could be threatened, with an arbitration system for disputes - a compromise that most of those in favour of liberalisation would consider accepting. However, opponents to reform think even 'negotiated third-party access' goes too far. Some, including the French, want to introduce a concept of a 'single buyer' as an alternative to third-party access. Under this arrangement, deals between electricity users and foreign suppliers would have to be reached through the host country's transmission system operator, which would be the sole purchaser of electricity supplies within that country. Reformers, already concerned about the concession on 'negotiated' third-party access, believe the single buyer concept would lead to little change. 'If too much is conceded, the introduction of competition could be logjammed for a decade,' says Mr John Baker, chief executive of the UK's National Power generation company. 'It may be preferable to wait three or four years, since a delay might enable them to get the important principles through.' Free-marketeers like Mr Baker believe that liberalisation is inevitable: increasingly, countries such as Italy, Spain and the Netherlands are starting to deregulate their energy industries. In Germany, once a strong opponent of change, supporters of third-party access include Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister. In addition, the Nordic countries that will join the EU next year are likely to support liberalisation, since they have already deregulated their energy markets. Nonetheless, the scale of opposition means that real progress on liberalisation could take years rather than months.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UEBERROTH MAY REPLACE TOP EASTERN MANAGERS  </P> <P> Former baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth said Saturday that members of  his group of investors, including current officials at other airlines, may  replace some of Eastern Airlines' top management if the planned $464-million  purchase of the troubled carrier goes through.  </P> <P> Ueberroth, speaking to reporters in Beverly Hills, said specific plans for  management changes had not been drawn up yet. But Phil Bakes, Eastern's current  president and chief executive, may be among those replaced if a new management  team is brought in. Ueberroth said "I don't know" when asked if Bakes is likely  to remain at the airline.  </P> <P> Ueberroth declined to identify any of the members of his investment group who  would be brought in to Eastern's management. But he said it was "just a small  group" of individuals, including several who now work for other airlines.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chapter 11 Protection  </P> <P> Eastern's unions favor replacement of current management of the airline, which  filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy  code five days after workers went out on strike.  </P> <P> The would-be airline chairman was in town briefly Saturday to appear before  institutional investors at Drexel Burnham Lambert's annual junk bond conference  at the Beverly Hilton. Drexel has committed itself to providing $300 million in  financing for the transaction.  </P> <P> Ueberroth told reporters that he may continue to receive advice on the  transaction from Michael Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk bond  department. Milken on Friday pleaded not guilty to racketeering and securities  fraud charges, and has taken a leave of absence from Drexel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suggestions From Milken  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, Ueberroth had disclosed that he received suggestions from  Milken in a telephone conversation on how to structure the deal. Ueberroth  described Milken as a friend.  </P> <P> Ueberroth on Saturday said: "He may call me. I may call him." But he said any  contacts would be limited to receiving advice from Milken. He said Milken would  not participate in any transactions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Negotiations With 3 Unions  </P> <P> Speculation on management changes at Eastern may be moot if Ueberroth's group  fails to come to terms with Eastern's unions. The investors reportedly are  seeking $210 million a year in wage and work rule concessions from the three  unions representing Eastern's machinists, pilots and flight attendants. In  exchange, both union and non-union employees would get a 30% ownership share in  the company. The Ueberroth group would own 30%, while other investors would get  40%.  </P> <P> Negotiations with the unions were continuing through the weekend, with a  deadline of midnight Tuesday. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has been  pressing for a quick resolution. Ueberroth said Saturday that he expects the  deal to collapse if an agreement is not reached by then.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fails to Appear  </P> <P> Speculation that Bakes might be replaced has grown since Thursday, when he  failed to appear at the press conference in which the agreement to sell Eastern  was announced. Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent  firm, was present.  </P> <P> In contrast, Bakes had played a prominent role March 9 in publicly announcing  Eastern's decision to file bankruptcy proceedings. An Eastern spokesman said  Saturday that Bakes would not have any comment on Ueberroth's statement.  </P></p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Enfranchise, and watch those shares rise - The Bottom Line INVESTORS looking for quick profits will have noted the news that Greenall, the pub retailer and hotel operator, plans to enfranchise its ordinary shares with limited voting rights. In the past, enfranchisement rumours often have triggered substantial rises in the shares of the companies concerned. Take Great Universal Stores, the mail order, financial services and property company which is controlled tightly by the Wolfson family. Rumours that the group would enfranchise its non-voting shares followed the death last June 21 of Sir Isaac Wolfson, its president. The non-voting shares rose 55p to Pounds 12.35 that day. Two-tier share structures typically have been employed where family-run businesses come to the market but the controlling family is unwilling to relinquish control. To get around the problem, it keeps a group of shares with voting rights, or with superior rights for itself, and floats only shares with limited rights, or no voting rights at all. But investors have criticised the practice and say it makes the floated shares unattractive. Enfranchisement raises expectations that the shares will become more attractive as liquidity is increased, and that the company as a whole will have a much simpler share structure. At the same time, it also raises immediately the possibility of an increase in the share price. The lack of widespread investor interest in companies with a complicated share structure that prevents takeover bids has meant that many with two-tier share structures have traded below their net asset value. When the share structure is simplified through enfranchisement, and liquidity is increased, it is possible that the shares will at least rise to their net asset value. Great Western Resources, the US-based but UK-listed oil and gas company, which enfranchised at the end of 1989, saw its share price nearly double, according to SG Warburg which was involved in the recapitalisation. The company had substantial asset value but the shares had been held down by a complicated structure under which Dan Pena, the chairman, held 40 per cent of the voting shares and the Kuwait Investment Company controlled more than 75 per cent of the fully-diluted shares. It is often, however, the chances of a takeover bid that tends to underpin a sharp rise in a company's share price when an enfranchisement is expected. In Greenall's case, the news did not generate much excitement and the ordinary shares rose a mere 1p to 398p on the day of the announcement. The following day, they dropped 8p. This was due partly to the fact that enfranchisement would have resulted in a dilution of the shares. Holders of 'A' shares were to be given two ordinary shares for each 'A' share to compensate them for the elimination of their superior voting rights. Interest in Greenall also was dampened by widespread speculation that the group's move to enfranchise was the prelude to a rights issue. If so, the market decided, it was not going to be a likely takeover target. So what are the chances of making a handsome profit by investing in two-tier companies which are likely to enfranchise in the near future? First, it is difficult to anticipate an enfranchisement. GUS, for example, has been surrounded by talk of this for years but, unless it suddenly develops ambitions beyond its means, it is thought unlikely to move in that direction. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the rewards could mean that it is not worth the trouble of speculating on a likely enfranchisement. As Greenall's case indicates, the chance of enfranchisement actually leading to an increase in the share price is not guaranteed. Much depends on whether the process leads to dilution of the ordinary shares. Whitbread, the brewer, is another company with a two-tier structure where there has been talk of enfranchisement. But even if this happened, the consensus is that while there might be an increase of a few pennies in the limited voting 'A' shares, nothing spectacular would be likely. 'There would be a modest rise like Greenalls but the market would not go mad,' says Eric Frankis at UBS Philips &amp; Drew. Whitbread is trading below its asset value of 581p and closed at 464p yesterday. Frankis points out that although enfranchisement might raise the shares to their net asset value level, it is not unusual for brewery stocks to be trading below that. The market also would look at the likely underlying reason for enfranchisement - that the company was looking to raise money on the market. And that would be enough to counter any hopes of a takeover.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Three-week suspension on Norsk Data share trading TRADING in the shares of Norsk Data, the troubled Norwegian mini-computer group, have been suspended for three weeks. The move came yesterday as the company's talks on debt restructuring with creditors, which include two Norwegian banks, reached an advanced stage. Norsk Data has debts estimated at NKr650m (Dollars 92.8m), plus an outstanding NKr350m German bearer bond programme. The Norsk Data holding company wants to extend repayments and complete a debt restructuring package. Last year, Norsk Data tried to buy back 90 per cent of its DM150m (Dollars 90.6m) of outstanding German bearer bonds, but managed to repurchase just DM73m. The remainder are due for payment on July 11. It said the debt restructuring talks, covering 'bourse sensitive' information, had been expanded to include a 'wider group of creditors'. It had therefore asked that trading in its shares be suspended. The group was restructured about 18 months ago into a holding company with financially independent subsidiaries. Norsk Data said that last December it had tried to improve the debt position of the holding company by repurchasing, at 25 per cent of nominal value, a portion of the German bearer bonds. It plans to make an announcement on its finances on March 2, when it is due to publish its 1992 results. If Norsk Data cannot reach a satisfactory deal, it could seek protection from creditors under Norwegian law. In 1991, Norsk Data plunged into losses, before year-end allocations, of NKr810m, against losses of NKr134m in 1990. In 1991 it was forced to take a NKr655m restructuring charge arising from its transformation into a computer service company. In addition to Oslo, London and New York, the company's shares, in the form of depository receipts, are traded in Stockholm, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Copenhagen.</p>

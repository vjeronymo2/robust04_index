			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Davalos from the "Exclusive" program] </F>   [Text] On this occasion I do not want to add another word  to a news item that appeared recently on the inside pages of  GRANMA, lost among other news with more appealing headlines.  This information, however, is a bombshell. The dateline on the  item is Cabaiguan, Sancti Spiritus Province, and in its first  paragraph, the leader as we reporters say, informs that the  Sergio Soto Refinery has produced, for the first time, oil for  electric transformers. This oil is used within the transformers,  vital electrical equipment used for transmitting and  distributing electricity. This is an extraordinary  accomplishment, not because it is a first, but because it is an  expensive resource that Cuba has been forced to import. Cuba has  had to and has to import it because without transformers there  is no electric energy going anywhere. Therefore when the  production of this oil increases and stabilizes we will be freed  from a heavy burden.    Reporter Juan Antonio Boreu's news item was very extensive.  I  believe it is loaded with new and good things, in a little over  a column. We turn each line written into a good commentary.    The reporter from Cabaiguan informs that this small  refinery,  founded before the triumph of the Revolution, where gasoline was  produced and marketed under the name of (Reca), now produces the  I-12 oil, oil used in the production of industrial oils;  (Termosic) oil, a special oil used by industrial plants;  (Fibrasin) oil, used in the production of rope; and the  (Sigrafic) solvent used in the cleanup of printing equipment.    All these products are very expensive in terms of hard  currency. Their production in Cabaiguan is an important event.  The report points out that at the refinery's basic oils plant,  the only one of its kind in Cuba, cooling oils are produced from  water used in cleaning. This product, of fundamental importance,  is used in tooling equipment.    The Sergio Soto Refinery has also achieved the  neutralization  of its highly corrosive and polluting level of residual  discharges. The refinery converted the discharges into another  energy resource which fuels the nearby Siboney Cement Factory.    What more can be said, things speak for themselves. We see  here several things, the first of which is the skill and  determination of the refinery's technicians and workers, which  should be praised. There is something here that I have not  mentioned but which is essential: If the special basic oils  produced by the refinery were to be imported, as we have done  before, they would be very expensive, if available on the market  at all. These oils are produced here thanks to the petroleum  obtained from Ciego de Avila's Pina oil deposit, of excellent  quality. This new oil field, discovered two years ago, has not  been characterized by huge production but by the low density of  its crude oil, which makes it ideal for the production of these  lubricants.    I believe I have been unsuccessful in my attempt to not add  words to this information sent from Cabaiguan, yet it was not  bad to repeat it, especially because it was good news. Not  because it was well written but because it contains elements  that denote the struggle of our people to move forward in the  midst of the special period.</p>

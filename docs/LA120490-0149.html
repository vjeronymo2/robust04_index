			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: JOHANNESBURG;  </P> <P> MILITANT BLACKS MEET  </P> <P> The Pan-Africanist Congress, a militant breakaway from the African National  Congress, is to decide whether to accept a South African government invitation  to participate in constitutional negotiations at a precedent-setting session  starting Friday.  </P> <P> Meeting inside the country for the first time in three decades, the PAC, which  was legalized early this year, says its membership has been growing steadily in  recent months with converts among young blacks unhappy with the ANC's decision  to open talks with the government.  </P> <P> The PAC has waged its own small-scale guerrilla war against Pretoria, and has  so far refused talks until government abolishes apartheid and agrees to hand  over power to a black majority. But some key PAC figures, including leaders  still in exile, think it may be time to reconsider lest they be left out of the  important constitution drafting process.  </P></p>

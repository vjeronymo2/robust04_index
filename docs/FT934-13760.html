			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Independent Insurance to raise Pounds 25m through listing INDEPENDENT Insurance, the general insurer which announced its intention to float last month, yesterday issued its pathfinder prospectus. The company, the first insurer to seek a listing for at least 30 years, is aiming to raise Pounds 25m in fresh capital. Mr Michael Bright, chief executive, said the listing would help the group develop its profile among brokers, as well as providing it with cash to allow it to continue expansion. Apart from motor insurance, where Mr Bright identified a growth in competitive pressure, prospects in most markets were good. A prospectus will be issued on November 10. An offer for intermediaries closes on November 16 and dealings in the shares are expected to begin on November 22. The issue will be underwritten by Lazard Brothers and Noble Group. The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.1m for the first eight months of 1993. The result was struck after a Pounds 5.2m provision for a Lloyd's stop loss policy. Net assets amounted to Pounds 59m, compared to Pounds 49.8m at the end of 1992. The group reaffirmed its intention to recommend a final dividend for the year of not less than 4.75p, making an 8.25p total. The pathfinder includes a letter from Watsons, the actuaries, reviewing its assessment of the company's reserves. The review concludes that the technical reserves are 'soundly based in that, overall, they exceed our projection of the corresponding liability (net of reinsurance) based on past and current trends.' Indications are that only a small number of existing shareholders will sell their shares. A further reflection of confidence is that the company's existing management and staff will be buying extra shares, increasing their interest to an estimated 10 per cent of the company. Fenchurch Group, the insurance broker which expects to seek a stock market flotation before the end of the year, yesterday announced the demerger of its Lloyd's underwriting agency business. Underlining the change, the name of Fenchurch Underwriting Agencies will be changed to Minories Underwriting Agencies.</p>

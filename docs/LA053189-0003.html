			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DAVIS AIDE BRALY FILES TO RUN AGAINST WRIGHT FOR ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> Hunt Braly, state Sen. Ed Davis' top aide, has become the second Republican  activist to file papers to oppose embattled Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi  Valley) in the June, 1990, primary.  </P> <P> "We continue to get encouragement from people," said Braly, 34, who is expected  to be backed by Davis (R-Valencia). "The keys will be a grass-roots campaign  and raising money."  </P> <P> Braly, who sent his intent-to-run statement to the Fair Political Practices  Commission on Friday, can now start raising campaign funds. He moved from  Woodland Hills to Wright's heavily Republican 37th District last week when he  purchased a condominium in Valencia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sixth Term  </P> <P> Wright, 60, has said she will seek a sixth term despite controversy over her  efforts to intercede for her daughter, who was in trouble with authorities over  her driving record.  </P> <P> Wright declined to respond directly to Braly's action, but her administrative  assistant, Catherine Morrison, said, "She says she's looking forward to a  spirited campaign, and in the meantime, she's just going to concentrate on her  legislative duties."  </P> <P> Braly's decision, however, drew immediate fire from Bob Larkin, a Simi Valley  businessman who previously declared his intent to challenge Wright.  </P> <P> Larkin, who is first vice chairman of the Ventura County Republican Central  Committee, said Braly should step down from his post as administrative  assistant to Davis.  </P> <P> Larkin said running for office while representing Davis in the 19th Senate  District -- which largely overlaps Wright's Assembly district -- would be a  "conflict of interest."  </P> <P> Braly, a lawyer, said he does not plan to leave his $52,848-a-year post with  Davis until he formally becomes a candidate in February.  </P> <P> "I'm fully aware that some people will say that's a conflict," Braly responded.  "I don't think there's any reason for me to give up my job to raise some money  on my own time and explore the possibility of running. . . .  </P> <P> "As I go through the district, people will clearly delineate when I'm  campaigning and when I'm doing the job for Ed Davis and the constituents he  represents."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attending Meetings  </P> <P> Braly has been highly visible in recent months in the populous Santa Clarita  Valley, attending meetings on a proposed state park, transportation issues and  a proposed landfill. Davis recently said this would be his aide's strongest  base in a far-flung district stretching from Lompoc and Solvang in Santa  Barbara County, to Simi Valley in Ventura County and to Santa Clarita and the  Antelope Valley in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Larkin, 52, said the presence of both himself and Braly in the primary would  help Wright by dividing the votes of those opposed to the veteran  assemblywoman. He said he hoped that one of the challengers would ultimately  withdraw.  </P> <P> "He has the obvious advantage of having had the last couple of years as a field  man for Ed Davis, and most of the districts overlap," Larkin said of Braly. "He  has the disadvantage of never having lived in the district, which I have. And I  have the name recognition in Simi Valley, which has the biggest block of  voters."  </P> <P> Braly said he plans to focus his bid on Wright's ties to Assembly Speaker  Willie Brown (D-San Francisco); her well-publicized efforts to keep her  much-ticketed daughter out of jail and behind the wheel, and transportation,  education and land-use issues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Raising Money  </P> <P> Braly said he hoped to raise $200,000 for the race. Even if he reaches this  goal, he said he expects Wright to outspend him by more than 2 to 1.  </P> <P> Morrison said Wright's fund-raising, including a May 19 event, has gone well.  She did not provide a figure.  </P> <P> In a related development, Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge), a  Wright adversary, said in an interview Tuesday that she would not support Braly  or any other primary challenger in the 37th District, which borders her 38th  District.  </P> <P> "I'm going to remain neutral in the campaign, whatever evolves," La Follette  said. "I just don't think it's appropriate for other members of the Legislature  to become involved in primaries."  </P> <P> At the same time, she said, "I am a strong supporter of open primaries."  </P></p>

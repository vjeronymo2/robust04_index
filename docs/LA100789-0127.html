			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PERU'S PRESIDENT ASKS U.S. FOR BILLIONS TO END PEASANTS' COCA GROWING  </P> <P> President Alan Garcia on Friday called on the United States to funnel billions  of dollars to Peruvian peasants to encourage them to replace coca, the raw  material for cocaine, with other crops as a way of curbing the drug trade.  </P> <P> Saying Washington's anti-drug efforts were misguided, Garcia said the United  States should invest in Peruvian agriculture and give seeds and fertilizers to  induce farmers to switch from coca to coffee and other crops.  </P> <P> "I propose the U.S. form a direct alliance with peasants . . . who will be the  most active fighters against drug trafficking if you give them an alternative,"  Garcia said in an interview with Reuters.  </P> <P> He also said Peru could slash the amount of coca smuggled out of the country if  the U.S. gave Peru a radar network along its jungle border with Colombia.  </P> <P> Peru is the world's largest producer of coca, the raw material for over 60% of  the cocaine that reaches U.S. streets.  </P> <P> Garcia said Washington should also guarantee a share of the U.S. market for  coca growers who switch to coffee or cocoa, the raw material for chocolate, and  perhaps even pay to airlift their crops out of farming regions in the same way  that drug traffickers airlift cocaine.  </P> <P> "No product will be able to compete with cocaine as long as cocaine is shipped  out by plane," said Garcia who, at 40, is Latin America's youngest president.  </P> <P> Garcia has allowed U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents to aid local  police in wrecking cocaine laboratories, jungle airstrips and hideouts used by  traffickers in Peru's Upper Huallaga river valley, the world's largest coca  supply point.  </P> <P> DEA agents and local police have destroyed at least 10 cocaine laboratories in  the Upper Huallaga valley in the past month, government officials have said.  </P> <P> But Garcia said he believed military and police aid would not be enough.  </P> <P> "The most direct and real way of attacking the problem . . . of Latin American  (coca) production is not through weapons and helicopters," said Garcia.  </P> <P> President Bush has earmarked $261 million as the first part of a long-term  anti-drug aid program.  </P></p>

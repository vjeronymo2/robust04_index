			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Handling of Israeli banks sale criticised ISRAEL'S state comptroller yesterday published a highly critical report of the government's handling of the sale of shares in the country's banks, which it took over 10 years ago following a share manipulation scandal. The comptroller's report said that rather than protect the public interest and minimise its losses, the government was prepared to make concessions to the former owners, thereby serving their interest in regaining control of the banks. The government allowed the former owners to take part in formulating policy concerning the sale of the banks and was willing to give them preferential terms in bidding for a controlling stake, it said. The former owners retained majority voting rights, and the report notes that the Treasury gave former owners who agreed to the equalisation of the banks' shares a bonus in the form of 3 per cent of the capital. According to the report, the government's willingness to allow the former owners to be involved in the banks' privatisation has been a main reason behind the prolonged delay in selling of the institutions. 'It was clear in advance that these people saw themselves as candidates to reacquire control, when the government put the shares up for sale,' said the report. 'This created a blatant contradiction between the aims of the government and the effective owner interested in selling the banks under the best possible terms, and the aims of the bank managers and former owners.' The report was published two days after the cabinet approved a reorganisation programme for Israel's four leading banks, presented by Finance Minister Avraham Shohat. The programme will force the big banks, which control more than 86 per cent of banking activity in the country, to sell off some of their smaller banking subsidiaries and their holdings in non-banking companies. Since taking over the banks in 1983, the government has not yet sold off shares in any of the big four - Leumi, Hapoalim, Israel Discount and Mizrahi.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Stormy Cellist: Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich stormed out of a performance at a  Rome concert hall because he was being televised without advance warning. In a  letter published in Rome's Il Tempo newspaper, Rostropovich said he left during  the intermission of a concert at the Santa Cecilia Academy on Friday "because I  did not feel I could give the public my best and because the first half was  already ruined."  </P> <P> Friends said Rostropovich was so furious that he left his priceless  Stradivarius cello behind in the concert hall and walked back to his hotel in  the pouring rain. Rostropovich, who is the music director of the National  Symphony, wrote that he dislikes being filmed: "It is probably an artistic  defect but I cannot concentrate in such circumstances because when I play for  the camera, I lose all intimacy with the public."

			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADE TALKS ARE HIGH-STAKES GAME FOR STATE'S FARMERS;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE: WORLD LEADERS MEETING IN HOUSTON AGREED ON FARM TRADE REFORM BUT  SET NO TIMETABLE FOR CHANGES. SOME CALIFORNIA GROWERS HAVE MUCH TO WIN; OTHERS  HAVE A LOT TO LOSE.  </P> <P> Ask a California kiwi fruit grower or marketer about the economic summit in  Houston and the response is likely to be subdued, cautiously optimistic at best  and that only if he's having a good day.  </P> <P> The reason is simple: Trade liberalization would come too late for the  California kiwi industry.  </P> <P> Over the past several years, heavy production subsidies were paid to French,  Italian and Spanish growers to get them to tear up their wine grapes -- of  which there was a glut -- and start planting kiwi.  </P> <P> "That's why we have lost the market," said James Llano, export sales manager  for Blue Diamond Inc., a Sacramento-based fresh fruit marketing cooperative.  "The kiwi fruit currently being produced in Europe were planted with government  subsidy. . . . We really would have benefitted from this three to four years  ago, before planting had taken place."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the last day of a Houston meeting between the United States and  six of its major allies, the Group of 7 issued a carefully crafted compromise  on the question of international farm trade reform, backing a U.S. demand for  cuts in subsidies but putting no timetable on that goal. But while the  compromise set a framework for negotiations, it included no specifics.  </P> <P> Because California leads the nation in agricultural exports, it also could  become the country's biggest winner if quotas and government subsidies to  foreign growers are outlawed in upcoming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  negotiations.  </P> <P> But some of its agricultural segments could also stand to lose if trade is  liberalized through the GATT talks. The United States hopes that the European  Community will ease government subsidies and import quotas, and there was some  evidence Wednesday that that could happen. But the United States has a few of  its own import quotas, including those governing sugar, dairy products and  peanuts.  </P> <P> California is the biggest producer of beet sugar in the nation, and sugar beet  growers are understandably nervous about what the United States gets and gives  away in negotiations.  </P> <P> "What could cause us to have major losses in the industry is an inequitable  change in our current policies," said Luther Markwardt, executive vice  president of the American Sugarbeet Growers Assn. "What's at stake here is  361,000 jobs and an $18.5-billion industry. Out of that, California is probably  the most vulnerable."  </P> <P> But Paul Drazek, an international trade specialist with the American Farm  Bureau Federation, contends that U.S. farmers are efficient enough to do well  in a fair international market. Therefore, no matter what the United States  concedes, it will still be better off.  </P> <P> "The Department of Agriculture has estimated that unfair trade practices cost  us $11 billion in agricultural exports annually," Drazek said. "Last year we  exported a total of $40 billion. California was top agricultural export state  and could be the single biggest winner, because many of the commodities that  face the toughest foreign restrictions are the types of products produced in  California."  </P> <P> The USDA is particularly optimistic. According to its Foreign Agricultural  Service, the United States could increase its export of dried prunes to the  European Community from $49 million at present to $64 million with trade  liberalization.  </P> <P> The United States currently exports $64 million worth of raisins to Europe each  year; that amount could increase to $83 million. And rice exports could shoot  up from $91 million to $159 million.  </P> <P> "We're delighted" about the progress made in Houston on Wednesday, said Kelly  Shipp, spokeswoman for the USDA. "It moves us off the dime. We've been  stalemated for some time. It's also the first time that the European Community  has agreed to negotiate on export subsidies and import quotas."  </P> <P> * SUMMIT ENDS IN COMPROMISE, A1  </P></p>

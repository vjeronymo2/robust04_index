			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / The small business small business BRITAIN'S first baby hotel opened in London yesterday promising its guests 'a complete haven' away from the lifestyles of their busy parents. Pippa Pop-ins, based in a customised four-storey Georgian house, caters for children aged from two to 12 years old whose parents want a break from their offspring for up to three days. Cuisine tends more towards home cooking than cordon bleu and all but the shyest guests will share bedrooms. At Pounds 25 per weekday night per child and Pounds 30 a night during the weekend, the overnight nursery is at the cheaper end of the London accommodation market but the steeper end of the babysitting market. Managing director Ms Pippa Deakin and her father, Tim, put up Pounds 20,000 themselves and have a Pounds 120,000 bank loan. The Fulham Road premises are rented by the company and refurbishment cost substantially more than Pounds 50,000. Legal safety and security requirements have pushed up costs. The directors do not expect to see a return on their money for five years, assuming the nursery works at full capacity (21 children at the day nursery and 12 overnight). Ms Deakin, 26, has spent the last 10 years working with children. She took business advice from Mr Nick Wilcockson, a Salomon Brothers stockbroker, who is the company's financial director. Limited publicity in June brought the nursery over 300 inquiries from parents. Most tend to be professionals and some are single parents. Diplomats and tourists have also expressed interest. If the business is successful, the directors say they may consider franchising their product. They say they have already had inquiries from Switzerland, Italy and the US.</p>

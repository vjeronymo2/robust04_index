			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WATER RATE DISCUSSION IS POSTPONED  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council on Tuesday agreed to Mayor Maureen O'Connor's  request to delay until early August a discussion of new water rates.  </P> <P> The new rates would penalize single-family water customers who use  substantially more water than the average utility customer.  </P> <P> O'Connor argued that discussion of the new rate structure would "send the wrong  message" to San Diegans who have cut back substantially on water use since a  voluntary conservation program began June 1. In early August, the council will  learn whether San Diegans have met the 10% voluntary reduction being sought.  </P> <P> O'Connor also voiced concerns that, as proposed, the new rates would apply only  to single-family homes, not to apartments or condominiums.  </P> <P> The five-tiered water rate program is supposed to promote conservation by  raising the rates as more water is used. The proposed program would replace a  single-price program now in place.  </P></p>

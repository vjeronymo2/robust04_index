			<p>CSO     [Text] Agartala, March 1. -- A new regional party under the  banner of United Regional Party of Tripura [URPT] was formed  here yesterday, reports UNI.    Announcing this, the party leaders addressing a press  conference here today said the main work of the party would be  to protect the socioeconomic and political interest of the  backward tribals and other ethnic groups.    A 10-member committee has been formed with the senior most  CPI(M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] leader, Mr. Ashok  Debbarma, as its convenor. They said that the Tripura National  Volunteers [TNV], ruling Left Front's partner, Tripura Hill  People's party, Tripura Upajati Juba Samity's youth wing, Tribal  Students' Federation and the Tripura Upajati Karmachhari Samity  would be the partners of the new body.    Mr. Debbarma, a founder member of the Communist Party in  Tripura in the late 40s, along with the present Chief Minister,  Mr. Dasaratha Deb, the former Chief Minister, Mr. Nripen  Chakraborty, and the veteran Communist leader and former  Minister, Mr. Biren Datta, alleged that the Left Front had  failed to protect the interests of the tribals.    Mr. Debbarma announced that the URPT would launch a  statewide  movement in support of the genuine demands of the tribals from  this month-end.    It would also support the TNV's raasta roko  agitation, slated to begin from March 3 in protest against  non-implementation of the tripartite TNV peace accord, signed on  August 12, 1988.    Mr. Debbarma and the other leaders further alleged that all  the political parties, including the ruling Left Front, had  bluffed the tribals and were not sincere for the all-round  development of the tribals.</p>

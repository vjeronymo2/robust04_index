			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Bundesbank eases rates BY EASING interest rates, the Bundesbank has made the task of defending German economic policy at next week's summit meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in Tokyo just a bit easier. But it will not be that easy. German monetary policy remains restrictive, while its effects on those linked to the D-Mark remain unpleasant. So long as this continues, US and French pressure on the Bundesbank is certain. Yesterday's reduction in the discount rate, to 6.75 per cent, is the fifth since last September, the cumulative reduction now being 2 percentage points. But the discount rate is only a floor, just as the Lombard rate, lowered a quarter of a percentage point yesterday, to 8.25 per cent, is the ceiling. What matters for the market is the repurchase, or 'repo', rate, which stood at 7.3 per cent yesterday, a decline of 2.4 percentage points from levels reached in the summer of 1992. The decline in short-term interest rates does appear substantial. But appearances are deceiving. In the first place, Germany is in deep recession. In the year to February 1993, German industrial production fell 12 per cent, though from a high level. Meanwhile, gross national product declined 2.9 per cent in the year to the first quarter of 1993. In its latest Economic Outlook, the OECD forecasts a fall of 1.9 per cent in German gross domestic product between 1992 and 1993. Restrictive policy Admittedly, the OECD is modestly optimistic about next year, expecting gross domestic product to increase by 2 per cent in the first half of 1994 and 2.8 per cent in the second half. Similarly, Bundesbank president Helmut Schlesinger stated yesterday that the council believes the economy is at its low point. But both institutions have been too optimistic about the strength of the German economy in the recent past. Only last December the OECD thought the German economy would grow 1.2 per cent between 1992 and 1993. In the second place, the Bundesbank's monetary policy remains restrictive. The best single measure of the monetary stance is the relation between short-term and long-term interest rates. The stance is restrictive when short-term interest rates are higher than long-term rates and easy when they are lower. Even after these latest cuts, the Bundesbank's short-term rates of interest remain well above long-term rates, now a little above 6 1/2 per cent. Not only is the monetary stance restrictive, but it has eased rather little, mainly because long-term rates of interest have, as intended, declined with short-term rates. Last September, three-month rates of interest were 2 percentage points above long-term ones. After yesterday's cuts, they were still three-quarters of a percentage point higher. Slow lane The Bundesbank remains cautious, as Mr Schlesinger remarked. Yesterday's cuts will not do much to transform the miserable short-term prospects that are now worrying the French government. The OECD expects German short-term interest rates to be 4 1/2 per cent by the second half of next year. Even this may be neither low enough nor soon enough. Not only would the Bundesbank's policy still be less expansionary than the Federal Reserve's of today, but the more slowly it eases, the further it may have to go. The Bundesbank has at least given its dependants some encouragement. As and when monetary growth falls well within its target range, further interest rate reductions are to be expected. This thought must encourage beleaguered French politicians to hang on. After last week's rebuff by the German finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, to its request for joint discussion of interest rate policy, the French government must have prayed for just such encouragement. But it has not received that much. Meanwhile, Mr Waigel must have disappointed the French yesterday by admitting that Germany would not be ready for economic and monetary union in 1997 or in 1999, if public deficits were not first reduced. What is often flatteringly described as the European Community's 'fast lane' is set to remain among the slowest places in the world economy. So long as this continues, the EC will be subject to fierce criticism not only by its partners but also, more worryingly, by its citizens.</p>

Imbued with a profound sense of responsibility, officers of  this special unit have played an active role in the first  national flight safety month this year.    At present, over 10,000 airplanes fly daily on 845 civil  aviation routes nationwide. To ensure smooth and safe flights  for airplanes, the Air Force aviation control unit has developed  a comprehensive system of air traffic control rules and  regulations, such as basic flight rules and flight control  regulations, which are compatible with China's national  conditions. The Air Force has allocated 40 percent of its  radars operating daily to serve the needs of civil aviation.  Moreover, the Air Force has vacated nearly 400 military  aviation training (?fields) and has revised 27 military routes  for civil aviation purposes. As a result, no air accidents due  to inadequate aviation control have been reported for several  decades.</p>

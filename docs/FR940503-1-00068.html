			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA would conduct these inspections or audits at facilities controlled by the foreign refiner. As a result, EPA inspectors and auditors would have to be given access to conduct inspections or audits by the foreign refiner and by the country in which the foreign refiner's facilities are located. Any failure to grant access, therefore, would be the result of an action or decision by the foreign refiner or the foreign country. Nevertheless, the consequences of any failure to give EPA full and immediate access would fall on the U.S. importers of that foreign refiner's gasoline. In consequence, EPA believes any importer who would claim use of an individual foreign refinery's baseline would be expected to protect itself against this possibility through whatever means it would feel prudent, such as assurances from the foreign refiner that the access requirement would be met, or contractual indemnification provisions that would apply in the event the access requirement is not met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consequences for the importer that would result from any failure to meet the access requirements are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Failure To Meet Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing that a foreign refinery's individual baseline could not be used by any importer if EPA were to determine that information submitted to EPA to establish the foreign refinery's individual baseline is inaccurate, or if EPA were denied access to the foreign refinery to conduct an inspection or audit. EPA also is proposing that a foreign refinery's individual baseline could not be used by the importer of a specific batch of gasoline in the event any of the foreign refinery baseline requirements would not be met with respect to that batch of gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, for example, if EPA would determine that a foreign refinery's individual baseline submittal is in error, an individual baseline for that refinery could not be used by any importer during any year, unless the Administrator determines a shorter period is appropriate. Similarly, if EPA were to attempt to conduct an inspection or audit of a foreign refinery and were to be denied full and immediate access, the individual baseline for that refinery could not be used by any importer during any year, unless the Administrator determines a shorter period is appropriate. In this situation, any importer who had previously submitted reports to EPA for any averaging period that included use of the foreign refinery's individual baseline would be required to recompute its compliance calculations,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ab initio <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , using the baseline that would apply to the importer in the absence of the foreign refinery's individual baseline_normally the statutory baseline. This recalculation by the importer would be required even if the recalculation would result in violations by the importer of the reformulated gasoline standards. It would be no defense for the importer to argue it used the foreign refinery's individual baseline in a good faith belief the baseline information was accurate, or that the foreign refiner would allow EPA to conduct inspections and audits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A similar result would occur if EPA were to discover that a particular batch of imported gasoline, claimed by the importer to be subject to a foreign refinery's individual baseline, in fact is not entitled to use of that baseline. This could occur, for example, if through the CPA attest engagement or through an EPA audit it were discovered that the gasoline comprising the batch was not produced at the foreign refinery claimed by the importer. Another example of gasoline that would not be entitled to use of a foreign refinery's baseline would be a batch of gasoline that is imported subsequent to the date when the total volume of imported gasoline for which use of the foreign refinery's baseline is claimed equals the baseline volume for that foreign refinery. In these cases the importer who improperly claimed use of the foreign refinery's individual baseline, but not other importers of gasoline produced by that foreign refinery, would be required to recompute its compliance calculations,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ab initio <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing that these consequences would be imposed on the importers, because there are clear barriers to effective enforcement directly against foreign refiners. This would occur even in a case where EPA could prove that gasoline was improperly imported using a foreign refinery's individual baseline, and where the improper use was the fault of the foreign refiner, for example by submitting false baseline information or by refusing to allow EPA inspections or audits. In such a case EPA could not bring effective enforcement against the foreign refiner. As a result, in order to preserve the integrity of the reformulated gasoline program, EPA proposes that importers would be ultimately responsible for the proper establishment and use of individual foreign refinery baselines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

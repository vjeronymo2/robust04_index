			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Call to reform French political funding rules Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, the French justice minister, yesterday recommended a reform of the country's laws concerning political funding, arguing that businesses should no longer be allowed to finance politicians' electoral campaigns. 'I think that a new step has to be taken,' he told Le Monde newspaper. 'In particular, it seems desirable that politicians should be totally independent of companies for the financing of their campaigns.' Mr Mehaignerie also raised the need to examine company law. Several corruption investigations under way relate to the responsibility of chairmen for the actions of subsidiaries, prompting the minister to question whether the law was well adapted to the operations of large businesses. He said the issue would be examined by a three-member commission appointed by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. The comments by Mr Mehaignerie come amid a series of corruption investigations. The chairmen of some of France's largest business groups, including Saint Gobain and Schneider, have been placed under investigation for alleged fraud. Mr Alain Carignon resigned as communications minister in July after he was placed under investigation in a case involving allegations of illicit payments for public works contracts in Grenoble, where he is mayor. This week an investigating magistrate recommended that Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, should be prosecuted for alleged fraud relating to payments for the construction of his holiday villa. Mr Mehaignerie said he had no concrete plans at the moment to introduce a reform of the party funding laws. 'There is no urgency at the moment. But the question merits reflection and a large debate.' He indicated two alternatives to the present system which allows, but strictly limits, the funds which can be paid by business to political parties. One would be the establishment of national foundations within political parties which would act as intermediaries between politicians and businesses. Another would be the creation of a public political financing body. Man in the News, Page 10</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 2 (CNA) -- The Government Information  Office (GIO) Saturday [2 April] expressed its strong  dissatisfaction over the Cannes TV Festival's changing the  Republic of China [ROC] delegation's title.    Cannes organizers demanded that the ROC delegation change  its  name to "Taiwan, China," under pressure from Beijing, a GIO  spokesman said.    The GIO strongly condemned the move and said the organizers  are politicizing the TV industry, which it said should remain a  commercial activity.    The GIO in turn has decided to dispatch only representatives  of the three local TV stations to participate in the 1994  festival, because they are "civilian" operators. In the past,  the ROC delegation has been comprised of representatives from  the GIO, from Taiwan's public television station, and from the  mass media.    Beijing in the last several years has intensified efforts to  downgrade the ROC at the festival. Last year, Beijing demanded  that the organizers remove the ROC flag representing the Taiwan  delegation.    In mid-March, the Cannes organizers demanded that the ROC  change its promotional pamphlet title from "Taipei TV Group,  ROC" to "Taiwan."</p>

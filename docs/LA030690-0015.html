			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE REFUSES TO HALT SEX CHURCH INQUIRY  </P> <P> A federal judge on Monday refused for the third time to issue a court order  barring police from investigating a Canyon Country couple who operate a sex  church, which prosecutors say is a front for prostitution.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge William M. Byrne Jr. had twice refused to grant the court  order requested by Will and Mary Ellen Tracy, the self-proclaimed high priest  and priestess of the Church of the Most High Goddess.  </P> <P> The Tracys argued that the First Amendment shields their church, which includes  sex acts in its rituals, from prosecution and have said that they will continue  to practice their religion. Police said the Tracys are practicing prostitution  because male worshipers make donations, often cash, to participate in sexual  rituals with Mary Ellen Tracy.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Municipal Court jury believed police and convicted Mary Ellen  Tracy in September on two counts of prostitution and one count of running a  house of prostitution. Her husband was convicted of running a house of  prostitution.  </P> <P> The Tracys are free on bail while they appeal.  </P></p>

One Saudi Arabian newspaper,  Al-Riyadh, claimed there was "an international conspiracy to increase tension  in the Arab situation." Up to 100,000 Soviet Jews are expected to emigrate to  Israel this year although the Jewish state says it has no policy of settling  them in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P></p>

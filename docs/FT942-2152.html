			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Finance companies warned on names use Finance companies which mislead the public by taking the name of an unrelated dealer or manufacturer could lose their consumer credit licences, Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, warned yesterday. Sir Bryan has written to trade associations asking for their views on proposals that companies whose name or trading style misled customers should have their licences suspended, revoked or varied. He also proposes not to issue new licences to such companies or to vary existing licences to add names which could be misleading. Sir Bryan said the recent investigation into photocopier selling practices and the office equipment leasing industry had revealed widespread use of misleading names by the subsidiaries of finance companies. 'These subsidiaries effectively take over the reputation of the trading company for which they are named rather than that of their finance industry parent,' he said. 'The result is that a customer, believing he has a contract with the finance subsidiary of a supplier, then finds that it is actually with an unrelated finance company.' Customers had a right not to be misled in this way and to know who would take responsibility if there was a problem with the service or product. The practice of leasing companies using similar names to those of dealers was condemned by the Court of Appeal in March. Sir Bryan added that unless he heard a convincing reason why finance company subsidiaries should be 'dressed up in the colours' of unrelated dealers or manufacturers he would use his licensing powers to put a stop to the practice.</p>

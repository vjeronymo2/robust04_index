			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Standard Chartered is called to account - The bank's abuses may have wider repercussions Standard Chartered had little option yesterday but to make tough noises about 'effective management and control' of its investment banking activities in Hong Kong. The catalogue of regulatory abuse described by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Hong Kong's corporate watchdog, was remarkable. The appointment of Mr John McFarlane, an executive director of the bank, to oversee the reorganisation of the bank's investment banking business in Hong Kong, and the clear separation announced between the merchant bank and securities house, is the beginning of a process, not the end of one. Last year Standard Chartered Asia was the third largest (ranked by value) merchant bank in Hong Kong in the lucrative business of initial public offerings (IPO), and first by number. It has now been banned from this activity until April next year. Standard Chartered's profits from Hong Kong broking and merchant banking were 3 per cent of pre-tax profits of Pounds 401m (USDollars 609.52m) in 1993, with IPOs accounting for about Pounds 1m. But the bank places strategic importance on broking as Asian capital markets grow stronger and more sophisticated. About 20 senior executives and traders from Standard Chartered Securities, the broker, and Standard Chartered Asia, the merchant bank, have left since the SFC began its inquiries last October. This includes some of Hong Kong's leading deal makers who will not be easy to replace. The infringements from July 1991 until March 1993 include one case in which the broker lent HKDollars 107m (USDollars 13.84m) to directors of Yanion, a component manufacturer, to support its HKDollars 750m flotation. In another case it allowed a company owned by one if its sales directors to sub-underwrite 10 per cent of an IPO and provided credit lines to enable it to support the company's share price after the flotation. In other cases, it permitted its employees to trade against clients through a practice known as 'rat trading'. This is where trades for customers are booked through an employee's private accounts with other stock brokers when the employee judges that he can make a profit. In terms of the profit and loss account, the upset pales into insignificance alongside the Bombay securities scandal, which led to a Pounds 269m bad debt charge in 1992. But it renews long-standing questions about the bank's ability to control operations in the 50 countries in which it operates. Mr Malcom Williamson, chief executive, argued yesterday that it was not comparable with Bombay. 'It would be easy for people to say this is another India, but that is not really justifiable,' he said. The issue was 'a reputational one, which we take very seriously,' rather than financial. Standard Chartered's Hong Kong securities arm was something of a loose cannon. The operation was formerly a broker called Ching Tung in which the bank acquired a minority stake after the 1987 crash. It operated as a largely autonomous subsidiary until full control was taken in the early 1990s. Risk controls and technology had been upgraded after the integration. But Mr Williamson said this came too late to prevent the IPO problems. 'The trouble is that it is easy to get events out of kilter. A lot of this pre-dated our decision to retain and develop the operation,' he said. Nonetheless, he acknowledged the potential problems faced by Standard Chartered in operating in places where regulation is being strengthened. 'Hong Kong was not a highly regulated market until recently, and when you have an total upgrade of ethics, people can get caught out,' he said. Indeed, the SFC's rebuke follows on from last September's upbraiding of Peregrine Investments - Hong Kong's top IPO issuer - for similar abuse of rules. It was found to have contributed to a restricted free-float in three IPOs, and was made to pay HKDollars 3.5m to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The Standard Chartered case, coming less than a year after Peregrine, will have repercussions beyond the narrow compass of the way an individual investment house recovers from regulatory censure. It was the judgment of financial market observers that important parts of the stock exchange's plan for its future development had been set back, perhaps indefinitely, by yesterday's revelations. In particular the exchange's desire to shift some of the regulatory burden from itself to the merchant banks along the lines of the self-policing practices apparent in New York - especially in relation to the vetting of prospectuses - now appears doomed. As the SFC has been pointing out over the past few months, there are significant differences between New York and Hong Kong. Some of these include the general litigious nature of US investors, their ability to mount class actions against investment houses and the existence of compensation funds in the US, which many houses maintain in the event of difficulty. Another important difference is Hong Kong's 1997 transfer to China. Self-regulation on the scale advocated by the stock exchange would not be feasible in Hong Kong especially, as one observer delicately put it yesterday, 'facing the influx of mainland Chinese business practices after 1997'. The Standard Chartered case has also probably strengthened the SFC's resolve not to change Hong Kong's prohibition against share price support activities at initial offerings. These practices are common in the UK and US, and international merchant banks have been lobbying the SFC in favour of change. International investment houses have complained to the authorities that their efforts to launch successfully some of the large mainland Chinese corporate issues have been hampered by what they regard as 'out of date' rules under which they have to operate. It is unlikely that Standard Chartered has helped the case for change.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                     HONG KONG EQUITY ISSUES - 1993                           Top lead managers  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank                          USDollarsm   Issues  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Peregrine Capital                  485.4       14 Wardley Corp Finance               393.5        9 Standard Chartered Asia            349.8       21 China Development Finance          199.8        6 Schroders                          127.8        2  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Asiamoney  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

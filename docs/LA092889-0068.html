			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MY BEST RECIPE: THIS HEARTY VERSION OF RUSSIAN CABBAGE SOUP HAS ITS OWN HISTORY  </P> <P> "In an effort to duplicate a fabulous Russian cabbage soup I had when living in  Moscow in 1936, I located a book of Russian recipes put out by the Russian War  Relief in 1942. Never-fail, here it is," writes Marian Bonner.  </P> <P> Bonner suggests removing the meat, serving it separately as boiled beef, and  using good rye or pumpernickel bread as an accompaniment to the soup. The Test  Kitchen taste panel found the meaty chunks of beef were also delicious as a  part of the hearty soup.  </P> <P> RUSSIAN CABBAGE SOUP  </P> <P> 1 (28-ounce) can tomatoes  </P> <P> 6 cups water  </P> <P> 3 pounds beef brisket  </P> <P> 2 soup bones  </P> <P> 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste  </P> <P> 2 pounds cabbage, coarsely shredded  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons coarse salt  </P> <P> 3/4 cup sugar  </P> <P> Juice of 1 lemon, or to taste  </P> <P> Dash cayenne pepper  </P> <P> Dash paprika  </P> <P> Combine tomatoes and water in large stockpot and bring to boil. Remove all but  thin layer of fat from beef and cut into large chunks.  </P> <P> Add beef, bones, tomato paste, cabbage, salt, sugar, lemon juice, cayenne and  paprika to stockpot, stirring to blend. Simmer, with lid ajar, 2 to 2 1/2 hours  or until meat is tender.  </P> <P> Remove bones before serving. Makes 6 to 8 servings.  </P> <P> Note: If desired, beef may be removed and served separately as boiled beef.  </P> <P>  -- MARIAN BONNER  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P> <P>  The Times pays $10 for readers' recipes published.

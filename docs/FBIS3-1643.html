Some of these enterprises are set up based on state-owned  enterprises with others created from non-state-run ones or  formed by putting technology, capital and land into capital  stock or by merging, joint-running or contracting. These  shareholding enterprises are involved in tourism, industry,  transportation and finance and have certain notable  characteristics.    First, they make more reasonable the industrial structure in  Hainan with 23 such companies engaging in tourism, 17 in  industrial development, 16 in the development of whole pieces of  land, seven in comprehensive agricultural development and five  in infrastructural construction, with all achieving greater  profits.    Second, these companies are an important contributor of  funds  for infrastructural construction in the province with some 60  percent of fund for the construction of the Sanya International  Airport, the Eastern Expressway and electric power stations  coming from these companies, resulting in relieving the shortage  of funds and speeding up infrastructural construction there.    Third, these companies have also become important sources of  the local financial income with five listed companies alone  handing in taxes of RMB 60 million last year.    The reason for the rapid development of these kinds of  companies in Hainan is the market economy in the province and  the greater autonomy of its enterprises.</p>

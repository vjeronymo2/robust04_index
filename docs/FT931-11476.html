			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Australian retailers say interim sales up COLES Myer and Woolworths, Australia's two leading retailers, both reported increased interim sales and forecast profit improvements when they report in March for their latest half-years. Coles reported a 4.1 rise in per cent sales to ADollars 7.85bn (USDollars 5.3bn) for the six months to January 24. Mr Peter Bartels, Coles Myer chief executive, said sales in the latest quarter had risen 4.3 per cent, against an increase of just 1.4 per cent a year earlier. Coles' performance was again surpassed by its smaller rival, Woolworths, which announced an 11.3 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 5.45bn in the 28 weeks to January 3. Woolworths directors noted that the company's sales increase easily surpassed that in national retail sales, which grew by about 5.3 per cent in the period. They said the company expected to surpass forecast earnings before interest and tax of ADollars 272m for the 53 weeks to June 27. BHP has further consolidated the refinancing of its complex investment in Beswick, the vehicle which controls around 20 per cent of BHP's own capital. BHP directors yesterday announced that Westpac Banking Corporation had agreed to hold its 'B' redeemable preference shares in Beswick until October 1996, subject to a put-and-call arrangement.</p>

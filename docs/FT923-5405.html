			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Economics: Focus turns to Germany THE focus this week turns to Germany where important data on the real economy are due. The figures will be watched all the more keenly following the recent turmoil on the currencies markets. In June, German industrial production fell by 2.1 per cent and although the drop was explained away by an early start to the summer holidays, industrial output has fallen month-on-month since April. Another drop in July could improve sentiment towards the dollar, since the weaker the German economy, the sooner the Bundesbank is likely to cut interest rates. But according to Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank, there are still no signs of serious recession in west Germany. 'So on this count there is not room for early Bundesbank easing,' she says. Unemployment in west Germany is forecast to rise by 20,000 as employment prospects weaken. However, the unemployment rate for west Germany, at around 6 per cent is still lower than in France, the UK and Italy. In the UK, figures for August's official reserves should give some indication of the extent of the Bank of England's intervention to support the pound last month. Other economic highlights of the week are listed below. The median of economists' forecasts from MMS International are in brackets.

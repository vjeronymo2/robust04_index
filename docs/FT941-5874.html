			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Pension schemes reduce investment in equities Pension schemes cut investment in domestic equities in 1993, the first time they had done so in 10 years. The WM Company, which measures the performance of UK pension funds, found that of the Pounds 3.4bn in net new cash available for investment last year, there was a disinvestment in UK equities of Pounds 1.4bn, or 41 per cent of available cash. The main beneficiaries of that disinvestment were UK index-linked gilts, cash and cash-like instruments, and overseas equities. The WM survey also found that the average UK pension fund manager underperformed the FT-A All Share index slightly, partly reflecting an underweighting in the shares of HongKong and Shanghai Bank. While the FT-A had a total return of 28.4 per cent in 1993, the average WM Company pension fund manager had a total UK equities return of 27.9 per cent. Across all asset classes, the average pension fund had a total return of 28.2 per cent. Mr George Urquhart, client manager at WM, said the reasons for disinvestment in UK equities may have been more a reflection of a desire by pension schemes to match assets and liabilities rather than any fundamental judgment about the value of UK stock markets. Several schemes in the 'WM 50' index - 54 schemes with assets of Pounds 1bn or more apiece - have undertaken studies of their assets and liabilities in the past year to assess how well they are structured to meet pension liabilities as they fall due. Mature schemes with large numbers of current or deferred pensioners need to be more heavily weighted in fixed-interest securities, and Mr Urquhart said these schemes may have pared equity holdings as a result. Many schemes in the WM 50 Index are those of large formerly nationalised industries which are currently cutting staff. The survey also found that, as a proportion of total holdings, UK pension funds reduced their average weighting in UK equities in 1993 to 56 per cent from 58 per cent in 1992. Overseas equities rose to a record 24 per cent of total assets while UK property holdings edged down to 5 per cent from 6 per cent. In 1984, the average UK pension scheme held 10 per cent of assets in UK property. The best-performing asset class were equities invested in Far Eastern equities excluding Japan. These had a total return of 95.3 per cent.</p>

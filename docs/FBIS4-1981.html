			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup"] </F>   [Text] Changchun, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Shoals of fish have  returned to the Songhua River in Jilin Province, where the water  turned black and aquatic products died out two decades ago due  to heavy pollution.    "This is the result of local governments' efforts to protect  the water resources," said Wang Yongrong, chairman of the  Songhua and Liaohe River Valley Water Conservancy Committee  under the Ministry of Water Resources.    "Progress has been made in protecting the water resources of  the Songhua and Liaohe Rivers, one of China's seven key water  systems, alongside the rapid economic development," the chairman  noted.    China's water resource volume ranks sixth in the world.  However, average consumption per capita in China is only  one-fourth the world's average, falling in 88th place.    Northeast China, where the Songhua and Liaohe Rivers flow,  suffers severe shortages of water resources. The average per  capita consumption of the surface water is only one-half the  country's average.    Northeast China consists of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning  Provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.    To clean up the pollution and protect the water resources,  the central government set up a leading group in charge of the  protection of the Songhua River in 1978.    In 1987, the group was expanded from members from  Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces and six ministries to include  representatives from northeast China's provinces and one  autonomous region and 12 ministries and commissions under the  central government, and its jurisdiction was enlarged to cover  both the Songhua and the Liaohe Rivers.    Years of practice have proven such a trans-regional leading  organization is effective in cleaning up and controlling  pollution and protecting the water resources.    A survey shows that the group has ordered 173 enterprises in  the Songhua and Liaohe River valley to clean up and control  pollution, involving a sum of 560 million yuan.    By the end of last year, these enterprises had completed 200  projects.    These projects are able to treat 309 million tons of waste  water and reduce the discharge of 650,000 tons of pollutants a  year into river. They earn 130 million yuan a year through  recycling and re- using treated water.    While helping enterprises in the Songhua and Liaoning [as  received] River valley to upgrade their technology to cut the  discharge of mercury into the rivers, the central government and  Heilongjiang and Jilin Provincial governments have allocated  special funds to make an epidemiological investigation before  working out related regulations and measures to protect the  rivers.    According to the regulations, any organization or enterprise  that violates the set limit for discharging waste water into the  rivers will be fined.    In addition, cities are encouraged to improve their  environment and make recycled use of treated waste water.    Liaoning, China's key industrial province, has launched a  "water cleaning project" to protect the water resources, improve  the water environment and save industrial-use water.    Governments of Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin Provinces  and  the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are taking joint efforts to  monitor the water quality of the Songhua and Liaohe Rivers in  winter, when water quality tends to deteriorate.    They also are carrying out international cooperation and  exchange in this field.    Officials and experts in environmental protection of  northeast China have paid a visit to Japan to learn from the  latest achievement and technology in the study and treatment of  mercury, and extended cooperation with the United States in  treating organic pollution.    They are also striving to gain international cooperation and  donations for environmental protection.    Yan Keqiang, deputy minister of water resources, has  encouraged people in northeast China to continue their efforts  to protect the water resources by saying, "we are determined to  harness and protect the Songhua and Liaohe River system and all  other major river systems in China."</p>

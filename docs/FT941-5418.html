			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Career loans fall short of target The recession has taken its toll on individuals investing in their own training, with a fall in demand for government-backed career loans and an increase in defaults by borrowers, says the Unemployment Unit, an independent research organisation. In 1992-93 only 10,000 Career Development Loans were approved, compared with a government target of 15,000, the Unemployment Unit says in its magazine Working Brief. The first seven months of 1993-94 also showed this trend had not improved. The scheme was set up in 1988 by the government, which intended the loans to play a strong role in encouraging people to invest in training. The maximum loan rises from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 8,000 in April, and the government meets interest costs during training. The Unemployment Unit said that more participants were having problems making repayments, with 1,500 default notices being served in 1992-93 compared with only 574 during the first three years.

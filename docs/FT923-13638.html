			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The facts behind FIRST FIRST (Fixed Interest Rate Savings Tax-Paid) Option Bond went on sale on Tuesday with a guaranteed interest rate of 7.75 per cent net (equivalent to 10.34 per cent gross) on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. A higher rate of 8.05 per cent is payable on Pounds 20,000 and above. Interest will be added annually and the maximum holding is Pounds 250,000. The rate is guaranteed for a year, but National Savings can announce a new rate of interest for new issues at any time. Who should buy the bond? The new bond fills a gap in the range of National Savings products which until now have worked to the advantage of higher rate and non-tax payers with no comparable product for basic rate taxpayers. With basic rate tax deducted at source, the bond is suitable for the country's 25.1m basic-rate taxpayers. Higher rate tax payers will be better off with the National Savings certificates because they are free of income or capital gains tax while they would have to pay the extra tax on the First Option bond. The 37th issue certificates pay 8 per cent per annum compound fixed for 5 years (equivalent 13.33 per cent to a 40 per cent tax payer). The index-linked certificates have a fixed rate of interest of 4.5 per cent above the retail price index. Non-taxpayers have the Capital Bonds which are subject to tax but on which interest is paid gross. They offer a guaranteed return if held for five years. The present Series D offers a gross return of 10.75 per cent per annum, compound over five years. However, non-taxpayers who want to invest their money for a period shorter than five years can consider the First Option bond, since tax is reclaimable from your tax office. Basic rate taxpayers who want a higher rate and are prepared to invest for five years should choose the Capital Bonds since the return after basic rate tax is 8.063 per cent per annum, which is marginally higher than the 37th issue certificates. How to apply Unlike other National Savings products, you cannot buy the bond over the post office counter though the post office will stock application forms. Alternatively, fill in the purchase forms issued in newspapers during the next three weeks or apply direct to National Savings, Glasgow G58 1SB. After receiving payment, National Savings will send an investment certificate within 28 days. The date of purchase on the certificate will be the date on which National Savings received the purchase form and payment. To cash in or not to cash in National Savings says that it does not regard First Option as a one year bond because savers can hold the bond for longer if they like the sound of the next annual fixed rate, hence the name 'option'. National Savings will write to investors, informing them of the new rate at the anniversary of purchase of the bond. Those who want to continue holding it need take no action - the bond will simply roll forward incurring the new fixed rate. Unlike most National Savings products, the unattractive general extension rate - currently 5.01 per cent - will not apply. If you want to cash in the bond on the anniversary date, you must complete the repayment form printed on the back of the investment certificate. No formal notice period is necessary. But there are penalties for early withdrawal. If the bond is cashed in before the first anniversary, no interest will be paid. Withdrawals between anniversaries will attract half interest for the period since the previous anniversary.</p>

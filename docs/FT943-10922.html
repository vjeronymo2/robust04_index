			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Denmark tops the ratings in July Most government bond markets posted modest gains in July, supported by a gradual decline in volatility and reports indicating reasonably paced, non-inflationary recoveries in many countries, according to JP Morgan's bond index monitor. Denmark fared best, gaining 2 per cent in local currency terms. However, according to the report, investor interest remained tempered by concerns over the potential inflationary consequences of the country's relatively strong economic recovery. Spanish bonds, the second-best performers, rose 1.86 per cent in local currency terms following favourable inflation data and easing concern over the political situation. French bonds rallied as investors shifted into the more liquid, core markets in Europe, and were further supported by the Bank of France's latest cut in its intervention rate to 5 per cent. They rose 1.44 per cent in local currency terms. Sweden was the weakest performer, falling by 1.7 per cent in local currency terms, on a rise in inflation and worries over the outlook for tackling the government's fiscal deficit as general elections approach. The yield on the benchmark bond breached 11 per cent. Italian bonds shed 0.14 per cent as judicial investigations into Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi intensified political uncertainty. Japanese government bonds fell 0.21 per cent on optimism over economic recovery and fading hopes of another discount rate cut.</p>

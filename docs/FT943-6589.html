			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Kozyrev pressure on Serb leader Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, yesterday renewed efforts to further isolate the Bosnian Serbs by trying to persuade Serbian leaders to allow international supervision of their frontier with Bosnia in exchange for the easing of sanctions. At the same time - despite intense pressure from the international community and Serbia proper - a No-vote was expected at the close of a two-day Bosnian Serb referendum on an international peace plan that would divide Bosnia roughly in half. Mr Kozyrev's mission to Belgrade is the first visit by a member of the so-called contact group of negotiating nations since President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia announced a trade embargo against his former Bosnian Serb proteges for rejecting the plan. Even in exchange for the easing of sanctions - most likely the opening of the airport in Belgrade and the lifting of a ban on international sports competition - Mr Milosevic so far has resisted the proposal to station international monitors on the border with Bosnia.</p>

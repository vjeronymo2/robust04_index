			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jun 27 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The government on  Monday announced a deregulatory package for the industrial  sector that reduces import duties on 739 tariff codes covering  manufacturing, agricultural and health products.    Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad, after a meeting with  President Suharto, said that the deregulation is not merely  aimed at boosting investment, efficiency and productivity, but  also at raising business and employment opportunities and  expediting development.    "The objectives are to increase the economic and national  strength and endurance," the minister said, adding that the  deregulation includes import duties, tariff surcharges and check  prices.    President Suharto on Monday received nine senior ministers  in  connection with the newly announced deregulatory package.    Under the new deregulation, import duties on textile  machinery and components as well as textile dyes are reduced  from 10 to 25 percent, while duties on agricultural machinery  has been reduced by five to 20 percent.    Import duties on tools and machinery for small scale  industries such as sewing machines, lathes, drills, carpentry  tools, dressing machines and other tools have been reduced to  five percent or totally eliminated.    He said that the import duty on the completely built-up  (CBU)  passenger car and station wagon has been reduced by 25 percent,  while for spare parts for the semi-trailer, it has been reduced  to 10 percent and duties on spare parts for the work-truck have  been eliminated.    "Import duties on components and sub-components for the  assembling of heavy duty equipment are completely lifted  beginning on January 1 next year," he added.    In the agricultural sector, the minister said that import  duties on some products such as wheat and rice flour, yellow  soybeans and cane sugar, that have so far been imported by the  National Logistic Board (Bulog), have been eliminated.    Import duties on corn, soybean meal, potatoes, coffee, tea,  sunflower seeds, margarine, fish meal, shrimp meal, processed  fish, processed food and livestock, barley, peanut meal and  sorghum have been reduced by five percent.    "The import duty on coconut and palm oil have been reduced  to  zero percent," he added.    He said that any price distortion caused by "dumping"  activities will be prevented by "anti-dumping policies".    The government also decided to increase the import duty on  38  tariff codes for products containing a certain alcohol content.    Of the 38 tariff codes, import duties on 33 tariff codes  have  increased by 170 percent, four tariff codes by 80 percent and  one by 70 percent.    Trade Minister S.B. Judono said that the aim of increasing  the import duty on goods with alcoholic content was to minimise  the domestic consumption of alcohol which has had a negative  impact on society.    On the occasion, the finance minister also announced some  regulation changes giving small scale entrepreneurs and  cooperative agencies easier access to funds provided by  state-run companies (BUMN).    The stipulation on what funds raised from BUMN can be used  for has been expanded, the maximum limit on the share of BUMN  surplus allocated to small scale businesses (which currently  stands at 500 rupiah million per BUMN) has been eliminated, and  efforts are being made to ensure that one percent of the BUMN's  surplus is allocated to the scheme.</p>

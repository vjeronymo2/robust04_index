			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION 4-A VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> NEWPORT HARBOR'S HOPES THWARTED BY SWATIK'S KILLS  </P> <P> Dan Glenn, Newport Harbor boys' volleyball coach, wore a worried look when he  watched Mira Costa's team warming up for its Southern Section 4-A quarterfinal  game Thursday night.  </P> <P> "All we have to do," Glenn said, "is stop the best player in the nation (David  Swatik) and the best team."  </P> <P> The Sailors failed to do either and Mira Costa, ranked No. 1 nationally by  Volleyball Monthly, rallied in all but the last game for a 15-11, 16-14, 15-5  victory at Newport Harbor.  </P> <P> Mira Costa, the 4-A runner-up in 1987 and 1989, advances to the semifinals  against the winner of Friday night's Laguna Beach-San Marcos game.  </P> <P> Swatik had 17 kills and four blocks and Pat Ivie, the younger brother of USC  and United States national team member Bryan Ivie, had 13 to lead Mira Costa  (16-0). Alex Opoulos and Ian Juberg each had 11 kills to lead Newport Harbor  (11-6).  </P> <P> "Swatik had the kills that counted," Glenn said after the game. "That's why  he's a great player."  </P> <P> Mira Costa Coach Mike Cook said his team struggled in Newport Harbor's small,  noisy gym.  </P> <P> "We toughed it out," he said. "This was a tough place to play. The Newport  crowd made a lot of noise and our kids couldn't communicate. Newport gave us an  excellent test in the first two games."  </P> <P> Mira Costa rallied from a 9-4 deficit in the first game. Swatik had four kills  and Mike Ashenfelter had two blocks as the Mustangs capitalized on four Newport  Harbor hitting errors in an 11-2 run.  </P> <P> The Mustangs trailed again early in the second game. They fought back from  deficits of 5-0 and 10-5 and fought off game point to tie it at 14-14.  Consecutive kills by Mark Shoptaw and Brian Thurston gave the Mustangs a 16-14  victory.  </P> <P> "We didn't lose this game," Glenn said. "They beat us. I just wish we could  have had that second game back.  </P> <P> "We got stuck on nine in the first game and 10 in the second game. Mira Costa  is a real good team and if you make mistakes against them, they'll capitalize  on you."  </P> <P> Mira Costa didn't have to bother with a comeback in the third game. The  Mustangs built a 6-0 lead and let Newport Harbor no closer than five.  </P></p>

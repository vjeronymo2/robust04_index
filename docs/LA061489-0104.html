			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BILL BROWN NAMED CENTURY FOOTBALL COACH  </P> <P> Bill Brown, former varsity football coach at Brea-Olinda High School, has been  named football coach at Century High in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Brown, 48, compiled a 32-25-3 record in six seasons at Brea, leading the  Wildcats to three playoff appearances in the Central Conference. He took a  leave of absence in 1988.  </P> <P> "I really didn't have too much interest in the job until I started talking to  the people over there," Brown said. "I was impressed with the quality of people  at the school and feeling of cooperation they all wanted. They not only want a  good academic program, they also want top-notch athletic programs."  </P> <P> Brown was defensive coordinator for three years at Brea-Olinda before becoming  coach in 1982.  </P> <P> Brown, an Indiana State graduate, also has been coach at John Glenn High in  Norwalk, where he was 13-13-1 in three years.  </P> <P> Brown was selected after school administrators opened the position for a second  time. Mike Churchill, former Riverside Poly coach, originally was selected, but  Churchill later rejected the job and accepted a varsity position at Redlands  High.  </P> <P> Century is scheduled to open in the fall with 1,000 freshmen and sophomores.  Brown becomes the third high-profile coach to join the new school's athletic  department, joining Greg Coombs (basketball) and Rick Hayes (baseball).  </P></p>

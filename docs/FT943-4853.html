			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Microscope can manipulate atoms A new type of microscope, which can not only 'see' individual atoms but also manipulate them, could be used in making electronic circuits on the smallest scale possible. Dr Bernard Richardson, a physicist at the University of Wales, Cardiff, told the British Association meeting in Loughborough that Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy enabled scientists 'to home in and pick up individual atoms'. Using STM, 'we ought to be able to write the whole Bible on the sharp tip of a pin', he said. Of more practical use, the electronics industry is experimenting with writing circuits by STM. That could produce silicon chips with lines 10 times thinner than those made with today's technology - another step towards packing more computing power into smaller and smaller components. As well as conventional semiconductors, STM could be used to make 'quantum devices'. These have novel properties because the electrons are confined in such a small space. Dr Richardson gave the example of making high-efficiency tunable lasers from quantum wires. 'I don't see why we shouldn't have a working system in five to 10 years' time,' he said. The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council is spending Pounds 4.5m on STM research for academic and industrial applications in the UK.</p>

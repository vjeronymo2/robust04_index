			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / International Company News: Kuok tipped to buy S China Morning Post TRADING in South China Morning Post shares was due to resume today amid expectations that this week will see Hong Kong's best-known newspaper fall into the hands of one of China's best-loved overseas businessmen. Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation announced on Friday that it was negotiating the sale of its 50 per cent stake in SCMP, and while the buyer's name has not been confirmed, it is widely expected to be a consortium led by Malaysian-born 'Sugar King' Robert Kuok. The share sale would trigger a general offer for the company, under Hong Kong's takeover and mergers code, but local newspaper coverage has raised expectations of an offer below Friday's closing price of HKDollars 5.35. Based on that price, the Murdoch stake would be valued at HKDollars 4bn (USDollars 516m). Mr Kuok commands one of the largest business empires in south-east Asia, and having made his fortune through sugar trading in Malaysia, he now controls a wide range of businesses, from hotel and property development to trading. He has a long track record of investment in Hong Kong, where he is now based. He recently floated his Hong Kong and Chinese hotel interests, as the HKDollars 6.5bn market capitalised Shangri-La Asia. However, the purchase of SCMP would be his largest and most high profile investment in the colony. It is his China connections which will attract most attention, if he finalises the deal. Mr Kuok was behind Beijing's first major internationally-funded property development, the USDollars 480m World Trade Centre. He also owns 13 per cent of Hong Kong's largest mainland-controlled investment vehicle, Citic Pacific, and has substantial investments in property and trading in China. Beijing would not welcome criticism from business partners, and is very sensitive to its media coverage in Hong Kong. As one senior employee at the SCMP stated: 'One of the ironies of this deal is that in a week's time, Rupert Murdoch may be held up as the last bastion of free speech and democracy in Hong Kong.' Mr Murdoch had implemented few changes at the newspaper. He treated it as a cash cow and paid out the bulk of earnings in dividends, while playing no apparent role in its editorial content. He is likely to make more than HKDollars 5bn profit from the deal, and he was clearly concerned about the future of running an English language newspaper in Hong Kong after its 1997 hand-over to China, from both a political and business perspective.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Was There a Steamroller at the Congress?"] </F>   [Text] Now that the passion that overpowered the Sandinist  Special Congress has died down, one must review what went on  behind the scenes.    The so-called "Majority Current" and the "Democratic Left"  canceled each other out. Take, for example, the lists of 113  candidates for Sandinist Assembly membership to be elected at  the Congress. Only five were registered on both lists. That  does not mean that all the other candidates were militants of  the other group. The two tried to attract votes to their lists,  including those allegedly "without any leanings," which means  they were undecided. They also tried to obtain support by  including candidates in exchange for mutual support.    This way of making up the lists led some to rebel, or at  least that was the case with the Democratic Left. During the  period for registering nominations for the National Directorate  (DN), Bayardo Altamirano registered independently. He later  refused to decline in favor of Damaso Vargas, even after the  names of the Sandinist Assembly were announced.    That is why there were 16 leftist candidates on the ballot.    There was basic agreement on line of thought and on the  lists  presented by the two tendencies. But the voters gave themselves  some leeway, which led to some surprises in the final results.  This explains why neither list managed to overshadow the other.  Of the total 113 members elected to the Sandinist Assembly, 45  were from the national roster, of which 26 were on the  Democratic Left list and 17 were on the Majority Current list.  Meanwhile, two names were on both lists: Francisco Rivera and  Lucio Jimenez, who is considered an "orthodox," but is known to  lean toward the Majority.    There were 41 lists, of the total 68 departmental lists,  registered by Democratic Left and 27 by the Majority.    Of the 15 members of the DN, 10 were on the Democratic Left  list and five were in the Majority. One of the 10 leftists was  a declared Majority supporter. A second was Bayardo Arce, who  took no sides until the last minute when he simply threw his  support to Commander Daniel Ortega.    The two most outstanding surprises were those not elected to  the DN: Sergio Ramirez, the main Majority leader, and Julio  Lopez, who was not elected to the Sandinist Assembly. Everybody  thought Lopez was the Democratic Left's ideologist and main  leader.    Another indication that the election results were  unpredictable is that out of the 113 members of the Sandinist  Assembly elected, 22 won more than 300 votes, but only three are  Democratic Left cadres: Daniel Ortega, Tomas Borge, and Lumberto  Campbell.    In addition, 17 received less than 200 votes, and out of  these 12 belong to the Democratic Left, including outstanding  cadres such as Felix Contreras, Emmet Lang, and union leaders  Mario Quintana, Gustavo Porras, and Damaso Vargas. In fact,  three of their running mates made it through the women's quota:  Ruth Herrera, Janeth Chavez, and Maria Esther Solis. It does  not seem then that one list had the upper hand.    The congress was full of contrasts: The Majority current had  as candidate Victor Manuel Gallegos (Pedrito el Hondureno), who  certainly does not represent the "renewal" and "democratic"  sector.    Another contrast was that during the heat of the debates,  when the Sandinist Assembly was already elected and it seemed  that the Democratic Left had "crushed" the Majority, a  "negotiation" was suggested for the sake of unity to choose a  "balanced Directorate."    Fernando Cardenal made the proposal public and official. In  practice, this would have meant negotiating a single roster  ballot. The proposal came from the Majority, whose members were  the biggest critics of single roster ballots during the First  Congress.    Confusion came out of the Congress. It is said that Mariano  Fiallos was purged even though he was one of the candidates  sought the most by both trends. The truth is that he declined  both candidacies because of his work with the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal.    Another contrasting fact is that the Democratic Left has on  its list people like Lucio Jimenez and Sandra Ramos, among whom  is not only a pending legal suit but a sharp political  confrontation regarding the legitimacy of property claimed by  the CST [Jose Benito Escobar Sandinist Workers Federation] from  the Women's Secretariat. There was also Roberto Gonzalez who  competed with Lucio Jimenez for the post of CST secretary  general, which also added to the polarization felt in this  Congress.    There was surprise at the election of barely known or  unknown  Miskito Thomas Tooker, from Rio Coco, who campaigned alone and  managed, without being on any list, to obtain 180 votes to  represent the RAAN [Northern Atlantic Autonomous Region].</p>

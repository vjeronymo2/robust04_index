			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Alena </F> Melicharkova; place and date not given: "They Gave the Best  They Had"]    [Text] One hundred days have passed since the coalition  government was established, a government that took the risk of  preelection failure in times of difficult economic problems and  a certain polarization in society. The opposition, deprived of  power, is heaping reproaches and accusations on the government,  particularly the prime minister. As usually happens, the more  one tries to expose lies, the more one's truth is doubted. One  day, however, history will tell us the true story about each  government. Today, Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik has the word.    [Melicharkova] Your government has been in power 100 days.  It is time to render an account, and we can now safely say  whether the individual members of the government are the right  people in the right place. Do you have the feeling that your  colleagues meet the criteria of the times?    [Moravcik] In this period, the government has shown itself  to be a well-functioning team. We may have different opinions  regarding certain problems, but it is a very important fact that  we have always been able to find solutions without having to  vote on certain problems and actually count the yes and no  votes. That is, practically all decisions are made unanimously  after thorough discussion. It is an important fact that this  government has been formed as a coalition government because all  of the political groups that are participating in it wanted to  give the best they had. This, in fact, is the logic of  parliamentarism, which has proved itself effective also in this  case. From this viewpoint, I can give a positive answer to your  question.    [Melicharkova] On what basis would you describe your  government as successful after 100 days?    [Moravcik] I will try to be concise. The biggest problem we  had to face was the budget. It was ill-conceived and of low  quality, which has mainly affected health care and education.  In the first days of our government, we were forced to "quench"  the problems that had arisen. We may consider it a positive  aspect of this government that we were able to secure the  conditions for these spheres to function normally. Moreover, we  should mention another problem, related to the budget deficit.  From the viewpoint of the transformation of the economy, it is  very important for us to keep the deficit at a certain level.  The approved budget contained great budgetary risks. It took a  lot of energy to eliminate them. We have drafted a project that  we are presenting to the National Council of the Slovak  Republic. If it is implemented in the way we have proposed, the  entire budget system should be consolidated. It is likely that  this will have a strong impact in the next period.    From this viewpoint, it is possible to consider this a  positive aspect, despite the fact that it represents  intervention in the tax system. However, we could not have  agreed with the increasing deficit because it would only mean  postponing the problem for the future, and, if other problems  appeared, in addition, a critical situation could arise, which  is what we want to avoid. The solution to this problem has a  positive impact mainly on the economy, but, in a way, it is also  a gift for the next government because it will not have to solve  this problem.    [Melicharkova] Some of the solutions will require a  considerable amount of funds. We cannot expect them to come  from abroad only....    [Moravcik] We have succeeded in discovering certain  resources in the sphere of privatization, despite the fact that,  in view of the specific privatization method in the previous  period, the administration of the National Property Fund  practically incurred a deficit. We had to quickly change the  entire privatization concept and relations between privatization  and the National Property Fund, and to draft our own project for  recovering the National Property Fund. On the basis of our  measures, we have found resources that we can now use as  development resources. This means that, in the interest of  certain development stimuli, we can use these additional  resources to compensate for certain restrictions in the budget.  We want to orient them, above all, toward comprehensive housing  construction, the road network, the construction of highways,  and development of small and medium-size enterprise. At the  same time, we have been solving a number of problems associated  with the normal functioning of all of the branches.    [Melicharkova] How are relations between the government  and parliament? The serious misunderstanding between the former  government, parliament, and president are well known. Are the  constitutional officials at the head of this state people who  are able to communicate and find consensus in the interests of  the Republic? It is a known fact that the chairman of the  National Council of the Slovak Republic is a member of the  opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. Do you not have  confrontations with him?    [Moravcik] There is no situation that would allow a  confrontation. I am not interested in a confrontational policy,  and it would not even be advantageous. The same applies to  relations with parliament. As regards our relations with the  president, communication is very efficient and trouble-free. It  is in full harmony with what is anchored in the Constitution of  the Slovak Republic.    [Melicharkova] Which of the problems that you inherited from  your predecessors have you already successfully solved?    [Moravcik] The problem of the social fund was critical. The  solution adopted by the former government was terrible. We  succeeded in getting the situation in the social fund into  tolerable shape. However, we are not fully satisfied with  everything we have achieved. It is a compromise, for sure, and  we will try to find a more systemic solution.    [Melicharkova] People who do not wish you success (and  thereby slander our state, in fact) affirm that this state has  no control mechanisms. For example, can the state apparatus  function without control mechanisms? Is it at all possible?    [Moravcik] It is impossible. Every system has to have  control mechanisms. We do not know the real arguments of those  who say we do not have control mechanisms. Such an idea is  really absurd. Each sector has its control bodies. Financial  control, provided by the Slovak Republic's Finance Ministry, has  a specific place. Also, the government has a control mechanism.  At the Office of the Government of the Slovak Republic, there  is a control department to control the fulfillment of government  resolutions. The Supreme Control Body of the Slovak Republic  has a most important place. We have abolished the specific  control body at the Office of the Government of the Slovak  Republic because such a thing is very strange from the viewpoint  of the usually accepted control mechanisms. It is something  that does not exist anywhere in the world. To establish a  control body at the government office, which, in fact, serves  the government, and to make a central state organ from the  office of the government is a concept that is not known anywhere  in the world. We were possibly the only state in the world that  had an absurd thing like that. It was therefore quite logical  for us to change this system and harmonize it with what is  usually done in the world. The fact is that the control system  of the Office of the Government of the Slovak Republic was often  misused to settle personal accounts or to pursue personal goals.  Such a way of "self-realization" in the state administration is  unacceptable.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Concern grows over Abiola Concern was growing last night about the welfare of Nigeria's detained opposition leader, Mr Moshood Abiola. Mr Abiola's aides said he had refused to accept the conditions for his release on bail, set by a high court judge whose intervention on Friday was sanctioned by the military government. The terms prevent the opposition leader from talking to the press or addressing public gatherings. Mr Abiola is the deposed winner of last year's general election who has been jailed on treason charges for proclaiming himself president. The oil workers' strike in support of Mr Abiola continued over the weekend. Union leaders will decide today whether to resume a general strike which was suspended last Friday. Mr Abiola's staff say that he was moved every few hours between different prisons in Abuja until they lost contact with him on Saturday night. 'They are keeping him incommunicado because we were able to frustrate the attempted bail order on Friday,' said one of Mr Abiola's assistants in Lagos. 'But we are worried because so far they have refused to allow access to his doctor and lawyer,' he said. Mr Abiola's lawyers have not petitioned for bail but for unconditional release and for all the treason charges to be struck out. Until Friday's emergency hearing, the high court in Abuja had been adjourned until August 16, when the judge is due to rule on whether the court has jurisdiction to try the case. Leaders of the 41 trade unions in the Nigeria Labour Congress will meet in Lagos to decide whether to re-instate or to call off for good the stoppage while Mr Abiola remains in jail. The decision was postponed from Saturday, because Mr Pascal Bafyau and other NLC leaders had not returned from Abuja, where they were involved in a failed attempt to break the political deadlock by securing conditional bail for Mr Abiola.</p>

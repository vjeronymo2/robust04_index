			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 30 (CNA) -- A special China Airlines  [CAL] flight on Saturday [30 April] carried back to Taiwan the  remains of the 101 Taiwan victims of the CAL Airbus-300 crash in  Nagoya, Japan.    A mixed Buddhist and Taoist ceremony to appease the spirits  of the victims was held at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport  upon the arrival of their bodies.    Transportation and Communications Minister Liu Chao-shiun,  Civil Aeronautics Administration Director-General Sun  Chao-liang, Association of East Asian Relations Chairman Ma  Chih-chuang, CAL General Manager Yuan Hsing-yuan, and Foreign  Ministry officials were present at the ceremony. They bowed  three times in front of the spirit tablets of the victims to pay  homage.    CAL officials, led by Yuan, carried banners saying "CAL Asks  For the Forgiveness of the Victims," and "All CAL Staff Mourn  the Death of the Victims."    The CAL Airbus-300 crashed upon landing and caught fire at  the Nagoya airport in central Japan on Tuesday, killing 263 out  of the 271 passengers and crewmembers aboard in what was the  10th worst accident in world aviation history. Of the eight  survivors, two were Taiwanese.    Most of the bodies of the Taiwan victims, who were mostly  from southern Taiwan, were cremated in Nagoya.    After the ceremony, the remains and bodies of the southern  Taiwan victims were ferried from Chiang Kai-shek airport to  Kaohsiung by another CAL flight.</p>

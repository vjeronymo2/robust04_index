			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> HOLDOUT ENDS FOR NO. 1 PICK  </P> <P> After signing a long-term contract, Anthony Smith, the Raiders' No. 1 draft  pick, arrived at training camp Monday and pulled aside Coach Art Shell.  </P> <P> "He wanted to apologize for being late," Shell said of the defensive end who  ended a weeklong holdout. "But I told him that we're just happy to have him  here and we want to just move forward."  </P> <P> Said Smith: "Any time a guy's not here he's going to fall behind. But I'll make  it back up." He practiced for the first time Monday.  </P> <P> The Raiders have high expectations for Smith, the 11th player selected in the  draft. A 6-foot-3, 265-pound All-Pacific 10 Conference selection from Arizona,  Smith was one of the best pass rushers in college football last season.  </P> <P> "I don't have to prove anything," Smith said. "Al Davis drafted me because he  has confidence in my ability and my skills as a football player. That's all."  </P> <P> The Raiders hope to move Smith into the lineup slowly. He is projected as the  backup to Scott Davis at left end, and he might play tackle when the Raiders  employ an extra pass rusher.  </P> <P> "Smith was one of the best pass rushers in this draft," Shell said. "He's very  explosive and has the ability to come off the corner and rush the passer and  play the run."  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> Jay Lawrence, who covers the Raiders for the Orange County Register, was banned  Monday from watching the team practice because he has accepted a job covering  the Denver Broncos at a Denver newspaper, the Rocky Mountain News. The Raiders  apparently feared Lawrence, who will continue to work for the Register until he  switches jobs next month, might give away secrets. Lawrence will be allowed to  interview players and attend Coach Art Shell's daily press conference. "It  seems a little ridiculous," Lawrence said. "I'm certainly not going to go  running to anyone with the Denver Broncos and tell them what I've seen here."  Mark Tomaszewski, Register sports editor, called Raider executive John Herrera  to ask for an explanation. "(Herrera) said they're treating Jay as an  out-of-town reporter, and he's just following orders that Al Davis gave him,"  Tomaszewski said. Herrera refused comment.  </P></p>

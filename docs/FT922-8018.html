			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Making sense of the auditor FOR ALL its merits, the traditional British audit report, with its central assertion about the truth and fairness of company accounts, did not stand up well to the test of the financial scandals and corporate collapses of the 1980s. The mandarin phraseology of the report has always meant more to auditors than to those whom the auditors are supposed to serve. And since the true and fair formula appeared to hold out the promise of certainty in an area where subjective judgment is critically important, it gave a dangerously misleading impression to people whose grasp of accounting was limited - a category which, if academic surveys are to be believed, includes a majority of British fund managers. So much the better, then, that Britain's new Auditing Practices Board is setting out to make the auditor's report more informative. In one of its first three exposure drafts for public comment, published this week, the board is seeking to clarify the role of the auditor and to explain how the audit process has dealt with uncertainties that remain unresolved when financial statements are approved. The clarification of the auditor's role will no doubt provide satisfaction to the board's own immediate constituency since it will emphasise the narrowness of the auditor's remit. It has always been the directors' job to prepare the accounts, while the auditor's duty is merely to express an opinion. We will now be reminded of this division of labour ad infinitum in the annual report. Judgmental areas The more substantive reform concerns the judgmental areas in company accounts. Under existing auditing standards, the audit report has far too little to say about the nature of the uncertainty affecting the accounts. The threat of a qualified report has admittedly given auditors a stick with which to prompt management into making fuller disclosure in the notes to the accounts. Yet where the auditor's report is unqualified, the reader of the financial statements may not be aware of the significance of a given note within the context of a difficult audit process. On other occasions, the auditor will express a qualified opinion without giving adequate information to explain the implications for the business. The Auditing Practices Board now proposes that the auditor should qualify an opinion only where there is genuine disagreement over the accounting treatment of uncertainty and the adequacy of its disclosure; or, again, where uncertainty is caused by management placing some limit on the scope of the auditor's work. The auditor will be required to draw readers' attention to those uncertainties that are so fundamental that a judgment one way or the other could have a serious impact on the picture that the accounts reveal. And the basis of the auditor's opinion will be supported by a brief description of audit procedures. Weak link This is potentially helpful. But it is important to remember that audit failures in the 1980s were not solely to do with the uninformative nature of the auditor's report. There is a weak link in the chain of accountability, in that the auditor's fees, though formally sanctioned by the shareholders, are for all practical purposes in the gift of the management on whose stewardship the auditor is supposed to pass an independent opinion. The quality of audit judgments has also declined as the big accounting firms have come to regard the audit function - privately, if not in public - as a loss leader for lucrative consultancy services. To make matters worse, the judgment in the recent Caparo case limited the auditor's liability for negligence to present shareholders, leaving third parties wholly unprotected. A tighter framework of accountability is needed. And it may not be enough simply to call for disclosure of consultancy fees from audit clients, as the Cadbury committee is shortly expected to do. The auditor must be seen to be free from such conflicts of interest. Whether that can be achieved without restructuring the accountancy profession is a moot point. But such an upheaval may, in the end, be unavoidable. In the meantime, a statutory clarification and extension of the auditor's responsibility to all stakeholders in the business is badly needed.</p>

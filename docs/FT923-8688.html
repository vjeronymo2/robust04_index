			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Sterling in limelight STERLING will take the limelight in foreign currency trading this week as a batch of indicators shows whether there are any signs of an economic upturn in the UK, writes James Blitz. Analysts believe that there are significant risks that the pound will break new ground in its descent against the D-Mark in forthcoming days. Last week's cut in interest rates on certain National Savings products unnerved sterling investors because it suggested to them that the government will not tighten monetary policy. July's fall in UK house prices also helped to bring sterling down to DM2.8247, its lowest point against the D-Mark since Britain joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism in October 1990. A host of economic indicators this week may underline sterling's fundamental weakness. Thursday will be the most important day, bringing the unemployment figures for July and the industrial production number for June, both of which are likely to show the economy slowing down. Friday's Retail Prices Index for July may bring some relief, showing that inflation is under control. Two factors may help save the pound's fall. The first is the threat of intervention by the Bank of England, and many analysts believe that the authorities will be waiting in the wings iof the piund falls below DM2.80. Wednesday's weekly intervention by the Bundesbank in the German money market is also important. Although the threat of a Lombard rate rise has been put off, German call money is virtually at the Lombard rate level of 9.75 per cent. If the Bundesbank adds liquidity to the market, this may slow sterling's descent.</p>

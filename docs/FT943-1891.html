			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Parliament may prove to be stumbling block for Aristide Police brutality on the streets of Port-au-Prince over the last two days has shown the truth of the Haitian proverb, 'Mennen koulev lekol pa anyen. Se fe'l chita ki red' - It's nothing to lead the snake to school, making it sit down is the hard part. Training the Haitian militia to replace political violence with civilised law enforcement has become a priority for Operation Restore Democracy. But the police have not been the only unruly characters who could spoil a peaceful transition. Haiti's parliament, which has evaded votes to restore exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, may yet prove a significant obstacle to installing a functioning democracy. The parliament and Mr Aristide, at loggerheads for the seven months of his term in Haiti and hostile to him in exile, will have to find a new modus vivendi. The first hurdle however, will be the passing of a law granting amnesty to the existing military regime. Under the deal struck by former US President Jimmy Carter and provisional President Emile Jonassaint last Sunday, 'certain military officers' are expected to enter 'an early and honourable retirement when a general amnesty is voted into law by the Haitian parliament, or October 15 1994, whichever is earlier'. Although the deadline provides the US with a necessary get-out if the parliament proves contrary, failure to enact an amnesty would cast a pall over the future co-existence of an Aristide government and his former military ousters. Most people agree there is little to be gained from disrupting the progress of the US-Haiti programme to replace the military leaders with Mr Aristide, but the assembly has been unpredictable in the past. The 1992 Washington Protocol was scuppered by the parliament, which had complained that the agreement brokered by the Organisation of American States to restore Mr Aristide was unconstitutional. Thanks to a disruption by parliamentarians allied to the coup leaders, the assembly never managed to achieve a quorum. The Governor's Island accord last year intended to achieve similar goals met with a similar fate. According to one political observer in the Haitian capital, if Gen Raoul Cedras can find a purpose in holding up the restoration of Mr Aristide, the pattern of breached agreements made possible by a parliament may repeat itself; Gen Cedras may call on parliamentary appointees and allies to block the amnesty vote. US officials are optimistic but not taking ratification for granted. 'We have a lot of faith in the parliament if it can be assembled,' said Mr Stanley Schrager, US embassy spokesman in Port-au-Prince. However, Mr Benard Sansaricq, Senate president, did not foresee problems with getting the law through the assembly. He predicted the legislative process could be over in four days next week. After passing the bill, the Upper House will send it to the Chamber of Deputies, where it will be ratified unless the deputies see any need for modification, in which case it returns to the Senate. To avoid a time-consuming to and fro, Mr Sansaricq said yesterday he planned to convene a bicameral commission to draw up the bill. He had no doubt the Senate would pass the legislation, but would not speculate on the lower house, which is thought to be divided and susceptible to persuasion from the de facto executive. The amnesty law is only one step on the difficult road of reconciliation which Mr Aristide has advocated in Washington. Whether or not it passes, Mr Sansaricq plans to obstruct an Aristide government. 'I do not support the return of Aristide - but it was a fait accompli. I will work in opposition as an elected member of this parliament,' he said. Gridlock, a snake US administrations know all too well, may be one of the things restored along with democracy and President Aristide. See Editorial Comment</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRONG GEM  </P> <P> Charles Champlin erred when he wrote that Charles MacArthur said "I wish they  were diamonds" when he offered peanuts to renowned actress Helen Hayes ("Helen  Hayes Isn't Ready to Rust," May 13).  </P> <P> In her 1965 memoir "A Gift of Joy," Hayes told how her future husband, during  their first meeting, "poured several peanuts out of the bag into my hand. Then  he smiled and said, 'I wish they were emeralds.' "  </P> <P> In the same paragraph Miss Hayes noted that the oft-repeated proffer of love  had a new twist when, years later, the successful playwright brought her a bag  of emeralds from India, saying, "I wish they were peanuts."  </P> <P> ROBERT ADAMS  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

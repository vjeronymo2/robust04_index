			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPECIALISTS PROVIDE THOSE HARD-TO-GET PARTS FOR EXOTIC IMPORTED CARS  </P> <P> When people describe Southern California as the car capital of the world, they  mean not only the sheer number of cars, but also the variety. Ubiquitous  Chevrolets and Hondas share the roadway with less common Triumphs from Britain,  Porsches from West Germany and Alfa Romeos from Italy.  </P> <P> Yet common or rare, they all eventually need new parts -- the average new car  has 15,000 of them. If you drive a Chevy, buying parts is often as simple as  going to a nearby Chief or Pep Boys store, or perhaps the nearest Chevrolet  dealer.  </P> <P> But what if you drive an MG -- which is no longer manufactured -- and need a  water pump? Or a 1960 Porsche 356 blows out its clutch? Or a 20-year-old Alfa  Romeo Spider needs a U-joint? You could try a big chain like Chief, but there's  no guarantee it carries the part. A Porsche or Alfa dealership might have it,  but you'll pay top dollar and you might have to wait for the dealer to order  it.  </P> <P> So owners of such cars often go see Marty Osborne, Mel Kay or John Shankle. All  run firms in the San Fernando Valley that specialize in selling parts for  exotic European imports, and at prices that often undercut the dealers.  </P> <P> The three firms do much of their business by mail order, and in that market  alone they must vie against dozens of other independent parts suppliers  nationwide. Each of the three advertises in Road &amp; Track, Car and Driver  and other car-buff magazines, and each has a toll-free telephone number to take  orders. Kay and Shankle send parts catalogues to thousands of potential  customers around the world.  </P> <P> But for Osborne, Kay and Shankle, that's where the similarity ends.  </P> <P> Marty Osborne's Import Motor Parts in Sherman Oaks, which sells parts for  British cars only, is no Pep Boys. His one-room store looks a bit tattered and  grimy, and his two telephones are covered with his greasy fingerprints.  Pictures of old British roadsters hang on the walls.  </P> <P> There's no computer here to track Osborne's inventory of hundreds of parts. But  Osborne doesn't need one. The inventory is stored in Osborne's head. And if he  doesn't have the exact part, Osborne knows how to get it either from another  supplier or by improvising.  </P> <P> "No book said that an MGB U-joint is the same as a Lotus, and it is," said the  broad, 6-foot-4 Osborne, whose runs his shop in T-shirt, jeans and tennis  shoes. "No one knows that, but I do."  </P> <P> Osborne, 38, buys his parts from a handful of major suppliers from Britain, but  he also buys wrecks of British cars for salable parts. For instance, Osborne  sells the metal panel that surrounds the radio -- and includes the radio's  speakers -- for a 1969 Jaguar XKE. Price: $200. "I rebuild water pumps,  clutches, transmission, I do a lot of engines," he said.  </P> <P> One reason Import Motor Parts is able to survive is because some British cars  are no longer made, and thus are considered collectibles, he said. "The last  new MG and Triumph you could buy in this country was in 1980," he said. "I've  seen MGBs go from being a $100 car to a $5,000 and $6,000 car now. So people  come in and they want all these little pieces."  </P> <P> Osborne's father moved his family from Britain to Southern California in 1954  because Marty suffered from asthma. His father went to work for a Rolls  Royce-Jaguar dealership in Pasadena, then bought into Import Motor Parts and  eventually took over the business. But after the elder Osborne had a stroke in  1984, Marty Osborne abandoned his goal of going to veterinary school and began  selling parts fulltime.  </P> <P> In past years, Import Motor Parts had sold parts for a variety of foreign cars,  and had sales of about $720,000 a year and seven employees, Osborne said. But  when Osborne took over, parts chains such as Chief were mushrooming, and  Osborne said he concluded "there's no way I can compete with these people." So  he focused only on British models, kept just one employee to deliver parts, and  now does about $250,000 in sales, he said.  </P> <P> Osborne is trying to build his mail-order business, which accounts for 30% of  his sales. He has a facsimile machine and a toll-free telephone number, and  gets orders from as far away as New Zealand.  </P> <P> He claims he'd keep working even if he won the lottery because "I really love  what I do." Besides, he said, "I don't have a business to sell really. If I'm  not here, no one could really do it. It's all in my memory."  </P> <P> John Shankle only tacitly acknowledges it, but his Shankle Engineering in  Chatsworth, which sells replacement parts for Alfa Romeos, thrives in large  part because the Alfa is not the most reliable car on earth.  </P> <P> Shankle, 55, diplomatically calls the Italian sports car "more temperamental"  than most others. "They are really great cars, basically, but they have these  little idiosyncrasies that crop up," he says.  </P> <P> For instance, the workings of their electrical parts "are just totally  puzzling," Shankle said. "I've often wondered how Marconi invented the radio. I  think he was trying to design a meat grinder and somehow made a mistake."  </P> <P> Alfa engines in older models also are notorious for being unable to keep the  crankcase oil from mixing with the cooling system's water, which causes the  engine to overheat. So Shankle sells a $46 "sure seal" kit he designed that  re-routes the oil to reduce the engine pressure that causes the leakage.  </P> <P> Despite these problems, Alfa owners are considered loyal and many tinker with  their cars enough to keep Shankle Engineering's 10 workers busy, even though  the market for Alfas is relatively small. His firm figures there are only about  25,000 to 40,000 Alfas on the road nationwide; by contrast, Honda sold 11,800  cars in late-June alone.  </P> <P> Shankle bought his first Alfa in 1958, then raced the cars for the next decade.  An engineer by trade, he started his parts business in 1967 mainly to sell  racing-type parts to jazz up Alfas. He eventually began selling replacement  parts as well, and now also sells add-on parts for Hondas.  </P> <P> Ninety percent of Shankle's parts are shipped to mail-order customers, and he  estimated the firm's sales this year would reach $850,000. He doesn't have to  look far for competition. To the east in Glendale is Alfa Ricambi, an Alfa  parts dealer with more than 20,000 replacement parts.  </P> <P> But Shankle sees his own market remaining stable. "My hunch is that 20 years  from now, you won't see many people fussing around with Honda CRXs, but they  still will be playing with their Alfas," he said.  </P> <P> If Import Motor Parts is a corner drugstore of parts, Performance Products in  Van Nuys is a department store. Performance, which sells only parts for  Porsches, has a cramped but clean front entrance chock-full of neatly displayed  parts and accessories to tempt walk-in buyers.  </P> <P> Like Shankle Engineering, Performance sells 90% of its parts by mail order, and  the heart of Performance is in back where it keeps rows of parts stacked 10  feet high. The firm does not sell used or rebuilt items, only new ones.  </P> <P> Twice a year Performance sends its slick, 170-page catalogue to more than  200,000 Porsche owners nationwide. Owner Mel Kay's mailing list is compiled  from names of previous customers and lists of drivers from state department of  motor vehicle offices nationwide.  </P> <P> Kay asserts that "we're the Nordstrom of the auto-parts business." But he's  referring more to Nordstrom's renowned attention to service than to the  department store's size.  </P> <P> Performance Products prospers mainly because Porsche dealers provide only  grudging help for customers needing parts, said Kay. "The dealers' attitude is  really what helps us in this business; they don't treat people properly," said  Kay, who ran a surgical supplies firm before he and a partner bought  Performance five years ago. The partner has since died, leaving Kay sole owner.  The firm was started 25 years ago.  </P> <P> Kay, 51, contends he outperforms the dealers by giving refunds, referring  customers to other dealers if Performance doesn't have the part, talking with  customers to ensure they are ordering the part they need and undercutting the  dealers on price.  </P> <P> Kay won't reveal Performance's exact sales, except to say they're less than $10  million and that the firm is 2 1/2 times bigger than when he took over.  Regardless, it's clear the firm is a multimillion-dollar business. Performance  uses computers to monitor its inventory of 5,000 parts, help its 30 employees  answer questions from callers and help design its semi-annual catalogue.  </P> <P> At Performance, you can buy a starter for a 1955 Porsche 356 for $89.50, or a  windshield-wiper motor for a 1965 Porsche 911 for $325. How about a plastic  cover to protect the rear of your Porsche 944s side-view mirrors from flying  pebbles? Kay sells them for $14.95.  </P> <P> Performance, like many other parts houses, can sell parts for less than car  dealers because the parts houses usually buy directly from suppliers, Kay said.  Dealers, by contrast, often buy parts at the end of a long distribution line  that includes the German supplier, North American distributors and other  middlemen, all of whom make the part more expensive, he said.  </P> <P> Kay says he gets all kinds of customers. He recalled the time a Porsche owner  drove up with a shoe-sized dent in his door. Kay said that when he asked what  happened the driver said, " 'My girlfriend feels that I treat the car better  than her. She got so mad she put her foot in the door.' "  </P> <P> The bottom line is that one way or another cars take a beating, and when they  do, Kay is ready.  </P></p>

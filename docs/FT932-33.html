			<p>930630 FT  30 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Israel TEL AVIV scored a 6.7 per cent gain after the Treasury ruled out imposing taxes on stock market profits, writes Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem. The Mishtanim index rose 12.45 to 199.47, in heavy turnover of Shk237m (Dollars 84.6m). On Tuesday, the Mishtanim had fallen to its lowest level since last November. However, Mr Abraham Shohat, Israel's finance minister, ended months of uncertainty on Tuesday evening, saying that he had decided to rule out a capital gains tax to inject stability into Israel's capital market. Mr Shohat also said that the imposition of a new tax would have hampered government plans to privatise several state-owned companies by selling shares to the public.</p>

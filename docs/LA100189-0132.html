			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HYPERION OFFICIALS SAY BIG-TANK PLAN IS NOT SET;  </P> <P> TREATMENT PLANT TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES IN WAKE OF UPROAR OVER PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Hyperion Treatment Plant officials, reacting to angry El Segundo residents,  emphasized last week that no final decision has been reached on whether to  build a row of giant processing tanks that would block homeowner views.  </P> <P> "We are not even close to saying this is what we are going to do," Walt Naydo,  division engineer for Hyperion, said in response to the proposal to erect a  number of 105-foot-high processing tanks as part of the ongoing work to  increase the plant's capacity.  </P> <P> Naydo added that Hyperion, which is operated by the city of Los Angeles, would  embark on a worldwide search to determine if there are other types of tanks  that could be used.  </P> <P> Naydo's remarks came in reaction to the uproar that followed a balloon  demonstration conducted by Hyperion officials Sept. 23. Fifty large weather  balloons were floated about 100 feet into the air to demonstrate to homeowners  who live on the bluffs above the plant how their views might be affected.  </P> <P> A number of residents immediately -- and vociferously -- complained to El  Segundo and Hyperion officials that the tanks would block their beach and ocean  views, and drive down property values. They also contended that the tanks would  block ocean breezes that dissipate the bad odors that sometimes emanate from  the plant.  </P> <P> "I can live with the plant the way it is now," said Elisa Bonilla, who moved to  a home on Dune Street above the plant two years ago with her husband and three  children. " . . . Now all of a sudden we have a 100-foot wall that is going to  be built in front of us. That is not fair."  </P> <P> Said El Segundo City Councilman Scot Dannen: "This is not just a strike against  El Segundo. This is a strike against the entire Santa Monica Bay" because the  tanks would be visible all along the beach and from the water.  </P> <P> Dannen spent much of last week organizing a community forum on the issue. About  200 residents attended a Thursday night meeting at Recreation Park, demanding  that plans for the tanks be dropped.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concern for Blocked Views  </P> <P> Afterward, Dannen said that he is convinced that Hyperion officials are sincere  about trying to find alternatives to the tanks. However, he said he is  unwilling to live with any tank that would block any homeowner's view.  </P> <P> "If they can make it so we don't see them at all, that is fine," Dannen said.  "But we will not tolerate any interference with our views."  </P> <P> Dannen said he and residents will launch an aggressive, grass-roots campaign in  an effort to garner political support. The final decision, which could come  within three months, rests with Los Angeles City Engineer Robert Horii and the  city's director of the Bureau of Sanitation, Delwin Biagi.  </P> <P> Hyperion officials said the proposed tanks, called digesters, would be  egg-shaped and about 85 feet in diameter. If approved by the Environmental  Protection Agency, a dozen tanks would be erected, probably by 1993, and nine  others could be built in future years. Construction of the first batch would  probably begin in mid-1991.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Efficient System  </P> <P> Naydo said the proposed 105-foot-high tanks are more efficient and easier to  maintain than the 18 digesters now in operation at the plant. In addition, the  proposed tanks would take up less space than the current type, he said, thereby  allowing the plant to build more digesters to treat more sewage. The digesters  currently in use are 25 feet high and 110 feet wide.  </P> <P> In an area equivalent in size to where four digesters now stand, nine of the  tall digesters could be built and the volume of sewage treated could be  doubled, Naydo said. Each of the proposed tanks would hold about 2.5 million  gallons of solid sewage.  </P> <P> Naydo said the height of the proposed tanks, which are commonly used in Europe,  could easily be reduced by five feet, and perhaps more, simply by making the  diameter of the tanks wider.  </P> <P> Also, Naydo said, the tanks could be lowered all the way into the ground,  although such a move would be "very, very expensive." Plans call for the tanks  to be lowered 30 feet into the ground, but not further because they would  encounter ground water.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lower Profile Costs More  </P> <P> "You can go as deep as necessary in order to completely eliminate the visual  impact," Naydo said, adding that the estimated $70-million price tag for  building 18 tall digesters would probably double if they were buried.  </P> <P> Construction of the tanks is unrelated to the federal court order requiring  Hyperion to become a full secondary treatment plant by 1998, said Naydo.  </P> <P> Naydo said the balloon test was conducted at the suggestion of El Segundo Mayor  Carl Jacobson. Before to the test, few residents bothered to show up at  workshops or a public hearing held by Hyperion to discuss the plan for the  proposed tanks.  </P> <P> "Basically . . . we needed information from the residents to determine how  seriously the impact may be and we needed something to work from," Naydo said.  "From our perspective, this is only the beginning of the decision-making  process."  </P></p>

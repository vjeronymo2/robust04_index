Of them, seven died with the various clinical  manifestations of the virus and three died not as a result of  the virus.    Sixteen of them are males and five females. Six are from  various towns throughout Macedonia, while the rest are from  Skopje.    With the exception of one hemophiliac, the rest got the  virus  through sexual contacts, through already seropositive parents,  or through needles while using drugs.    The largest number of them obtained the virus outside of  Macedonia even though there are cases where some were infected  with the virus in Macedonia.</p>

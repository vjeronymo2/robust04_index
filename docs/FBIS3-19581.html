In a statement at the airport before his departure, Cetin  said that Turkey welcomed this step taken by Bosnians and Croats  and hoped that real peace comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina when Serbs  join this process too.    "Turkey is ready to contribute to the UN Forces in the  region, for a lasting, equitable peace," Cetin said.    "Turkey, which has the confidence of both Croats and  Bosnians, will continue contributing actively to the peace  process in the region," he said.    Cetin added that the ceremony, to which he was invited by  his  American counterpart Warren Christopher, showed once more the  importance and weight of Turkey in the Balkans.    On Turkey's proposal to join the UNPROFOR [United Nations  Protection Forces] in the region, Cetin said that French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe, who was visiting Turkey, said that his  country did not oppose this initiative.    Evaluating Juppe's visit, Cetin said that the French  Government was not displaying a disturbing stand toward Turkey  and was very careful in not intervening in Turkey's internal  affairs.    Cetin will proceed from Washington to New York and will  return home on March 20.</p>

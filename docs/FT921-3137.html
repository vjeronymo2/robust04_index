			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: BBC criticised after changes to talk show format LABOUR yesterday challenged the impartiality of the BBC's election coverage following changes to next week's edition of the Money Programme made after the Conservative party threatened to withdraw its participation. Government and opposition treasury and trade spokesmen were to face a five-strong panel of senior industrial, city and trade union figures, with Mr Peter Jay, the BBC's economics editor, in the chair. The Conservatives said the make-up of the panel was biased towards Labour. The programme will now go ahead next Sunday in a different format without the panel, which was to have appeared in a total of three pre-election programmes. The changes follow the cancellation of last week's Panorama film, also presented by Mr Jay, which focused on the government's economic record. Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign coordinator, said: 'It is now clear that the BBC is being subjected to intolerable pressure from the Conservative party.' Labour accused the BBC of succumbing to Tory meddling over Panorama. A panel member, Mr Martin Taylor, vice-president of Hanson, the multi-national group, said: 'I regret that the series of programmes is not now to take place.' It is understood that Mr Taylor, a Conservative supporter, believed the panel was balanced. Conservative Central Office said yesterday: 'Two members of the panel have been publicly identified with the Labour party. The political balance was not right.' Both Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, are prepared to take part in the programme in a different format. Tory objections centred on Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEU engineering union, and Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, the food manufacturing company. Both are broadly sympathetic to Labour. Central Office said it only knew of one member, Mr Taylor, who could be described as sympathetic to the Conservatives. Central Office said it did not know the politics of the other members of the panel; Ms Janet Cohen, corporate finance director of Charterhouse bank, and Mr David Sainsbury, deputy chairman of Sainsbury, the supermarket group. The BBC said it regretted the Conservatives' stance but would not change the panel. 'We believe the panel would have rigorously tested all three parties. 'The majority of the panel and the BBC felt it would be wrong to subject only Labour and Liberal Democrat representatives to scrutiny.' The corporation had therefore reluctantly changed the format. Mr Laird said: 'The Tories are clearly on the run and not interested in independent views such as the panel that the BBC put together.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["UR" report: "Scharping Accuses Kohl of Cheating Voters"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  Chairman Rudolf Scharping has condemned the Federal Government's  renunciation of a tax concept for the next election period as an  "attempt to cheat the voters on a large scale." The Federal  Government must explain to the public and to the Bundestag why  it does that, he said in Bonn's SPD Press Service on Friday [17  June]. After all, the tax concept was announced in January in  the government's annual economic report, which is an official  document.    Scharping sees primarily one reason for the renunciation:  "Chancellor Kohl does not have the courage to tell the people  that the government coalition is planning considerable tax  increases." It has obviously already been decided that the tax  lie of the previous Bundestag election will be repeated,  Scharping asserted.    Even after the debacle at the European elections, SPD  Chairman Rudolf Scharping does not want to change anything about  the program and the basic line of the election campaign. A few  days before the election party congress in Halle (22 June) he  announced that the SPD will "increase mobilization, make the  will for a change clearer, and improve its reform profile." The  election of the candidate for the chancellor's office is to be a  secret ballot. "I do not want an acclamation."    Even though he pointed out that he is not responsible for  every poster, Scharping admitted that he shares responsibility  for mistakes. Thus, the western German way of thinking was  transferred to the east, where it was not understood. He  himself "has done clearly too much during the past half year;  concentration is slipping."    Scharping still sees a chance to win the Bundestag  elections.  Yesterday Sharping did "not" want to "discuss publicly"  personnel reshuffles in the election campaign team and in the  party apparatus. He did not confirm Federal Manager Guenter  Verheugen's announcement that the shadow cabinet will be  presented at the end of July. Instead, he gave the second half  of August as the date.    The focal issue of the congress in Halle, which was  deliberately scheduled immediately before the Landtag elections  in Saxony-Anhalt, is the election program with 230 motions for  amendments. Guest speakers are new DGB [German Trade Union  Federation] Chairman Dieter Schulte as well as the prime  ministers of Spain and Norway, Gonzalez and Brundtland.</p>

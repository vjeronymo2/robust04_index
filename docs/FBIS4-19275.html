			<p>BFN     [Text] Greece's role for the achievement of peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina can be useful. This is the evaluation of new  Yugoslavia Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, who arrived  this afternoon in Athens.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Greek Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias and Yugoslav Foreign Minister  Jovanovic are expected to discuss the situation in the former  Yugoslavia and the general situation in the Balkans. We will  examine ways to dissipate the clouds over the area, Jovanovic  said. The Yugoslav foreign minister appeared optimistic and  expressed the belief that in the end logic will prevail. He  also did not fail to stress that Greece and Yugoslavia are  positive factors of stability in the Balkans.    [Jovanovic, through interpreter] We believe that Greece's  role can be useful in working toward maintaining peace in our  region and toward the promotion of peaceful processes as was the  case in the past and is now.    [Papoulias] In a difficult period for our region, I think  that this meeting is necessary and indispensable due to the  developments. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporter: "Beijing Leaders Inspect Various </F> Localities, Political Bureau To Hold Meeting To Deal With  Loss-Making State Enterprises and Soaring Prices"]    [Text] On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 4 June  incident, members of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau  left Beijing to conduct "investigations and studies" in various  localities. They have returned one after the other to Beijing  in recent days. Reportedly, the Political Bureau will hold an  enlarged meeting within the next few days to study the current  political and economic situation and work out relevant  countermeasures.    During the politically sensitive period in May, General  Secretary Jiang Zemin assumed personal command in Beijing while  vice chairmen Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen of the Central Military  Commission inspected group armies of the navy and the ground  forces respectively.    With two topics in mind, the other Political Bureau members  left for inspection tours of other localities.    Following his visit to Inner Mongolia in early May to find  out about the unity situation among various nationalities and  the circumstances of large and medium state enterprises, Premier  Li Peng made a five-day inspection tour of Jiangsu from 17 to 22  May. In particular, he inspected local commodity production  bases and large and medium-sized state enterprises. In the  course of economic development, he urged them to maintain a  balance between local interests and central needs.    Vice Premier Zhu Rongji inspected grain production and the  grain purchase and marketing system of the Hangjiahu plain from  late April to early May. He handled the question of cultivated  land lying idle in the coastal areas, called for settling the  problem through legislation, and urged the local government to  keep prices under control. Later, he summoned an economic work  conference of seven central plain provinces in Wuhan and  Zhengzhou from 13 to 22 May to settle the problems in grain and  cotton production, purchase, and marketing and to check the  deficits of the state enterprises in these provinces.    Hu Jintao, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee  in charge of party affairs, inspected Henan's rural areas from  14 to 18 May to specially resolve the problems of party  organizations at the basic levels. He called on the party  organizations to unite the masses and maintain stability.    Li Ruihuan, member of the Political Bureau Standing  Committee, visited five northern European nations from 18 to 22  May. Following a private visit to Australia and New Zealand,  Tian Jiyun returned to China via Hong Kong on 12 May and made a  seven-day inspection tour of Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Qian  Qichen inspected Sichuan and Li Lanqing inspected Guangdong's  Zhuhai while Wu Bangguo, Chen Xitong, and Jiang Chunyun made  investigations and studies of their respective regions.    Following their inspection tours of various localities, it  is  said that the Political Bureau members will hold meetings in  Beijing to settle state enterprise deficits, suspension of  production, and unemployment and petitions arising from these,  as well as the problems of a standstill in agricultural  production, peasants allowing their fields to lie idle,  difficulties in purchasing and selling grain and cotton, the  issuance of IOU's, and peasants' complaints.    Viewed from the overall situation, the mainland's tightened  economy has resulted in a drop in the scale of capital  construction, investment, and other quotas. However, prices  remain high. Despite the relaxation of contradictions,  economists hold that there is little room to maneuver in  macroeconomic regulation and control, and the situation is by no  means optimistic.    As a matter of fact, the current political situation is  grimmer than the economic situation. Beijing looks relaxed  externally but is tense internally and massive forces are  stationed there to prevent trouble. However, people in Beijing  believe that the municipality is tranquil and no trouble is  likely to occur. If there should be trouble, it will probably  take place in the heavy industrial bases, areas inhabited by  minority nationalities, and the traditional grain production  bases.    According to common practice, important topics at the  current  enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau will include emergency  measures adopted to deal with U.S. extension of China's  most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, partial extension, or  sanctions imposed on certain products.</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Canadian Funding: Enthusiastic reception shows appeal of provincial issues CANADA's 10 provinces have a hearty appetite for funds and investors seem eager to satisfy it. The provinces and their utilities, such as Ontario Hydro and Hydro-Quebec, have tapped the domestic and international bond markets for about CDollars 24bn so far this year. Last week alone British Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia raised more than CDollars 1.5bn in Canadian and US dollar-denominated bonds. The appeal of Canadian provincial paper is reflected in a sharp narrowing of spreads over the past six months. Alberta's latest CDollars 750m, five-year issue was priced to yield 7.07 per cent, or 30 basis points above comparable Canadian government bonds, whereas the spread was 54 basis points earlier this year. While spreads may tighten a little further, investors are banking on further capital gains as Canadian interest rates continue to fall. The Canadian yield curve has never been steeper. Three-month Treasury bills were yielding 5.25 per cent at the end of last week, down from a peak of almost 13.7 per cent in mid-1990. By contrast, long-term Canadian government bond yields have fallen from 11.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent in the same period. Mr Barry Calhoun, chief fixed-income dealer at Toronto Dominion Bank, predicts that long-term bond yields could slide 2 to 3 percentage points. Investors increasingly view Canadian provincial issues as an alternative to US bonds, offering a higher yield without significantly greater risk. The spate of issues this year has greatly improved the liquidity of the provincial market. Ontario's budget last April was a milestone in improving the climate for provincial bond issues. The market had expected Ontario's 1992-93 deficit to soar from the original forecast of CDollars 8.9bn to as high as CDollars 14bn: instead the province's social democratic government announced a CDollars 9.9bn shortfall for the coming year. The Bank of Canada's performance in beating back inflation has also been bullish for bonds and the currency risk appears small. Cautious players would argue that the best of the provincial and Canadian bond market may be over. With Canada's economy still bumping along at the bottom of the cycle, several provinces may have difficulty meeting their budget deficit targets. Inflation is more likely to go up than down and negotiations over Quebec's future are entering a crucial phase. But the enthusiastic response to the recent spate of provincial issues indicates that many investors believe either that Canadian bond prices still have some steam left, or that Alberta or Nova Scotia are safer havens for their money at present than some of the alternatives, especially in Europe.</p>

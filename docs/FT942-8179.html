			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / British Gas may float business and home supply arm British Gas is considering floating its trading business, responsible for supplying gas to domestic and business customers, in an apparent U-turn on evidence it gave to last year's Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the gas industry.

Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, rejected the MMC's proposal, recommending instead full internal separation of the trading arm from transportation. British Gas's trading arm was recently split into two parts - public gas supply and contract trading - with combined annual turnover of more than Pounds 8bn. British Gas now appears to have altered its view, believing that flotation sooner rather than later would maximise shareholder value.

Splitting off trading may help shake the operation up and prepare it for the onslaught from independent gas companies.' The company said: 'The restructuring of the company into five units is proceeding so that they have their own profit centres and accounts.'</p>

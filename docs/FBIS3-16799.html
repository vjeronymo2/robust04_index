			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mayor of St. Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak has  extended the elections to the City Assembly, held on March 20,  by another 24 hours.    Sobchak did so just 90 minutes before voting was to end,  when  it became clear that the elections were a failure. According to  the city electoral commission, only 21.532000060100f the electors came  to the polling stations (elections will be considered valid if  252000060100f the electors take part in voting).    The electoral commission believes that a second round of  elections must be held. As each seat in the City Assembly is  contested by about 15 candidates, it is unlikely that any of  them will accrue the required 5010006040lus 1 vote.    Sobchak has made an amendment in the provision on elections  according to which a candidate shall be considered elected  during the first round if he receives a majority of the votes  irrespective of the number of voters.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. A contingent deferred sales charge (the ``Sales Charge'') may be assessed against Contract values upon surrender. The length of time from receipt of a premium payment to the time of surrender determines the Sales Charge. Purchase payments will be deemed to be surrendered in the order in which they are received and all surrenders will be deemed made first from purchase payments and then from other Contract values. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Sales Charge is 6% the first and second years, 5% the third and fourth years, 4% the fifth year, 3% the sixth year, 2% the seventh year, and 0% the eighth year. During the first seven Contract years, on a non-cumulative basis, a Contract owner may make a partial surrender of Contract values up to 10% of the aggregate premium payments made to the Contract (as determined on the date of the requested withdrawal) without application of the Sales Charge. After the seventh Contract year, the Contract owner may make a partial surrender of the greater of 10% of premium payments made during the seven years prior to the surrender, or 100% of the Contract value less the premium payments made during the seven years prior to the surrender, without the application of a Sales Charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Hartford Life will deduct an annual maintenance fee of $30 from each Contract to reimburse Hartford Life for expenses relating to administration and maintenance of the Contract and the Subaccounts. There is no charge for Contracts with more than a $50,000 Contract value on the Contract anniversary. The application states that the annual maintenance fee may not be increased during the life of the Contracts. Applicants further state that total revenues from the annual maintenance fees under the Contracts are not expected to exceed Hartford Life's average expected costs for administering the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Hartford Life will deduct a daily charge at the rate of 1.25% annually to compensate it for providing mortality and expense guarantees with respect to the Contracts. Applicants estimate that 0.90% of the 1.25% charge is for mortality risk and 0.35% is for expense risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Applicants state that the mortality risk arises from the obligation of Hartford Life to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Make monthly annuity payments, regardless of how long an annuitant may live and regardless of how long annuitants as a group may live; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Pay the minimum death benefit under a Contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Applicants state that the expense risk assumed by Hartford Life is the risk that the administrative fees assessed by Hartford Life will be insufficient to cover actual expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge will not increase. If the charge is insufficient to cover actual costs, the loss will fall on Hartford Life. Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient to meet actual expenses, the excess will be profit to Hartford Life and will be available for any proper corporate purpose. Applicants state that Hartford Life expects a reasonable profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request an exemption from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent relief is necessary to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2), in pertinent part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services of a character normally performed by the bank itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by Hartford Life under the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable variable annuity contracts. Applicants state that this representation is based upon a survey of comparable contracts issued by a large number of other insurance companies. The application states that Hartford Life will undertake to maintain and make available to the Commission upon request a memorandum setting forth in detail the methodology and the contracts of other insurance companies underlying this representation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Applicants represent that Hartford Life has concluded that there is the likelihood that the proceeds from sales loads will be insufficient to cover the expected costs of distributing the contracts. Applicants state that any shortfall will be covered from the assets of the general account, which may include profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. Hartford Life has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the Account's distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Account and Contract owners. Applicants further state that Hartford Life undertakes to maintain and make available to the Commission, upon request, a memorandum setting forth the basis for this representation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants represent that the Account will invest only in open-end management companies which have undertaken to have a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the open-end management company, formulate and approve any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Employee Information and Training, Paragraph (g) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Are the provisions proposing that building systems maintenance workers receive special training with respect to the use of personal protective equipment, use of ventilation during cleaning and maintenance activities, and on proper use and disposal of hazardous chemicals and other agents, necessary and appropriate to assure maintenance of acceptable indoor air quality? Why? Why not? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Should training of building maintenance and systems workers include additional specific elements not proposed in this notice? What should this additional training consist of and why? Which workers should this training be provided to_all maintenance and building systems workers, supervisors, crew leaders? Should such training be provided periodically, or would initial training suffice? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Is it necessary, as proposed, to require that all employees in the facility be informed of the contents of the standard and of signs and symptoms associated with building-related illness? Why? Why not?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recordkeeping, Paragraph (h) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Will retention of records, as proposed, enhance the potential for reducing indoor air quality problems? Will retention of maintenance records, IAQ compliance program records, and records of employee complaints serve as necessary documentation upon which actions and decisions can be made to improve deficiencies found in facility air quality? If so, how will these records serve that purpose? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) What length of time should the records required to be established under this proposal be required to be retained? Is OSHA's proposed 3-year retention period reasonable? Why? Why not? Should different retention periods be specified for each particular record, and if so, why? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Is it reasonable to require transfer of records from an employee to a successor employer? What other mechanisms are available to ensure that the facility-specific records remain at the building or facility in the event of tenant turnover? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Dates, Paragraph (i) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Is it feasible for employees to fully implement the provisions of this notice within one year of the effective date, as proposed? Why? Why not? If not, which provisions present difficulties, technologic or economic, with respect to implementation? For which provisions should implementation periods be either decreased or increased and why? To what extent should implementation periods be decreased or increased for particular provisions? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. State Plan Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 25 states and territories with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans must adopt a comparable standard within six months of the publication date of a final standard.

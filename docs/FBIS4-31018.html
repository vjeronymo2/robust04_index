			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Marian Munteanu,  head of the Movement for Romania [MPR], presented to a news  conference on 31 May a document, dated 20 December 1993, issued  by the Association for the Redemption of the Rights and  Properties of the Jews of Romanian Extraction.    According to Marian Munteanu, the document had been advanced  to the government and Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu. He claimed that  meetings had taken place on the issue of Holocaust in Romania.  In the presented document, the Association demands from the  Romanian state the restitution of the material assets possessed  by the former Romanian citizens of Jewish origin and assumption  by the Romanian state of responsibility for the killing of  400,000 Jews during the Second World War, by the "Romanian  fascist" regime.    Marian Munteanu thinks the claims are not justified, since  "there was no fascist state and no Holocaust in Romania" and the  figure of 400,000 is "a simple mistake caused by insufficient  knowledge of historic reality." The Movement for Romania, a  non-parliamentary party, considers that the victims of  repression and violence in Romania were Romanians and by no  means the national minorities. A commitment by the state's  current rulers to what the Jewish organizations claim might lead  to Romania's economic enslaving, forcing the Romanian people to  pay tens of billions of dollars in damages and retrocession of  real estate and enterprises, Marian Munteanu said. He hoped  Romania's president would deny the claims of the Association for  Redemption of the Rights and Properties of the Jews of Romanian  Extraction.</p>

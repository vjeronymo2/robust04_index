			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Giant smelter facing 'unbelievable problems' RUSSIA'S GIANT Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter is facing a mass of 'unbelievably complicated problems', according to Mr Vladimir Nikitchenko, the deputy director, reports Reuter from Krasnoyarsk. But he insists that the plant will maintain current output levels. 'In the last two months the cost of our aluminium has doubled from 50,000 roubles (Dollars 310 at the Russian central bank exchange rate) to 120,000 roubles a tonne,' he said this week. Electricity, which accounts for 60 to 70 per cent of the cost of producing aluminium, has recently doubled in price. 'In the old days we knew a supplier would supply us, and he was obliged to do so at a set price and within a set time. Today no one owes (anybody) anything,' he said. One of the plant's alumina (aluminium oxide) suppliers in Nikolayev, a town in the newly-independent Ukraine, was 'playing up', but that was only part of the problem. Huge price rises and critical cash shortages had set off a vicious circle of unpaid debts among domestic consumers and suppliers, he said. 'Our customers are in debt to us . . . and we are paying part of what we owe. We are delivering metals to consumers without taking money because we know they have none. But not taking money from our customers makes it hard to pay our suppliers.' The plant covers an area of 30 square km (12 square miles) and employs about 12,000 workers. 'This factory is colossal and no one will allow it to be closed down,' said Mr Nikitchenko, adding that 70,000 people in Krasnoyarsk  -a city of 1m people - depended on the plant as did 70m people across the country. Local ecologists say the plant's emissions are dangerous but Nikitchenko claimed experts rated them as tolerable. He said the plant was involved in a Dollars 30m long-term project with Kaiser Aluminum Corporation of the US to modernise the electrolysis process and to build gas-cleaning equipment. Nikitchenko said the plant was planning to privatise itself so it could leave the state sector.</p>

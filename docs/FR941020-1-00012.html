			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1781 of the Leland Act required the Department to promulgate a final rule to implement Section 1719 of the Leland Act by October 1, 1991, with implementation required the first day of the month 120 days after publication of implementing regulations. Thus, the latest date for implementation of Section 1719 of the Leland Act was February 1, 1992. The 1991 Technical Amendments require Section 904 to be effective and implemented no later than February 1, 1992. In response to these implementation requirements, and since final regulations would not be issued before that date, the Department issued a memorandum, dated December 27, 1991, notifying State agencies of these provisions and the February implementation date. State agencies were advised to exercise their best judgment regarding procedures for applying these provisions. Clarification that the standard did not apply to vehicles was provided to all State agencies in January 1992. Whatever standards State agencies have used between February 1, 1992 and the publication of the final rule meet the requirements of the Act, provided that such standards were not applied to vehicles. Recognizing that the statutory amendments regarding inaccessible resources have already been implemented through the above described memoranda and in order to provide for the orderly implementation of the specific provision of this proposed rule, the Department is proposing to require that this rule be effective in any given State upon implementation by the State agency but in no event later than the first day of the month 120 days after publication of the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 273 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedures, Aliens, Claims, Food stamps, Grant programs-social programs, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Social security, Students. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, 7 CFR Part 273 is proposed to be amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 273_CERTIFICATION OF ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

A resource shall be so identified if its sale or other disposition is unlikely to produce any significant amount of funds for the support of the household. This provision does not apply to negotiable financial instruments or vehicles. The determination of whether any part of the value of a vehicle is included as a resource shall be handled using the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section. The State agency may require verification of the value of a resource to be excluded if the information provided by the household is questionable. The following definitions shall be used in developing these standards: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Significant return  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> shall be any return, after estimated costs of sale or disposition, and taking into account the ownership interest of the household, that is estimated to be one half or more of the applicable resource limit for the household; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Any significant amount of funds <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  shall be funds amounting to one half or more of the applicable resource limit for the household. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ellen Haas, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25977 Filed 10&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;30&hyph;U <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

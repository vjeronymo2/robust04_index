			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 24 KYODO -- Officials from Japan  and the United States began Friday what is expected to be a  marathon round of talks on automobile trade issues.    A Japanese official said that in a "worst case scenario,"  the  two sides would find themselves talking to each other right  before a summit meeting Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was  scheduled to hold with President Bill Clinton on July 8 in  Naples.    In Tokyo on Saturday morning Japan time, Hata reportedly  decided to step down together with his ministers.    Japanese officials say both sides have shown little  willingness to bend on "matters of principle" involving the  issue of how to measure progress of foreign access into the  Japanese market, the biggest roadblock in the year-old  "framework" trade negotiations.    The auto trade talks -- one of the four priority "baskets"  in  the framework accord the two countries concluded during last  year's G-7 summit in Tokyo -- are intended to boost the sale of  foreign automobiles in Japan as well as the sale of foreign auto  parts to Japanese automakers, both in Japan and in the U.S.    According to Japanese officials, the U.S. negotiators are  still insisting on what appears to be sales targets of a  "numerical nature" for determining how successfully foreign auto  firms are doing in Japan.    "This is something we cannot accept, as a matter of  principle," a Japanese official said.    U.S. officials, meanwhile, could not be reached for comment.    Japanese officials alluded to the necessity of "political  decision" to break the logjam, but the prospect appears unlikely  in view of political uncertainties surrounding the minority Hata  government.    The trade talks, between working-level officials from the  two  governments, are scheduled to grind on through the weekend.    On Monday, Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister of international  trade and industry for international affairs, will join his U.S.  counterpart, Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, to  explore the possibilities for a breakthrough.    Okamatsu and Garten will address "more critical issues," a  Japanese official said.    Japanese officials say there is no schedule on how long the  talks next week in Washington will last.    "Presumably, if the worse comes to worst, we might find  ourselves around until right before the summit," the official  said.</p>

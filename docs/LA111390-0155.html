			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PROFIT TAKERS MOVE IN, PUT DOW OFF 4.95  </P> <P> After two days of healthy buying, Wall Street traders took profits today,  sending stocks mildly lower.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 4.95 points at 2,535.40. Volume on  the New York Stock Exchange was a moderate 160.24 million shares, while  advancing stocks outpaced losers by about 8 to 7.  </P> <P> Traders said sharply rising bond prices -- a reflection of dealers' hopes that  the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates soon -- stopped blue chip stocks  from falling further.  </P> <P> Profit taking was the main reason for the Dow's decline. In the previous two  sessions, the 30-share index rose by a combined 96.54 points.  </P> <P> Throughout the day, the market had been fluctuating in a narrow range.  </P> <P> "My guess is it is the pause that refreshes," said Michael Metz, an analyst  with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "We've had a nice 100-point run in the last two  sessions. I think we're seeing a little profit-taking."  </P> <P> Stocks posted their gains as oil prices dropped sharply, but oil was moving  back up today, and some analysts believed that had put a brake on the stock  market.  </P> <P> "It's a little bit of a deterrent," said Jack Solomon of Bear Stearns &amp; Co.  He said the market seemed to be "resting."  </P> <P> Among actively traded issues, Philip Morris was down 5/8 at 48 3/4 with an hour  before the closing, Federal National Mortgage was up 3/4 at 32 3/4, American  Express was up 7/8 at 22 1/2, IBM was down 1/2 at 112 1/2, General Electric was  up 1/2 at 55 7/8 and Pepsi Co. was up 3/8 at 25 3/8. Toys R Us was up 7/8 at 23  5/8.  </P> <P> On the government bond market, long-term issues posted the steepest gains as  the market positioned itself for lower interest rates amid more negative news  about the economy.  </P> <P> The price of the government's bellwether 30-year bond, which climbed 29/32  point on Friday, was up another 3/4 point, or about $7.50 per $1,000 in face  value at midday. Its yield, which falls when the bond's price rises, tumbled to  8.55% from 8.62% late Friday. The government bond market was closed Monday for  Veterans Day.  </P> <P> Bond prices moved higher on the opening, building on gains posted overseas on  Monday.  </P></p>

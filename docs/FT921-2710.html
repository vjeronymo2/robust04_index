			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Plague of bad news leaves Oslo volatile  -There are a number of reasons why Norway has been vulnerable Volatility, and vulnerability, in the Oslo stock market has carried over from last year into 1992. Equities are plagued by bad news in Norway's banking sector, weaker 1991 earnings by blue chip industrials, low tanker rates suffered by shipping companies and confusion over takeover battles in the insurance sector. Since the close of 1991, the Oslo All-Share index has dipped by 0.30 per cent; but it has dropped by 13.7 per cent in the 12 months to the end of February. The market fell 9.4 per cent in 1991. Oslo's problems are not just psychological jitters caused by last year's near-collapse of the country's ailing banking industry; they are also related to the volatility of the crude oil market, from which Norway's economy needs a minimum price of Dollars 18 per barrel. In addition, Norway's big export industries, represented by blue chip stocks outside the oil sector, are suffering from a downturn in the world economy. This became distinctly apparent in February as 1991 profit and loss accounts began to flow. Norsk Hydro, the big blue chip which weighs heavily not only on the All-Share, but also on the industry sub-index, has seen its share price weaken 24.7 per cent in the last 12 months to end-February. Hydro's decline reflects the company's reversal in fortunes between 1990 to 1991, with its earnings hit hard by major write-offs in its agriculture and magnesium divisions. Last year the company slid into a net loss of NKr498m (Dollars 76.6m) from a profit in 1990 of NKr2.9bn, and was forced to pass its dividend. It also took a non-recurring NKr2.9bn charge for restructuring of the two divisions, compared with a NKr200m restructuring charge in 1990. The company's weak performance was reflected in a 6.6 per cent decline in the industry sub-index in January this year, although the fall since the start of the year has now been reduced to just 0.35 per cent. The banks sub-index, which last year saw the delisting of Norway's two biggest banks after they were nationalised in a state-backed rescue plan, plunged 71.4 per cent in the last 12 months to end-February. It fell 16.3 per cent in the first two months of this year, and by 14.7 per cent in January alone. The horrors of the sector's near demise almost destroyed investor confidence in the market as a whole. Analysts believe that sentiment is likely to continue to suffer but that several undervalued stocks will give a medium-term lift to the market, which will also be led by trends on Wall Street. Den norske Bank (DnB), Norway's biggest bank, was barely saved from insolvency last December by a state-backed rescue package which included a takeover of Realkreditt, the ailing mortgage group. DnB's 'A' shares fell 92.9 per cent from end-February 1991, when they were NKr90, to end-February this year when they stood at NKr6.40. However, as part of the state rescue plan the bank announced a NKr2.38bn preference share issue yesterday, to help it meet equity capital requirements by the end of the year. The shipping sub-index, in which Bergesen weighs heavily, has dropped 23.6 per cent in the last 12 months. In January, shipping issues fell 11.3 per cent but there was some recovery implicit in a two-month decline of 3.5 per cent since the start of the year to the end of last month. For its part, Bergesen's share price dropped 17.6 per cent in the 12 months to February on fears that tanker prices will continue to decline this year, and worries over where financing will be raised to renew the company's ageing fleet. Bergesen has a fleet of 18 tankers and warned that 1992 operating profit for that sector of business will be lower. Last year 54 per cent of Bergesen's NKr812m operating profit was derived from tanker operations. On a positive note, DnB Securities believes demand for oil tanker tonnage will increase by 2 to 7 per cent in 1992, with the supply side expected to grow by 5 per cent. The 12-month fall in insurance shares is 37.7 per cent. Uni Storebrand, the heavyweight of insurance stocks, has seen its share price tumble 44.2 per cent over the same period. The market is not convinced of the logic in Uni's NKr4.7bn investment in Skandia, the Swedish insurer, or how Uni will get around Skandia's voting limitation of 30 votes per individual shareholder if it is indeed seeking to take over the company.</p>

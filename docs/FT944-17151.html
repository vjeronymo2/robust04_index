			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / China finance ministry to borrow Dollars 10bn abroad China's finance ministry expects to increase significantly its foreign exposure by borrowing about Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.3bn) over the next five years on international capital markets to help fund the country's infrastructure requirements, according to a senior ministry official. Mr Gao Tian, director of the ministry's debt management department, said the ministry would take advantage of the longer maturities available internationally to boost its capital-raising abroad. This year the ministry has issued Dollars 1bn in global bonds. At the same time, the government would closely monitor borrowing by other state agencies and corporations to ensure that China's debt service ratio did not exceed 15 per cent. The present ratio is about 11 per cent. Mr Gao said China's 'long-term strategy' was to diversify its sources of capital. It would seek funds in the US, Japanese, Asian and European bond markets, depending on interest rate trends. He indicated that among the factors pushing China into the international capital markets was concern about rapidly increasing obligations to domestic bondholders. Most government paper carries short-term maturities of between one and five years. China this year issued more than Yn100bn (Pounds 7.4bn) of treasury bonds. Payments to bondholders will rise sharply to an average of Yn70bn over the next few years from Yn6bn-Yn10bn in the late 1980s. Mr Gao said it was difficult to persuade domestic investors to purchase bonds with longer maturities because of concern about rising prices. He indicated that China expected to maintain a fairly heavy borrowing programme for the rest of this century, but it would be sensitive to cost. This reflects a conservative approach within the bureaucracy. China's foreign debt, including that of state investment agencies, was Dollars 83.5bn at the end of 1993 and is expected to rise to about Dollars 100bn by the end of this year. The official Xinhua news agency quoted an official of the state administration of foreign exchange control as saying recently that 'it was time for China to limit its foreign borrowing and use as much direct overseas investment as possible'. The Xinhua dispatch also reported that the authorities were surveying some 500 enterprises and projects to assess how effectively foreign borrowings were being used. Chinese institutions, including among them the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, the state investment company, have been active in international capital markets for some time, but the ministry of finance was relatively slow to tap external sources until last year, with the issuing of Dollars 300m of 'dragon bonds' in the Asian market, following an earlier foray into the Eurobond market.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FLICKS: FILM AND VIDEO NOTES;  </P> <P> NOT SO HOT DOG;  </P> <P> FORGET THE FOOD, EXCEPT FOR THE POPCORN WITH CAREFULLY MEASURED BUTTER, AT THE  CAMARILLO CINEMAS.  </P> <P> Now at a theater near you:  </P> <P> No. 2 in a series of reviews of Ventura County movie theaters. This time we  take a look inside the Camarillo Cinemas at the Paseo Camarillo Shopping Center  on Daily Drive.  </P> <P> Food: The bad news about the hot dog is that it was rather bland. The good news  is that it was so small that it hardly mattered how it tasted.  </P> <P> The popcorn was good, with the butter carefully measured.  </P> <P> Restroom: Interestingly, the men's room is painted white and brown, to match  the look of the shopping center. The brown looks new, the white old and  peeling, with scattered flecks of yellow gunk. It looked like a mid-quality gas  station facility. One light fixture was broken, one toilet was out of order and  the metal towel dispenser was bent as if someone, for some bizarre reason, had  tried to break into it.  </P> <P> Pre-movie entertainment: No music or Muzak, but there is a chorus of beeping  from the four video games in the lobby.  </P> <P> Pre-movie ads: Two.  </P> <P> Previews: Two.  </P> <P> Movie screen: In theater No. 3, at least, the screen isn't deep enough. In the  opening credits, the letters making up the stars' names dropped off the bottom.  </P> <P> Jack Nicholson's film "The Two Jakes," the delayed sequel to "Chinatown,"  hasn't been that successful, but its presence has made the original a highly  sought-after commodity in the local video market. "Everyone's coming in for  it," said Ted Merrill of Video Adventures in Ojai, a store with only one copy  of "Chinatown." "It's on reserve every night."  </P> <P> New this week on the video shelves of Salzer's in Ventura: a four-set  collection of tapes from the TV series "Outer Limits." That's right, no need to  adjust your eyeglasses.  </P> <P> The titles are "Controlled Experiment," starring Carroll O'Connor; "The Human  Factor," with Sally Kellerman; "Behold Eck!" and "ZZZZZZ."  </P> <P> Salzer's, by the way, is undergoing changes in management.  </P> <P> Don't forget the Ojai Film Society's science fiction night Aug. 26. This  "Evening With the Incredible Shrinking Man" is being supported financially by  the Diet Center. Talk about a sure-fire weight loss technique. LEO SMITH  </P></p>

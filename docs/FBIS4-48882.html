			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Dongyun (3769 0392 0061): "China Punishes 21 </F> Chinese and Foreign Enterprises Involved in Illegal Textile  Transshipments"]    [Text] Guangzhou 10 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--This  reporter has learned from the Fourth National Work Meeting on  Cracking Down on Illegal Textile Transshipment Activities, which  was held here today, that to date, the relevant departments of  the Chinese Government had meted out severe punishment to 21  domestic manufacturing plants and export enterprises and foreign  enterprises involved in illegal textile transshipment.    It was learned that Chinese and foreign enterprises, namely  the Dongmao Enterprise Company Limited of Shenyang City, the  Guangyu Shareholding Xiamen Company of Fujian Province, and the  Shifa Garment Company Limited and the Yongjia Garment Plant  Company Limited of Shantou City in Guangdong Province were named  public; exchanges with Hong Kong's Daguo Company and the ROK's  Dongqing Trading Company Limited and Taiyuan Trading Company  Limited have been banned; and the Shanghai office of Hong Kong's  Linghua Company was closed down.    It was learned that since 1990, the U.S. side had presented  the Chinese Government with a total of 69 cases of illegal  textile transshipment and had asked the Chinese side to conduct  comprehensive investigations into them. To date, the Chinese  Government has given notice of the results of 47 investigations  cases to the U.S. side through the U.S. Embassy in China. The  remaining 22 cases are still under investigation.    Viewed from the results of the investigations, not many of  the Chinese export or manufacturing enterprises really intended  to bypass management quotas on textiles or to engage in illegal  transshipments, and most of them were innocently involved. For  example, they took part in illegal transshipments planned by  businessmen in Hong Kong and other regions without knowing that  such activities were illegal. Only a few lawless enterprises  planned and carried out illegal textile transshipments, seeking  exorbitant profits and ignoring the overall interests of the  country.    Viewed from cases provided by the U.S. side and from the  results of investigations conducted by the Chinese side, the  range of enterprises involved in illegal transshipments is quite  wide at present. These include enterprises engaged in three  forms of import processing and compensation trade,  foreign-invested enterprises, enterprises engaged in special  foreign trade, representative offices of foreign businessmen in  China, and manufacturing enterprises which are not authorized to  take part in foreign trade. Since foreign-invested enterprises  and township and town enterprises know very little about illegal  textile transshipments, more problems are found among them.    The meeting reaffirmed that in stopping and cracking down on  illegal textile transshipments, the Chinese Government would, as  before, adopt a resolute stand and attitude, severely punish  enterprises which are engaged in illegal transshipments, and  take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of this kind  of illegal activity.</p>

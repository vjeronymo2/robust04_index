			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / UK Company News: GM Firth Losses at GM Firth, the steel group, widened from Pounds 4.86m to Pounds 5.99m pre-tax for the year ended March 31. Losses per share rose from 12.27p to 17.02p. The directors said that management accounts for the first quarter showed a return to profitability for the Spartan Redheugh business but that this was insufficient to absorb losses on other group activities. They added that the continuing losses now arose primarily from costs associated with vacated properties.</p>

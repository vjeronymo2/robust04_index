			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Director's status crucial to LSO position during inquiry Sir, Richard Fairman, in his review of the London Symphony Orchestra's Gala concert ('Tireless Solti fires up LSO', October 27), raises the issue of the LSO's role during the Hoffmann inquiry in 1993. There was one crucial issue centrally affecting the public position the LSO took - that I am chairman of the Association of British Orchestras (ABO), as well as being managing director of the LSO. After the Arts Council announced its funding decision for London orchestras in July 1993 and set up the Hoffmann Committee, I offered my resignation as chairman of the ABO if the board felt that my continuing as chairman would create any conflict of interest. The ABO board unanimously asked me to remain. As the chairman of the ABO is always the manager of an orchestra, there can be times when the chairman's orchestra will be centrally involved in an issue the association has to deal with. It is the policy of the association that, on these occasions, it should be represented solely by its director, which was the case in 1993. Libby MacNamara, the director, ran all the meetings on this subject and publicly represented the ABO position extremely effectively. Furthermore, during the Hoffmann inquiry, the Musicians' Union called a meeting to consult players from the London orchestras about their views on the very serious implications of the inquiry and to co-ordinate solidarity between the orchestras. By far the greatest number of orchestral players from any of the four London orchestras who attended that meeting were LSO members; this does not indicate an orchestra which was not involved. Fairman also raises a point about the LSO Millennium Fund. In the difficult economic climate in which the LSO and all the UK orchestras are working, the LSO players have taken no fee rises for the past three years in order to fulfil the orchestra's commitment to the high artistic standards it has set itself. The LSO Millennium Fund has been established to endeavour to try to secure the orchestra's future and those very standards we have worked so hard to achieve.

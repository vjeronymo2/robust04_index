			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, April 4 (XINHUA) -- An international  symposium on China's Spark Program and an exhibition featuring  the program opened here today under the sponsorship of the  United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and China.    More than 140 delegates from 18 developing nations including  Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia and Brazil and 17 of China's  provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions as well as the  UNDP and several Chinese ministries attended today's meeting.    The Spark Program, initiated in 1986, is part of the plan  the  Chinese Government has undertaken to boost the rural economy  through science and technology. After eight years of effort,  the program has covered 85 percent of China's counties. Some  25,000 projects have achieved evident social and economic  returns.    The symposium was held to explore possibilities and ways for  rural economic and technological cooperation. The exhibition is  also expected to help promote technology transfers, product  exports and establishment of joint ventures.    Abebe Ambatchew and Romulo Garcia, two officials from the  UNDP, praised the Spark Program highly, saying that the program  has played a great role in boosting local economy through  science and technology, and the experience can now be studied by  other developing nations.    In addition, they say that the program has helped China in  fighting against poverty, in environmental protection and in  enhancing steady development of the rural economy.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / People: Pavia to quit Lasmo Michael Pavia, finance director of Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company, is to leave the company at the end of the year - the latest in a series of moves among senior executives as the company searches for a strategy to see it through a troubled period of weak oil prices. The future of Pavia, who has been with Lasmo for 14 years, had been the subject of much market speculation since the middle of last week. Joe Darby, chief executive, says his departure was 'one of several changes . . . following a thorough review of the company's strategy and management'. Earlier this year, John Hogan was appointed chief operating officer and Peter Nolan took over as head of exploration, while Darby himself only joined the company in February. City sentiment towards Lasmo has been decidedly gloomy of late, in large part because of its vulnerability to low oil prices, and the prospect of growing debt to finance new production. Darby yesterday denied that any additional moves were being planned, although at least one non-executive post will open up next year. Pavia's departure comes after a particularly active year, in which he helped Lasmo to raise Dollars 600m on the US capital markets. He also recently completed the financing of Lasmo's Pounds 350m share of the development costs for the Liverpool Bay oil and gas field, one of the projects which the company is hoping will boost its fortunes in coming years. Lasmo says there are several internal candidates for finance director, but executive search consultants will also be used.</p>

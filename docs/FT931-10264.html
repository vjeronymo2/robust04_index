			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Time-Warner strikes first profit since takeover TIME-WARNER, the US media group, yesterday reported its first annual net profit since the publishing group, Time, merged with entertainment company Warner in 1989. It made Dollars 86m (Pounds 56.9m) in 1992, against a loss of Dollars 99m in 1991. Fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 68m, up from Dollars 45m in the same period of 1991, thanks to higher operating profits at each of Time-Warner's five divisions. Time-Warner tries to concentrate Wall Street attention on its earnings before interest, taxes, appreciation and amortisation, on the grounds that its underlying performance is distorted both by its debt burden and by heavy non-cash amortisation charges, which totalled more than Dollars 500m in both 1991 and 1992. On this basis, profits rose 8 per cent in the fourth quarter, from Dollars 677m to Dollars 731m, and 11 per cent during the year, from Dollars 2.26bn to Dollars 2.51bn. Revenues for the quarter totalled Dollars 3.72bn, against Dollars 3.39bn, and for the year Dollars 13.07bn, against Dollars 12.02bn. However, at earnings per share level, the company's profits translated into losses. It reported a loss of 25 cents a share in the quarter, down from 29 cents a year ago, and a loss of Dollars 1.46 for the year, down from Dollars 2.40. The group's publishing division reported operating profits of Dollars 132m in the quarter (Dollars 124m), and Dollars 328m for 1992 (Dollars 246m). The filmed entertainment division rose to Dollars 92m in the quarter (Dollars 90m), and Dollars 410m for the year, up from Dollars 390m. The company said strong US box office results from the films The Bodyguard and Forever Young helped the quarter.</p>

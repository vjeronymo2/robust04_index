			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / MPs divided on BR sell-off plan MR JOHN MacGREGOR, transport secretary, was yesterday battling to defend his rail privatisation in the run-up to tomorrow's publication of the Railways Bill. There was some relief for him when it emerged that one of the main focuses of opposition to his plans - the cross-party Commons transport committee - was convulsed by internal dissent. Hostility to the plans has thrived amid growing confusion over what they mean for freight and passenger customers. The confusion has arisen because the government's plans involve a complex mix of continued state ownership for the tracks, outright sale for freight operations, and contracting-out to the private sector for passenger services. One of the most outspoken opponents of the privatisation plans has been Mr Robert Adley, the Conservative backbencher and railway enthusiast who chairs the Commons committee investigating the government's proposals. Yesterday the committee produced an interim report which had been expected to be highly critical of the government's plans. Instead, it confined itself to raising a series of 'unresolved issues'. It later emerged that the report had been agreed only after one Conservative member of the committee, Mr Matthew Banks, MP for Southport, had insisted on substantial amendments and deletions. Another Conservative member, Mr Nick Hawkins, MP for Blackpool South, dissociated himself from any implied criticism. Mr Adley said the report was inevitably a compromise between strongly held views. The report drew strong support from opposition parties, the public-transport lobby and the Central Transport Consultative Committee, the rail passengers' watchdog. The watchdog echoed MPs' concerns that franchising was incompatible with open access, that it could prove impractical to separate track ownership from train operation and that network benefits such as through-ticketing could be lost. Mr MacGregor said he had already agreed that some franchises could be exclusive and that others could include tracks as well as trains. The government had also promised that through-ticketing would be preserved, he said. Earlier, Mr MacGregor told a rail freight conference in London organised by the Waterfront Partnership consultancy that the introduction of track charges need not necessarily drive freight off the rails, 'providing they can cover the real costs of using the track'.</p>

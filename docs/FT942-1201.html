			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Site sale clinches Pounds 500m shopping complex Bluewater Park, a 1.625m sq ft shopping and leisure development at Dartford in Kent, is set to proceed as a result of the sale of the development site to Lend Lease, an Australian property company. The scheme, which is expected to carry a value of Pounds 500m-Pounds 600m on completion, is likely to be the last of the giant regional shopping schemes to be built following the government's crackdown on planning permission for out-of-town developments. The conditional sale of the site by Blue Circle Industries to Lend Lease ends years of speculation about the project's viability. Work is expected to begin later this year or early in 1995. Lend Lease, which operates 30 shopping centres in the US and Australia and has Pounds 6bn of funds under management, is confident it can put together a consortium of investors to fund the scheme's Pounds 300m construction costs. The Prudential, the life assurer, said yesterday that it was 'seriously considering' investing about Pounds 100m in the scheme. Bluewater Park will be in head-on competition with one of the UK's largest existing shopping centres at Thurrock, Lakeside, just 10 miles away, which is owned by Capital Shopping Centres. The scheme's promoters say that the river Thames, which runs between the two, will act as a natural divide. Moreover, they believe that demand, thought to embrace 6.5m people within 45 minutes drive time, is enough for both centres. The government's decision to restrict out-of-town developments in order to protect town centres has made it easier for the Bluewater scheme to attract investors because the policy is likely to add value to schemes that have already won planning permission. The decision by Blue Circle to sell its 230-acre site for Pounds 50m marks a decision that property is not part of its core business. The company, which has 20,000 acres of land surplus to its needs, will make a pre-tax profit of somewhere between Pounds 24m and Pounds 89m from the development over several years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jun 09, BNS -- The head of the Russian  delegation for talks with Lithuania confirmed that "Russia links  the problem of transit and normal functioning of the Kaliningrad  region to Lithuania's most favored nation trade status."    Viktor Isakov noted that "this is not a trap of officials or  the (Russian) Foreign Ministry," but "the line of the country's  leadership."    In an interview with the Vilnius-based Russian-language ECHO  LITVY newspaper, Isakov commented on a round of  Lithuanian-Russian talks that was held in Vilnius June 7-8.    Discussing Russian military transit, the Russian diplomat  said Russia "is not asking anything from Lithuania,...,and does  not demand to create some uncontrolled corridor." Isakov noted,  however, that Russia has some things to complain about. In his  words, "entire tank-cars of fuel disappear during transit  through Lithuanian territory." The Russian diplomat said  "explanations that cargos are redirected and even that mafia is  involved are not convincing."    Commenting on accusations that Russia pressurizes Lithuania,  Isakov said "not a single example of such threats and statements  was presented by the Lithuanian side. On the contrary, threats  to "shut in" the Kaliningrad region are already heard from the  Lithuanian side." In Isakov's view, difficulties in talks on  sea borders are "completely natural yet possible to overcome."    Isakov said assertions that Kaliningrad poses a military  threat is a fiction, "just another card in the game of those who  do not want improvement of relations" between Lithuania and  Russia.</p>

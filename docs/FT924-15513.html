			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Democrats hold their breath as Perot returns to the fray JUST one month away from the US presidential election, the campaign had settled into a pattern that appeared to open the way for Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic challenger, to build state by state on his lead over President George Bush, the Republican incumbent. The return of Mr Ross Perot to the race, together with the emergence of an agreement on when and where to hold televised debates between the candidates, offered at least the prospect of something to break the pattern. Many Democrats are still holding their breath, remembering their party's astonishing capacity for losing presidential elections. Yet the dynamics of the race have been moving inexorably in Mr Clinton's favour, and the Republicans are fervently praying that the uncertainty created by Mr Perot and by the debates could shift the odds Mr Bush's way. Realistically, neither Mr Perot's announcement on Thursday that he would re-enter the campaign he quit in July, nor the proposed three debates to be held between October 11 and October 19, has more than an outside chance of significantly altering the outcome of the November 3 election. Mr Perot has come a long way from the heady days of early summer, when opinion polls showed him leading both President Bush and Governor Clinton. Today, according to a CNN-USA Today poll, the Texas billionaire would score only 7 per cent in the election, compared with 35 per cent for Mr Bush and 52 per cent for Mr Clinton. Perhaps more significantly, 72 per cent of those questioned in the poll said there was no chance they would vote for Mr Perot. The results were scarcely more encouraging for the president, however, for 48 per cent said there was no chance they would vote for him, while only 32 ruled out voting for his Democratic rival. As for the debates, only that between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960 is widely credited with making much difference; even then, however, Kennedy merely cemented an existing lead in the opinion polls. Mr Perot, who has bought half-hour national television advertisements next week, seems likely to join the debates, and his twanging one-liners could well draw the limelight away from the two main candidates. Nevertheless, it would take a substantial blunder during the debates by Mr Clinton for them to have much impact on the result of the election on their own. Even with Mr Perot in the race, Mr Clinton has rock-solid leads in 16 states, including California, New York and Illinois, which carry great weight in the electoral college; President Bush, on the other hand, can count only on Indiana and Utah. With time fast running out, Mr Clinton can, therefore, concentrate on good prospects such as Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and even keep Mr Bush on the defensive with forays into once firmly Republican states such as Texas and Florida.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Provision increases TVS deficit to Pounds 27m - Agnew underlines 'total commitment' to oversee revival of company MR RUDOLF Agnew, chairman of TVS Entertainment, the ITV company which lost its franchise, promised yesterday to try to raise the company 'phoenix-like from the ashes.' The former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields said yesterday that he saw it as 'a very personal challenge' to stay on and try to rebuild TVS after it goes off the air at the end of this year. 'Its a total commitment,' said Mr Agnew, who still feels bitter that the company's bid of Pounds 59.75m a year was turned down by the Independent Television Commission. He faces a big challenge. The company yesterday announced that losses at the pre-tax level jumped from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 26.7m in 1991. The figure includes a further exceptional provision of Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 25.1m) against the programme stock of MTM, its US production subsidiary. In addition there was an extraordinary provision of Pounds 24m (Pounds 4m) flowing mainly from the loss of its licence. This included Pounds 18.8m for the fall in the value of assets such as studios, Pounds 9.9m in redundancy costs, and the Pounds 2.6m cost of the licence application. The provision was partly offset by Exchequer Levy relief of Pounds 2.3m and a Pounds 5m tax credit. There was a reduction of Pounds 20.9m in the revaluation reserve. TVS said the provisions were the main reason for the drop in net assets from Pounds 111.6m to Pounds 47.4m. The policy of not paying a dividend will continue. Net borrowing fell from Pounds 35.3m to Pounds 25.4m and is now closer to Pounds 15m. The company's aim is to continue to service the debt which is mainly in the US and accumulate cash in the UK in the last year of the franchise. Not including the remaining debt, TVS could have between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m in cash when the last 30 staff bow out. Apart from keeping its Maidstone studios and its UK programme catalogue  - three bids for 800 hours of programmes were all, at less than Pounds 2m, unacceptably low - TVS will also retain MTM. The outlook at MTM is a little brighter. Evening Shade, a comedy starring Burt Reynolds, produced with CBS, has been renewed until the 1993-94 broadcast season. This means there are enough episodes to licence the series to local TV stations. The Trials of Rosie O'Neill has also been renewed. Apart from exploiting existing assets Mr Agnew said the company would be seeking opportunities in the leisure and communications field. The areas being studied included independent production, television services and telecommunications. An attempt to return to broadcasting with partners when the barriers to takeovers of ITV companies are removed at the beginning of 1994 has not been ruled out. The TVS chairman said that the company's two main French shareholders, Canal Plus and Compagnie Generale des Eaux, were sticking with TVS.</p>

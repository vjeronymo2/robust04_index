			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Markets: A triumph of glib salesmanship - Serious Money HAVE you recently been offered a cash payout 'which could be worth up to Pounds 91,300 or more'? If so, you are probably a card member of American Express and may be finding the prospect of all that loot hard to resist. After all, if you apply by December 30, you can get a free gift of an alarm clock, garment carrier or 'luxury bath towel' in a genuine American Express card design (please do leave home without it). The offer is a prime example of how a marketing letter can conform to the regulations set by Lautro and yet be a triumph of slick salesmanship. What American Express is actually selling is a low-start, 15-year, with-profits endowment policy from Norwich Union, called Moneybuilder Plus. There is certainly no secret about this - it is stated in the first two paragraphs. But let us look at the second paragraph more closely. 'In brief,' it runs, 'this is an extraordinary 15-year endowment that, thanks to its low start feature, could offer you a substantially higher cash payout than even Norwich Union's ordinary 15-year plans. . . for the same initial contribution'. Sounds good, doesn't it? Put your cheque books away for a moment. First examine page two of the letter, which explains it all. 'How surprising, then, that the 'secret' of this dramatically higher growth should be so simple: Moneybuilder Plus builds a small, but powerful, yearly increase into your monthly premiums for the first five years of your plan (and then keeps them level until the end of the plan).' In fact, premiums will increase by 20 per cent of the original for each of the first five years. Your payment for the last ten years will be double the initial investment. Hold on a minute. So these 'dramatically higher' returns stem from the fact that you will be paying 'dramatically higher' premiums? Let us paraphrase. If you invest Pounds 100 a month in this plan, you will get a bigger return than if you invest Pounds 50. Extraordinary, as American Express would say. Does an increasing premium seem a turn-off? The letter has the answer; the increase 'could be just a few pence per day'. Not much compared with 'up to Pounds 91,300 or more', is it? What about this phrase, which is in big blue print at the top of the letter? It is none too specific when you think about it. Next to the Pounds 91,300 figure, there is an asterisk which leads to a footnote, which in turn leads to the policyholder information and benefits table. This table is based (as required by Lautro) on assumed growth rates of 7 and 10.5 per cent. It shows the potential returns for initial premiums of between Pounds 30 and Pounds 200 a month. Payouts also vary with age; the older you are, the greater the cost of life cover. American Express has not been so crass as to quote the maximum growth rate on the maximum premium for the youngest person. Not quite. The table shows that Pounds 91,300 is based on a 10.5 per cent growth rate for a 65-year-old man paying Pounds 200 a month. With increasing premiums, that means you would be paying Pounds 400 a month after five years. Your total premiums over the life of the plan would be Pounds 64,800, which puts the possible Pounds 91,300 payout in a rather different light. The letter claims this is 'a possible return that compares favourably with expected returns for national savings, building societies and certain stocks and shares'. Another interesting phrase; if savers could have a list of Amex's 'certain stocks and shares', investing would be a lot easier over the next 15 years. But to make a different comparison, the equivalent sum invested in the average UK equity general unit trust savings plan over the 15 years to March 1992 would have grown to Pounds 229,000, according to Money Management. The next 15 years may well be a lot less exciting for unit trust returns (although this will affect Norwich Union's plan as well). But it is far from certain that Norwich Union will produce returns which beat rival products - as John Authers writes on Page IV, it is about to cut bonuses on with-profits policies for the second year running. A further factor, of course, is that there is no life cover in a unit trust savings plan. But the letter concentrates on the investment, not the insurance, aspects of the plan. After all, on page three it says: 'Just imagine what you could do with all that money. You could take that world cruise you've always dreamed of, or perhaps buy a new boat or car.' Maybe. Not if you start by investing Pounds 30 a month; then you are looking forward (on the same assumptions) to just Pounds 13,300 after 15 years. If inflation averages five per cent per annum, that figure will halve in real terms over 15 years; in other words, it would be worth Pounds 6,650 in today's money. You could get a car for that price, but a BMW is out. American Express says that customers who have doubts can ring its financial services arm and get independent financial advice about the nature of the product and indeed other products if they are more suitable. And to be fair to Amex, no one could be misled about the nature of the product if they read the product particulars (which are included in the pack, as required by regulation). But there are no big blue letters, no underlined words such as 'dramatically higher' in the particulars; just sober facts about a modest product which has been over-hyped.</p>

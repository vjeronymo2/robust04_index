			<p>BFN     [Text] The Private Newspaper Publishers' Association,  PRINPAG, condemned the attack on the offices of the Free Press  in Accra, in which unknown assailants smeared the place with  night [as heard] soil. A statement issued by the association  described the attack as part of a long chain of acts of  commissions and omissions, which have been calculated to  intimidate the independent press into abandoning its  responsibility of contributing to the building of a decent  society in which the principles of probity and accountability  are respected. The private media representative on the National  Media Commission, Mr. Adu Kwabena Asem has, in a similar  statement condemned the soiling of the premises of the free  press.</p>

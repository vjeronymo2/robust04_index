			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, April 23 (KCNA) -- Kim Chang-su, deputy  chief of the mission of the South Korean National Democratic  Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon) in Cuba, at a press conference here on  April 18 on the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the April 19  popular uprising called upon the South Korean people to  overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime and establish a  democratic government.    He said the April 19, 1960, popular uprising in South Korea  was a righteous resistance of the people who rose up in demand  of a new politics, a new system and a new life against the  colonial ruling system and fascist suppression by the U.S.  imperialists and the Syngman Rhee puppet clique.    "The day is gone when the United States could model the  world  to its pleasure with strength and a strong arm," he said, and  demanded: "The United States must squarely face the situation,  immediately stop its adventurous war moves and get out of South  Korea at once, taking along its forces and destruction weapons."    Denouncing the anti-reunification, anti-national and  anti-popular crimes of the "civilian government", he said: "What  Kim Yong-sam has done under the civilian mask eloquently proves  that he is a truculent fascist dictator, splittist, sychophant  traitor and warmaniac putting the preceding military dictators  in the shade".</p>

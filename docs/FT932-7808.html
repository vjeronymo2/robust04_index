			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Dialling for dollars, yen, pounds . . .: The government's sale of shares in BT When Lord Cairns, chief executive of SG Warburg, launches the marketing campaign for the sale of the government's remaining shares in BT on Monday, he will be looking forward to a relatively trouble-free few months. There is a marked contrast with the atmosphere surrounding the second sale of BT shares in 1991, in which Warburg also played the leading role. That sale was dogged by political uncertainty in the run-up to the general election; by concern over the imminent price review by Oftel, the industry regulator; and by a row with investment institutions over how the float was marketed. This time, Lord Cairns will have fewer worries as he announces the timetable for the sale. He is expected to say that, subject to demand, the Treasury plans to sell all of its 21.9 per cent holding valued at more than Pounds 5bn in mid-July. Still, though the current sale is progressing smoothly, a number of concerns remain. The first of these is the emergence of wider competition to BT's basic business. Mr Tim Hirst, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, one of the stockbrokers which declined to take part in the sale when it was not asked to be a global manager, says the potential impact has been underestimated. He expects that cable operators will be providing telephony to more than 2m residential and 550,000 business customers by 1997, compared with a total of 150,000 today. Mr Hirst estimates that this could cost BT Pounds 550m a year in lost line rental and call volumes. That is only 4 per cent of BT's current revenues, but since much of BT's network costs are fixed, there may be a painful impact on profits. In any event, the entry of the cable operators indicates the extent to which BT core business, UK telephony, is at last becoming a competitive market. The second area of potential concern is, as always, the attitude of the regulator. Uncertainties currently hang over how much BT should charge its competitors for the use of its lines; and how it should separate out its accounts for local and long-distance business. Oftel is expected to report on this shortly. For Warburg, global co-ordinator to the offer, the third issue is closer to home. The structure of the sale is proving controversial. For the first time in any privatisation 11 global managers will compete among each other to sell the new shares to the top 500 institutions throughout the world. The government decided against the usual practice of giving brokers exclusive rights in different parts of the globe. Instead, it decided that competition among selected managers would drum up demand and increase the price at which it can sell its BT shares. But the idea that there is going to be vigorous competition is not as simple as it seems. During the pre-marketing phase, which lasts for around two weeks, all the brokers - apart from Warburg - may only approach institutions in an region allocated to them as their home base. Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, for example, may only market the offer to US institutions, while Daiwa will be restricted to Japan. Warburg, however, will be able to market shares anywhere in the world. Only at the end of the pre-marketing phase can all the managers compete for big investors in any country. The delay in competition is meant to prevent institutions from being pestered by over-zealous government advisers. Warburg is so keen to avoid such an annoyance that it has introduced rules to control the competition throughout the sale: Every week each global manager has to report on how it sees the market in BT shares developing, with a copy for Warburg. All contacts with institutions, even within an allocated region, must be reported to Warburg. During the roadshows in which BT will actively market the government's shares around the world, Warburg will be the only adviser in the one-to-one meetings between the company and potential investors. Mr James Sassoon, a director of SG Warburg, said: 'In any competition one needs a set of rules to make sure competition is fair and to make it fair there has to be some control. We have to make sure the control is not excessive.' What has emerged is a hybrid structure combining both competition and control. But some of the global managers are not convinced that Warburg has got the balance right. Some have described the global co-ordinator as 'erring in favour of excessive control', introducing 'heavy policing' and keeping a 'tight rein' on the sale. One global manager advised Warburg 'to play it very carefully and to play it straight because the potential for conflict is so great'. The particular concern of some global managers is that Warburg will use the information passed to it by other brokers to win a greater share of business, particularly in overseas markets. However, Warburg says this will not happen because it has established a 'Chinese wall' between the directors co-ordinating the sale and the team competing for business with the global managers. Mr Sassoon says that the UK Treasury has made sure that Warburg is not in a position to 'steal the deal'. The bank is also making it clear to investors that their bids will be treated on an equal basis regardless of which manager puts in the bid. Though relations between the issues' managers may prove delicate, they are likely to meet considerable appetite for the shares. A number of big UK institutions, for example, said they were underweighted in BT shares and welcomed the opportunity to buy more. Since around two-thirds of the new shares are expected to go to private investors, as in the previous BT share sale, some institutions may be left bidding for the stock in the after-market, which should help the shares to go to a premium after the sale. There is one other comforting factor. In the last sale, some institutions felt Warburg was being heavy-handed in threatening to penalise investors who tried to go short of the stock ahead of the sale. In practice, however, they had no complaints about the relatively relaxed way the policy was implemented. Though it will also apply this time, fund managers do not expect the row to recur.</p>

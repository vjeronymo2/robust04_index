			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE INDUSTRY;  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD'S BRAVE NEW WORLD;  </P> <P> A REVOLUTION IN ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY IS COMING, AND THE JAPANESE  ELECTRONICS GIANTS BUYING UP HOLLYWOOD ARE LEADING IT  </P> <P> In a scene from the Oscar-winning "Cinema Paradiso," a young boy is frantically  pedaling his bicycle between two small towns in pre-World War II Sicily  carrying reels of film back and forth so audiences in the two villages can  watch the same movie at about the same time.  </P> <P> The scene is one among many that writer-director Giuseppe Tornatore uses to  create a nostalgia for old-time moviegoing, and while the era he re-creates is  as musty as your grandfather's stamp collection, the scene serves just as well  to illustrate how little film exhibition has really changed.  </P> <P> Despite the historical milestones of "talkies," color, wide-screen processes  and stereo, surround and digital sound, films are essentially shown the same  way as they were 70 years ago. Motion picture images are still imprinted on  sprocket-holed celluloid strips, delivered to theaters in bulky canisters and  run through projectors at 24 frames per second.  </P> <P> But, according to most experts, all that is about to change -- dramatically.  </P> <P> By the year 2005, maybe sooner, movies will almost certainly be delivered to  screens -- in both theaters and at home -- electronically. Engineers' eyes  light up and spit sparks when they discuss the possibilities ahead:  high-definition television, satellite transmissions, fiber optics and digital  reproduction, and they swear on a stack of megabytes that the video revolution  of the '80s is a molehill compared to the technological mountain to be scaled  in the '90s.  </P> <P> Nobody knows exactly what the changes will be -- or which will become the  industry standards -- but this much is clear: As Hollywood continues to make  the kinds of movies the world loves, the companies in the best position to  exploit the new technology will lead the global entertainment industry into the  21st Century.  </P> <P> Who best understands the coming revolution and what it means to the movie  business? Well, the Japanese seem to understand it very, very well. They  should, because they are the world leaders in coming up with the technology  that's going to change everything. That's one reason Sony plopped down $3.4  billion to buy Columbia Pictures last year, and why Matsushita Electric  Industrial Co. is now buying MCA, owner of Universal Studios, for a whopping  $6.1 billion.  </P> <P> And there's at least one company in Korea that seems to have an inkling about  it: Samsung, one of the world's largest corporations, apparently sized up Orion  Pictures recently before deciding not to buy it.  </P> <P> Hollywood, whose dream merchants sleep through most revolutions, is beginning  to recognize it, too. Technology committees have sprung up at several studios,  and just last year, the industry at large agreed to fund and participate in an  international group called the Technology Foundation of the Motion  Picture/Television Industry.  </P> <P> But the studios lag woefully behind in both research and visionary leadership.  The film business here has traditionally been run on short-term objectives, and  though its dominance as the world's supplier of filmed entertainment is  unquestioned, its failure to seize the day when television and then video came  along assured it a subsidiary role in the current high-stakes media shakeout.  </P> <P> "The Japanese, culturally, take a longer view of things, while America is  young, rambunctious, short-sighted," says special-effects wizard Richard  Edlund, who is president of Marina del Rey-based Boss Film Studios. "Their  arrival in Hollywood will force us to think."  </P> <P> "Hardware," "software" and "synergy" are the buzzwords of the  Japanese-Hollywood story. The Japanese dominate the hardware market (TV sets,  VCRs, stereo and other home-entertainment equipment) while Hollywood has the  software (movies, TV programs, musical recordings). Owning both gives them the  synergy -- the corporate version of hybrid vigor -- to add up to more than the  sum of their parts.  </P> <P> Is that why the Japanese paid what looked like Neiman-Marcus prices for  Columbia and MCA? In part, yes. By controlling movies and TV programming,  experts say, the Japanese can better influence the direction of entertainment  technology. (Matsushita, for example, could give laser-disc players a big boost  by releasing Universal movies in that format.)  </P> <P> But that's not the only reason behind the Japanese interest in Hollywood:  Experts say that, with the coming entertainment revolution, the values of  studio libraries will skyrocket, making the MCA and Columbia deals look like  bargains in retrospect.  </P> <P> The technology driving that revolution won't be cheap. To persuade consumers to  buy the hardware, they have to make sure there are plenty of good things to put  in them.  </P> <P> "The Japanese know that you can't sell a $3,000 high-definition TV set unless  there's a sufficient number of movies, cassettes or laser discs available for  the damn thing," says Douglas Trumbull, president of Berkshire Motion Picture  and the creator of visual effects for "2001: A Space Odyssey." "The acquisition  of Columbia and MCA creates a critical mass for them."  </P> <P> The reactions to the Japanese landing in Hollywood has been either serious  hand-wringing -- over the export of profits and the fear of censorship -- or a  sanguine acceptance of economic one-upmanship in a free-enterprise system  without boundaries. Yet few people have raised the questions of the long-term  objectives of the Japanese and the potential impact of their control on  consumers. Since the Hollywood Establishment is unskilled at looking ahead,  this article examines those issues from the standpoint of the technology  looming just ahead.  </P> <P> Technological sluggishness wasn't always the American way in entertainment. It  was the Americans, primarily through RCA, who introduced color TV to the world.  The Japanese -- specialists at refinement -- took it and ran with it, becoming  the acknowledged masters of the medium. Hollywood movie studios, too, were once  in the forefront, with their own projection and camera departments in  competition to introduce such improvements as Stereosound and Vistavision.  </P> <P> "Technology was once an integral part of studio competition," says Trumbull,  "but since the 1948 consent decree that forbade studios to own theaters, the  focus has been on product, creating vehicles for talent. The question of what  medium to put them in is of absolutely no consequence. The movie business has  shot itself in the foot."  </P> <P> The disbanding in the mid-'50s of the Motion Picture Research Council, a  studio-funded committee that coordinated technological development, may have  been the final cut that left Hollywood, in Richard Edlund's words, "a  technological headless horseman."  </P> <P> Part of the problem, Edlund adds, is the lack of continuity here. "Running a  studio has become a game of musical chairs. The Japanese companies are very  conservative, they move very deliberately. But once they make up their minds,  they really get on it."  </P> <P> The sale of MCA-Universal, leaving four of the town's seven major movie studios  in foreign hands, has raised some non-technological issues as well. Reflecting  a widespread wariness about having an occupying army in our cultural front  yard, Variety blared a Japanese headline, translated "Buyer Beware." Around  town, filmmakers nervously assessed Matsushita president Akio Tanii's  reluctance to assure them he wouldn't meddle in creative matters.  </P> <P> Those concerns are not unfounded. Two years ago, Bernardo Bertolucci's "The  Last Emperor" opened in Japanese theaters only after the portrayal of Japan's  bloody 1937 raid on Nanjing was excised. Other films critical of Japanese  culture have never been seen there. As Patrick O'Heffernan, director of Georgia  Institute for Technology's Center for International Strategy, put it: "We revel  in skewering our sacred cows. The Japanese honor their sacred cows. Will that  lead to censorship? I don't think so. But it will be one more step in the  process where some movies don't get made."  </P> <P> O'Heffernan and others also express concern that the Japanese owners will be  even more big-hit and bottom-line oriented than the Americans. But the larger  issue, argues O'Heffernan, is that the U.S. is losing control of the exports --  our media and culture -- that have made the American way of life so influential  overseas.  </P> <P> Some Hollywood insiders, however, don't expect those exports to look any  different under Japanese ownership. "The Japanese aren't going to try to decide  for people what pictures they should see," says David Geffen, who became a  leading stockholder in MCA when he sold Geffen Records to the studio last  March, and who stands to make an additional $180 million when the Matsushita  deal is completed. "David Puttnam was disastrously unsuccessful when he tried  to do that at Columbia. If the Japanese try to affect things, they will have  lost their investment because the talent will pick up its bags and go  elsewhere. Hollywood is one of the few places (where) the assets go home at  night."  </P> <P> But the focus on what movies two Japanese-owned studios might or might not make  obscures an even bigger story: Whatever shape the coming film technology  revolution takes, it will be the people who build those black boxes in your  home -- as much as the people who produce TV shows and movies -- who determine  the range of options available to audiences.  </P> <P> For the vast majority of movie fans, the important question in all this is,  what's in it for us? When the new technologies are out of the lab, will there  be more and better movies to choose from and more convenient ways to view them,  or will Hollywood merely recycle the formula-blockbuster mentality of the '80s?  </P> <P> You can start a fight taking either position, but certainly, technology has the  potential to increase choice by revolutionizing both the production and  distribution of movies. On the production side, new technologies could give  filmmakers outside the mainstream low-cost ways to make movies of sufficient  technical quality to attract large audiences.  </P> <P> "Technology in most other areas has lowered the barriers to producing product,"  says Jonathan Seybold, a pioneer in desktop publishing whose Malibu company  publishes high-tech newsletters and sponsors seminars. "It happened in  printing, and now it's happening in music very clearly. My neighbor is an  Oscar-winning composer who can put together digitally (on his home computer) a  whole film score. He has more artistic control at a fraction of the cost.  </P> <P> "Those tendencies are the best counterbalance I can think of to the increasing  concentration of media companies. I would hope the same thing would happen in  movies, too. I would love to have more Wayne Wangs and Spike Lees doing  interesting, low-budget films."  </P> <P> But the real revolution, many say, will come not in the production of films but  in their distribution. Movie theaters will be swept along on the tide of  change, but by all accounts, the focus of the new technological race will be  the home -- transformed into a multimedia, interactive entertainment center  through the marriage of computers and film. People will be able to pick up the  fiber-optic phone line, access any listing, say, in the Paramount or ABC  libraries, punch in a code and, within minutes, have "Singin' in the Rain" or a  documentary on civil-rights violations flash across a wall-sized,  high-definition screen.  </P> <P> The multimedia possibilities are unlimited. "Your 10-year-old son is doing a  paper on Martin Luther King," says Scott Ross, general manager of LucasArts'  Industrial Light &amp; Magic. "(With this technology) he dials the NBC library  to pull film of King's 'I Have a Dream' speech. Once you can complete the  relationship of the computer and the TV set, it will blow apart the  (conventional) concept of entertainment and media."  </P> <P> All for a fee, of course. Billing will also be streamlined, with the charges  reflected on your telephone statements. The phone companies stand to make a  mint carrying all this new information over their wires. (Some experts believe  that is one motive behind AT&amp;T's recent bid for NCR Corp., the nation's  fifth-largest computer maker.)  </P> <P> "The video, feature film, and computer industries have traditionally been very  separate," says Robert Greenberg, president of R/Greenberg Associates, which  specializes in special effects and computer-generated imagery, "but now they're  talking the same language as it relates to images and sound. The common  denominator is digital control."  </P> <P> "Digital" -- the conversion of sounds and images to electronic bits -- will  open the door to interactive TV, to mass data storage, to the duplication of  sound and images without loss of quality from one generation to the next. One  expert foresees a vending machine that would stamp out films on videodiscs  while you wait.  </P> <P> Digital processing is also the key to compressing information into fiber optic  phone lines, which will bring the movie into the home. The American  fiber-optics system, though nowhere near as far along as the Japanese  equivalent, is under way. Though the main branches are in place, home hookups  -- slowed down by the breakup of AT&amp;T -- are 15 or 20 years down the road.  "Laying the lines to deal with this volume of information," says Greenberg, "is  like trying to build a mass transit system in L.A. -- a pretty difficult feat."  </P> <P> Still, the incentive is there, for creators as well as consumers. "Independent  film producers could buy space on the fiber-optic cable," says Trumbull, "and  get their film to millions in one night. That provides them with an instant  return on their investment."  </P> <P> Andrew Lippman, associate director of MIT's Media Laboratory, notes that the  use of computers will enable studios to tailor their movies to different  audiences. "You can individualize things: changing content, transferring it to  different languages, even changing gestures to suit individual countries," he  says. "You could produce 10 versions of a movie with options built in to  broaden interest."  </P> <P> More and more, the studios will also be using computers to generate special  effects, landscapes, even people and animals such as the digitally created  water snake that appeared in last year's underwater adventure movie "The  Abyss." And the days of cut-and-paste editing of 35mm film are almost surely  coming to an end.  </P> <P> "We'll be able to capture information in front of the lens and put it on a  digital record," says Marty Katz, Disney's executive vice president of motion  picture and television production and founder of its two-year-old Technology  Committee. "The camera will electronically indicate which takes are good and  transmit them to the lab. Film can then be edited electronically and the  finished picture beamed via satellite into the home. It will revolutionize the  way film is processed, edited and distributed."  </P> <P> These changes in both production and viewing are bringing the computer and  consumer electronics industries closer together, raising this question: Does  your TV become your computer, or does your computer become your TV? The answer  has huge implications for global competition, because the Americans dominate  the computer arena while the Japanese drive the consumer electronics industry,  particularly in the area of HDTV. By multiplying the number of lines of  resolution on your TV picture, HDTV boasts a theater-quality image and couples  it with CD-quality stereo sound.  </P> <P> But getting HDTV into American homes will require massive investment in  equipment by broadcasters and a consumer changeover at home. Though Sony has  already sold the first HDTV sets in Japan, for about $18,000 each, the U.S. is  faced with a Catch-22: Broadcasters don't want to convert to HDTV until  consumers have the sets, and consumers won't want to buy sets until there is  plenty of HDTV programming to receive.  </P> <P> There are other problems. For one, many U.S. companies and lawmakers see the  potential HDTV market as the linchpin of American competitiveness and are loath  to hand it over to Japan. Several legislators have called for federal funding  of research efforts. Others believe that the U.S. should sit out HDTV -- where  the Japanese have the clear advantage -- and await the development of fully  digital television, which many experts believe is the next technology of  choice.  </P> <P> While the HDTV debate continues in Congress, the Federal Communications  Commission is going forward with a testing program and says it will adopt an  American HDTV standard in 1993, creating, in all probability, three different  standards worldwide -- ours, Japan's and Europe's.  </P> <P> "Fortunately for us, HDTV is blessed with a few major problems," says Jeorg  Agin, general manager of Kodak's motion picture and television markets  division, which is developing its own high-resolution system with nearly twice  the lines offered by HDTV. "The world has yet to settle on a standard. There's  little library of software available. CBS isn't about to put out material in  that format if there's no one out there to receive it. And who's going to  advertise in such a limited system or invest in a technology that may soon be  obsolete?"  </P> <P> Sony, meanwhile, is quietly pushing HDTV through its Hollywood toehold. At  Sony's Columbia Pictures headquarters in Culver City, John Galt, a director at  Sony High Definition Facilities, is researching ways to use "high-definition  processes" (he cringes at the word video) in film production, often combining  the technology with computers and animation techniques. On a screen in a  chilly, computer-laden room, a camera pans across a room full of toys, past a  long-haired cat who looks like he could fall off the screen and into your lap,  landing on . . . John Galt. Zip! Galt shrinks. Zap! He's in a Lego helicopter  and flying across the room, a miniature pilot in a room full of life-size Teddy  bears. This technology, Galt says, would have made Disney's "Honey, I Shrunk  the Kids" almost a snap to produce. (Disney has expressed keen interest in the  technology.)  </P> <P> No one expects filmmakers in the near term to shoot feature films in  high-definition video; it still lacks the rich texture and clarity of 35mm  film. A couple of feature films have been made in high-definition video,  including one ("Julia and Julia") that starred Kathleen Turner. But watching  them, even after they've been transferred to film and projected on a normal  screen, is more like watching a daytime TV drama than a movie. Few people  believe that "look" is the future of motion pictures.  </P> <P> Sony has stopped talking about the advantages of shooting movies on  high-definition video and instead is peddling the technology for use in  post-production, insisting it will save time and money and actually aid in  optical and special-effects work. Observers say Sony is betting that if it can  get filmmakers to accept HDTV at any level, it will have a leg up on its  hardware competitors.  </P> <P> Sony and Matsushita can push their own HDTV technologies another way, some  analysts say. By converting the films in their libraries to high-definition  video, they can sell HDTV sets on which to play those films, thus providing  competition to broadcasters reluctant to adopt HDTV programming.  </P> <P> In addition, says MIT's Lippman, the value of the movies themselves will  skyrocket given the privatization of European broadcast stations, greater  at-home access and the possibility of packing more and more programming on  satellites through digital compression. "The studio library is of tremendous  value in itself," he says. "It ain't an HDTV issue."  </P> <P> Despite the advantages of all these new technologies, most experts say it's  unlikely that they will reduce budgets on major studio movies (the average now  costs about $25 million) or call the dominance of the studios into question. It  takes lots of capital to pay superstar salaries and to fund the large-scale  marketing essential to a hit. Decentralization or not, insiders insist,  Hollywood is unlikely to change its ways.  </P> <P> "In the end, technology doesn't matter," says Tom Pollock, chairman of  MCA-Universal's motion picture group. "You have to make films people want to  see. The business will always be hit-driven. It won't change -- ever, ever,  ever."  </P> <P> Will people stop going to movie theaters when all these electronic marvels are  in their homes? No one can say for sure -- in 10 years, you might be able to  punch a button on your remote control and fill your TV room with holographic  buddies -- but the urge to get out and see a movie with strangers has survived  every other technological convenience.  </P> <P> But to withstand the next wave, theaters will undergo their own revolution.  Last week, Jameson Entertainment Group and Ikegami Electronics unveiled plans  to build theater multiplexes that will project movies from high-definition  laser discs. The multiplexes also will be equipped to screen television  programming, sporting events, business conferences and educational seminars via  satellite -- moving Hollywood one step closer to the day when feature films,  too, can be bounced off satellites and into theaters.  </P> <P> "What I foresee is a differentiation emerging between what you see at home and  what you see in the theaters," predicts Trumbull, "a line drawn between  special-effects spectacles that use wide screens and stereo sound, and the more  intimate films such as 'sex, lies and videotape' (which people will watch at  home). The market will dwindle to fewer but larger screens showing spectacular  epics to justify the $8, $10, $12 ticket prices."  </P> <P> Whatever improvements are made, they will most likely come at the nudging of  the studios rather than on the initiative of the notoriously cost-conscious  theater owners. Trumbull, whose 65mm Showscan high-speed photographic and  projection system met with opposition from those unwilling to foot the cost of  new equipment, says he's not holding his breath.  </P> <P> "I poured $35 million into Showscan and showed it to every theater chain, every  studio head, all the unions," he says. "The response was uniformly positive. I  had hoped it would restore some of the grandeur to a movie business that had  been multiplexed to death. The rub was that no one was willing to use it. I  left the industry four years ago in abject disappointment . . . This business  doesn't take technology seriously."  </P> <P> "The problem is that filmmaking is a collaborative art form," says Greenberg.  "You can't throw in a new technology and expect it to be immediately embraced."  </P> <P> Still, strides are being made. Disney recently introduced digital, CD-quality  sound on 15 of its "Dick Tracy" prints, and would have done more if more  theaters were equipped to use it. And the studio is experimenting with a "3-D"  sound system, which could provide the chug of a train, for instance, passing  behind the viewer and out the theater doors. Also in development are motion  simulators like those used in Disneyland's Star Tours attraction, which would  make it possible for viewers to sit in a theater seat and feel as if they're on  the speed bike with Luke and Leia during the forest scene in "Return of the  Jedi."  </P> <P> The potential technology out there is raising a variety of questions at home.  Will industry players move in concert with the best systems, or will they get  into a winner-take-all battle, like the one Sony and Matsushita had over  videocassette standards? With interactive TV, will the industry push even  harder on market research? "Studios will know not just who's watching a movie,  but how old they are and where they live," says ILM's Ross. "The business will  undoubtedly become even more demographically oriented."  </P> <P> Analysts worry that the cost of starting up the new technology and converting  libraries may exceed potential revenues, and that the public will tune out on  hype that may sound like a technological Tower of Babel. Still, the revolution  will come, and people with the vision to look ahead are seeing green.  </P> <P> "The ultimate dream machine for all studios is the same: A mechanism by which  any individual, at the time of his choosing, can order a film without leaving  home," says one high-powered studio executive. "That's the ultimate dream for  the film owner -- to market material to the consumer without a middleman."  </P> <P> For all the talk of East-West rivalry, there's general agreement that  cooperation is the only practical road, long-term. The Japanese are financing  Edlund's upcoming feature "Solar Crisis," for which he is developing new  digital techniques; Disney has a $600-million line of credit with the Japanese;  and JVC has invested $100 million in equity and credit advances in producer  Lawrence Gordon's Largo Entertainment.  </P> <P> "It's 'old-think' to have a U.S. vs. Japan attitude," says MIT's Lippman.  "Without international cooperation, it will be impossible to distribute a  program worldwide."  </P> <P> Still, some analysts continue to worry that the U.S. is ceding Japan power not  only over ephemeral cultural resources but over concrete decisions on which  technologies will dominate the lucrative entertainment industry over the next  decades, and the pace at which they will be introduced.  </P> <P> "Until now the global media revolution has been a U.S. revolution," says  Georgia Tech's O'Heffernan. "Global media is U.S.-based. We had the opportunity  to set the course. Instead, we're selling it."  </P></p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Wolstenholme Rink hit by bad debts Bad debts in its printing industry supply side left pre-tax profits at Wolstenholme Rink 17 per cent lower at Pounds 2.32m, against Pounds 2.81m. The bad debt charge increased from Pounds 256,000 to Pounds 847,000. Turnover for 1991 increased to Pounds 53.4m (Pounds 42.5m) mainly resulting from the acquisition of PS&amp;E in November 1990. The Lancashire-based company, which also makes metal powders, said that the economic climate was making business difficult but it expected to make progress this year. Earnings per share were 20.5p (30.4p) but a maintained final dividend of 10p is proposed for an unchanged total of 16.3p. Gearing increased from 43 per cent to 50 per cent at the year end resulting from the purchase of PCO towards the end of the year.</p>

The MKDH and Egyutteles are Slovak parliamentary opposition  parties representing the country's Hungarian minority (14 seats  in the 150-seat Slovak parliament), the SDL is the strongest  opposition party (28 seats).    Weiss was reacting to the statements made recently by MKDH  Chairman Bela Bugar, who had accused the SDL of being insincere.  SDL representatives allegedly present accommodation stands on  the ethnic minority problem, but on the other hand, "even after  one year and one month, they were not able to take as stance  towards the draft constitutional law on ethnic minorities  presented to them by its creators from the MKDH and the  Egyutteles" Bugar said at an MKDH press conference.    "We have declared publicly that we could not accept the  draft  law due to its legal shortcomings. We agreed on bilateral talks  with Hungarian representatives in order to consult our  reservations at the level of experts. However, they submitted a  bill to the parliament last June without consulting with us,"  Weiss said.    He stressed that the ethnic minority problem could be solved  neither if the parliamentary majority outvoted the minority, nor  if the Hungarian minority tried to "make the remaining part of  the parliament accept its views as the only correct and  possible, and complained with the Council of Europe in case of  their rejection."    Weiss said he was surprised by the statement of Erno Rozsa,  a  deputy from the MKDH-Egyutteles coalition, that "all demands of  the Hungarian minority will be met." Weiss asked whom the MKDH  and the Egyutteles wanted to cooperate with, when they do not  create conditions for cooperation with the SDL, the parliament's  second strongest party, or with some other party.    Slovakia would not be in the limelight abroad if the ethnic  minority claims had been solved in a comprehensive way, on the  basis of a certain state concept, which would have resulted in  passing the mentioned constitutional law, Weiss said.    "Representatives of the MKDH and Egyutteles made use of the  Slovak Government's incoherent position to push through demands  which will meet with political support in the Slovak parliament  only with great difficulties," Weiss said, referring to the  results of the meeting of Slovakia's ethnic Hungarian  representatives in Komarno, south Slovakia, earlier this month.    About 560,000 ethnic Hungarians (11 percent of the country's  total population) live in southern Slovakia.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> APPEALS COURT IN ITALY OVERTURNS GUCCI CONVICTION  </P> <P> An appeals court has cleared Maurizio Gucci, former chairman of the Italian  fashion firm Guccio Gucci SpA, of attempted fraud in the inheritance of company  shares, a Gucci spokesman said today.  </P> <P> The decision overturned a judgment last month under which Gucci was given a  one-year suspended jail sentence after being charged with forging his dead  father's signature on documents transferring 50% of shares in the leather goods  and fashion firm to him.  </P> <P> The prosecution said Gucci had sought to avoid paying inheritance taxes.  </P> <P> "The ruling can only fill me with satisfaction. . . . After five difficult  years, justice has finally been done in respect of my father's wishes," the  spokesman quoted Gucci as saying.  </P> <P> Gucci was ousted as company chairman in July, 1987, and replaced by his cousin  Giorgio.  </P></p>

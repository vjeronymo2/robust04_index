			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Morgan Crucible profits rise 3% on acquisitions MORGAN CRUCIBLE, the specialised industrial materials manufacturer, yesterday reported a 3 per cent rise in profits, helped by acquisitions and a lower interest charge, Mr Bruce Farmer, chief executive, said the group's decision to diversify out of the UK in the early 1980s was bearing fruit. Pre-tax profits in the 53 weeks to January 1992, rose from Pounds 59.5m to Pounds 61m on sales up 8 per cent at Pounds 627.8m in spite of recession in a number of its markets. Earnings per share fell 16 per cent, from 23.8p to 19.9p, after adjusting for last April's Pounds 96m rights issue. The company is to pay a 6.85p final dividend, giving a total of 12.6p, up 5 per cent on the year. Mr Farmer said Morgan would not tap shareholders for more funds before 1994 unless something extraordinary happened. While Morgan is increasingly seen as a company well positioned to take advantage of the emerging economic recovery in its biggest market, the US, the market has not forgotten the Pounds 175m the company raised from two rights issues in quick succession. One benefit of the rights issue last year was that the interest charge fell Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 10.5m, helping to turn a fall in operating profit into an increase at the pre-tax level. Following the rights issue, gearing fell at the year end to 28 per cent, down from 65 per cent. Morgan says it is no hurry to spend the rest of the rights proceeds although it is currently looking at potential acquisitions in the UK, the US and Continental Europe. While recession in the UK showed no sign of lifting, Mr Farmer said Morgan's US, Australasian and Far Eastern markets, which account for 69 per cent of sales, were growing. Operating profits fell in the carbon, technical ceramics and thermal ceramics divisions but rose in speciality materials. Mr Farmer said the group had increased gross margins at some cost to volume, demonstrating the strong positions it commands in its markets. 'We have not been selling goods cheap or buying volume,' he said. Morgan expects to pay a marginally higher tax rate of 31 per cent this year, having enjoyed the benefits of an ACT write-back in 1991. Comment, Page 22</p>

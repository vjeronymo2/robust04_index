			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] China is to significantly boost the staff of its key  policy branch on Hong Kong affairs in the next two months to  help speed up preparations for the 1997 handover.    About 16 newly-recruited staff will join the Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office in the face of the increasing workload on  transitional matters.    The extra staff will mainly work under the two major  departments on political and economic affairs, headed by Xu Ze  and Zhang Liangdong. At present, each department has about 20  staff who help formulate China's strategy on matters ranging  from the airport plan, localisation of civil service and Joint  Liaison Group issues.    The extra staff have been recruited in the past few months  following a decision by the Chinese Government to increase  staffing of the office in view of the growing workload. Sources  said the new recruits were all fresh graduates from major  universities in Beijing.    "Of course, it's most ideal to have people who have already  had some experience on Hong Kong affairs transferred from other  departments. But the pool of experienced staff is really too  small. We can only look for fresh university graduates," an  official said.    The official said the extra staff would have to be given  training on the background to the Hong Kong issues.    He said the additional staff would help strengthen the  research team of the two departments and the sup porting team  for the Preliminary Working Committee.    Officials said the staff in crease was imperative because  workloads had risen in the lead-up to 1997.</p>

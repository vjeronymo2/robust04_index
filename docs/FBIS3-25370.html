			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Gabonese Trade Union Confederation [COSYGA]  has expressed its determination to go ahead with its planned  three-day general strike starting today to press for concrete  measures to cope with the soaring prices caused by the  devaluation of the CFA franc. The workers are also pressing for  an 80-percent wage increase. Prime Minister Oye-Mba held talks  with union leaders on 14 January and told them that his  government was examining further measures designed to alleviate  the adverse effects of the devaluation through the subsidization  of certain basic commodities. [passage omitted]    [In a related report at 1215 GMT on 16 February 1994,  Libreville Radio adds: "The 72-hour strike called by COSYGA  seems to have received little support. The movement was not  very much observed and Libreville residents in particular are  quietly going about their normal business, both in the public  and private sectors."    [Libreville Radio says that the personnel officer for the  Libreville municipal council said the following: "Reports  reaching me from the region say that the strike has only been  partially observed. I am happy to report that a large number of  our employees have come to work."]</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Chance to put a name in lights AN OPPORTUNITY to advertise in lights at London's landmark Piccadilly Circus will arise next year. The Pounds 1m-a-year neon slot will be vacant as a result of a decision by Panasonic, the Japanese consumer electronic company, not to renew its lease on the site. Land Securities, the property company, is offering the slot on a five-year lease from next June. The new sign will 'have to be compatible' with other advertisers, which include Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Foster's and Sanyo, said the company. 'For example, Pepsi would probably not be on,' it explained. In the course of a year about 24m vehicles, 100m bus passengers and 32m underground passengers use Piccadilly Circus, said Land Securities. The 1,600 sq ft site currently takes 7,620 ft of neon tubes, 29,000 ft of cables and has 25 computers controlling 15,000 electrical switches. Panasonic said yesterday that after 10 years of having its name in lights at Piccadilly Circus 'other opportunities had become available'. It is 20 years since a British-owned company advertised at the famous site, although past names have included BP, British Airways, Schweppes and Players Cigarettes. Coca-Cola has displayed its illuminated sign since 1968.</p>

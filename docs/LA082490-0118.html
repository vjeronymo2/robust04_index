			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Eric Dickerson was a no-show at the Indianapolis Colts' training camp in  Anderson, Ind., once again refusing to report for a scheduled re-examination of  his injured hamstring.  </P> <P> Dickerson has spent the last two weeks at a Houston clinic where he has been  undergoing rehabilitation for the non-football injury after failing a team  physical Aug. 6.  </P> <P> He was asked to return to Indianapolis so that team physicians could evaluate  his progress.  </P> <P> Dickerson, who was bothered by a hamstring injury in his right leg last season,  suffered the injury to his left leg while working on his own during the  off-season. The team therefore considers the injury unrelated to football and  cannot order Dickerson to report for the physical since he is not being paid by  the club.  </P></p>

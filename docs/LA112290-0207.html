			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> ANTI-DRUNK-DRIVING SIGNS RECOMMENDED  </P> <P> The city's Public Safety Commission voted unanimously this week to recommend  installing 10 street signs near bars and restaurants reminding motorists not to  drive after drinking.  </P> <P> The commission made the same recommendation to the City Council in June, but  the council delayed action because it didn't like the design of the proposed  signs.  </P> <P> The original sign would have featured a large martini glass with a car behind  it, all enclosed inside a circle with a slash through it.  </P> <P> Then-Mayor Larry Agran said in June that he thought the signs would be "quickly  disregarded" by motorists. Council members agreed and said in June that the  signs should include an anti-drunk-driving message.  </P> <P> The proposed sign design approved by the commission Tuesday night uses the same  circle-slash picture from before, but adds the words "Don't Drink and Drive"  along the bottom and "DUI Laws Strictly Enforced" along the top.  </P> <P> The commission's recommendation to add the permanent signs, at a cost of  $1,200, will be forwarded to the City Council. If approved, the signs probably  will not be installed until after this holiday season.  </P> <P> Public Safety Commissioner Dave Christensen voted to approve the signs, but  expressed doubts about their effectiveness.  </P> <P> "Are people really going to look at these signs and say, 'Gee whiz, I better  not drink and drive tonight?' " Christensen said.  </P> <P> But Commissioner Leslie Pyle said the signs will serve as constant reminders to  the public of the risk of being caught if they drive after drinking.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Reinaldo Antonio Tefel] </F>   [Text] It is encouraging that a group of Sandinists who  seemed to be locked into traditional positions have joined in  the great Latin American current of the new democratic left and  humanistic socialism. The document of the Pekin Guerrero Group,  with that significant shift, opens up room for a Sandinist  consensus on programmatic issues. This is made even more  encouraging by two facts:    1. The fact that some strong intellectuals have made  positive  contributions to this document; and    2. The fact that among the members of that group there are  people who just recently had been attacking, excluding, and  criticizing those of us who, for a long time--and in some cases  like mine, for years--had been calling for a profound democratic  transformation of Sandinism, by updating its historic roots  along the lines of democratic neosocialism. This creates hope  that exclusionary tactics and abusive language may now be buried  forever.    However, the document has some gaps on which we need to  reach  consensus before the Extraordinary Congress. I am only going to  list them in order to promote a Sandinist debate of these issues:    1. We need to design a viable socioeconomic alternative to  offer to oppose neoliberalism and statism, an alternative which  will define the ground rules in our relations with the  government and with other political parties, and will serve as  our standard for the 1996 elections.    2. We need to adopt a self-critical position on the policies  and actions of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], a  self-criticism we owe to all Sandinists and to the Nicaraguan  people.    3. We need to insist that the Extraordinary Congress  establish effective controls for the transparent management of  party assets.    4. Equality among all Sandinists needs to be established  with  complete clarity, rejecting any form of political elitism by  dividing people into first- and second-class members.    5. From general statements on party organization on which we  all agree, we need to move to organize clearly collective  democratic leadership groups that correspond to the initial  Sandinist form of collegial leadership, and do away with  unipersonal authoritarian forms. Only in this way, with a  collective democratic leadership, can we make the approach of  the democratic left and humanistic socialism become a reality,  and only in this way will we be able to bring about a profound  transformation and renewal in unity.</p>

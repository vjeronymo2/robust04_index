			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER'S DEATH BLAMED ON RAIN, BALD TIRES  </P> <P> Rain-slick pavement and bald tires were partly to blame for the death Monday of  a 24-year-old Glendale motorist whose car skidded off the southbound on-ramp to  the Glendale Freeway at Mountain Street and plunged down a 50-foot embankment  onto the freeway.  </P> <P> The motorist was "traveling too fast for the weather conditions" and missed by  inches a guard rail that would have blocked the skidding vehicle, said  California Highway Patrol spokeswoman Tami Low.  </P> <P> "If he had hit the rail, he would have stayed on the ramp and probably been  alive," Low said.  </P> <P> The motorist, who was alone, was traveling east on Mountain when the car  skidded as he turned right onto the ramp. The vehicle overturned twice down the  embankment before landing on its wheels on the freeway. CHP officers said all  four tires on the 1979 Pontiac Grand Prix were bald.  </P> <P> The driver, whose name was being withheld pending notification of relatives,  was pronounced dead at the scene. No other vehicles were involved. Two lanes of  the freeway were closed for two hours after the 11 a.m. accident.  </P></p>

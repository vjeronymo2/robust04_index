			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Alain Lamassoure, French minister [delegate] for  European affairs has ended his visit to Estonia. Erik Samel  will sum up his visit.    [Samel] [passage omitted] According to the French minister,  the main subject in his discussions with Estonian politicians  were issues to do with European security, including the  so-called Balladur plan or the European security pact, whose  opening conference will take place in April, in Paris. The pact  aims to provide an opportunity for all European countries to  have their security ensured. The French minister emphasized  that for France, Estonian security is also French security.    According to [Foreign Minister] Juri Luik, who also attended  the news conference, Lamassoure's visit took place at a very  good time for Estonia since Estonia is now taking great strides  toward Europe.    [Begin Luik recording] We talked about several issues of  mutual interest. First, of course, about security issues. The  Estonian position is that the closer Estonia is to the European  Union, the more Estonian security is safeguarded. Of particular  importance here is Lamassoure's position -- which the Estonian  side also encouraged -- that a free-trade agreement with Europe  is a good thing but it must contain a strong political  dimension. A political dimension, which, in fact, would equate  us with the Visegrad foursome, would equate us with Poland, the  Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia. This is the position  that the French minister emphasized and that is also what we  emphasized.    We also emphasized the need to develop new European security  structures. First and foremost, the West European Union. The  West European Union is a promising organization alongside NATO.  There was also talk about an associated member status, which is  being developed at the West European Union. Given the status of  an associated member Estonia would be willing to take part in  the work of the West European Union.    We discussed the Balladur plan and the French minister  emphasized (?and said that he is in full support of) the  Balladur plan developing into a mechanism for resolving bones of  contention between Estonia and Russia because the strength of  the Balladur mechanism is that the European Union member states  will act as guarantors to agreements reached. They will also  help to broker such agreements. I would not, for example, rule  out the possibility that the Estonian-Russian border issue may  find a solution through precisely this mechanism, in the spirit  of cooperation it provides.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "rk": "National Democratic Party: 30,000 to </F> 40,000 per Coupon Book"]    [Text] Bratislava--The offer of the Christian Democratic  Movement [KDH] to accept other parties' candidates on its slate  of candidates blocks the possibility of forming a coalition,  which creates a new situation for the National Democratic Party  [NDS], Andrej Findo told yesterday's NDS briefing. Anton Hrnko  added that it should be in the political parties' interest to  prevent the fragmentation of political entities so that the  situation of the 1992 elections does not recur when a movement  supported by one-third of voters gained almost one-half of the  seats in the National Council of the Slovak Republic. Hrnko,  who attended the elections in Hungary as an observer, noted that  they took place in a calm and fair atmosphere and were  distinguished by a minimum of advertising. He said that the NDS  proposes that changes to the election law focus on increasing  the number of constituencies from four to seven and on imposing  a strict limit on campaign spending (a sum of about 20 million  Slovak korunas was being considered in the Coalition Council, on  the basis of U.S. and French experiences). At today's meeting  of the Coalition Council, which will discuss the further  orientation of privatization, NDS representatives (Minister  Milan Janicina, Vladimir Miskovsky, and Andrej Findo) will push  for the use of a combination of privatization methods and a  flexible solution to individual specific cases. However, they  will assert that coupon privatization is their own contribution  to this discussion, Findo said, adding that they want to achieve  that citizens receive an average of 30,000-40,000 Slovak korunas  worth of property per coupon book.</p>

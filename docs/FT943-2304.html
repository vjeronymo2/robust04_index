			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Arts: A firm commitment to abstraction - William Packer admires the work of Barbara Hepworth at the Liverpool Tate Gallery There was a time when the names of Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore were run automatically together, as the joint-pioneers and life-long protagonists in the modern phase of British sculpture. The claim was never entirely true, the creature more of the art and critical politics of the 1930s, with Herbert Read and Adrian Stokes the great revisionists, than the more complex realities of the 1920s. But it served well enough in its time, and it especially suited Henry Moore's own driven and temperamental need to be recognised as pre-eminent in the field. I once had the evidence direct from the great man himself, having gone to see him late in 1976 to talk about sculpture in Britain in the 1930s and '40s. The conversation turned inevitably to Barbara Hepworth and the nature of whatever contribution she had made. 'Ah: Barbara', he said. 'You know, I taught her everything she knew.' Whether or not he really did believe so, we can never know. I rather think he did, though as to why we can only speculate. There he was, enjoying in his late 70s the final spectacular confirmation and celebration of his life's achievement: and there was she, dead only the year before, and her reputation qualified by the uncertain work of her last years, when her health was failing and spirits low. And this was the pretty slip of a girl, some five years his junior, whom he found a year ahead of him at Leeds College of Art when he came back from the war, and who went on before him to the Sculpture School of the Royal College and won the travelling scholarship to Italy before he did. But whatever his reasonings or feelings might have been, it most certainly was not true. What is true is that for a few crucial years around 1930, a time critical for each of them as they sought to establish themselves in their careers, the ambiguous and perhaps competitive relationship they had enjoyed as students was transformed into one of close and mutual professional stimulation and support. There they were in neighbouring studios in Belsize Park. The Moores were newly-married, and she then was with John Skeaping, another sculptor whom she had married in Italy; but they separated in 1931, after which her second husband, the painter Ben Nicholson, moved in. And again with Nicholson, the easy assumption is that it was he too, in that creative menage a trois, who led her to her own commitment to abstraction. But Nicholson, some decorative abstract exercises in 1924 apart, would not turn to formal abstraction as such until 1933. As for Moore, he was making some severely abstracted and surreal carvings by 1931, but they retained nevertheless a figurative connotation, and it was not until 1933 and even later that he made any sustained commitment to purely formal abstraction. Even then, as he openly declared, the complete abandonment of an organic or figurative reference was not for him. With Barbara Hepworth, the transition from figuration into abstraction was more or less in step with Moore's, neither leading nor following. Both, in the 1920s, had drawn upon primitive and ancient examples, he from Mexican, she from Egyptian carving especially, and both were now looking closely at contemporary surrealism and constructivism, and of course at each other. But with Barbara the commitment to abstraction, when it came, was characterised by none of the other's equivocation and self-doubt. And though she would return from time to time to a figurative reference, that essential commitment to a pure and formal abstraction would sustain her all her life. Ironically, it was her first husband, Skeaping, who in his own work withdrew from the avant-gardism of the 1920s into a safer academicism, who had had the most direct influence upon her, from their years together at the British School at Rome. That influence was technical, for he was a consummately skilful carver. It is upon her own extraordinary refinement and originality as a carver that her reputation finally rests. This exhibition has been beautifully chosen and installed, rightly laying the emphasis upon her work on that human and domestic scale, at which the artist's hand is most directly engaged with image and material together. She was capable of working successfully at a monumental scale - her 'Family of Man' is currently splendidly set out on the hillside at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park - but in this, in her later years especially, and in her modelling rather than her carving, she often seemed to lose her way. Now the record is put straight and it is as a carver of unique sensibility and true originality, breaking open the form and reaching into the spaces within, that we properly celebrate her. Most of all we celebrate the radical achievement of that first transition to abstraction, that is set out so clearly in the first few rooms of this important exhibition.

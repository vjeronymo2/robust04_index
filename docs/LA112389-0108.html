			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOW TO EMIGRES FROM E. EUROPE  </P> <P> The Bush Administration on Wednesday virtually cut off the prospects for most  Polish and Hungarian refugees in Western Europe to resettle in the United  States any time soon.  </P> <P> Citing "the democratic evolution" in those nations, the State Department said  it will process no new applications by Polish and Hungarian refugees.  </P> <P> Further, officials said, about 19,000 of the 20,000 applications on file likely  will be rejected, because, with a few exceptions, only refugees with strong  family ties in the United States will be admitted.  </P> <P> The 20,000 applicants are but a fraction of the Polish and Hungarian refugee  population in West Europe.  </P></p>

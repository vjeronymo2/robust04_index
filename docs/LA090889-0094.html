			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEAM CUP VOLLEYBALL;  </P> <P> OBRADOVICH LOSES BUT HE'S STILL HAPPY  </P> <P> Depending on how you look at it, Steve Obradovich is either unromantic or a  great planner. What he isn't is boring.  </P> <P> "Never a dull moment," the one they call O.B. said.  </P> <P> There rarely is one with Obradovich, who once helped USC win a Rose Bowl and a  national title in volleyball the same year (1977), and is regarded as one of  the most colorful players in beach volleyball, his full-time sport of choice.  But this week may be a topper.  </P> <P> Wednesday: He was married to his girlfriend of 1 1/2 years in a small,  beachfront ceremony. Anticipating that this time of the year would be busy,  they honeymooned ahead of time last April in Hawaii.  </P> <P> Thursday: He played on the first of six nights of Great Western Team Cup  Volleyball at the Forum. Happy actual honeymoon.  </P> <P> Today: He returns to work as owner of Julie's, the USC hangout/restaurant.  </P> <P> Neither Obradovich nor his wife, Linda, find anything terribly unusual about  forgoing a honeymoon to play in the tournament. It has been their way of life  all along, the changing gears and careers from one day to the next. But beyond  that, Team Cup, the only professional indoor league in the country, holds  special meaning: Winning, all the time.  </P> <P> While his beach career has been filled mainly with injuries and frustration the  last four years, Obradovich, as a member of the championship team in each of  the previous three years of the Forum event, has found unquestionable success.  Only Jeff Stork can make the same claim.  </P> <P> "I've got the best of both worlds," Obradovich said before Team Toyota beat his  Team Reebok, 30-23, 31-29, under the event's unique scoring system. "I'm a  businessman who makes major decisions with the restaurant and then I can go out  on the beach and play volleyball."  </P> <P> But not much longer. Obradovich, who has spent 17 of his 34 years playing  competitive volleyball, plans to retire as a full-time participant after the  Jose Cuervo tournament Sept. 15-16 in San Diego.  </P> <P> Other things are starting to take precedent -- such as the restaurant, almost  constant pain in his left thigh and knee that keeps him awake some nights, and  a baby due in mid-November.  </P> <P> "This is the happiest I've ever been in my life," he said.  </P> <P> In the first match of the doubleheader before 1,589 fans, Mike Blanchard and  Jon Root led Labatt's to a 19-30, 30-24, 11-8 victory over A'ME.  </P></p>

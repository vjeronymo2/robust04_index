While regretting this incident, which was carried out by  vicious hands, the committee hopes that the competent security  circles will quickly take the necessary measures, chase the  culprits, and bring them to justice, so they can receive a just  punishment.    The committee also extends condolences to the martyr's  family  and kinsfolk. Funeral services for martyr al-Jihmi will be held  at the martyrs' cemetery this morning, after prayers at the  al-Shuhada' Mosque.</p>

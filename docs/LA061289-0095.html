			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PIERCE DEBUT HONORS O.C. CENTENNIAL  </P> <P> In a reserved spirit of celebration for the Orange County Centennial, the  Garden Grove Symphony under the baton of Edward Peterson ended its 1988-89  season Saturday night at Wash Auditorium. A program of light music headed by  the works of American composers unfortunately caught more people dozing off  than appreciating the anniversary.  </P> <P> Most anticipated was the premiere of Brent Pierce's "Landscapes, A Symphonic  Tone Poem for Orchestra and Piano in Three Movements." Commissioned by the  orchestra with donations from Times Mirror Co., Subaru and Disneyland, the new  work raised few eyebrows, inspired few imaginations.  </P> <P> Pierce, who directs jazz and choral ensembles at Cal State Fullerton, composes  with a lush tonality that seems to reflect an interest in film music. In  "Landscapes," he uses lots of notes, glissandos and sweeping passages,  producing little variation in texture or dynamics.  </P> <P> Once in a while, more sophisticated harmonies and rhythms occur, sounding much  like Aaron Copland. The third movement, "La Tierra Nueva," created a few  surprises with a saxophone solo and what sounded like a quote from Stravinsky.  </P> <P> Most disappointing, the rudimentary piano part -- more suited as simply another  orchestral part than a solo -- did little to display the talents of local  pianist Pinio Dovalis-Miner.  </P> <P> Dovalis-Miner's work in Falla's "Noches en los Jardines de Espana" proved more  of a challenge. This time dressed in a bright blue dress and crossing herself  before playing, she played with a sincere passion, aptly bringing out the  Spanish idioms. Yet sometimes her high energy level became forced and,  consequently, her playing inaccurate.  </P> <P> Peterson led the ensemble without much flair, locking into tempos that were  consistently on the slow side. Aligning the varying tempos between orchestra  and soloist also gave him some genuine problems.  </P> <P> Closing the program was a routine performance of Copland's "El Salon Mexico."  </P></p>

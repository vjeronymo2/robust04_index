			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION PILL MAY HELP TREAT RARE TUMOR  </P> <P> The controversial abortion pill RU 486, which is sold in France and China but  not the United States, may prove effective in treating a rare tumor of the  brain and spinal cord, according to preliminary findings to be made public  today.  </P> <P> The results, to be presented by USC researchers at a meeting of neurological  surgeons in Tucson, raise the possibility that the drug could eventually be  approved for U.S. use, not to terminate pregnancies but to control tumor  growth.  </P> <P> "Our study has nothing to do with abortion, " said Dr. Steven Grunberg, the USC  oncologist who headed the study. "The drug happens to have the hormonal effect  that we're looking for to try to treat this tumor."  </P> <P> The abortion pill, which can be taken up to five weeks after conception, is  viewed as a revolutionary step in fertility control: It promises a safer,  easier and more private abortion than the traditional surgical approach,  advocates as well as critics acknowledge.  </P> <P> But intense opposition by groups opposed to abortion prompted the drug's  manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, to suspend distribution in France last October  shortly after it was approved for sale. The company resumed distribution later  that month on orders from the French government.  </P> <P> No pharmaceutical company has applied for permission to market RU 486 in the  United States. Opponents of abortion have vowed to organize a consumer boycott  of all the products of any U.S. drug firm that tries to distribute the pill.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the French researcher who developed the pill, Etienne-Emile  Baulieu, was awarded the Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award, one of six  prestigious prizes given annually by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inoperable Tumor  </P> <P> Baulieu predicted that the award would help make the drug more widely  available.  </P> <P> According to Grunberg, his research group gave the pill to 14 men and women  with an inoperable meningioma -- a tumor, usually benign, of the covering of  the brain and spinal cord. The slow-growing tumor causes symptoms ranging from  headaches to impaired mental functioning.  </P> <P> In four patients, the tumor shrank about 10%, Grunberg said. In six, it  remained stable. Two others were referred out of the study for chemotherapy  after their tumor proved malignant. One other patient's tumor grew, and one  dropped out of the study for personal reasons.  </P> <P> "We're very excited and encouraged because we feel that four of the 14 have  shown a response," Grunberg said in an interview. He said the shrinkage was  small but "in the skull, even a few millimeters can make the difference between  a major neurologic problem or not."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rare Disease  </P> <P> Meningiomas are rare: About one new case per every 100,000 population is  diagnosed each year. The tumor expands slowly and the usual treatment is  surgery, but in some cases the tumor is located in a place that makes it  dangerous to operate.  </P> <P> Grunberg stressed that further studies in larger numbers of patients are needed  to confirm his findings. He was scheduled to present his results today at the  annual scientific meeting of the National Academy of Neurological Surgeons.  </P> <P> RU 486, also known as mifepristone, is a synthetic steroid with a chemical  structure resembling that of the hormone progesterone. By attaching itself to  progesterone receptors in the body, it effectively blocks the action of real  progesterone.  </P> <P> The growth of meningiomas appears to be influenced by hormones. The tumors are  three times as common in women as men, and they increase during pregnancy.  Furthermore, scientists have identified progesterone receptors on the surface  of meningioma tumor cells.  </P> <P> As an abortion pill, RU 486 brings on a woman's menstrual period by blocking  the action of progesterone. Progesterone helps thicken the lining of the uterus  so a fertilized egg can become implanted and develop.  </P> <P> RESEARCHER LAUDED -- America's most prestigious medical award has been bestowed  upon the developer of RU 486.

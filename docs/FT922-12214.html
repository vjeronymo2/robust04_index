			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Cowes ferry service is compulsorily wound up COWES EXPRESS, the smallest of four ferry companies operating between Southampton and Cowes on the Isle of Wight, has been compulsorily wound up in the High Court, Richard Tomkins writes. The order was made on the application of creditors owed more than Pounds 230,000. The winding-up of Cowes Express leaves only Red Funnel, a subsidiary of Associated British Ports, operating services on the route. Isle of Wight ferry operations recently came under the scrutiny of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission after complaints that the services were, mile for mile, among the most expensive in the world.</p>

Zhu said in an arrival statement: "We came here to expand  friendly ties with the Korean people as well as the DLP. I  think exchanges and cooperation between the Chinese Communist  Party and the DLP will contribute much to the development of  ties between the two countries.    "President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China slated for March 26  will have important meaning in bilateral relations and will  serve as momentum to lift the ties a step higher. Our party and  people are anticipating President Kim's tour to Beijing  wholeheartedly."    Asked about the date of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's  visit  to Seoul, Zhu said, "I think Jiang will surely visit Seoul  sometime and the issue will be decided through consultations  between Kim and Jiang."</p>

Gerasimenko, identified by  caption; figures in brackets denote broadcast time in GMT in  hours, minutes, and seconds]    [Text] [202502] Echoes of the press scandal and legal  proceedings concerning chemical weapons which have taken place  in the capital can be heard also in our region, especially since  one of this sector's main facilities is located right here. I  am referring to Shikhany. The veil of secrecy shrouding the  local military test range and two institutes involved in the  development of chemical weapons in the past has been slightly  lifted.    However, this does not mean that fewer questions are now  being asked among either the local population or the military  themselves as regards the range of problems concerning chemical  weapons. Reports about alleged flareups of skin diseases and  other allergies, attributed to the proximity of the dangerous  chemical facility, which periodically appear in the local press  are rebutted by the military. However, an independent expert  medical and ecological study is constantly being put off. And  where should the money for such a study come from when there are  no funds even for maintaining the GITOS [as heard, expansion  unknown], the Shikhany institute which used to develop chemical  weapons in the past and has been devising techniques for their  destruction in recent years. As from the beginning of February  the institute staff have been sent on indefinite, unpaid  vacation.    The absence of a clear state program for the destruction of  chemical weapons and the uncertainty about the Shikhany  facilities' participation in this process cannot but spawn new  rumors and add tension to the situation.

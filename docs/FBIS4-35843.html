			<p>BFN     [Text] The second group of 300 Pakistani troops left  Lahore this morning for the Slovak Republic for onward  deployment in Bosnia. The troops will form part of the United  Nations peacekeeping mission in the war-torn Muslim country.  The third group of troops is expected to leave within a  fortnight. These groups are scheduled to undergo requisite  training in the Slovak Republic for a period of two weeks and  then fly to Bosnia to take their peacekeeping duties under the  auspices of the United Nations. The remaining troops of the main  body will be flown directly to Bosnia under a phased program  expected to be completed by the end of July this year. At  Lahore Airport, they were seen off by senior officers of the  Pakistan Army.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television In my days as a reporter three favourite rainy-day stories were: Increase In Dog Attacks On Children, Puma On The Loose, and Dramatic Rise In Rat Population. All three were guaranteed to cause a stir ..no matter how often you ran them. BBC1's early evening series Here And Now starts a new batch with 'Dramatic Rise In Rat Population'. Which of the standard variations will they go for: 'Now they're immune to all known poisons' or 'This new strain knows no fear' ? (7.00). C4's current affairs series, Dispatches, brings out the discrepancies between cost and penalty for running a lorry legally and running it illegally. Tax and insurance can cost as much as Pounds 3,000, and proper maintenance much more, yet fines for breaking the rules can be just a few hundred pounds, even when a fatality results (9.00). Ludovic Kennedy presents an 80-minute report on Murder In Belgravia - The Lucan Affair which, remarkably, promises to 'shed new light on the accepted theory of what happened on that fateful November night'. Hard to imagine anything new unless you claim that Lucan did not do it (10.20 BBC1).</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Number of companies entering receivership jumps The number of companies entering receivership or administration jumped by more than 50 per cent to 248 last month, according to figures from the official London and Edinburgh Gazettes analysed by accountants Touche Ross. The total for the first two months of the year was 411, compared with 772 for the same period last year. Mr Christopher Morris, head of insolvency at Touche, said the monthly rise might have been exceptional but possibly suggested that bankers were starting to worry about the chances of their customers being able to trade successfully out of recession.</p>

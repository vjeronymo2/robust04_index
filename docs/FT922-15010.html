			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitive Telemetrix advances 21% to Pounds 4.5m TELEMETRIX, the electronics and information systems group, reported a 21 per cent boost in profits for 1991 and announced that it was looking for further growth through acquisitions. The pre-tax figure jumped from Pounds 3.69m to Pounds 4.48m on turnover ahead at Pounds 83.7m (Pounds 72.5m). Earnings per share worked through at 2.1p (2p). The annual dividend is held at 0.6p. The company said it had managed to buck the recessionary trend in Europe, Japan and the US - from where it generated more than half its turnover last year - through Pounds 1.2m of cost cutting, debt reduction and the improved performance of GTI, its US subsidiary. Mr Tim Curtis, the new chief executive, said that the company was considering potential additions in the Pounds 5m to Pounds 20m range but had 'nothing on the stocks at the moment'. Having cut net debt from Pounds 7.6m to Pounds 4.8m it is expected to set its sights on targets within its 'core business area', particularly those involved in Local Area Networks, the linking of personal computers within organisations as opposed to via a national database.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Victoire reshuffles capital for CU deal Victoire, the French insurer, plans to reshuffle its share structure and distribute FFr4.11bn in bonus shares and dividends to shareholders in preparation for its takeover by Commercial Union of the UK. Commercial Union last month ended months of negotiations by clinching a FFr12.5bn (Dollars 2.24bn) deal to buy the bulk of Victoire's interests from Suez, the French holding company that owns 89 per cent of the insurance company. Before completing the deal Victoire must restructure its equity base and redistribute the proceeds raised by the disposal late last year of its interest in the Vinci insurance group. The buyer was Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP). The share restructuring will involve doubling the nominal value of Victoire's 22.5m existing shares to FFr200 in a two-for-one exchange. The value of Victoire's share capital will then be increased to FFr2.73bn from FFr2.25bn by issuing 13 new bonus shares to investors for every 60 shares held. Victoire's shareholders will also receive a special dividend of FFr1.3bn. The company will then distribute to shareholders the FFr2.89bn interest in UAP that it received in payment for the Vinci deal. The news of the Victoire transaction coincides with mounting speculation that Allianz, the powerful German insurer once seen as a prospective buyer of Victoire, is in talks with Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank, over a co-operative venture in France. Credit Lyonnais is known to be interested in forging links with a large insurance group following the failure of plans to form a co-operative venture with Assurances Generales de France. Allianz yesterday declined to comment on German press reports that it had begun talks with Credit Lyonnais.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (14): Reforms signal a more regulated approach - Custody / Norma Cohen reviews the moves to tighten control in the aftermath of the Maxwell scandal IT IS one of the quirks of the UK's investment scene that the custody business is the one sector to escape unregulated. All indications are that this anomaly is about to come to an end. The death at sea of Robert Maxwell, chairman of Maxwell Communications Corporation, sparked an investigation which revealed that more than Pounds 440m was missing from pension funds he controlled. In the aftermath of the Maxwell scandal, a government appointed panel is considering a wide range of options about how best to reform rules for occupational pensions. Not least among these are some which relate to custodians. Meanwhile, the debate about custodial arrangements is occurring at a time when UK pension schemes are taking a much harder look at their own costs, including the costs of custody. A recent study from the National Association of Pension Funds highlights custody as one of the services where there are substantial hidden costs to the client. A study from management consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton indicates that no more than 50 to 60 per cent of custodians fees are derived from the formal charges levied on clients with the remainder coming from stock lending of client portfolios, interest balances and foreign exchange activities. Aided by the work of pensions consultants, some UK funds are taking an increasingly critical view of their own custodial arrangements, both from a cost perspective as well as safety and service. Some large in-house funds, such as ESN Pension Management, the scheme of the privatised electricity companies, have embarked on a campaign to force fund managers to 'unbundle' their custodial and fund management services. This has struck a raw nerve in the fund management industry which is fighting hard against it. Mr Gordon Lindsey, managing director at Mercury Asset Management's Custody and Investor Services Division, says that it cannot charge for the services separately. 'If you wish to use a separate custodian, you may. But we will charge you the same fee,' he said. He argues that MAM would incur costs anyway in adjusting its data systems to communicate with other custodians. However, in the US, egged on by pensions consultants, pension schemes have forced custodians to unbundle fees and cut charges. One large state pension scheme has struck a deal with its custodian under which the custodial service is free as long as the custodian may earn a turn by lending the scheme's securities. If stock lending dries up, the scheme will have to pay Dollars 400,000 to Dollars 500,000 a year in custodial fees. But in the UK, the immediate headline issue in custody is that of safety. Using a series of transactions labelled by Mr Maxwell's in-house and independent fund managers as 'stock lending', ownership of shares passed from the fund managers and custodians to other Maxwell-owned companies. Although the practice bore little resemblance to formal stock lending in which securities never actually change hands, the activities have thrown open the whole question of how to ensure safe-keeping of assets. The government-appointed Goode Committee, named for its chairman, commercial law professor Roy Goode, is considering whether, in the light of the Maxwell affair, pension schemes should be required to designate a custodian for its assets which is separate from the fund manager. The commercial significance of this question is not lost on either fund managers or custodians and the battle lines have been quickly drawn. On one side are the Forum for Independent Custodians, a group organised by Royal Bank of Scotland, the largest independent custodian for UK pension funds. On the other side are the leading fund managers, all of whom operate their own separately capitalised custodial subsidiary. The National Association of Pension Funds has suggested a more modest measure which would require the use of an outside custodian for pension schemes which are managed in-house. That suggestion has upset the UK's largest banks which are both fund manager and custodian for their own pension schemes. The sums are not inconsiderable. More than two-thirds of the assets of Lloyds Asset Management belong to its own pension schemes and Barclays de Zoete Wedd manages more than Pounds 6bn of its pension scheme. Members of the Goode Committee are circumspect about their likely recommendations on custody. However, it is believed unlikely that they will insist on outside custodial arrangements provided those of the fund manager are separately capitalised and properly managed and audited. Another issue yet unresolved is whether Maxwell-type theft could be avoided if securities were required to be registered in the name of their actual owner. Mr Michael Robarts, of Fleming Investment Management, argues that designation not only offers little protection to clients but will also slow down the settlement process, raising costs for everyone and increasing risks. 'Chaos will ensue,' he promises. And because designation wil be under the control of custodians, there is little to stop a larcenous outfit from simply designating itself as the ultimate owner of share certificates. Mr Robarts argues that instead of designating securities in the name of clients, there should be tighter controls on custodians and strict limits on which trustees have the authority to give orders for transfers of securities to the custodians. The suggestion seems to be falling on fertile ground. Already, several accountancy firms have proposed model audits for pension fund custodians designed to help trustees feel assured that the securities they think they own are actually there. Even without regulation, this procedure is increasingly likely to be built into a scheme's procedures. Meanwhile, some members of the pensions industry have suggested that the UK should adopt US-style Erisa legislation which requires custodians to refuse to carry out orders which they believe or suspect are improper. That view has been discussed with the City's chief watchdog, the Securities and Investments Board, which is said to favour it. Overall, pension fund custody, long a backwater of the industry, is receiving scrutiny the likes of which it has never felt before. It is inevitable that it will emerge in a different form.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUES TO BLOCK MERGER OF 2 COUNTY AMPHITHEATERS;  </P> <P> ANTITRUST ACTION: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS COMBINATION MIGHT RESULT IN HIGHER  PRICES FOR CONCERT-GOERS AND LOWER PAY FOR PERFORMERS. A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING  ORDER IS SOUGHT.  </P> <P> The U.S. Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit Thursday to block the  planned merger of Orange County's two biggest concert venues, the Pacific  Amphitheatre and Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, contending that the move would  create an illegal monopoly.  </P> <P> In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court, Justice Department officials said  the two huge amphitheaters dominate the concert-venue market in Orange County.  Combining the two would leave few other suitable alternatives for promoters,  performers and concert-goers in the event that the merger resulted in higher  prices for booking or tickets, the lawsuit said.  </P> <P> "The effect of the combination may be substantially to lessen competition, or  to tend to create a monopoly, in the Orange County concert amphitheater market  in violation of (the Clayton antitrust act)," the suit said.  </P> <P> The proposal under attack would combine the assets and operations of the two  venues under a single limited partnership. The current Pacific Amphitheatre  partners would own a 50% interest in the new entity and would operate both  facilities, the lawsuit said. The current Irvine Meadows partners would hold a  25% interest, and Ogden Corp., a national concessionaire, would own the  remaining 25% interest in exchange for $8 million, the suit said.  </P> <P> The parties planned to consummate the merger at one minute past midnight today,  the suit said.  </P> <P> The Justice Department sought a temporary restraining order halting the merger,  but the judge assigned to the case was not available to hear it Thursday. It  was not immediately known if another hearing date was set.  </P> <P> Justice officials said the merger would eliminate or lessen "actual and  potential" competition between concert venues in Orange County. As a result,  artists could be paid less for performing at the two facilities and  concert-goers could have to pay higher prices and have fewer concerts to choose  from, the lawsuit said.  </P> <P> Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, with 18,000 seats, and the 15,000-seat  Irvine Meadows, eight miles away in Irvine, together bring in between $16  million and $19 million in concert revenues annually, the suit said. Each  hosted about half of the major concerts by performing artists in Orange County  in the last three years, officials said. Combining the two would double the  market share of the resulting partnership in a market that is already "highly  concentrated," the suit said.  </P> <P> None of the attorneys on the case could be reached for comment. Officials of  New York-based Nederlander Organization, which owns a 50% interest in the  Pacific Amphitheatre, were also unavailable. But they have said in the past  that joint operation of the two venues would stimulate competition because  booking agencies would have equal access to both.  </P> <P> Robert Geddes, the managing partner of Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre who has  teamed with former MCA chairman Irving Azoff to try to buy that facility for a  sum that Geddes will not disclose, endorsed the Justice Department's action.  </P> <P> "We view it as the appropriate thing for Justice to do," Geddes said. "To the  extent that it doesn't affect what we're trying to accomplish, we'll go forward  with our negotiations and hope to close them as quickly as possible."  </P> <P> Geddes said he and Azoff are talking with Irvine partners Donald Koll, Paul  Hegness and Charles Hoffman about their buyout offer. Geddes said he thinks  that their negotiations are "making progress." And although the specter of a  defense against the Justice Department is "ominous," Geddes said, he and Azoff  have not received any indication that the suit might prompt quicker acceptance  of their offer as a way of solving the Justice Department's concern over  creation of a monopoly.  </P> <P> Other Irvine partners could not be reached to discuss the negotiations.  </P> <P> In Santa Ana, meanwhile, the trial continued in an unrelated lawsuit filed by  the Pacific Amphitheatre's neighbors over noise complaints. In testimony  Thursday, the amphitheater's financial controller said the concert venue has  never turned a profit since it opened in 1983.  </P></p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Repsol to delay 10% equity sale REPSOL, the Spanish state-owned oil, gas and chemicals group, is to delay a placing of some 10 per cent of its equity until next year to allow parliament to lift legal barriers to the deal. The delay caused some surprise on the domestic markets where the placement, which will include an international tranche and would raise some Pta60bn (Dollars 625m), had been eagerly awaited. The markets had understood that parliament would remove the mandatory majority state ownership of Repsol. A draft bill was approved last July. But Repsol said yesterday the legislation would not be approved until December, delaying the placement until the first half of 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Source Close to Abu-Mazin Denies He </F> Intends To Resign From Fatah"]    [Text] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- While it has been  confirmed that Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir) has submitted his  resignation from the Mobilization and Organization Department in  Fatah and from his other political and movement duties, Fatah  sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Mahmud 'Abbas  (Abu-Mazin) is in severe disagreement with Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat because of his hesitation over returning to Gaza  and Jericho and offering guarantees to the World Bank and the  donor states to facilitate the provision of grants and aid --  which prompted some people to talk about the possibility of  Abu-Mazin's resigning his posts. But an authoritative source in  the office of Abu-Mazin, head of the PLO Pan-Arab and  International Relations, has stressed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that  "there is no truth in recent reports of Abu-Mazin's intention to  quit political and organization action or to resign from Fatah."    The source added that Abu-Mazin's explaining the reasons  that  prompted Abu-Mahir to resign and to quit political and movement  action does not mean "a similarity in their positions." The  source vehemently denied that there is any coordination between  Abu-Mahir and Abu-Mazin with regard to the resignation issue.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Abu-Mazin and Faruq  Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf) [head of the PLO Political Department]  succeeded the day before yesterday in persuading Abu-Mahir to  abandon his seclusion and resume his daily work in his office.  Cadres from the Mobilization and Organization Department have  contacted Abu-Mahir at his home, urging him to abandon his  resignation "because he is needed in order not to perpetuate  autocracy in the movement."    Elsewhere, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that a  misunderstanding arose yesterday between 'Arafat and Abu-al-Lutf  in front of European Union ambassadors over the current balance  of the Scandinavian states' aid fund for the Palestinian people  -- the fund named after the late Norwegian Foreign Minister  (Jorgen) Holst. Reports say that 'Arafat put the figure at $53  million, while Abu-al-Lutf put it at $60 million. This conflict  in the figures aroused the European ambassadors' suspicions  about the fate of the $7 million, the difference between the two  figures.</p>

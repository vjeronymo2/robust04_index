			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HARBOR HIT BY A COLD BAKERSFIELD WIND, 56-0  </P> <P> Brutal reality of the kind Harbor College experienced last season made another  unwelcome appearance at the Seahawks' Western State Conference home opener  Saturday evening.  </P> <P> Visiting Bakersfield College scored early and often against Harbor, soundly  defeating the Seahawks, 56-0.  </P> <P> The Renegades (2-0-1, 1-0-1) used a strong running attack to quickly dominate  the game. Harbor fell to 1-2, 0-2 in the WSC.  </P> <P> Gino Valpredo got the scoring started for Bakersfield in the first quarter. His  one-yard touchdown run capped a three-play, 45-yard drive. The Renegades scored  three more times before halftime.  </P> <P> Valpredo scored his second touchdown on a seven-yard run in the second quarter,  capping a 73-yard drive by the Renegades in 15 plays.  </P> <P> Following an interception by Bakersfield's Jake Hogue, the Renegades needed  just four plays to drive 30 yards for their next score, a 20-yard gallop by  Nathan Dupree.  </P> <P> Alexis Charles plunged into the end zone from the one-yard line to give  Bakersfield a 26-0 lead at the half.  </P> <P> Seahawk punter Jose Rocha mishandled a snap from center and lost the ball to  the Renegades' Joesph Cooper, who carried it into the end zone for another  Bakersfield touchdown.  </P> <P> Bakersfield took advantage of another Harbor mistake when Nick Harker's  interception gave the Renegades the ball at the Seahawk 13. Quarterback Lance  Geary wasted little time in hitting wide receiver Bu'Shawn Glover on an  eight-yard touchdown pass.  </P> <P> Valpredo's third touchdown of the game, a four-yard run, increasing his team's  lead to 49-0 at the end of three quarters.  </P> <P> Early in the final period, Bakersfield's Joesph Bobo ran for a touchdown to  conclude the scoring.  </P></p>

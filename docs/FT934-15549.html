			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (3): UN envoy may be president - Politics DURING THE chilly depths of their long, dark winter, Finns will vote next January for a new president whom they hope will preside over the country's emergence from three years of national gloom. All the signs are that they will choose Mr Martti Ahtisaari, who comes from outside the political mainstream and whose election would mark a break from the rather stultified ways of the past and an attempt to seek a new path after the economic and political traumas of the early 1990s. Mr Ahtisaari is a diplomat whose most striking accomplishments have been as a United Nations envoy, notably as the head of the operation overseeing Namibia's transition to independence. Even as the campaign for the January 16 election warms up at home, he has stayed away, intending to remain in his senior role in the UN's peacemaking efforts in former Yugoslavia until December. In other circumstances, that would seem an inauspicious background for launching into domestic politics. But such is the level of disaffection with the old guard that Mr Ahtisaari has consistently been streets ahead in the polls. His burly physical presence and bluff 'folksy' approach - he is from the rural north - have enhanced his popularity. But above all, he is a fresh face. 'Ahtisaari has one big thing working for him,' says Mr Jaakko Iloniemi, head of EVA - the Centre for Finnish Business and Policy Studies. 'He is not a political figure. In the eyes of the nation he has no responsibility for the mess we are in.' Mr Ahtisaari's main policy platform is a clear advocacy of Finland's application to join the European Community - an issue which has split the country but so far does not seem to have damaged his popularity. He does represent a political party - the main opposition Social Democrats. But it was the potency of his non-party image that prompted the Social Democrats to choose him over Mr Kalevi Sorsa, the former prime minister, in a primary election in May. Altogether, there are nine candidates vying for the presidency, but only two form a real threat to Mr Ahtisaari. One, Mr Raimo Ilaskivi, of the conservative National Coalition party, is a former mayor of Helsinki who defeated Mr Pertti Salolainen, his party's leader, for the candidacy and is also running on an anti-political ticket. Mr Paavo Vayrynen, until recently foreign minister, is the candidate of Mr Esko Aho's Centre party and is an experienced campaigner. These two will put up a tough fight, attacking Mr Ahtisaari for his lack of experience in domestic affairs. But Mr Ilaskivi, at least, admits that the split in the anti-Ahtisaari vote means the only chance to defeat him is to deny him a simple majority and force a run-off vote in February. 'Ahtisaari will win on January 16. The question is whether he wins outright the first time,' he says. The new president will take over at a time of flux in Finnish political life. The presidential election itself will be held for the first time by popular vote, rather than by electoral college, a reform which helped both Mr Ahtisaari and Mr Ilaskivi achieve their primary victories against opponents of their respective party establishments. The direct election of the president seems bound to increase the political authority of the head of state, who already enjoys considerable constitutional powers, such as the power to dissolve parliament, appoint ministers, delay legislation and preside over foreign policy. The three main candidates have all signalled an intention to be more active than the Social Democratic incumbent, President Mauno Koivisto, whose reticence has attracted criticism, particularly during the days of deepest economic crisis in late 1992. However, Mr Aho's centre-right government wants to push legislation through parliament to curb some of the powers of the presidency as a balancing measure to the introduction of direct election. Mr Ahtisaari has not objected to such a move in principle, so long as the president's role in foreign policy is not diminished. While the constitutional balance between the presidency and parliament is changing, there are also shifts going on within the parliamentary sphere. The Social Democrats, under Mr Ulf Sundqvist, have largely gone along with the tough fiscal policies of Mr Aho's coalition, recognising that public spending has to be controlled to get a grip on the budget deficit and foreign debt. At a deeper level, parliamentary parties must also come to terms with shifting attitudes among voters. According to an EVA survey, the response to the collapse of old certainties has been to turn away from left-right issues and to focus instead on 'traditional' values, with the emphasis on the family, social justice and environmental issues. 'This means that there is a desire to bring sheer party politics down from its pedestal - to make it a servant of the electorate, rather than the master it has always aspired to be,' EVA commented on the survey.</p>

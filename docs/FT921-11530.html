			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Letter: Part-time not second rate (1) Sir, Valerie Amos (Letters January 21) from the Equal Opportunities Commission says that a 'significant proportion of part-time working women would like to work full-time' but offers no evidence for her assertion. The 1980 Women and Employment survey showed that more than four-fifths of women with part-time jobs were happy with their working hours and pay. More significant still, the 1986 Labour Force Survey shows 65 per cent of women prefer part-time. Moreover, these jobs which women choose to do should not be dismissed as a second-class alternative to a 'long and successful career': the 1984 Women and Employment survey showed levels of satisfaction with the type of work and job security were actually higher among part-timers. Valerie Amos should recognise that the traditional full-time employee job is not the universal preference or aspiration of women. Jane Walker, 40 Ennismore Gardens, London SW7 1AQ</p>

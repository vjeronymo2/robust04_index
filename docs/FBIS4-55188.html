			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by B. Maric: "We Shall Defend What Is Ours"] </F>   [Excerpt] It is not true that the Serbian republic army is  amassing fresh forces and hardware on the Brcko front.    This was stated by General Novica Simic, commander of the  east Bosnian corps, who stressed that the republic of Srpska  army has the same forces in the region of Brcko that it had  three months ago. With this, Simic denied claims -- particularly  by the Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina Army -- about the concentration  of an extremely large number of Serbian troops and  armored-mechanized units in this part of Posavina. Moreover,  the commander of the east Bosnian corps has denied rumors that  the republic of Srpska army was preparing an offensive on the  strongholds of Alija Izetbegovic's troops south of Brcko.    A Muslim army attack on Serbian defense positions would not  be anything new for us, because they have been trying for months  to cut off the "corridor" and reach the Sava River. So far, we  have successfully repelled all attacks of the Muslim forces on  this front; we shall repel the future ones as well, if they  occur -- General Novica Simic told reporters assembled in Brcko.    Circles close to the republic of Srpska army assess that the  Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has not -- even after the arrival  of UN Protection Force observers on the Brcko front -- given up  its intention of attacking the joint forces of the 1st Krajina  and east Bosnia corps on this front. If the Muslim political  and military leadership truly feared an "offensive of the  Bosnian Serb forces," the General Staff of the Supreme Command  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army would not have forbidden Hazim  Sadic, commander of the 2d Tuzla Corps, to sign a cease-fire  agreement on the Brcko front with General Simic.  <H5>  Losers' Threats </H5>   If the Muslim side were interested in peace in this part of  Posavina, it would not have positioned seven brigades and  several independent subversion-terrorist units around Brcko!  Altogether, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has concentrated over  14,000 troops, a part of its armored-mechanized forces, and  artillery weapons, including 152-mm Nora howitzers around Brcko.  On the other hand, northwest of Brcko, in the region of Orasje,  the Croatian Defense Council has six brigades, supported by a  military police battalion of the regular Croatian Army.  Croatian troops also have 30 tanks and armored personnel  carriers that they received from the Croatian Army. Moreover,  they have large caliber artillery weapons that were brought to  the Sava River bank from the Republic of Croatia. In addition  to Djuro Matuzovic, commander of the Orasje region, the Croatian  Defense Council units are under the command of Zeljko Barisic  from Korac near Brod, Iko Stanic from Derventa, and Tomo Bozic  from Odjak.

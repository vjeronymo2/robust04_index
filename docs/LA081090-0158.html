			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES: BE-BOP COMPETITION BLOWS INTO TOWN  </P> <P> Be-boppers take heed! Jazz aficionado Bill Sinclair has decided to take his  love for be-bop another step by announcing the Southern California Be-Bop  Blowoff (SCBB), a contest with $900 in prize money that's designed for both  professionals and amateurs, young and old alike. The idea of the contest, where  the emphasis will be on individual artists rather than groups, is "to give good  music a boost which it . . . needs," says Sinclair in a press release.  </P> <P> The competition begins with audition by tape submission, and those selected  will appear in play-offs in Los Angeles area nightclubs. Sinclair says that all  phases of the contest will be judged by qualified jazz educators.  </P> <P> For information, send a self-addressed envelope to: SCBB, 22932 Vermont Avenue,  Torrance, 90502.  </P> <P> Time for Women: New York-based pianist/singer Barbara Carroll -- who's  currently appearing Tuesday through Saturday in the lounge of the Westwood  Marquis and Gardens Hotel in Westwood -- has been in the jazz business for 40  years and says that things are finally getting better for the women musicians.  </P> <P> "It's about time," says the artist who's usually heard in the Bemelman's Bar of  Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel, where she's been a mainstay for more than a decade.  "When I began playing, it wasn't the case. Now a women isn't prejudged the way  she was in the past, when it was automatically assumed she couldn't play. I  don't think that happens any more."  </P> <P> The pianist, who arrived on the New York jazz scene in the late '40s, played  with guitarists Chuck Wayne and Charlie Byrd before stepping out with her own  trio. "When I first came to New York, I worked at the Down Beat club on 52nd  Street, opposite Dizzy Gillespie's big band," she recalls. "I was so thrilled  because (the Street was where) all my idols, like Billie Holiday, Charlie  Parker and Art Tatum, were working."  </P> <P> In the early '50s, Carroll led a trio at the Embers, a midtown room. "It was a  wonderful jazz room, and I shared the bill with Art Tatum. It was like playing  opposite God," she says.  </P> <P> Carroll who played the Westwood Marquis in January and February and continues  there through Sept. 15, likes the 90-seat room -- "It's very comfy" -- and says  the audiences have been "very responsive. Fortunately, there have been quite a  number of (listeners), and they've been very attentive, and great to play for."  </P> <P> The pianist, whose most recent release is "Old Friends" (Audiophile), says her  performances are based on "essentially what I have always done, but with more  singing. So I play jazz, improvising on standards and good show tunes with jazz  classics and my originals mixed in."  </P> <P> Carroll continues to find the jazz medium striking a warm chord with her. "I  love the freedom of being able to take a song and play it differently each  time, never being bound to playing it the same way," she says. "And since I'm  playing alone, I really have that freedom. It makes it more interesting for me,  and for the audience."  </P> <P> Rim Shots: The Long Beach Museum of Art (2300 Ocean Blvd., Long Beach, (213)  439-2119) is hosting Wednesday jazz concerts this summer.

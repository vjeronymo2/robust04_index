And do the democrats need to  intercept them from their political opponents? MOSKOVSKIYE  NOVOSTI authors have different views on this problem.  <H5>  V. Lipitskiy: `Enemy Instead of Ally' </H5>   The success of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  and Zhirinovskiy is all the more remarkable in that it was  achieved in the absence of serious organizational structures. It  graphically demonstrated the power and attractiveness of  patriotic phrases, even if reduced to the grotesque. Also  notable is the fact that a majority of the electorate went for  their noncommunist version, rejecting the old idioms. And now it  remains merely to guess at the reason for this.    The "national-patriotic" opposition is the child and  reflection of the current authorities, nurtured by their  mistakes and symmetrically reflecting their characteristic  features.    Of course, as befits a mirror reflection, its details,  despite its entire similarity with the original, have an  opposite sign. This applies to the generic characteristics of  both the authorities and the opposition: "democratism" and  "patriotism."    Whence the odd and illogical division into "patriots" and  "democrats" as alternate political forces? Without delving even  into hoary antiquity, to the sources of the struggles of the  Slavophiles and Westerners, it can be seen how difficult it has  been to avoid such a division. Any authorities use patriotism as  an argument in their favor, in support of preservation of the  status quo, and our ancien regime resorted to this method  particularly sedulously. The situation pushed those who were  opposed to the regime into a disregard for patriotic values,  therefore.    The dissident movement in the USSR up to 1985 was not  mass-based, popular even less. It was highly elite and pro-West.  With the start of perestroyka, the situation changed  considerably.    Sometimes you simply have to wonder: Where did all these  swarms of intrepid fighters against totalitarianism come from?  What were they doing until they learned from the mouth of the  general secretary that free-thinking was allowed, and  encouraged, even? Were they suffering in the snares of lies and  lack of rights? By no means! Unmurmuringly they "cooperated with  the regime" in the ranks of pioneer, Communist Youth League, and  trade union organizations and also in the ranks of the Volunteer  Society for Assistance to the Army, Air Force, and Navy and the  Water-Rescue Society.    It is clear that this conformist environment could not have  created its own ideology but adopted that prepared in advance by  the dissidents. The basis thereof was the idea of democracy--and  it was clear to all without needless words, what is more, that  Western democracy would be taken as the model. Whence arose a  dilemma, just as simple and convincing as it is erroneous:  Democrats are the supporters of reforms and familiarization with  world, that is to say, Western, civilization; patriots are  retrograde persons, restorers of the past, and the enemies of  transformations.    Such is the prehistory in principle, which by no means  excludes special cases. There was also an informal  national-patriotic movement, also of the opposition, although  the democrats shunned it and expressed doubt as to its  independence of the regime. Muslim traditionalism began to  gather momentum in the republics, but overseas influence also  performed not the least role here.    The rejection of patriotic emphases, granted all its  conditional nature, proved to be a miscalculation made by the  democrats. The flank was surrendered without resistance,  although, with a preponderance in the news media at that time,  an equality of positions could have been achieved, at least. But  the tactics of the democratic forces at that time were  determined by the forecast of the lengthy and gradual  transformation of society.    Inertia is one explanation of why the democrats, having  become the authorities, continued (and now continue) to behave  as the opposition. The struggle against totalitarianism had  pushed to the forefront people with the optimum set of  attributes for such a specific mission. They feel themselves to  be, as before, overthrowers and are far less inspired and  specific when it is a question of constructive tasks. The  patriotic idea, national interests, and power projection for  this pleiad of destroyers are merely fragments of the old world,  in whose breakup they were so thoroughly involved that they did  not notice how reasonable limits had been exceeded.    In addition, there came with them into power a pro-West  orientation, which acquired additional impetus inasmuch as the  West discovered in Russia entirely material interests.  Politicians who allowed themselves to speak about this out loud  quickly found themselves isolated and out of a job.    This is why the authorities began so belatedly (only as of  the start of 1993, seemingly, when new arguments in the struggle  against the Supreme Soviet were needed) to master the patriotic  vocabulary. This proved difficult--there was still the desire to  utter the sacramental "I do not believe!" And the people uttered  it at the elections on 12 December.    The radical democrats had acquired a new enemy. They came to  life noticeably--a crisis of the genre was manifestly perceived  after the October events. Now once again there was someone to  implacably combat, and the threat that the slow-moving reforms  so sorely needed was discovered. And the very first clashes  revealed the increased divergence of the ideas of democratism  and patriotism, which increasingly resembled Kipling's East and  West: Never would the twain meet.    We can only wonder at the low trainability of already  venerable politicians who had succumbed to panic in the face of  their failure. They were unable to think up anything better than  to call together an anti-fascist front. And these are people in  whose hands are power and responsibility for the fate of the  country, and patriotism, consequently, is their field!    This portends nothing good. A choice between an  nonindependent policy deprived of national priorities and  bellicose nationalism is no choice. A democratism unadapted to  Russian conditions has few chances of survival and even fewer  chances of becoming a dependable barrier to the far more  customary autocracy. And ultra-patriotism (it is into this niche  that the authorities are sedulously shoving even very moderate  patriotic impulses) also gravitates toward dictatorial forms.  The discrediting of the democratic idea, on the other hand,  which ensues from the extremely unsuccessful forms of  embodiment, is making it a feeble counterweight to the growing  national self-awareness, hurt national feeling, and mass  discontent at the progress of the reforms.    The hounding of patriotism and contrasting it with democracy  are extremely unproductive. The synthesis thereof--democratic  patriotism (Rutskoy's term, which was undeservedly  criticized)--is needed particularly in Russia. And the future is  on the side of the political forces that know how to unite  people around national values and interests on the basis of  democratic forms of the organization of society.  <H5>  Kronid Lyubarskiy: `Monkey's Paw' </H5>   Now, when the voices of fascists are for the first time  starting to be heard within the Russian Parliament and the  democrats have simply not recovered, seemingly, from the shock  induced by this fact, it is worth remembering one, not all that  significant, event, which occurred at the end of June at the  Constitutional Conference.    After two weeks of work in groups, a plenary session, at  which the rapporteurs presenting the viewpoints of all the  groups on various aspects of the Constitution were to have  spoken, was scheduled. Six persons were chosen from the  political parties and grassroots organizations. Among those  applying to speak was Vladimir Zhirinovskiy also, but his  candidacy was during the vote in the group of parties rejected.    Imagine the astonishment when the chairman at the plenary  session called to speak, instead of the rapporteur chosen by the  group, Zhirinovskiy. With evident pleasure, the leader of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia delivered his somewhat  insolent and freewheeling speech, the end of which was covered  in, I shall not say tumultuous, but quite loud, applause.    Some 150 representatives of the political parties had simply  been spat upon. After the session, the democrats, at home in the  "highest spheres," explained with consternation and with shame:  Well, you understand, Zhirinovskiy is for strong presidential  authority....    I also am for strong presidential authority. But no  political  goal, even the most noble, can be achieved with the aid of  "allies" from the camp of totalitarianism. A price that  obliterates the entire meaning of the victory that has been won  has to be paid for such "assistance." Support for the democrats  by fascists or communists is the monkey's paw from the  well-known parable of the talisman capable of fulfilling wishes,  but always in the most appalling way. So when its young owner  made a wish for riches, there was an immediate knock on the door  from a messenger who informed him of the death of his much-loved  father, who had left him an inheritance. All other miracles  wrought by the monkey's paw were of the same kind.    I cannot prove this, but I have the continual suspicion that  Zhirinovskiy's occupation of television in the fateful first 10  days of December was not simply Bragin's stupidity or a  spineless understanding of "pluralism." Zhirinovskiy was put on  the screen as an ally in the cause of propaganda of the  Constitution. People wanted to "use" him, but the "monkey's paw"  effect worked unswervingly. The price that we will all pay for  Zhirinovskiy's "support" of the Constitution has not as yet been  fully recognized, it would seem.    Yet by the time Zhirinovskiy was put on the screen, his  political views were no secret. I will quote merely the  following significant words: "How I dream that Russian soldiers  will wash their boots in the warm water of the Indian Ocean....  That any platoon of Russian soldiers could bring order to be  bear in any space.... The Army cannot get stronger in military  recruiting offices and barracks. It needs a purpose, a  mission.... The Russian Army would have to revive again today  were....it to accomplish an operation to establish Russia's new  borders in a southerly direction" (Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, "Last  Dash to the South," which was signed to press on 28 September  1993, over two months prior to the Duma elections).    If what has just been quoted does not constitute the formal  elements of a crime as specified by Article 71 of the Criminal  Code of the Russian Federation ("Propaganda of war, in whatever  form it is conducted"), I would inquire of Aleksey Kazannik,  general procurator of the Russian Federation, what in this case  he considers such propaganda. And does not his own silence fall  under another article of the Criminal Code, Article 172, which  reads: "....an official's nondischarge or inappropriate  discharge of his duties as a consequence of a negligent or  unconscientious attitude toward them that has appreciably  damaged state or public interests or the rights and interests of  the citizens protected by law"?    I greatly fear that the tolerant attitude of representatives  of the Russian power establishment toward fledgling Russian  fascism has deep roots. It is hardly that any of them harbor  affections for fascism. But they lack immunity; their blood  lacks a sufficient number of antibodies immediately and  decisively rejecting totalitarianism and its methods in any form.    The spirit of totalitarianism is with frightening constancy  being revived in the hearts of democrats, and some of its  methods seem acceptable to them, even, and its support,  permissible. I recall the discussion at the Constitutional  Conference of the article on the citizen's right to freedom of  movement on the territory of the Russian Federation, when there  suddenly appeared a proposal, submitted by it is not known whom,  for restricting this freedom. It was not a question of some  temporary measure, but of the introduction of restrictions in an  unalterable part of the Constitution determining the basic  rights and liberties of the citizens!    A spiritual leader of Russian democracy, Father Gleb  Yakunin,  the "Russian Makarios," delivered an impassioned speech in  support of these restrictions, alluding to the wishes of the  electorate. Well, "yesterday's slave, tired of liberty,"  frequently "demands the lash." These demands can be heeded. It  was the unanimous support of Muscovites and their anger at the  "capture" of Moscow's markets by "people of Caucasian  nationality" and so forth to which Moscow's City Hall alluded  when introducing the "special procedure of residence" in the  capital. It counted on the same when adopting the decision on  the expulsion of the refugees, for whom it was required to  display concern by an international convention that had been  signed by Russia.    The problem is not only and not so much the fact that the  spirit of Moscow's initiative rapidly spread through Russia and  was echoed in the "near abroad." The most frightening aspect is  that each such step is a substantial contribution to a revival  of the "ethics" of totalitarianism.    Only by having defined misanthropic ideologies as an  absolute  evil and having rejected them once and for all, patiently  explaining their essence, will we have an opportunity to bar the  way to fascism. Zhirinovskiy's victory is merely the first bell.  We need to be able to hear it.</p>

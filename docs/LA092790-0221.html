			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPAY $6 MILLION OR GO TO JAIL, JUDGE TELLS ADVISER  </P> <P> A federal judge said he would jail financial adviser and radio personality  Richard (R.G.) Reynolds of Laguna Niguel unless he meets an Oct. 15 deadline to  repay about $6 million he owes to victims of his various investment schemes.  </P> <P> Last December, U.S. District Judge A. Andrew Hauk found Reynolds guilty of  violating civil securities laws for enticing about 400 people to invest in Kern  County gold and other ventures. Hauk subsequently ruled Reynolds in contempt of  court for failing to repay any of the money. On Wednesday, Hauk issued the  order with the Oct. 15 deadline.  </P> <P> "We felt the judge did the appropriate thing," said Sandra Harris, chief of  enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission's Los Angeles region.  "Mr. Reynolds had ample opportunity to present evidence demonstrating his  inability to comply with the court's order to pay, and he failed to do so."  </P> <P> In his heyday, between 1985 and 1987, Reynolds had a substantial following in  California and the West through his nightly radio talk shows on investing.  Reynolds, who has only a high school education, portrayed himself as a folksy  adviser to plain folks with modest amounts to invest. Until a few weeks ago,  his program was airing on radio station KORG-AM in Anaheim. For that show, like  his others, he paid for the air time.  </P> <P> Harris said many investors were elderly people who gave Reynolds their  retirement money. The SEC said Reynolds commingled the funds he collected from  investors and spent them on himself and on other business ventures.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Reynolds said he is broke. He filed for personal bankruptcy in  Santa Ana federal court on April 18 to protect his Laguna Niguel home.  </P> <P> "If I have to go to jail, I'll go," said Reynolds, who said he plans to appeal  Hauk's order to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and all the way to the  U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary. "I would have run a long time ago if I was  guilty."  </P> <P> Reynolds has acknowledged in court that he is the target of a Los Angeles  federal grand jury investigation.  </P> <P> He said he does not have the $6 million the court wants because he spent all  the money on salaries, newsletters and other expenses needed to operate  Burbank-based R.G. Enterprises.  </P> <P> "My whole thing was to build a corporation and take it public," said Reynolds.  He closed the business shortly after U.S. Postal Inspectors, acting on a  federal search warrant, raided his offices in April, 1987, seizing business  records, stock certificates and rare coins.  </P> <P> Last February, Reynolds said he had purchased controlling interest in Flow  Ventures Ltd., a holding company with interests in a Tennessee tomato juice  factory and a California cosmetics firm. Flow Ventures stock is traded in the  pink sheets and has been trading for less than 20 cents a share in recent  weeks.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the SEC's Harris said the agency's goal is to collect the money  Reynolds took in and return it to the bilked investors.  </P> <P> Reynolds' personal bankruptcy petition lists debts of $500,000. He asks that  $1.8 million worth of property, including his $750,000 home, be exempt from the  filing. The petition also says he holds 37 million shares of Flow Ventures  stock, valued at $740,000. According to the petition, Reynolds lent the company  $300,000.  </P> <P> Before the bankruptcy filing, First Fidelity Savings &amp; Loan began  foreclosure proceedings against Reynolds' home. In late August, Household  Finance filed a motion for relief from the exemption so it could proceed with  foreclosure on a separate $100,000 note secured by his home.  </P></p>

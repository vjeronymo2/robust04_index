			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK index futures bounced from Monday's falls after a large seller of the Footsie contract, who had been active over the last three sessions, completed his operations, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the September contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,509 making a fairly firm opening. But the positive mood soon turned sour as a few independent traders and a large institution went on the selling tack, sending the contract into retreat. By 10.30am September had fallen to 2,487. With the large sell order completed, the September contract recovered and moved into more positive territory, helping lift the underlying cash market higher. Sentiment was also boosted by comments by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, about a possible cut in German interest rates. September continued to move forward in a quiet afternoon session, closing at 2,520, up 30 on the previous session and about 2 points ahead of its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 25. Turnover reached 8.696 contracts. The day in the traded options market was dull, with turnover a meagre 21,895 contracts by the close. Some 8,624 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. British Aerospace was the most actively traded stock option at 1,454 lots.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (23): All change at Laura Ashley - The fashion and furnishings company has a seamless link between a human resources management system and a computer bureau for processing the payroll - Payroll processing; User View LAURA ASHLEY now uses a computer bureau to process the payroll for its 4,000 employees, but until recently personnel administration was handled largely manually. There were a few personal computers running spreadsheets but no formal human resources system. 'It was previously a bit cock-eyed, with payroll driving the personnel system when it should be the other way round, as it is now,' says human resources director Roy Willis. Mr Willis joined in 1990, when the company was starting its restructuring. 'Before, things were run by divisions but we now take a global view,' he says. 'It was very difficult to get management information at corporate level, so it made sense to install a system that was common to all.' Laura Ashley was already using the Centrefile bureau for payroll processing and chose the Hoskyns human resources management package, running on an IBM AS/400 business minicomputer. 'I certainly didn't want to bring payroll back in-house,' Mr Willis says. 'For one thing, we would need extra people to manage it.' Laura Ashley's computing department put a lot of work into developing a link between the Hoskyns and Centrefile systems. 'We input all the data just once, through the human resources system, which sends it to Centrefile, so there's no more or less work for us than if we had our own payroll system,' Roy Willis says. 'Previously, we keyed in payroll data and sent it over telecommunications links to Centrefile; we still do this, but through the human resources system.' He adds: 'We have as much integration as we would if we had brought it all in-house. The link is virtually seamless.' Laura Ashley is still in the early days and is building its database. But it is already looking at the recruitment, absence monitoring and occupational health modules. 'The system will make life much easier when managements ask for information which has been so difficult to get with any consistency across the UK,' says Roy Willis. Eventually he expects departments to be not only accessing information directly but also entering their own data.</p>

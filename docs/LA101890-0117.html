			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE UPS SPEED LIMIT ON WESTERN  </P> <P> Torrance City Council members Tuesday approved raising the speed limit on  Western Avenue from 40 m.p.h. to 45 m.p.h. but asked the Traffic Commission to  hold hearings on proposed speed limits for other major city streets.  </P> <P> The proposed speed limits are based on a state law requiring cities that wish  to conduct radar enforcement on their major streets -- generally those wider  than 40 feet -- to survey them every five years to determine current traffic  conditions and prevailing speeds.  </P> <P> To allow radar enforcement, speed limits for those streets must be established  within five miles per hour of the speed set by 85% of the drivers.  </P> <P> City officials may set a lower speed limit only if a significant consideration,  such as a blind curve or an adjacent school, warrants it.  </P> <P> Council members, concerned that their most recent surveys called for increasing  speed limits on most of the city's major arteries, decided to postpone action  to allow public comment.  </P> <P> Most of Torrance's radar surveys have expired, some as long as two years ago.  As a result, police officers have been barred from using radar on most of the  city's busiest streets.  </P> <P> Although Torrance hired a consultant to conduct new surveys two years ago, city  officials set them aside when they discovered that speed limits would have to  be raised on a number of streets.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the council certified current speed limits on Madrona Avenue  between Sepulveda Boulevard and Carson Street, on Prairie Avenue between  Artesia and Redondo Beach boulevards and on Hawthorne Boulevard south of Newton  Street.  </P> <P> Police officials also asked the City Council to increase speed limits on 190th  Street, Crenshaw Boulevard and Madrona, Prairie and Van Ness avenues.  </P> <P> Council members refused.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Dee Hardison called it the start of "a vicious cycle. . . . Are  you going to be back in five years asking for 50 miles an hour on some of these  streets?"  </P> <P> Lt. Dennis Frandsen, head of the Police Department's traffic division, said he  did not believe that would happen.  </P> <P> "The philosophy is to allow people to vote on what speed limits should be set  by measuring how fast they are going now," he said. "They're currently ignoring  the speed limits that are on these streets . . . and we can't use radar to  enforce those limits."  </P> <P> Increased speed limits to be considered at a later time would involve, among  others, Anza and Arlington avenues, Calle Mayor, Carson Street, Pacific Coast  Highway, and Palos Verdes, Sepulveda and Torrance boulevards -- many of which  are lined by homes.  </P> <P> Councilmen Bill Applegate and Dan Walker criticized their colleagues for  failing to take the action necessary to let police use radar.  </P> <P> "Sending it off to the traffic commission is not getting the job done," Walker  said. "Nobody likes to have those speed limits raised, and no one wants to have  them raised . . . but state law is preempting us from acting in a different  manner. . . . I'd just as soon have the enforcement now and the conversation  later."  </P> <P> Among the proposed increases in speed limits sent back to the traffic  commission were:  </P> <P> * On 190th Street, from 35 m.p.h. west of Anza and 40 miles east of Anza to 45  m.p.h. within city limits.  </P> <P> * On Madrona Avenue, from 30 m.p.h. between Carson Street and Torrance  Boulevard to 40 m.p.h., and to 45 m.p.h. between Torrance and Del Amo  boulevards.  </P> <P> * On Prairie Avenue, to 45 m.p.h. between Del Amo and Artesia boulevards. The  limit would remain at 35 m.p.h. between Artesia and Redondo Beach boulevards.  </P> <P> * On Van Ness Avenue, to 40 m.p.h. within city limits.  </P> <P> * On Crenshaw Boulevard, to 45 m.p.h. north of Carson Street.  </P></p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Pits would require 'months' to restart THE 10 PITS earmarked for closure or already closed by British Coal would need up to nine months of work before they could operate fully again, Mr Doug Bulmer, president of the British Association of Colliery Management, said yesterday. He told the Commons trade and industry committee that some of the pits could be re-opened quickly but in some cases six to nine months would be necessary before equipment was fully operational. British Coal is undergoing a 90-day consultation period with unions about the future of the pits. Mr Bulmer called for the dismissal of Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator. British Coal's decision to close 31 pits, announced last month, had not been a surprise because of 'the way in which the power generation market has been rigged against coal and in favour of gas', he said. 'It came as no surprise to the government or the electricity regulator and we have provided documentary evidence of that. In our view the regulator should be dismissed for dereliction of duty. We are being pushed out of the power generation market, quite irrespective of our ability to get costs down to compete with imported coal and other fuels.' Mr Bulmer said. 'Gas is to be burned in preference to coal, despite its higher price, because of the way the electricity supply industry is organised,' he said. The government had constructed a crazy system and could alter it, he said. Six Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in areas affected by threatened pit closures have formulated plans to help miners and other workers find new jobs. The proposals include assistance with job searching, retraining, skill assessment, and support in setting up businesses. The six Tecs are in areas where 10 pits have been listed for closure after a 90-day consultation period. The government has made up to Pounds 75m available to Tecs in areas hit by the pit closures.</p>

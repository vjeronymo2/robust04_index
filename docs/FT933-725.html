			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Tecs attack 'barrier to training' UPTAKE OF Investors in People, the government's main national initiative to improve the training of employees, is being hampered by red tape, Training and Enterprise Councils said yesterday. The employer-led Tecs, which promote the scheme, said they found it 'difficult if not impossible' to gain access to the Pounds 10m offered by the government this year to match any funds that Tecs could raise for the scheme. Investors in People (IIP) helps participating companies to develop employee training and to match people more effectively to the needs of corporate plans. Tecs fear they are unlikely to get more than 10 per cent of the Pounds 10m on offer. Mr Julian Blackwell, chairman of the Oxford-based Heart of England Tec, said: 'Investors in People is a success and will be even more successful in the future. 'But because of this funding problem it will take us longer to promote it to employers than we would wish. The skills situation in this country is such that we have not got that time.' Heart of England has persuaded employers of more than 9 per cent of the workforce in its area to join the scheme. Tecs are given no budget by the government for promoting the scheme. But they are allowed to use on it savings made from government-funded programmes for the unemployed which they administer. Tecs promote IIP to employers in their areas, often offering free advice on whether the companies need to change their personnel practices to meet the scheme's demands. However, matching funds cannot be used for salaries of Tec employees promoting the scheme, promotional literature, seminars, general marketing of the scheme or for diagnostic work. Mr Blackwell said the prescriptive nature of matched funding caused problems even when Tecs were eligible to apply for the funds. It virtually excluded the provision of matching funds to help public-sector organisations. The Department of Employment said the Pounds 10m had been ring-fenced for the purpose of providing companies with advice, guidance and assistance on how to achieve IIP. Other money, it said, was available to Tecs.</p>

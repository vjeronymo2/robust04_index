			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Leading Article: World on the trade brink TRADE FRICTION is increasingly undermining western co-operation. As a result, short-sighted decisions made by myopic decision-makers could do untold damage to the hopes of billions of people around the world. The background is inauspicious. With the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the strategic glue binding the western economies, has dissolved. Where once there was a nuclear-armed colossus to fear, there are now beggars to shrug aside. To its credit, the Clinton administration wants the west to unite to help rebuild Russia. Unfortunately, squabbles over how to share the burden now divide the west, whereas the threat once presented by the Soviet Union united it. The less than happy state of most major economies makes co-operation still more difficult. The exception is the US. This week's announcement that US industrial output was up 0.4 per cent in February and 4.3 per cent over the past 12 months confirms that Mr Clinton must be the luckiest - and Mr George Bush the unluckiest - politician on earth. Others have been less fortunate. The UK economy may now be recovering after its two and a half years or so in recession, but only after a policy volte face forced upon a reluctant government by the foreign exchange markets. In the other major industrial countries, the picture is darker still. The British Treasury forecasts a fall of  3/4 per cent in the combined gross domestic product of the three largest continental European economies in 1993, following an increase of just 1 1/4 per cent last year. German GDP may even fall by 1 1/2 per cent this year, it argues. Yet neither the grim economic tidings nor the much vaunted 'solidarity pact' have been enough to transform the Bundesbank's caution. For the rest of Europe, the Bundesbank's monetary policy feels like the death of a thousand small interest rate cuts. Further stimulus Meanwhile, the Japanese government is contemplating a second major fiscal package, to follow the Y10,700bn (Pounds 62.5bn) emergency increase in public works spending announced last autumn. Since the British Treasury's forecast is for a mere 1 per cent increase in Japanese gross national product between 1992 and 1993, following 1.5 per cent last year, a further boost would seem inevitable. But the trade surplus, which reached Dollars 10.55bn in February alone, is the most important reason for action, since it has become an increasingly significant focus of tension, particularly with the US. Yet the Japanese trade surplus is as much an excuse for friction as its cause. Washington is now in the grip of what looks increasingly like a new policy paradigm, one that is bound to make all its trade relationships more difficult. Where once US trade policy was aimed at agreements on legal and administrative processes, it is now aimed more and more at achieving specific quantitative results. Where once it was multilateral, it is now increasingly bilateral or unilateral. Specific commitment The prime example of the new policy paradigm is the 1986 semiconductor pact, progress on which is due to be reviewed by US and Japanese trade officials in Hawaii this weekend. For many Americans this is the example of how trade should be conducted with Japan. They particularly like the specific commitment to a 20 per cent foreign share of the Japanese market which they believe it contained. To this, the Japanese reply that there was no such commitment. They also assert that no market economy could make such a commitment. Fortunately, the immediate dispute has been defused by the news that the Japanese have reached the 'target' they insist is no target at all. While the US is apparently intent on turning Japan into the 'Japan Inc' that many Americans complain it already is, it has not ignored its trade relations with the European Community. Fortunately, the threat of immediate US sanctions over public procurement has been lifted. But US policy towards the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations remains extremely obscure. It is an obscurity that some in the EC, particularly the government most likely to emerge from the coming French elections, may well want to exploit. That government will, after all, be elected largely because the economy suffers from rising unemployment and is burdened by short-term real interest rates at around 8 per cent. Protectionism is almost inevitable. The French conservative parties are already committed to reviewing the farm reform of the EC. They are also committed to changing the agreement on farm trade negotiated with the US last year. Since the US apparently wants precisely the same thing, further conflict would seem inevitable. The mistake on all sides of these trade squabbles has been the failure to recognise that harmonious trade relations have become more central to the industrial countries not less. It would be a bitter irony if it took the collapse of Russia's reforming government to restore the co-operation among the industrial countries that is now so sorely lacking.</p>

After inspecting Qingdao's harbor, technology development  zone and bonded zone, economists agreed that the time was ripe  for the construction of a free port in the city.    According to the initial scheme drafted by the local  government, three steps will be taken, including improvement of  the existing harbor-front in the coming decade, improvement of  facilities in the technology development zone and bonded zone at  the beginning of the next century and final establishment of a  multi-functional free port by the year 2020.    Qingdao city is among the country's earliest to have been  opened up to foreign investors and also one of the five largest  port cities of China.    It is always in the forefront of the reform and opening-up  of  Shandong, a coastal province where the estuary of the Yellow  River is located.    A switch to a free port will bring Qingdao port into full  play and best exploit its geographic, historic and economic  advantages in trade with neighboring Japan and the Republic of  Korea, Germany as well as Taiwan.    Enormous economic profits and political benefits are  expected  to inland provinces along the Yellow River from the completion  of the project.    It will also play a positive role in helping China to attain  an active position in trade and economic cooperation in  Northeast Asia, even in the whole Asia-Pacific region.    The scheme aims to further enlarge the opening-up of the  Yellow River valley to match that of Zhujiang River valley in  south China led by special economic zones such as Shenzhen, and  the Chang Jiang river valley led by Pudong area in Shanghai,  thus readjusting reform patterns of the country and promoting  its all-around opening-up.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Mitsubishi Electric is increasing production of  elevators in their three Asian bases of China, Thailand, and  Taiwan. They will boost to nearly 14,000 the number of units  produced at all three bases in a five-year plan in stages, an  increase of about 50 percent over the present. Moreover, they  will put effort into the export of high-speed elevators from  Japan. They are covering sluggish domestic demand and spurring  the elevator business by proceeding to open up Asian markets  where the construction rush continues backed by rapid economic  development.    The bases decided for this increased production are  "Mitsubishi Elevator Asia" (annual production of 2,000 units), a  fully financed company in Thailand; "Shanghai Mitsubishi  Elevator Ltd." (annual production of 4,000 units), a joint  venture company in China; and a Taiwan joint venture company  (annual production of 3,000 units). Production there totalled  9,000 units in 1993. Almost all of the products are for Asia,  and the Mitsubishi Group is selling 10,000 units in the same  region, including Japanese and South Korean production.    According to the increased production plan, the program for  the period of the next five years is to boost annual production  respectively to 3,500 units in Thailand, 5,400-5,500 units in  Shanghai, and 4,700-,800 units in Taiwan. It is estimated that  the number of units produced when the plan is finished will be  nearly 14,000, about a 50 percent increase compared to 1993.  They plan that the number of units sold in the Asian region at  that point in time, including exports from Japan and production  in South Korea, will be over 18,000 units annually.    A construction rush of high-rise buildings and homes is  continuing along with economic development in Asia, and it is  expected that the demand for elevators will greatly increase in  the future. Particularly in China, it is anticipated that the  annual market scale will reach 30,000 units in a few years and  it will grow into the world's largest market. Starting with  Japanese manufacturers such as Hitachi, major U.S. and European  firms such as Otis Elevator of the United States and Schindler  Lift of Switzerland are also embarking on business expansion.</p>

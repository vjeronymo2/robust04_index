The pressure dropped by five atmospheres on Tuesday  afternoon  in transit gas pipelines near Ukrainian border with European  countries and experts are sure that there is only one reason for  that -- Ukraine is pumping out fuel after Russia began cutting  down supplies to it demanding that debts for previous deliveries  be paid.    If the pressure falls by other five atmospheres, West  European consumers may remain without the Russian fuel,  "Gazprom" experts warned and added that in this case they would  have to decrease gas supplies for purely technological reasons.    The experts are sure that gas supplies will be further  decreased already today also because no debt payments had been  yet received from Ukraine.    Today Russia continued natural gas supplies to Ukraine and  Belarus in reduced volumes, but refrained from further cuts so  far, according to chief engineer of the main dispatcher  department of "Gazprom" Vladimir Podmarkov.</p>

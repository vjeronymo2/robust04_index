			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Management: Navigators without a map or compass - UK companies are failing to look to the future with a sense of strategy Many British companies, sizeable as well as small, are trying to navigate their way to competitive survival in the dark, without either a map or a compass. Almost a third look no further forward than one-year budgets, and more than half have no long-term goals. This bleak picture emerges from a study of the way that over 1,100 UK companies of all shapes and sizes think, plan and act strategically - or fail to do so. But this picture may be just the tip of a miserable iceberg. The study, called 'Unplanned and Unprepared', suggests that, on top of the 30 per cent which have no strategy, up to another 40 per cent plan inadequately. The study was conducted by a thriving consultancy called Strategy for Success, formed out of one of the few fee-earning parts of the National Economic Development Office, which was wound up at the end of last year. The study makes instructive reading, even if its terminology owes too much to Nedo's belief in formal planning and too little to the new business orthodoxy of what academics call 'emergent strategies': those which emerge from entre-preneurial action, albeit within a loose strategic framework. This view sees 'strategy' and 'planning' as two separate animals: strategy as a sense of direction, and planning as the detailed road map which one uses to get there. The 'planning' frame of reference causes the authors of the study to be a little over-ready to suggest that three-year formal plans are too short for many companies' best interests, when in many industries - consumer and office electronics, for instance - this is the furthest that things can be plotted in any detail. Of the 1,100 companies surveyed, no fewer than 15 with revenues of over Pounds 500m put themselves in the category of having 'unclear goals', or none at all. A further five were contained in the 10 per cent of the sample which had only short-term goals. Making only short-term plans may be excusable, even sensible, but having only short-term goals, or none at all, is suicidal. As one respondent put it, doing so is tantamount to being 'adrift and rudderless in a turbulent sea'. Another problem which emerges from the survey is the failure of some companies to realise that planning can - and should - be much more than just a corporate activity directed at acquisitions and marketing: plans, or at least goals and strategies, should be formulated at every level of the organisation and for every activity. Commenting on the results of the study, Brian Weekes, the consultancy's managing director, says some companies 'have won in the UK third division without taking a strategic view, and therefore think they'll survive in the international marketplace'. But other companies recognise the problem: 'They know they've been jammed into a short-term timeframe - often by their own top management  - and they know they must get out of it,' says Weekes. For sizeable companies he cites two particular impediments to long-term thinking or planning, depending on the type of company. In private companies, the main problem is often the owner-manager's refusal to allow strategic issues to be thrashed out properly because of the obvious need either for large injections of capital or for radical changes in the nature of the business - or for both. For subsidiaries of public companies, he says a frequent problem is that their freedom to think and act strategically is constrained by their lack of complete control over key activities such as marketing or manufacturing; these are carried out by the parent company surprisingly often, Weekes says. A third common barrier to strategic thinking and action is the lack of cross-functional collaboration, especially between marketing, engineering and manufacturing. Unplanned and Unprepared.

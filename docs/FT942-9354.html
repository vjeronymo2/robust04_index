			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: French current account deficit France's current account slid to a FFr4.3bn (Pounds 500m) seasonally adjusted deficit in February from a FFr16.1bn surplus in January, the economics ministry said yesterday. The ministry said that the deficit reflected interest coupon payments on French government bonds to non-residents and an unusually large French contribution to the European Union that month. The government said that its definitive surplus for 1993 was FFr59.5bn, or 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with FFr20.5bn, or 0.3 per cent of GDP, in 1992. France had a basic balance of payments deficit in February of FFr51.68bn, compared with a deficit of FFr24.42bn in January and a surplus of FFr13.90bn in February 1993, the ministry said. The cumulative deficit in the first two months of 1994 was FFr76.10bn, compared with a surplus of FFr30.65bn in the first two months of 1993. Italy's public sector deficit narrowed to a provisional L16,100bn (Pounds 6.7bn) in the period January-February 1994 from a L21,410bn deficit in the corresponding period of 1993, the treasury announced yesterday. Norway's trade surplus rose to NKr2.86bn (Pounds 264m) in April from NKr1.67bn in March, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. The cumulative January-April surplus fell to NKr14.95bn from NKr20.81bn in the same period a year ago. Denmark's unemployment in the first quarter of 1994 rose to 13.7 per cent of the workforce, compared with 13.0 per cent in the first quarter of 1993, according to the Danish national statistics agency.</p>

Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  spoke to Yasir 'Arafat on the phone a short while ago. Rabin  told 'Arafat: On behalf of the government I would like to  express shock over the brutal murder by this madman which  resulted in the death of innocent people during Ramadan, at a  place holy to both Jews and Arabs. I want to tell you that this  is a disgrace to us all. We condemned this insane act and will  do everything we can to ascertain what caused it. Although we  know that the murderer committed suicide, we know that three  days ago he said he wanted to carry out a dramatic act in order  to halt the peace talks. He acted against us all, but  especially, he killed innocent people, and we will adopt all  measures to restore quiet and to check whether he had  accomplices. I wanted to speak to you directly and to express  the government's condolences to you and to the Palestinian  people. I can find no words to denounce this act. Let us speed  up the effort to do what we committed ourselves to in the  Declaration of Principles. I am sorry that this happened now,  in the middle of our attempt of reaching a conclusion on the  Gaza and Jericho issues. As an Israeli, I am ashamed of this  act.    The meeting at the Defense Ministry here in Tel Aviv, with  the participation of the prime minister and ministers, is still  continuing. U.S. Ambassador Djerejian came here and left the  meeting a short while ago.</p>

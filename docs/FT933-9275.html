			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Russell Hobbs behind 88% leap at Pifco A STRONG performance by its Russell Hobbs brand enabled Pifco, the electrical appliances group, to report a 88 per cent increase in annual profits. The pre-tax outcome for the 12 months to April 30 rose from Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 2.2m on sales of Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 40m). Mr Michael Webber, chairman, said: 'Improved efficiency and profitability at Russell Hobbs and tight control on all costs throughout the group was responsible for the rise in profits.' As part of the rationalisation the workforce was reduced by 12 per cent, leading to the loss of 78 jobs. The company ended the year with a net cash balance of Pounds 4.6m. In the 28 months before the group acquired Russell Hobbs it incurred losses of Pounds 31m. Mr Webber conceded that analysts had been nervous about the purchase, believing it to be either a big lead forward or big mistake. 'I believe we have now proved it has been a success' he said. Tax charge remained low at 5 per cent because of accumulated losses at Russell Hobbs. Pifco is exploring potential acquisitions in the European small appliance industry. 'Timing is everything' said Mr Webber, 'but there could be some good buys in Germany where many of the family businesses are thinking twice about their options.' He described consumer confidence in the UK as 'fragile and erratic' with margins under pressure. The company is planning to launch a number of products at the bottom end of the market to co-exist with its premium brands such as Russell Hobbs and Carmen. Earnings per share rose to 25.5p (13.9p). The final dividend is raised to 4.75p making a total of 8.25p (7.75p).</p>

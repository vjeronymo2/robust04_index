The meeting is against a background of a civil service  strike  that threatens to cripple the homeland as strikers demand the  return of their pension contributions and re-incorporation into  South Africa.    The cabinet must decide whether to register alongside its  Freedom Alliance partner, the Inkatha Freedom Party, and  Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front.    Although the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front], of which  Gen Viljoen is chairman, decided on Saturday against  registration, the Freedom Front could still participate in the  elections. Attempts are being made to persuade moderates to  follow through with the registration.    Hopes for Bophuthatswana's inclusion in the electoral  process  were further boosted when African National Congress President  Nelson Mandela said in Pietersburg on Sunday that the deadline  for registration could be extended.    A spokesman for the Office of Minister of Constitutional  Development Roelf Meyer said on Monday that if the Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] would accept the registration of  Bophuthatswana's ruling Christian Democratic Party on Monday  afternoon, "the government will not obstruct that". He said any  objection to the late registration would be based on practical  rather than political objections. "Whatever the IEC can  accommodate, that will be okay with the government," the  spokesman said.    A Bophuthatswana government source said a representative  would be flown to Johannesburg to register if the cabinet  decided on participation.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Grandeur and chaos - Robert Graham gives an aficionado's guide to Naples, scene of this week's G7 summit The Bourbons used to make their regal entry into Naples by sea. So did Admiral Nelson in search of Lady Hamilton. It is, to this day, also the most convenient way to reach the heart of Naples. The heads of the G7 countries will, however, arrive by air for their meeting this week. This is, yes, more in tune with the times, but air travel misses the sweep of the Bay of Naples with the volcanic cone of Vesuvius in the background. Unfortunately, most people's impressions of Naples are coloured by negative experiences within minutes of setting foot at its airport or two railway stations. This is unfortunate because Naples is unquestionably the grandest, if not also the most maligned and most chaotic, of the great Mediterranean port cities. Naples and the Neapolitans deserve a second, even a third, chance. The airport ordeal begins even before landing, as the aircraft navigates a perilous path between illegally built apartment blocks and the tops of ancient chemical plants that ring the runway. Then comes the wait for baggage which has a habit of losing itself. Be quick to report luggage that does not arrive: I was once allowed to search the holds of five parked aircraft and, eventually, located the lost piece about to be dispatched to Bari. Luggage in hand, it is best to opt for a taxi. The cardinal rule about Naples taxis - who consider any passenger, especially one from out of town, fair game - is always to check the meter works and is clocked on. This is particularly adviseable for the journey to central Naples, which takes at least 45 minutes. Here is a fairly standard routine between passenger and driver: 'Could you put on the meter?' 'I'm afraid it's not working.' At this point you threaten to get out of the taxi. If done with good humour, you will immediately be called Dotto (Doctor - a sign of respect) and then be treated to a display of Neapolitan driving - something to be experienced, not described. But you may still be cheated with some spurious supplementary charge. Naples offers two railway stations. Napoli Centrali is the main terminal. But Centrali suffers the inconveniences of being surrounded by a square with often grid-locked traffic and a high proportion of assorted eastern European alms-seekers and local importuners. It is often easier to go to Napoli Mergellina which is close to the sea front, less crowded and allows access to the main hotel area in less than 10 minutes. Inter-city trains only ever stop at one of these two stations. However, there is a useful underground link between them - the only part of the city's long-promised metro. Public transport is erratic and crowded, although in less than six months a new mayor has performed wonders. He has managed to reduce the appalling traffic jams of the past merely by making the traffic police work. A large number were found to have been clocking in, only to go home with the excuse that the traffic was so bad that their presence made no difference. The G-7 summit is an additional incentive to spruce up the city and improve its workings. The city centre is usually easier and more enjoyable to negotiate on foot. Going by bus can be an uncertain experience: it is not always easy to buy a ticket before boarding, as passengers are meant to, but board anyway because no one will bother to check. The best of Naples hotels are on the corniche of Via Partenope, overlooking a small marina and the ancient hulk of the Castel Dell'Ovo, with the Bay and Capri in the distance. Prices are more or less the same, with the Vesuvio at the top of the range - over L350,000 (Dollars 220) a night. The Santa Lucia is well-decorated with Neapolitan antiques and has helpful staff, while the Excelsior appeals to those attracted by faded grandeur. If you want to pay less, look for the smaller s in Chiaia. Via Partenope corniche has the advantage of being fairly self-contained. In front, there are a good 15 restaurants around the Castel Dell'Ovo marina, all serving good Neapolitan cuisine. If you come to Naples on business, it is a shame not to see some of the sights. The priority must be the Museo Archeologico (one of the world's top museums, with the finest finds from Pompei). There is a surfeit of churches, Roman and Greek ruins at Pausilypon, palaces and art collections. The Capodimonte Museum, the most important art gallery, is currently closed for restoration. For those with time to go to Pompei, it can be reached by train from Napoli Centrale. The journey, scheduled to last 45 minutes, in the manner of Naples often takes longer.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / International Company News: Skanska profit ahead 83% at nine months Skanska, Scandinavia's largest construction and property group, increased pre-tax profits by 83 per cent to SKr2.72bn (Dollars 365m) in the first nine months. Expanded international operations, reduced interest costs and higher dividend income offset the slump in the Swedish building market and lower rental revenues. The figures included a SKr879m dividend from the winding up of the investment group, Protorp. There was a 4 per cent drop in nine-month operating income to SKr1.87bn from SKr1.95bn, reflecting a worse performance from the Swedish construction unit and lower rental revenues after property divestments late last year. But the downturn was offset by SKr857m in financial income. In the same 1993 period, the group incurred SKr466m in expenses. The Swedish construction side saw operating profits fall to SKr363m from SKr412m as revenues fell 7 per cent to SKr10.3bn. Low demand and depressed prices characterised the domestic market, now in its fourth year of recession. Residential construction is being held back by high interest rates with housing starts falling to 5,800 from 7,400. The company says the market should have touched bottom, with higher road and civil engineering activity helping to offset low housing construction business in the next year. International operations accounted for 46 per cent of total order bookings of SKr27.4bn against 27 per cent of SKr17.6bn in 1993 . International construction revenues jumped to SKr6.9bn from SKr4.4bn and operating income climbed to SKr47m from SKr16m. Skanska says its full-year profit, excluding the dividend from Protorp, will be considerably better than last year's SKr1.1bn.</p>

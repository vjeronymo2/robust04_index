			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Palace from the </F> "Union Radio News" newscast]    [Text] Interior Relations Minister Ramon Escovar Salom  anounced the creation of a specialized police unit within the  Metropolitan Police to face street disturbances. The interior  relations minister explained this unit will not be independent  from the police. However, he continued, it will be formed by  agents who will receive special training to handle  demonstrations, because the riot police equipment gear is  currently insufficient.    Escovar Salom stated this decision was made because the  government will no longer tolerate violence, where buses are  burned down and store windows broken. He stated his opposition  to police using their fire power in student distrubances, but he  also opposed street disturbances without controls by authorities.    [Begin Escovar Salom recording] Demonstrations must be  conducted by observing a particular behavior. I explained to  student leaders that they must carry out their actions  peacefully; I asked them to assist not only the government but  also Venezuelan society.    Regarding firearms, I don't think anyone in Venezuela wants  to see police using their firepower irresponsibly. Therefore, we  must observe certain principles. The police weapons are called  regulation weapons; they can only be used in keeping with police  regulations. Now there must be a specialized and trained corps  to fight street disturbances. [end recording]    Escovar Salom termed the rumors of his alleged resignation  from the Ministry of Internal Relations mere speculation. He  reported he will soon present before Congress the Bill replacing  the Law on Hoodlums and Thugs, which has been in force in the  country since the times of former President Eliazar Lopez  Contreras.    Finally, Escovar Salom reiterated categorically the  government will use the public force to prevent the food boycott  of Caracas, planned by a group of union members of Inerca  [expansion unknown] who oppose the restructuring of Coche Market  by an intervention board.</p>

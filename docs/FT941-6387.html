			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Scottish Office to amend bill The Scottish Office intends to amend the bill to reform local government, now going through parliament, to enable Strathclyde Regional Council to conclude a deal to lease Pounds 36m of trains for its passenger transport executive. The leasing of the trains, to be built by Hunslett TPL of Leeds, has been held up since last autumn because Lombard North Central, the leasing company, said there was inadequate security because Strathclyde is to be broken into 10 councils under the reform. The Scottish Office says it will seek to amend the legislation to permit the council to lease the trains. Strathclyde believes a legally binding letter stating this intention will be enough to unblock the deal. It says the diesel multiple units should go into service by mid-1996. Mr Malcolm Waugh, chairman of Strathclyde Regional Council's transport committee, welcomed what he called a volte face by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the Scottish Office minister. He said, however, that the council would receive the trains 10 months later than it might have done if Lord James had accepted what the council said in the first place.</p>

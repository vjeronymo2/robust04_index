			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Loans for the boys (2) I HAVE lent my son-in-law Pounds 39,000. I have a written acknowledgement and could soon be seeking repayment. No interest payment was specified and none was made. Will the Inland Revenue be able to claim income tax at some specified rate on the loan? Not unless your son-in-law invested the money (or part of it). If he did invest it (or put it into an interest-bearing account), then the income which he derived from it will be assessable upon you - and not on him - by virtue of, for example, section 672 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. There are other anti-avoidance provisions which might conceivably bite - section 786 (Transactions associated with loans and credit), for example - but it seems unlikely from the bare facts outlined in your letter. If you are in doubt, it could pay you to consult a local accountant or solicitor. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

The statistics  have not yet been processed by the Ministries of Health and  Justice. According to their statistics, in 1991 the police  figures for deaths were increased from 114 to 116 and a year  later from 146 to 187.    Last year the number of reports to the police on the basis  of  the Drug Law soared by almost 40 percent: While in 1992 7,805  persons were reported to the police, in 1993 the number exploded  to 10,915. The development in Salzburg was particularly dramatic  (plus 88 percent), Tirol (plus 76 percent), and Vienna (plus  59.8 percent). Slight declines were noted only in Carinthia and  Burgenland.</p>

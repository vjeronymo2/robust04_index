			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Manama, 18 Jan (WAKH) -- Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi,  head of the Palestinian negotiating team, has said that the  Gaza-Jericho agreement is an accomplished fact because the  Palestinian leadership [words indistinct] signed it and because  the world adopted it as a basis for the achievement of peace in  the region.    However, in a statement to the Bahraini paper AL-AYYAM  today,  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi noted that this agreement places the  Palestinian side [words indistinct] in a difficult position  because it does not address the issue of the continued Israeli  settlement activity in the occupied territories. Rather, he  said, the agreement gives Israel more reasons to justify its  denial of the Palestinian rights to self-determination,  independent statehood, and repatriation.    He said that he believes that this agreement can be dealt  with while maintaining inalienable Palestinian rights. He noted  that this can be achieved through effecting a national unity  among the various political factions on a democratic basis.    Talking about the situation inside the Palestinian home, the  Palestinian negotiator expressed satisfaction with what is going  on between Palestinian officials and the Palestinian opposition.    He said that the next phase requires the PLO apparatus,  which  was established on the basis of an armed struggle, to make  unusual preparations. Now it must adapt itself for the next  phase.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Umberto Rosso: "This Is How We Will Wage War on </F> Taxes -- the Professor Wrings Applause"]    [Text] Rome -- [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi's  "minister of finance," in the velvet setting of a Parioli hotel  to present the "miracle" program to Rome's upper bourgeoisie,  surprisingly finds himself on the same wavelength as the  Communist Renewal, which wants to tax treasury bills. Antonio  Martino, Forza Italia's economic expert, smiles and speaks with  a voice strained from too many debates: "Yes, the premises  which [Communist Renewal leader] Bertinotti starts out from are  sacrosanct: The present system, the taxation of public debt  securities, is unjust. But the paths separate here, and I draw  totally different conclusions." Professor Martino does not  think of making people pay interest on treasury bills, nor does  he espouse the measure of registering securities, which would be  "dangerous." "At least for the time being," he states, until  such time that the virtuous mechanism bearing Berlusconi's name  comes into motion, which should restore the state's finances.  "Reasons of political opportunity" suggest that it is better to  make do with this situation, which we have not created, but  which has come about over many years, until such time as the  restoration of the public finances allows us to take provisions  in the direction indicated also by [economist] Mario Monti.  Hence, according to what the quoted economist is suggesting,  the future according to Martino for treasury bills is the  "bringing in line of their tax treatment with that of other  investments."    And yet, Bertinotti's idea has raised ferocious opposition  in  the "pole of freedoms," a war on the communists who wish to  annihilate government securities. "No, not from me. And then,  if one looks behind all the various positions, the absurd fact  is this: In Italy, two citizens enjoying the same income are  treated in two totally different ways. The person earning it  from working is punished with a confiscatory tax system. The  other, whose income comes from interest on public debt  securities, pays not one lira of tax."    The war cry, which fires off applause from the elegant  audience and the rostrum (all the Rome candidates: Fabrizio del  Noce, Gustavo Selva, Publio Fiori, etc.), is the war on taxes:  The raising of deductions and the single personal income tax  rate of 30 percent are the "two pillars" of the program, which  have unbridled the "most uncivilized, heedless, disorderly  reaction by the left, evidently short of arguments, against us."  One reason more not to abandon the confrontation. By the way,  Professor Martino, is it true that you refused a face to face  interview with Budget Minister Spaventa in front of the "Milan,  Italia" TV cameras? "No. First of all, they told me that  yesterday evening there would be Spaventa, then Visco [in charge  of Democratic Party of the Left tax policy]. But I do not suit  them and the job went to someone else." Is this not a wish to  escape confrontation, following Berlusconi's line? "Nothing of  the kind. We have been confronting Spaventa for a very long  time. Maybe, if he did not insult me, it would be more  pleasant." Forza Italia's economist confesses having been  tempted to impose a blackout on those newspapers which  ill-treated him worst. ("One cannot run the headline `Come  Forward Martino,' that is the limit...") but he quickly changed  his mind. Is he offended if one talks of a magic wand for those  million jobs which are promised? He replies with the numbers:  "If we manage to obtain the detaxation of fiscal burdens, the  three-year extension for the net creation of new jobs -- and not  the entrepreneur who dismisses and then rehires, this is fraud  -- I believe that this would represent an enormous stimulus for  employment." In just two years, as Berlusconi guarantees, a  million new people brought into the workforce? "Well, perhaps  this was an objective thrown out..."</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Militants win biggest bloc in Jordan poll JORDAN'S Moslem fundamentalists yesterday retained the largest bloc in parliament following Monday's multi-party elections but suffered a decline in the number of seats they hold. Voters elected 16 candidates to the 80-member parliament from the fundamentalist party, the Islamic Action Front, (22 in the 1989 elections). Turnout was 68 per cent of the 1.2m voters who collected their voting cards. The result is a victory for King Hussein who urged the electorate to show moderation in choosing their representatives. It vindicates the king's policy of accommodating Moslem fundamentalists in the political system rather than excluding them as in Algeria and Egypt. The king said the elections made Jordan 'an example for others near and far'. The new parliament, due to convene early next month , consists of mainly tribal and centrist MPs without party affiliations. It is likely to offer strong support to the government in all policies including the peace process, which is rejected by the Islamic Action Front. It will also include Jordan's first woman parliamentarian, Ms Toujan Faisal, an activist branded by fundamentalists as an apostate. The fundamentalists will have less lobbying power in the new parliament, but the elections were not all bad news for the Islamic Action Front. Its candidates had particular success in Jordan's main non-tribal urban areas of Amman and Zarqa, where high unemployment and poverty makes them perfect breeding grounds for radicalism. One of the Front's candidates standing in Zarqa, Mr Bassam Emoush, received the highest number of votes. (9,316). The Islamic Action Front took three of the four seats designated for Moslems in Zarqa, the biggest of Jordan's 20 voting districts. In Amman's poverty-stricken First and Second Districts, Islamic candidates dominated the polls. More surprisingly, in the Third District of Amman, which is home to Jordan's intelligentsia and bourgeois elite, a popular fundamentalist and member of the Islamic Action Front, Mr Ibrahim Zeid Kilani, topped the ballot with 9,131 votes, followed by the former prime minister, Mr Taher Masri, who received 8,789. Most other parliamentary seats went to independent tribal candidates in rural areas where a vote for the tribe is more important than a vote for Islam or any other ideology. Out of the 15-or-so political parties standing, aside from the Islamic Action Front, few candidates won seats under party banners. Political parties were legalised in 1992 after a 35-year ban. A plethora of parties registered for the elections, but most were ill-organised, lacked any coherent policies, and failed to be taken seriously by the voting public.</p>

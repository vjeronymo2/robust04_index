			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLEA BARGAIN TALKS IN BRANDO CASE BREAK  DOWN  </P> <P> Behind-the-scenes plea bargain negotiations in the Christian Brando murder case  have broken down, lawyers on both sides said Thursday, and a judge scheduled  the trial to begin Nov. 5.  </P> <P> "Nobody's talking settlement now," Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Bill Clark told reporters after a brief hearing in Santa Monica Superior Court.  Both sides indicated last week that they were discussing a possible  manslaughter plea, even before it became apparent that Brando's sister,  Cheyenne, could not be forced to return from Tahiti to testify.  </P> <P> Clark said an offer by defense lawyer Robert Shapiro was not accepted. "I can  tell you this, whatever he's offered we've turned down," he said.  </P> <P> Shapiro said it appears likely that the case will go to trial, although he said  he remains open to a negotiated settlement.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas ordered 250 prospective jurors to report,  explaining that most will be excused for hardship and publicity reasons.  </P></p>

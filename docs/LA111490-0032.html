			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY DELAYS CUTTING MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING AMID PLEAS FOR SERVICES;  </P> <P> BUDGET: SUPERVISORS MAY SLASH $41.9 MILLION IN PROGRAMS UNLESS STATE AID COMES.  PATIENTS AND CLINIC PERSONNEL SAY MORE HELP, NOT LESS, IS NEEDED.  </P> <P> Patients, clinic administrators and advocates for the mentally ill on Tuesday  predicted mayhem and tragedy if the County Board of Supervisors goes through  with $41.9 million in cuts to mental health programs.  </P> <P> The supervisors are wrestling with major budget shortfalls for mental and  public health programs because of the failure of the Proposition 134 liquor  tax.  </P> <P> Action on the mental health cuts was postponed until next Tuesday to allow more  time to obtain a promise of a bailout from governor-elect Pete Wilson. The  supervisors also set Dec. 15 for a legally mandated hearing on the impact of  the proposed $12.7 million in cuts to outpatient services at county hospitals  and health centers.  </P> <P> Without additional money and with no cuts in services, the mental health budget  will run out in April. The latest plan of county mental health Director Roberto  Quiroz calls for dropping 22,000 of the 69,000 people in outpatient programs,  closing 10 county clinics and converting the five that remain to crisis centers  for the most seriously ill.  </P> <P> "Basically what we are saying is that we will no longer have walk-in outpatient  clinics operated by the county," Quiroz said.  </P> <P> One that would be closed is Hollywood Mental Health Service, serving 1,700  patients. The threat of its closure drove Ina Kleinberg, 61, of West Los  Angeles to join a demonstration in front of the Hall of Administration on  Tuesday just before the supervisors met.  </P> <P> About 100 protesters circled the plaza in front of the building at 500 W.  Temple St., carrying placards with such slogans as "Mental Health or More  Police" and "Share the Wealth With Mental Health."  </P> <P> Kleinberg and her husband care for their 36-year-old daughter, who is  schizophrenic and manic-depressive. -The family receives care from several  sources, but Kleinberg said she also has needed help in coping with the stress  that mental illness has brought on the family.  </P> <P> "I found a haven at Hollywood Mental Health in the once-a-week family group,"  she said.  </P> <P> Later, in the supervisors' meeting, Marvel Rolfe sat before the microphone to  plead for Hollywood Mental Health. A psychiatric nurse there for 12 years, she  spoke of tending to patients who are the most disabled among the county's  mentally ill, and of what she sees as the impact of today's deteriorating  economy, growing unemployment and money woes on mental health in general.  </P> <P> "We don't need more cuts, we need more services," Rolfe said, near tears.  </P> <P> Ann Lodwig Brand, president of the Assn. of Community Mental Health Agencies,  representing 42 nonprofit mental health clinics under contract to the county,  projected that 40,000 -- not 22,000 -- patients will be dropped from care if  the cuts go through.  </P> <P> "They have got to come up with the money," Brand said in an interview. "You  have a system that has been in development for 50 to 60 years that will go  under with these cuts, and you won't be able to bring it back by adding more  money next year."  </P> <P> In postponing a decision on the cuts, the supervisors said they were counting  heavily on Wilson to restore state mental and public health money that Gov.  George Deukmejian cut last summer to balance the state budget.  </P> <P> The board mailed a letter Nov. 8 to Wilson asking for an emergency meeting to  discuss restoring the cuts.  </P> <P> The board has received no response. Bill Livingston, Wilson's press secretary,  told The Times that he did not know if the letter has reached the transition  team and that it was too early to make any budget decisions.  </P> <P> The supervisors plan to send a similar letter to county legislators to get them  involved in lobbying Wilson.  </P> <P> Supervisor Ed Edelman, an advocate of additional funding, said he did not want  the board to stop with Wilson, but to explore the possibility of new taxes or  funds from other departments.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Richard Simon and Carl Ingram contributed to this story.  </P></p>

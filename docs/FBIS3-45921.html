			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Huang Qifan (7806 1142 1581) in the "Earnestly </F> Study Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume 3"  column: "Deng Xiaoping's Ideas on Opening Up and Development  and the Development of Pudong in Shanghai"]    [Text] Comrade Deng Xiaoping was the main decisionmaker  and founder of the Pudong development in Shanghai. Over the  last three years, the Pudong development has been guided by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideological line of "emancipating the  mind and seeking truth from facts," with the 14th party  congress's "one spearhead, three centers" as its strategic  targets. The development has seized the historic opportunity,  launched comprehensive development and construction, rapidly  expanded opening up to the rest of the country and to the  outside world, and achieved substantive progress.  <H3>  1. Comrade Xiaoping's Decision To Develop Pudong and Steps  for Opening Up and Development </H3>   The Pudong development in Shanghai was announced in the 12th  year of our country's opening up and development policy.  In these 12 years, economic reforms made two big steps of  great significance in regional and industrial opening up.    The first step, from 1979 to 1988, saw the  establishment of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan  Special Economic Zones and 14 economic and technological  development zones along the coast.    The second step occurred in 1990 with the decision to  develop the New Pudong District in Shanghai.    Both these strategic steps were personally planned and  decided on by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. As a great historic  figure, all of Comrade Xiaoping's decisions are made with  insight into the world situation and are based on China's  reality. China has a large population but a weak foundation,  hence a comprehensive start to development and construction was  out of the question. Economic revitalization must be  jump-started at certain points of breakthrough. Therefore,  Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Let some areas with the  conditions become developed first, and let some areas develop  slowly. Then areas that have developed will bring along the  areas slower in development, thus leading to common prosperity."  He repeatedly stressed: "This is a big policy, one that can  influence and set in motion the entire national economy. I  suggest comrades consider and study it seriously." This was a  scientific conclusion based on 40 years of experience and  lessons. Practice over the last decade or so has proved again  and again that this conclusion is right and unshakable.    Under the auspices of Comrade Xiaoping, China's massive  opening- up and development policy was first tested out in  relatively backward areas adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao,  which, more exposed to economic development in developed areas,  would have fewer labor pains and could be jump-started. A  decade of effort finally established, step by step, a large  group of "windows" and "bases" for opening up to the outside  world. The areas grew from buying technology and "processing  and assembling investor-supplied materials and components" to  direct introduction of foreign capital, advanced technology, and  management methods; extended domestic and foreign markets; and  scored encouraging results.    At a time when south China and coastal regions have acquired  greater experience in opening up and development, it is  necessary -- and the conditions also permit -- to make the more  critical second step toward regional and industrial opening up.  So Comrade Xiaoping turned his eyes firmly toward Shanghai --  the fount of China's finance, trade, and industry and an  extraordinarily large metropolitan area.    Early in 1990, when touring Shanghai, Comrade Xiaoping  showed  great concern for preparations for the Pudong development. When  he returned to Beijing, he told Political Bureau leaders:  Though I have retired, there is one more thing I would like to  say, and that concerns Shanghai's Pudong development. You must  show more concern for it. In April 1990, the Central Committee  and State Council declared the second strategic step of opening  up to the outside world by formally announcing the important  decision of developing and opening up Pudong of Shanghai and  marking it as the focus for China's opening up and development  for the next decade.    From a regional development point of view, if opening up and  development in the 1980's began with underdeveloped regions  which did not have much influence on the national economy, then  opening up and development in the 1990's can be said to be  spearheaded by efforts in extraordinarily large cities and to be  moving into the Chinese heartland. Comrade Xiaoping said in  this regard: Once Shanghai is opened up, nothing will be the  same for reform and opening up in the Chang Jiang Delta, the  entire Chang Jiang region, and the whole nation."    From an industrial standpoint, the 1980's was characterized  by the opening up of secondary industry, whereas the Pudong  development in the 1990's centers on tertiary industry. Four of  the 10 policies in central Document No. 10 have to do with  opening up tertiary industry with foreign capital, all of them  opening up policies of an entirely novel character, which can be  appreciated in the opening up of tertiary industries such as  commerce, trade, finance, and securities. This shows that  China's opening up policy in the 1990's has extended the area of  opening up from mainly "foreign-invested" manufacturing  industries to tertiary industries. The integration of the  global economy is marked by the integration of tertiary  industries such as finance, commerce, trade, information, and  technology. For its economy to take off, China must create a  new dimension in its opening up to the outside world, opening up  not only primary and secondary industries, but also tertiary  ones in order to speed up structural adjustment and meet the  requirements of the integration of the world economy. The  opening up of tertiary industry requires a developed economy,  modern communications and telecommunications, and various  interdisciplinary and specialized professionals as a foundation.    According to the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's keynote  addresses made on tours of Shanghai in the last two years,  Shanghai's Pudong development has the following advantages:    1. General advantages. "Shanghai enjoys obvious advantages  in talent, technology, and management over extensive areas,"  "Shanghai people are smart and have good quality," and "the  popular sentiment in Shanghai is amenable, which is an infinite  force."    2. Starting from a high level. In February 1991 Comrade  Xiaoping pointed out when touring Shanghai: "Pudong development  starts off later than Shenzhen, but from a higher level. I  think it can catch up with and overtake Shenzhen."    3. A broad influence and great significance. In 1991,  Comrade Xiaoping said: "That year the four special economic  zones were chosen mainly out of consideration of geographical  conditions. Shenzhen borders Hong Kong; Zhuhai is near Macao;  Shantou because there is a large Chaozhou population in  Southeast Asian countries; and Xiamen because there are many  Minnan [southern Fujian] people doing business overseas. But we  never thought of the talent advantage of Shanghai." "I wish  that Pudong had been developed a few years earlier, like  Shenzhen. As for the Pudong development, it is a project with  wide influence. More than Pudong is involved here. The whole  Shanghai development is at stake. It is nothing less than  developing the Chang Jiang Delta and the entire river region  through this base in Shanghai. Get a grip on Pudong and stick  to it until it is completed."    Summing up the above, Comrade Xiaoping displayed the  farsightedness and insight that befits a great historic figure  in choosing Pudong of Shanghai as the spearhead for expanding  opening up in the 1990's. Shanghai was formerly a financial and  trade center and a key port on the western Pacific coast, and  still enjoys advantages in talent, technology, and management.  Every condition exist for restoring Shanghai to a modern  international city through opening up and developing Pudong,  which incidentally will give us experience in experiments in  integrated reforms in finance, securities, trade, commerce, and  information. It was a brilliant move by Comrade Xiaoping, the  party Central Committee, and the State Council.  <H3>  2. Comrade Xiaoping's Strategy for Opening Up and Developing  Pudong and the Pursuit of the Pudong Development </H3>   The fact that the Pudong development contains new elements  in  the stage of reform in which it finds itself, location, and  industry determines that any development strategy for the  project will have to break new ground. The New District of  Pudong has upheld the "three orientations" and laid down the new  strategy of "three priorities." The high level from which  Pudong development starts can be seen in the "three priorities"  strategies revolving around "orienting to the world, orienting  to the future, and orienting to modernity"; and the "three  priorities" flew from Comrade Xiaoping's strategic thought.    1. Priority for finance and trading. When being  briefed by Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji on the Pudong development  in Shanghai in February 1991, Comrade Xiaoping made some  incisive statements on New Pudong District's "giving priority to  financial policy": "Finance is very important and is the core  of modern economies. With finance in good order, it will be  like a decisive move that energizes a whole game of chess.  Shanghai used to be a financial center and a place of free  currency exchange. It should be the same from now on. China is  relying on Shanghai to gain a foothold in international finance."    With profound thoughts characteristic of a great historic  figure, Comrade Xiaoping spelled out in short statements what  was significant at four different levels: First, he clarified  the essential position of finance in a national economy; second,  he pointed out the method for developing the economy, that is,  focusing effort on financial reforms and development; third, he  named the key to becoming an international financial center,  that is, an international financial center must be a place of  free currency exchange; and fourth, he hoped that Shanghai would  do things according to international conventions and become a  financial center as quickly as possible.    The policy of prioritizing finance has paved the way for  foreign investment and led to flourishing finance, commerce, and  trade in the New District of Pudong. In banking, the last three  years saw the establishment of 38 new Sino-foreign financial  institutions on both shores of the Pu Jiang. Banks in the new  district boast 25 billion yuan in savings balances and 24  billion in loan balances, 12 times the balances in 1990. The  securities trading network in the new district is continuously  expanding, with considerable growth in trading amounts. In the  financial and insurance industries, total insurance in the new  district amounts to 120 billion yuan, a fourteenfold net  increase from 1990. Rapid development in the banking industry  has promoted rapid growth in various trades and industries in  the new district. In commerce, a 600,000-square-meter modern  shopping mall complex is under construction, a number of these  malls, covering an area of over 100,000 square meters, being  supermarkets financed by Sino-foreign investment. Once built,  these commercial buildings will be the country's largest  shopping malls. The last three years saw the opening of an  additional 25,000 industrial and commercial enterprises in the  New District of Pudong, and this has created a climate of all  businesses converging on the district.    2. Priority for infrastructural projects.  Comrade Xiaoping said on a tour of the Nanpu Bridge project:  Shanghai is so big. We must build a couple of big bridges. He  stressed more than once the urgency of expediting energy,  transport, and other key projects: "Launch whichever projects  can be launched first; and they should command all the necessary  funds. Launching a project a year earlier means reaping profits  a year earlier; a delay may well stretch into the next century."    To improve its tangible investment environment, Shanghai  Municipality plans to spend 15 billion yuan in the Eighth  Five-Year Plan on the 10 great projects in the new district. At  present, the construction of Nanpu and Yangbu Bridges, the  Pudong section of the Yanggaolu inner ring, Waigaoqiao Port  district, Pudong Coal Plant, and Heliu sewage plant has been  completed, while Lingqiao Water Works and Waigaoqiao Power Plant  are under construction. Shanghai people took three years to  complete the infrastructural investment project scheduled for  five years. To establish the framework of a large modern city  as early as possible, the New District of Pudong is pressing  ahead with the planning work for Pudong International Airport,  the outer ring, Phase II of the electric power plan and the  port, Pudong subway, the tunnel line connection, trunk  communication lines, and other key projects. These urban  projects will go into construction over the next few years and  will lay a solid foundation for Pudong to develop into a modern  multifunctional city with a rational urban layout, an advanced  communication network, a convenient and easy telecommunications  system, and a good ecological environment.    3. Priority for high- and new-technology  industries. "Science and technology is the primary  productive force" is the scientific characterization by Comrade  Xiaoping of modern economic development. In one of his southern  inspection tour addresses, Comrade Xiaoping stressed: "Faster  economic development has to rely on science, technology, and  education. One high-tech breakthrough can trigger development  in a whole group of industries." "China must also gain a place  in the international high-tech world."    Over the last three years, the New District of Pudong  focused  its eyes on absorbing domestic and foreign investment, gradually  raising the technological input of the investment projects. A  group of noted multinational corporations has transferred world  advanced technologies to the New District of Pudong, such as the  sophisticated chemical works from Dupont of the United States,  Rothmaunds' autometers, programed switchboards from Bell of  Belgium, Japan's JVC electronic products, and so on. Zhangjiang  High- Technology Zone started operation earlier than planned and  13 high- tech projects have moved into the zone, such as  computer software, magnetic tubes for microwave ovens,  integrated circuits, and so on. Some 300 scientific and  technological groups comprising research institutes and  institutes of higher learning have moved into Pudong.    In the last three years, Pudong development's "three  priorities" strategy has, through "mutual east-west  interaction," created a favorable impact on invigorating  Shanghai and serving the whole country.  <H3>  3. Comrade Xiaoping's Developmental View on Opening Up and  Development and the New Takeoff of the Pudong Economy </H3>   Following Comrade Xiaoping's southern inspection tour  addresses, the New District of Pudong rapidly opened up both to  the rest of the country and to the outside world, and China's  reform and opening up entered a new stage. Comrade Xiaoping's  keynote addresses are very rich in content and shot through with  one theme: "Development is the last word [fa zhan cai shi ying  dao li 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 3810]."    Economic development is the ultimate element and form of  expression for international competition. Development is also a  main theme for China, and in the 1990's the key to survival for  a people. Therefore, Comrade Xiaoping demanded that we "seize  the opportunity and develop ourselves, and the key is developing  the economy."    Comrade Xiaoping stressed: "Low speed is tantamount to  halting, even sliding backward." He also pointed out:  "Shanghai is our ace. Getting Shanghai off the ground is a  shortcut." "Shanghai has every condition to progress faster."  In early 1992, Comrade Xiaoping cautioned us: Pudong  development can move ahead and can not go back. At the present  rate, by 1995 Pudong should see some great changes, which means  I may still live to see it. All these instructions by Comrade  Xiaoping pointed out that development must break out of  equilibrium and create some momentum.    Aimed at Shanghai's practical situation, Comrade Xiaoping  specifically stressed: "I hope that Shanghai people will  emancipate the mind more, be bolder, and take greater steps,"  pointing out: Some people worry Pudong might have trouble. I do  not think it will. Even those who worry cannot name the trouble.    Comrade Xiaoping made known his earnest hope for Pudong  development in Shanghai in February 1992: "It can learn from  the Shenzhen, Guangdong experience. Do a better job in Pudong,  build it higher and make it more modernized." In Shanghai on  New Year's Eve, 1993, Comrade Xiaoping again advised: "Make  more effort this year, ride on the crest, plant the feet firmly  on the ground, overcome difficulties, and move up to a higher  level."    The greatness of a distinguished revolutionary lies in the  fact that his strategic decisions will inevitably be transformed  into all-embracing social practice. Comrade Xiaoping's remarks  egg us on and make Shanghai increase the pace of opening up and  developing Pudong and initiate comprehensive construction, which  promotes the rapid development of Pudong's economic functions.    Domestic- and foreign-funded projects increased  considerably. Before 1990, there were only 37  "foreign-funded" enterprises in Pudong; now there are over 1,700  foreign-invested enterprises setting up their bases in Pudong.  Total investment from these foreign-funded enterprises amounts  to some $5 billion, while the absorption of foreign capital  amounts to $3 billion. Foreign- capital projects are  characterized by large scale and high economic efficiency,  technological inputs, and success rates; and many of them are  multinational companies or corporations. Over 2,500 enterprises  from the other Chinese provinces, cities, and central ministries  have invested in Pudong a total of some 14 billion yuan.    Develop subdistricts, take note of strengthening  functions. By the end of this century, the New District of  Pudong will have built four key subdistricts, of which the  central portion of the Lujiazui Financial Trade Zone has drawn  up a blueprint of first-rate world standards; and over 50  financial and commercial trade buildings are being constructed,  with another 50 in the planning stage. The total construction  area of the central portion is 4.1 million square meters and  will, with Shanghai Waitan, make up China's CBD [preceding  initials published in Roman alphabet] (central business  district). The Jinqiaokou Export Processing Zone is  constructing an all-purpose export processing base in pursuit of  its targets of good economic efficiency, high-grade products,  and an export-weighted structure, has signed contracts on 200  domestic and foreign-funded projects, and has embarked as  planned on the construction of over 100 projects; and 30  projects have been completed and are in production. Waigaoqiao  Bonded Area is taking advantage of the "domestic customs-free  [jing nei guan wai 1064 0355 7070 1120]" situation to pursue  vigorously international trade, bonded markets, and off-shore  financial services; and over 1,000 domestic and foreign  companies have moved into the area. With the operation of  Xingan District, the area will become a genuine free-trade area.  Zhangjiang High-Tech Garden will integrate scientific research,  production, and services in a vigorous bid to develop high-tech  industry and establish a new economic growth base. The pursuit  of the above key subdistricts will lay a foundation for the  emergence of an all-purpose modernized metropolitan pattern in  Pudong.    Vibrant social and economic development. The 1993  GDP is expected to top 16 billion yuan, more than double the  1990 GDP, fulfilling Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee's target  of doubling the GDP in three years' time promised to Comrade  Xiaoping in 1991. By the end of this century, the New District  of Pudong is expected to have raised 200 billion yuan through  the absorption of foreign capital, joint domestic funds, bank  financing, funds raised through securities, land rents, mutual  funds operations, "BOT [preceding term published in Roman  alphabet; expansion unknown]" mode, and financial inputs, to  finance various projects in the new district, of which 40  percent will go to infrastructure, 30 percent to modern  high-tech industry, and the remaining 30 percent into tertiary  industry. By then, the GDP of the New District of Pudong is  expected to top 80 billion yuan, achieving the target of  increasing its GDP by seven times, and by then its economic  power will account for one-fourth of Shanghai's economy, as  against one-fourteenth in 1990. Meanwhile, the new district is  stepping up efforts to establish a coordinated education system  featuring universities, special institutes of higher learning,  technical colleges, and basic education; to build a group of  high-end medical, cultural, and sport facilities; and to develop  the New District of Pudong into a first- rate commercial center  with a first-rate urban infrastructure, a first-rate all-purpose  free-trade zone, an export and processing base, a suburban  agricultural zone, and a high-quality residential area in  Shanghai.  <H3>  4. The Future Scenario Charted by Comrade Xiaoping for  Pudong's Opening Up and Development and for the Effort To  "Spearhead" Shanghai's Pursuit of "Three Centers" With the  Pudong Development </H3>   Comrade Xiaoping stressed repeatedly: "We have to create a  few more Hong Kongs in the mainland." This is one key element  in Comrade Xiaoping's opening up and development strategy. It  is not aimed at creating a Hong Kong-style social system, though  it does mean that to achieve the targets of our development  strategy, we have to be more open and, where conditions permit,  learn from Hong Kong's experience and allow an international  financial, trading, and economic center to play its role.    The 14th party congress report points out: With the Pudong  development as the vanguard, further develop cities along the  Chang Jiang, and as quickly as possible develop Shanghai into  one of the international economic, financial, and trading  centers, with which to trigger off an economic takeoff in the  Chang Jiang Delta and the entire river region. This is the  demand and target set by the party for the Pudong development in  realizing the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's addresses.    The conditions and potential for Shanghai to become a  financial center. A financial center only emerges when  there is a concentration of the headquarters or branches of  international banks in a place which is, moreover, nourished by  securities capital, foreign exchange, and gold markets. As the  Pudong development unfolds, there are now over 50 banks'  headquarters and branches and financial companies in Shanghai,  all as legal entities, and over 80 offices of foreign-capital  banks. In the next few years, both shores of the Pu Jiang are  likely to add and capable of adding another 10 or more Chinese-  and foreign-capital commercial banks or financial companies. In  this way, by the end of this century, when Shanghai will have  150 or more financial institutions, Shanghai will -- with the  addition of a few other financial operations -- have every good  condition to become a financial center. At present, various  types of financial markets have started business and are moving  rapidly forward in Shanghai.    1. Rapid development in securities markets. The  capital trading volume of Shanghai Securities Exchange in 1992  was 76 billion yuan, but in 1993 it is expected to have topped  400 billion yuan. The exchange now has over 400 members and  over 1,200 seats. Operations at the exchange are increasingly  standardized.    2. A capital market taking shape. Capital  discount volume jumped from 10 billion yuan in 1990 to 160  billion yuan in 1992 -- proving that it is entirely possible for  Shanghai to become a regional capital center, playing a leading  role in financing, and helping form a monetary market in  Shanghai.    3. Prospects for expanding the foreign exchange  market. Last year 3.7 billion yuan changed hands in the  Shanghai foreign exchange swap center. The next step should be  slowly turning the swap center into a national foreign exchange  trading market, with slow expansion in trading volume, the  participation of enterprises of multiple forms of ownership and  individuals in foreign exchange swapping, a greater variety of  currencies traded, a widening range of discount transactions  between foreign-exchange dealers, and development in  foreign-exchange futures. Meanwhile, the "domestic  customs-free" situation enjoyed by Waigaoqiao Bonded Area should  be exploited to help launch cross-strait financial services.    4. Enormous potential in the gold market.  Shanghai has a large and reputable gold jewelry market, which  can serve as a base for the formation of a gold market,  extending gold investment channels, creating intermediate  agencies for the gold trade, and introducing spot gold and gold  futures, gold certificates and accounts, and other investment  and trading forms, eventually leading to a centralized gold  market in conjunction with the international gold market and  participating in its competition.    Conditions and potential for Shanghai to become a trade  center. An international trade center owes its existence  to the convergence of Chinese and foreign mercantile and trading  houses onto a place serving cargo transhipment and domestic and  foreign trading. The policy of opening up and developing Pudong  provides excellent conditions for Shanghai to become a trade  center.    1. Make the effort of developing and expanding futures  trading a springboard for turning Shanghai into a trading and  circulating center of domestic and international capital goods  and bulk cargoes. Already in operation are metal, coal,  petroleum, cotton, chemical, grain, and various other futures  markets, the total trading volume of which for this year is  expected to top 300 billion yuan and possibly over 1 trillion by  1995, when they will have become China's largest futures markets.    2. Give play to the role of big ports, create  conditions in the New District of Pudong for setting up  foreign-trade trading companies; establish foreign-trade holding  companies; experiment in pilot joint-investment, joint-venture  commercial wholesaling business; and implement the new  district's preferential policies for foreign trading in order to  attract more international multinational [as published]  corporations and noted trading houses to set up bases in  Pudong. Meanwhile, actively explore ways to enhance the  role of Waigaoqiao Bonded Area; build China's largest free-trade  zone where things are done in conformity with international  conventions; work hard to increase the proportion of Shanghai's  entrepot trade in total trading volume from the present 30  percent to over 70 percent by the year 2000; and create a  climate such that businesses all converge on Pudong through the  operation of the large Pudong port, with which to stimulate a  vibrant growth in Shanghai's domestic and foreign trade.    3. Attract domestic and foreign capital; set up a group  of super-wholesaling markets, supermarkets, chain shops, and  24-hour- operation commercial networks to facilitate great flows  of international goods in and out of Pudong, Shanghai.    Shanghai's conditions and potential to become an  economic center. The formation of an economic bloc relies  on a great modern industrial underpinning, takes large-sized  multinational corporations and business conglomerates as the  main force, and aims at the aggregate economic turnover and  combined economic indicators of an international city. Shanghai  has been making rapid progress in this direction in recent years/    First, direct the effort to speed up the development of  Pudong Jinqiao Export and Processing Zone and Zhangjiang  High-Technology Garden, and develop Minxing Industrial  Development Zone and Caohejing High-Technology Development Zone  in Puxi; and introduce with selective emphases new industries  characterized by large size, high efficiency, and a strong,  fanning-out impact on other industries, which will create the  necessary momentum for the emergence of a group of modern  industries that typify the functions, status, and role of a  mega-economic center city.    Second, exploiting the advantage of capital movements on  Shanghai's finance and securities markets and Pudong's  pathbreaking attempt to link itself up with international  markets, we may establish a group of joint-stock,  cross-regional, and industrially integrated business  conglomerates at an optimal level of composition and resource  allocation to boost competitiveness in international markets.    Third, strengthen the reform effort in the operation and  management of state-owned assets in Shanghai and the New  District of Pudong; quicken the flow of state-owned assets; and  build dozens, even hundreds, of multinational and joint-stock  corporations in Shanghai and Pudong to turn these two areas into  financial command centers of multinational and joint-stock  corporations.    Through the study of Comrade Xiaoping's thought on opening  up  and developing and the practice of the Pudong development, we  have come to appreciate the arduousness and role of the Pudong  development and Shanghai's reinvigoration. We firmly believe  that, guided by the line of Comrade Xiaoping's reform and  opening up thought, supported by the central authorities, and  through ceaseless struggle, Shanghai will be able to take  advantage of the time, geographical location, and personnel  harmony and complete this great task. The party's "grand  objective of "one spearhead, three centers" will become a  reality with the arrival of the new century.</p>

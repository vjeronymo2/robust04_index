			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Provincial Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] It has been learned from the 27 May press briefing  jointly sponsored by the Commission on Politics and Law and the  propaganda department of the provincial CPC committee that Anhui  has scored marked interim progress in its crackdown on crime  over the past month. The number of criminal cases has dropped  significantly throughout Anhui, and the increase in major crimes  was halted. The crackdown is now developing both in breadth and  depth.    After the provincial CPC committee and government announced  the crackdown in a telephone conference on 25 April, the  provincial judicial and public security departments and the  prefectures and cities took immediate action by instituting a  system of leadership responsibility and setting up crackdown  offices. Principal leaders took upon themselves the  responsibility of implementing the crackdown. Pursuant with the  provincial plan and in light of their respective public security  conditions, the various prefectures and cities set the tasks,  objectives, target areas, and prime targets of the crackdown  and formulated general requirements and methods and steps for  implementing the crackdown. Moreover, they also utilized mass  media and other propaganda tools to build up the momentum and  offered support in terms of financial and material resources.    As of 25 May, the province had cracked over 5,000 criminal  cases, of which 1,400 were major ones. A total of 875 criminals  gangs were crushed and 4,100 gang members were pacified. Over  12,000 criminal offenders of every description were arrested, of  which 1,500 were escaped criminals and convicts. Stolen money  or goods worth 15 million yuan and over 1,000 firearms were  seized.    At present, the prefectures and cities have entered the  phase  of punishing and processing the criminals.

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL ENFORCES OUSTER OF ARAB WORKERS  </P> <P> Israel on Tuesday implemented its order sending Palestinian workers from the  Gaza Strip back home as Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin took a hard-line in  explaining the action. An indefinite curfew in the strip, confining its 600,000  residents to their homes, continued.  </P> <P> The moves came as Israeli officials were warning that matters could get worse  for the Arabs if they do not accept the government's peace proposal.  </P> <P> Rabin said the restrictions on the thousands of Gaza Strip workers employed in  Israel -- the first such action since the intifada began -- are meant to show  "that the privilege of free travel and work in Israel cannot be taken for  granted."  </P> <P> Witnesses said that hundreds of Arabs were detained by soldiers on the main  roads leading into the Gaza Strip. Police officers were checking identification  cards of Palestinians in Jerusalem.  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank work at  mostly menial jobs in Israel. Workers from the West Bank were still being  allowed to report to their employers, although similar action was being  considered.  </P> <P> Rabin, in remarks made to Israeli army radio, said the Palestinians "will  understand that they have only one alternative to proceed to peace, and that is  on the basis of the government initiative."  </P> <P> "There is not and there will not be," Rabin said, "another alternative for  diplomatic procedures related to the Palestinians which is not based on the  government initiative."  </P> <P> Deputy Foreign Minister Binyamin Netanyahu warned that "if Israel wants to put  the screws to the Palestinians, the situation . . . could be quite different."  </P> <P> The Israeli peace plan proposes elections to select a Palestinian delegation  that would work out details of a five-year period of autonomy, under Israeli  rule, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Within three years,  talks would open on the permanent status of the territories.  </P> <P> Leading Palestinian activists view the measure as a devious means of bringing  an end to the uprising and prolonging Israeli rule in the occupied territories.  The Palestinians are demanding that Israel concede to independence for the West  Bank and Gaza.  </P> <P> There have been calls to bar the Gaza Strip workers from crossing into Israel  since the recent discovery of the body of a soldier who had been picked up as a  hitchhiker, presumably by Arabs. The Israeli government had resisted such  calls, expressing a desire to restore normal life in the occupied territories,  including the continuation of the flow of labor into Israel.  </P> <P> In another development Tuesday, the Israeli police arrested a Palestinian  activist who was scheduled to attend a meeting with a high-level delegation  from the U.S. State Department. The delegation is headed by Dennis Ross, the  director of policy planning, who is considered a key adviser on Middle East  affairs.  </P> <P> The activist, Hassan Khatib, a member of the Palestinian Communist Party, was  picked up at his home in the West Bank town of Ramallah at 2 a.m. The Communist  Party is one of four factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization active  in the territories.  </P> <P> Khatib had recently signed a letter addressed to the U.S. Consulate rejecting  the Israeli election plan. Israeli officials would not give a reason for his  arrest.  </P> <P> Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, the head of a Palestinian research institute in Jerusalem,  said: "The Israelis are clearly sending us a message. They want to force us to  accept the plan."  </P> <P> Ross met with five other Palestinians known to favor the PLO. The Palestinians  gave Ross a statement repeating their rejection of the Israeli election plan as  a public relations ploy. Later in the day, the U.S. representative met with  Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. After the meeting, Ross was positive in tone.  "We find the discussions encouraging. They give us reason to believe there is a  potential opportunity to build on. . . ."  </P></p>

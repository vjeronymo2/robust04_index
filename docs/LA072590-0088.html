			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS USE HANDS-ON APPROACH IN UCLA PROGRAM ON RECYCLING  </P> <P> Digging through household trash is usually the province of cheap private eyes  and tabloid reporters.  </P> <P> But for 70 UCLA Extension students, it's a summer job unlike any other.  </P> <P> The students for the last three weeks have been pawing through truckloads of  garbage -- in 90-degree-plus heat, for no pay -- at the Azusa Land Reclamation  Co. dump.  </P> <P> Wearing protective jumpsuits, face masks and double layers of gloves, the  students are working to answer a question of increasing importance to  California cities:  </P> <P> What exactly is in all those garbage bags?  </P> <P> The students are enrolled in UCLA's Extension Program in municipal solid waste  management, a first of its kind project to train people to start city recycling  programs.  </P> <P> The students are sorting, weighing and recording the makeup of residential  waste samples. By figuring out what goes into the city's garbage stream, they  will better know how to get recyclable materials out, program director Eugene  Tseng said.  </P> <P> When they finish with the residential waste, students will attack truckloads of  commercial and industrial garbage to get an overall city "waste  characterization." In all, they will sort through three tons of garbage.  Project planners expect to be done by December.  </P> <P> Most participants in the extension program are local waste management industry  workers.  </P> <P> "It's very wacky, but it's for a good cause. People are very wasteful and  recycling is something we're going to have to do. It's great, I love trash,"  said Cristin Brame, 22, a landfill employee enrolled in the course.  </P> <P> Boxing Cheng, of the People's Republic of China, is director of solid waste  research at the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences. Cheng said  he will take the technical and practical information he gets from the program  back to China to deal with his country's garbage dilemma.  </P> <P> "We have no landfills now, so you can imagine how serious a problem it is," he  said.  </P> <P> California is facing a shortage of landfill space. Gov. George Deukmejian  signed a law last September requiring cities to cut their landfill-bound waste  by 25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000.  </P> <P> To accomplish this, cities will have to establish municipal recycling programs,  but there is a "critical shortfall of qualified, trained people in the field"  to help them, Tseng said. The UCLA program will help provide the needed people,  he said.  </P> <P> Because of the classroom the dump provides, Azusa will get a tailor-made design  for its recycling program. But "other cities are just kind of wondering how  they're going to do it," said Ann Baba, project manager for the UCLA-Azusa  study.  </P> <P> Azusa currently has no municipal recycling program.  </P></p>

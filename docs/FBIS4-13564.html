			<p>BFN     [Text] The cabinet today approved the appointment of  Commander Asaf Hefetz as Israel Police Commissioner, to replace  Commissioner Rafi Peled. He will assume duty on 1 May and serve  a three-year term. Commander Yehuda Wilk, commander of the  Jerusalem District Police, announced that he is resigning the  force. Speaking to our correspondent earlier today, Commander  Wilk said he cannot cooperate with the new police commissioner  because their methods of operation are different. Police  Minister Shahal told reporters that a very small police officers  reshuffle is now expected.</p>

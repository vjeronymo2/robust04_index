			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Strike call at Bank of France UNIONS representing most of the Bank of France's 17,189 employees have called a one-day strike next Tuesday. It is in support of demands for guarantees that the central bank's activities not be cut back once it gets autonomy in monetary policy-making. The unions said they had nothing against Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the bank's governor, who fought off Treasury pressure for for commercial bank regulation to be transferred from the central bank to a new body. But, a union spokeswoman said, 'we only have oral assurances (about maintaining the scope of the bank's activities) from the governor, who himself only has oral assurances from the government and the Treasury'. Amendments to the government's draft bill to make the bank independent in setting monetary policy - as eventually required by the Maastricht treaty - have been proposed by the unions. They are intended to bolster the central bank's monopoly in printing the nation's money, lay down that one of the two deputy governors be chosen from within the staff, and endorse its role in keeping financial data on all French companies.</p>

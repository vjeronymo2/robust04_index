			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (13): The multiples take a tumble - Chinese shares in Hong Kong When Qingling Motors, a light duty truck maker, was listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange last month, it set a new pricing low for H shares, the China enterprises listed in the colony. The HKDollars 2.07 price tag put the shares on a price-earnings ratio of nine times 1994 earnings - a far cry from the 17.89 multiple commanded by Tsingtao Brewery, the pioneering H share which came to market a year and a month before Qingling. Slashed p/e multiples are a function of three broad changes to and in the embryonic market: a downturn in general market conditions across the globe; growing choice in the H share market; and enhanced sophistication among the former state owned enterprises themselves, which has led to what bankers dub 'more realistic' pricing. While the move towards more aggressive pricing has prevented a mass shelving of listings during the lull in market sentiment that has marked trading activity since the beginning of the year, it has not been without its casualties. The listing of putative H share Shanghai Haixing Shipping Company has been put on the back burner after directors and sponsors fell out over pricing: it is understood the company, whose listing was to have pre-empted that of Qingling, could not bring itself to accept a single-digit p/e. Peregrine Capital, the Hong Kong merchant bank which played a leading role in 15 fund-raising transactions in Hong Kong and three in China in the first half of the year, involving total funds of HKDollars 8.9bn, admitted at the time of its interim results earlier this month that a number of big mandates had been shelved 'until market conditions improve'. However, Mr Alex Ko, a director of the company, believes interest in China companies has persisted during the downturn even though the responses to listings have not been as consistently overwhelming as last year. He attributes this to more selective investors who are looking more closely at the structure of the company on offer and the merits yielded by it and the industry sector in which it operates. 'Pricing is subject to market conditions. With a good market and good company you can get a high price. But if the market is down and selling on a p/e of 10 times and you are raising capital at 12 or 15 times, of course the market will have less interest in the company. 'Proper pricing of initial public offerings depends very much on several factors: prospects of the company, management, industry sector, general market conditions and sentiment and even political stability,' he says. All H shares to date have been fully subscribed - if only by a whisper, as in the case of Tianjin Bohai Chemical - but some of this year's offerings have performed poorly on their debut. Luoyang Float Glass, which kicked off the 1994 batch of H shares on July 8, saw its share price slide 20 per cent to HKDollars 3.65 on the first day of trading. For the companies which went to New York - of which Shandong Huaneng Power Company is the pioneering example of a Chinese company selected by the mainland authorities to opt for a single listing (as opposed to a dual or secondary listing) - performances have been even worse. Trading volumes are very thin - Shanghai Petrochemical, which is traded in both New York and Hong Kong, sees the bulk of activity in the colony. Mr Andrew Liu, managing director at Morgan Stanley Asia - sponsor of the impending China Eastern Airlines issue on Wall Street - says that while shares have been placed on a global basis for a number of issues, the trading patterns invariably show that the dominant activity takes place in Hong Kong. 'I think that is probably the most significant point we have observed in the past year: the natural trading market for all these China companies is going to be Hong Kong or China,' he says. This pattern has prompted the Chinese government to push for dual listings to twin New York with active 'home' markets, where interest, news and analyst research helps galvanise trading momentum. Certain mechanical problems - not least the disparity between listing requirements and procedures on the two exchanges - mean that dual listings are unlikely to be offered to all the remaining New York-bound China companies, although Morgan Stanley reckons those that are tided over until next year will have a stronger chance to benefit. The Chinese government has been playing a pro-active role in the securities markets all round. In recent months the focus has been on the domestic markets, which have since provided a total turnabout in fortunes for investors who were previously faced with falling prices, tight liquidity and poor sentiment. The government announced plans to list USDollars 1bn worth of B shares - stock designated for foreigners, but which will now be available to mainlanders too - this year, in effect trebling the size of the market.</p>

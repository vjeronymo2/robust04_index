			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MAINLY MOZART FESTIVAL A MOSTLY ORDINARY EVENT  </P> <P> David Atherton wrapped up his Westgate Mainly Mozart Festival in style Sunday  night. A strong all-Mozart program, lively performances from the players, and a  full house in Davies Festival Theatre provided ample reasons for the British  maestro's air of self-assurance and confidence on the podium.  </P> <P> In this farewell program, two of the festival orchestra members favored the  audience with solo turns. Concertmaster William Preucil's performance as  soloist in Mozart's "Turkish" Violin Concerto was conventional and rather  small-scaled, although it was still polished and brimming with conviction. His  sweet, agile sound flourished in the intimate middle movement, where he ably  captured the composer's transcendental introspection.  </P> <P> Although flutist Jean Larson's solo was limited to the single movement "Andante  for Flute and Orchestra," K. 315, she made the most of her opportunity. Her  playing Sunday confirmed the favorable impression she made in a festival  chamber concert last week: the silver-toned Texas flutist can spin out a  sinuous melody with grace, charm, and apparent nonchalance.  </P> <P> Perhaps to demonstrate Mozart's development as a symphonist, Atherton commenced  his program with the composer's First Symphony, K. 16 (written when he was 8  years old), and concluded with his penultimate Symphony No. 40 in G Minor, K.  550. Even though this First Symphony is little more than a curiosity, the  conductor took pains to make the most of it, demanding precise articulations  and assiduous adherence to its naive, rococo contrasts.  </P> <P> If only Atherton had delved as deeply and patiently into the great G Minor  Symphony. He took an aggressive stance, demanding a Beethoven-like grandeur  rather than cultivating the undercurrent of turbulence that propels this  complex, late Mozart work. He was satisfied with high energy and tight  discipline, but there was little poetry beneath all of that brio. And, although  this approach may have generated a few more decibels for the unsympathetic  acoustics of the open-air theater, it brought out an unflattering, hard-edged  timbre in the strings.  </P> <P> This reviewer's evaluation of the festival's inaugural season remains  equivocal. While it was well-organized and well-attended, its musical  achievements were embarrassingly modest. If the level of performance never sank  below professional respectability, it rarely soared or strayed from the norms  of traditional Mozart interpretation.  </P> <P> The La Jolla Chamber Music Society's annual SummerFest, to cite the record of  another well-run festival, has provided the crucible for some spine-tingling  performances and daring interpretations of major works of the repertory.  </P> <P> In terms of repertory, Atherton's choices cry out for improvement, especially  if the festival is to continue next year. The festival's title may have been  "Mainly Mozart," but the rest of the repertory was surprisingly miscellaneous.  Although Atherton's programming did not stray beyond the Classical period --  creative choices might have juxtaposed neo-Classical 20th-Century works -- not  a single major work by Beethoven or Haydn complemented the Mozart repertory.  </P></p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Rose blooms in Bosnian sunlight: The contrasting roles of the UN commander and Lord Owen Is that Rose? But he looks so young]' The Bosnian woman's admiration was shared by the soldiers on to whose armoured personnel carrier General Sir Michael Rose had just made a spectacular leap. The general, who three days earlier had called Nato into its first action against ground targets, has become as popular with many Bosnian Moslems as Lord Owen, who followed him out of his Sarajevo headquarters, is unpopular. Indeed, the news of Lord Owen's arrival in Sarajevo on Wednesday morning had been greeted with derision and dismay by Bosnian officials. They thought that Lord Owen had been consigned to the dustbin of history two months ago, at the time of the Nato ultimatum. Yet now, in the very week when Nato aircraft had struck twice at Serb positions around the besieged enclave of Gorazde, the EU mediator was back, accompanied by his silent UN sidekick Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg. Lord Owen had, of course, merely stepped to the wings for these past two months. It is true that since February little had been heard of the international conference on former Yugoslavia (ICFY), of which he and Mr Stoltenberg are co-chairmen. But Lord Owen has visibly enjoyed being back in a media spotlight which during the past two months had deserted him in favour of Mr Charles Redman and Mr Vitaly Churkin, the US and Russian special envoys, and General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia. But, says Lord Owen, the ICFY has never ceased to exist; all the negotiations that have been going on are technically under its aegis. He had always argued that the peace process could only make headway if governments, especially the US and Russian governments, involved themselves in it. That they have now done so he regards as a boost rather than a setback to ICFY's work. Meanwhile, Lord Owen has not been idle. In particular, he has kept in close touch with Serbia's president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic. Both Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs clearly see Lord Owen as more sympathetic to their interests, or at least understanding of their concerns, than other western negotiators. They see his reappearance on the scene as a sign that their tactics are succeeding. Clearly the Serbs were not pleased with the turn of events in Bosnia since the Nato ultimatum in February. True, their compliance with the ultimatum was made less humiliating by the simultaneous arrival of Russian troops in Sarajevo; and the terms of the ceasefire in Sarajevo were not unfavourable to Serb interests, as it has tended to consolidate Serb control of the suburbs and environs of the city. But Russia's failure to protest when Nato shot down four Serb aircraft for violating the no-fly zone on February 28, followed the next day by the US-brokered Moslem-Croat agreement, must have been a blow to the Serbs. For most of the past year Serbs and Croats had been co-operating against the Moslems in central Bosnia. Now the Croats, though not actively fighting on the Moslem side, have become benevolent neutrals. Supplies of all sorts can now reach the Moslems much more easily from the coast, and the Bosnian army no longer has to fight two enemies at once. This has enabled the Bosnian army to make small but significant gains in north-central Bosnia at the Serbs' expense, notably around Maglaj, which 'ceased to be an enclave and is now a finger, indeed a swollen finger', in the words of the UN special representative, Mr Yasushi Akashi. Meanwhile the UN protection force (Unprofor), under Gen Rose's charismatic leadership, has been interpreting its mandate in a more robust and muscular way which the Serbs do not like. Although Gen Rose was not directly involved in Nato's February ultimatum, he used it skilfully to increase his own authority  - warning the Serbs that it was in their interest to co-operate with him if they wished to avoid a direct confrontation with Nato. Indeed during March the Bosnian Serbs were on the whole co-operative and appeared genuinely anxious to avoid such a confrontation. But they may simply have been postponing a showdown until they were ready for a spring offensive in the area of greatest strategic concern to them: the largest remaining Moslem enclave in the east of the country, which was also the only one still effectively defended by government forces and from which the Moslems were capable of harassing Serb communications between eastern and southern Bosnia. The Serbs have successfully kept westerners guessing about their decision-making processes. Some western observers believe there are serious divisions either between the political and military leaders among the Bosnian Serbs, or between the Bosnian Serb leadership as a whole and Serbia proper. Others believe that Mr Milosevic keeps all the strings in his own hands, and that the Gorazde offensive could not possibly have happened without his approval if not active encouragement. If the latter school is right, it may have been connected with Mr Milosevic's concern about unrest in the Sandzak, a region shared between Serbia and Montenegro (the two partners in the Yugoslav federation). The Sandzak has a large Moslem population, some of whose leaders say openly that they would like to join Sandzak to neighbouring Bosnia. Similarly, observers disagree on whether the Serbs hoped or intended to overrun Gorazde, or merely to neutralise it, as they have done with the other eastern enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa. In the latter case, the Bosnian Serbs are now close to realising their goal, and their brinkmanship in staging a confrontation with Unprofor appears to have paid off. By calling Gen Rose's bluff and obliging him to call in Nato airpower to defend UN personnel, they have succeeded in putting him on the defensive. Last week the general was bending over backwards to avoid escalating the crisis. He stressed that he had only called in 'close air support' to defend his own men and not (as the next paragraph of the same UN Security Council resolution allowed him) to defend the 'safe area' of Gorazde itself; he pointed out that the Security Council had never defined the extent of the safe area, implying that his mandate only obliged him to defend the town itself and not the area round it; he suggested that his forces had killed more Croats and Moslems than Serbs by firing in self-defence in the course of the war; he insisted that Unprofor is a neutral peacekeeping force and 'not here to fight anybody's war'; and he even refused to display concern over the detention of UN observers in Serb-held territory (which his spokesman described as 'an administrative matter'). When reports reached Gen Rose on Thursday morning that the Serbs had begun shelling Tuzla airfield  - which is in another safe haven and has UN troops stationed on it  - it was clear that he had to weigh the pros and cons of calling for further air strikes. Happily, in that case, the shelling stopped after Nato planes had buzzed the area without dropping any bombs. Last night, however, a grimmer moment of truth arrived. The Serbs renewed their offensive in Gorazde, the Moslem defence crumbled, and the fall of the town appeared imminent. Even worse, from Gen Rose's point of view, two of his own cherished SAS soldiers, whom he put in to Gorazde two weeks ago to monitor the battle and act as forward air controllers for eventual air strikes, were seriously wounded; and a French reconnaissance plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire. How the UN and Nato would respond was still unclear last night. What did seem clear, however, was that both Gen Rose and Lord Owen had underestimated the destructive fury of the Bosnian Serbs.</p>

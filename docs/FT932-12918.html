			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Empty first class on All Nippon Airways - The response to dwindling domestic demand at the Japanese airline All Nippon Airways, Japan's largest airline and one of world's biggest, suspended for one day its first class service on its London to Tokyo flight last Sunday because there were no fee-paying first class passengers. On its Tokyo to Sydney route it has discontinued first class. And on its recently-launched Tokyo to Shanghai service it has decided to offer only business and economy class. ANA has been hit by the turmoil in the international airline market as well as at home by the downturn in the Japanese economy. 'We've seen a big decline in first and business class passengers of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent depending on specific routes,' said Mr Isao Yagi, the airline's corporate planning director. 'As a result we are thinking of discontinuing first class service on certain routes,' he added. The rationalisation of the airline's first class service is only one relatively small aspect of a broad series of measures ANA is undertaking to adapt its operations to difficult times. Although the airline remains one of the few big international carriers to remain profitable, it expects net earnings for the year ended March, 1993 to have fallen to about Y3bn (Dollars 68.5m) from Y7.6bn in 1991-92. Profits are likely to come under even greater pressure during the next two years. 'We are going to make the maximum effort to achieve another Yen 3bn profit next year but it's going to be tough,' Mr Yagi said. The airline's shareholders are expected to approve in June the appointment of Mr Seiji Fukatsu as ANA's new president and chief executive. Mr Fukatsu, head of the airline's domestic Air Nippon subsidiary, will take over from Mr Akio Kondo, who is to become vice-chairman. The new chief executive is expected to place the emphasis on rationalisation, unlike Mr Kondo, who presided over the airline's international and domestic expansion during the past 6 1/2 years. Senior ANA officials acknowledged that the costs of Japanese carriers have been too high. However, they explained it was virtually impossible even in hard times to adopt the same sweeping approach to restructuring and job cuts as airlines in other parts of the world. ANA has established a task force to study ways of improving efficiency, cutting costs while increasing revenues in the difficult climate. Senior ANA managers indicated that cost saving measures could include the hiring for the first time of lower cost foreign cabin attendants and a reduction in the traditional annual intake of new trainee recruits. It has started relocating headquarters staff to sales and marketing tasks to strengthen the airline's marketing and sales operations. 'We are also trying to contract out some of our functions and have postponed the delivery of some new aircraft on order,' Mr Yagi explained. ANA is cutting back its 1991-95 capital expenditure plan from Y1,300bn to Y1,000bn. It is resorting increasingly to leasing rather than purchasing aircraft. The airline is considering trimming its dividend. The aim of ANA officials was to improve competitiveness by reducing costs close to the level of rival US carriers. However, they conceded it would be difficult to bring Japanese costs down to those of other Asian carriers. The strategy is likely to slow down the rate of the airline's international expansion. ANA, whose operations have been centred in Japan where it has a 53 per cent share of the domestic market, started expanding into the international market in 1986. With a network covering 18 international destinations, Mr Taiji Kameyama, ANA's head of international relations, said the company's international route expansion was complete. The next step will be to increase the frequency of services on some of these routes. In the shorter term, the airline sees the biggest potential in the Asian and especially Chinese markets. The company is slowing down the expansion of its international hotel business and has suspended plans to open a hotel in London. The airline's strong presence in the domestic market has helped it weather the downturn better than Japan Airlines, its rival which relies on international services for 70 per cent of its business. But growth has slowed down in the Japanese airline market after averaging about 10 per cent a year during 1985-90. 'For the first time since 1985 we had a small decline in domestic passenger numbers in our fiscal year to March 1993,' Mr Yagi said. In spite of a 0.3 per cent fall in domestic passengers to 33.3m, these services remained profitable last year. By contrast, the international operations facing fierce fares competition lost money, although passenger numbers rose by 7 per cent to 1,574,201. ANA expects competition on international services from Japan to intensify during the next two to three years with the completion of new runways at Tokyo and Osaka offering greater access for rival international airlines to fly into the Japanese market. 'Our domestic services will continue to be in the future our core business,' Mr Yagi said.</p>

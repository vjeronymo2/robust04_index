			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: EASTERN EUROPEAN UPHEAVAL BRINGS FOCUS ON CASTRO  </P> <P> Most politically progressive journals were quick to embrace the changes  sweeping Eastern Europe in the age of glasnost and perestroika. Closer to home,  though, Cuba has proven more problematic.  </P> <P> Mother Jones may have been the first left-wing publication to suggest that  Cuban leader Fidel Castro has overstayed his political welcome. A series of  articles in the June Progressive is a bit more equivocal.  </P> <P> A piece by Saul Landau of the Institute for Policy Studies, while making valid  points about America's inadvertent complicity in forcing Castro's hand, reads  like an apologia for the dictator.  </P> <P> But William Steif's more balanced article, "Grumbling and Graffiti," points out  something often overlooked by the U.S. press: Despite his Draconian ways,  Castro still has strong support in some areas and it is bolstered each time the  United States does something, which to Cubans, smacks of "Yanqui imperialism"  -- such as last year's invasion of Panama.  </P> <P> As one pro-Castro demonstrator told Steif, "The Yanquis don't approach us as  peers, don't approach us as gentlemen."  </P> <P> Other Cubans, he reports, worry about right-wing exiles in Florida, who openly  plan to go back when Castro dies or is deposed to reclaim property that Castro  nationalized. Those holdings would include "dozens of dilapidated mansions in  the once-upscale Miramar district," Steif writes, adding, "The hundreds of  families who live crowded in those mansions and hang their laundry to dry from  the mansion windows are offended by the idea of the rich returning there."  </P> <P> </P> <P> REQUIRED READING  </P> <P> * At least since Paradise Lost, bad guys have explained their evil deeds by  saying "The devil made me do it." Lately, though, some cops also have been laid  blame for certain crimes on Lucifer. The Spring issue of The Skeptical Inquirer  investigates investigators of alleged Satanic cults and finds that most of  these self-styled experts -- popular speakers on the law enforcement conference  circuit these days -- often depend more on fundamentalist Christian dogma and  newspaper clippings than rational detective work. A second piece tracks the  peculiar phenomenon of "Satanic cult rumor panics," which have swept parts of  the country since 1984.  </P> <P> * Things happen fast these days and there's seldom time to step back and ponder  world events -- not in an economic or geopolitical or artistic sense, but in a  more deeply philosophical sense. In a speech reprinted in the June Smart,  author Kurt Vonnegut wonders why countries on occasion blast civilian targets  into oblivion. Vonnegut, who as a prisoner of war survived the Allied  firebombing of Dresden 45 years ago, doesn't offer a satisfactory answer. But  his wise observations on bombings from Hiroshima to Libya are worth slowing  down long enough to consider.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SHREDDER FODDER  </P> <P> * This spring, Life magazine launches its latest single-advertiser "Special  Issue," this one on "The World of Children." The advertiser in this case is  McDonald's, but the McAdvertisements and McPhoto-essays run together, creating  a gooier mess than a preschool class dribbling McMilkshakes.  </P> <P> * When will the once-great Esquire face truth in advertising laws and change  its subtitle to: "How to be a New Age Yuppie, circa 1983?" The current issue  dissects "The Secret Life of the American Wife," but this shotgun wedding  between a bad idea and a desperate publication should have been annulled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAGAZINE VS. MAGAZINE  </P> <P> * As the June WigWag sees things, "People magazine's exclusive coverage of Ryan  White's death was inconceivably sad -- sad in countless ways." The WigWag  editorial recounts People's seven-step coverage. For instance, No. 2: When  (Elton John) saw Ryan, lying unconscious, he was taken aback ("At first John is  simply overcome, unable to speak.") But he managed to pull himself together and  comfort Ryan's mother ("The superstar and the Kokomo factory worker hug and  stare. Only the thunk-thunk of the ventilator and the beep-beep of the heart  monitor fill the silence" and Ryan, too. Finally, Elton finds the words for  this moment. . . . 'Ryan,' he says softly, leaning close to the blank face.  'Michael Jackson called to see how you were.' ")  </P> <P> * In deciding to parody Vanity Fair, the June National Lampoon set its sights  on an easy target. But the only bulls-eye in the hit-and-miss skewering that  Lampoon delivers is a not-so-subtle "Editor's Letter" from one "Teena Brown":  "Not many magazines possess the resources, or the commitment to substance, to  run 600,000-word profiles of rich people," this spoof of Brown writes. "But  when it comes to the superficial, V.F. digs deeper. The success we've enjoyed  demonstrates that we deliver what our readers really want. . . . In truth,  today's magazine readers like ads."  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW ON NEWSSTANDS  </P> <P> There are magazines devoted exclusively to oceans, to rivers, to islands.  Summit, The Mountain Journal, premieres this spring, devoted exclusively to  "the home of the gods -- that elevated world where your eyes see farther, your  heart pulses faster, your soul soars higher."  </P> <P> More than just another outlet for mountaineers' braggadocio and mystical  mumblings, this well-produced Fleetwood, Pa., publication -- at least the first  issue -- offers enough fine photography and prose to engage even dedicated  flat-landers.  </P></p>

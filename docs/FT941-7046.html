			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Ousted metals group chief hits back Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the former chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, has denounced the company's supervisory board chairman for an 'orchestrated attack on my credibility' at the metals, mining and industrial group's special meeting on Thursday. Mr Schimmelbusch, who was sacked in December last year, told a newspaper that Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director who is supervisory board chairman at the German metals group, should have known the risks associated with the oil futures trading activities of MG Corp, the New York-based trading subsidiary. Speculative futures dealing at MG Corp led to losses of DM2.3bn (Dollars 1.35bn), and drove Metallgesellschaft to the brink of insolvency. On Thursday, Mr Schmitz blamed the company's near-failure on the former management, claiming he had been wilfully misled by Mr Schimmelbusch and other directors. Mr Schimmelbusch, who is believed to have been living chiefly in New York since he was dismissed, said he had frequently discussed MG Corp's oil futures trading activities with Mr Schmitz during 1992 and 1993. He said the dialogue was partly in the context of a joint venture between Deutsche Bank and Metallgesellschaft, in which the bank tried to market an oil derivatives programme to its German industrial customers. The aim of the programme was to reduce companies' energy costs, but joint presentations by the bank and Metallgesellschaft did not produce any business. The dialogue with the supervisory board chairman went further than this, Mr Schimmelbusch said, covering MG Corp's strategy and financing needs. Mr Schmitz said on Thursday he was not properly informed of problems at MG Corp until December 3 last year. Mr Schimmelbusch claimed he had not known about a mismatch between commitments to deliver oil and the hedging strategy  -the eventual cause of MG Corp's massive losses - until November 29. He had then thought the potential loss would be limited to Dollars 200m. Deutsche Bank yesterday refused to comment on Mr Schimmelbusch's attack. Shareholders at the meeting, meanwhile, voted overwhelmingly for a DM3.4bn refinancing package.</p>

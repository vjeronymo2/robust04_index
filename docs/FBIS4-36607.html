			<p>BFN     [Text] Ambassador Melissa Wells, the special envoy of the  American President Bill Clinton, arrived in Khartoum today. She  was received at the airport by al-Sayyid 'Umar Yusuf Baridu,  first undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and his  excellency the American ambassador to the Sudan together with  some officials.    Ambassador Melissa Wells, who was appointed during the past  two weeks by the American president, will concentrate her  mission on the support of peace efforts and humanitarian aid.  It is to be noted that Wells had visited the Sudan formerly in  1981.    Ladies and gentlemen, Melissa Wells, special envoy of U.S.  President Bill Clinton to Sudan, gave Sudan television the  following report:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] I want to ask  you about your purpose for visiting Sudan. What are you going  to do? Have you any message for the president?    [Wells] I was just recently, a couple of weeks, appointed as  President Clinton's special representative on the Sudan, and my  brief in this job is to promote the regional peace effort that  is currently under way to bring an end to the war in the south  and to help smooth delivery of humanitarian assistance. And,  yes, I will be carrying a letter for President Bashir from  President Clinton.    [Correspondent] Will your visit be (?focused on) relations  or  it is an informal (?visit)?    [Wells] No, I hope that we can engage constructively in a  dialogue as concerns the peace in the south. I have to my right  here the president's ambassador to your government Donald  Petterson who covers a much broader, wider range of issues and  does so from day to day. My focus is specifically in terms of  promoting the peace effort.    [Correspondent] Have you visited any countries before you  came to Sudan?    [Wells] Yes, I started out in Kenya, then went to Uganda,  Ethiopia, I have just come from Eritrea and now I am here.    [Correspondent] You are going to visit Waw [southern Sudan]  and (?rebellion) have you visited Sudan before?    [Wells] Waw I have been to before, when I was just telling  my  friends here that my family and I made a long, lovely trip  through the Sudan in December 1981. And we had some mechanical  difficulties in Waw and so we spent a few days there and I  remember how very generous the people were. They have beautiful  melons in Waw and we bought a lot of them because, you know, not  much food to buy along the way. And as we left at night, we  were driving at night to avoid the heat, they saw us leaving and  they pushed all these melons as gifts through our window. It  was very touching.    [Correspondent] In Kenya and Uganda did you find or meet  John  Garang?    [wells] No, no I have not met Mr. Garang. I hope to meet him  later.    [Correspondent] Thank you. [end recording]</p>

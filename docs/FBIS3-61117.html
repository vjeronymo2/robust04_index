The privatization organs of local councils are seeking  in this manner to neutralize the pressure brought to bear on  them by the FDMU [Fund of State Property of Ukraine]--a  structure of the Cabinet of Ministers, i.e. of executive power.  In an exclusive to Business P-P, Taras Pakholyuk commented on  the situation personally.    In the words of Taras Pakholyuk, the main task of the  conference in Kiev was to develop joint proposals concerning  more intensive conduct of minor privatization for the supreme  echelons of power--the president, Cabinet of Ministers of  Ukraine, Supreme Council of Ukraine, and the FDMU. At the  seminar quite a number of obstacles were revealed which  interfere with the regular course of minor privatization as a  result of ill-constructed regulatory documents which were  confirmed at the level of the FDMU and the Cabinet of Ministers  of Ukraine. FKM chairmen set up a working group which drew up a  package of proposals concerning privatization for confirmation  by the supreme echelon.    Taras Pakholyuk proposed to create a coordinating organ to  "push" these proposals in Kiev because a paper "without the  footwork" will clearly not work effectively enough. Everyone was  prompted to do so by the experience of the previous seminar at  which, all the efforts of the chairmen of local funds  notwithstanding, neither Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of the  commission of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, nor the FDMU  leadership responded to the joint decisions of FKM chairmen in  any way. For this reason, some of the proposals were included in  the new package (nothing changed in half a year). The idea to  establish the Association of the Privatization Organs of Ukraine  was supported, and a resolution in this regard was passed.  Statutory documents will be presented on 8-9 December in Odessa,  at an international conference on privatization in Ukraine,  where the resolution of all organizational issues will be  completed, and, in particular, regulations on the association  will be confirmed and the association will be registered. Taras  Pakholyuk expects that a support group will be created in the  Supreme Council with help from the association as early as this  term. This, in a way, will be a lobby which will operate on the  principle of the Union of Ukrainian Lessees.    Responding to a question from the correspondent of Business  P-P on whether this organ will turn into a self-contained  structure, Taras Pakholyuk answered that it will not, because  financing will be provided directly by the FKM's. That is to  say, they will directly control the actions of the association  and pay only if the work of the association is beneficial for  the FKM's.    At the same time, Taras Pakholyuk rejected accusations  against the local FKM's to the effect that the desire of the  funds to maintain independence from the center was the main goal  of the creation of the association. He is convinced that the  independence of the FKM's, and the local organs of  self-government in general, is guaranteed by Ukrainian  legislation. "That is to say, we are sufficiently independent to  begin with; for this reason, we are not afraid that someone will  be able to subordinate us. It is just that at the seminar  itself, after getting acquainted with the chairmen of the FKM's,  one could conclude that their interest in conducting  privatization exceeds that of the FDMU considerably; at least if  we analyze approaches to privatization by the FDMU and the local  organs, a substantial difference leaps out at us. The FDMU  defends mainly the buyout of enterprises by labor collectives  and the establishment of privately held joint-stock companies,  that is, privatization strictly for labor collectives. At the  same time, the FKM's of Ukraine hold both auctions and  commercial competitions; accordingly, more funds are taken in,  and the effectiveness of privatization is high. Through  competition, property ends up with an effective potential owner  who is interested in the greatest possible returns from  production."    According to Taras Pakholyuk, the FDMU is directly  interested  in maintaining or even enhancing control over privatization in  Ukraine. It is precisely its efforts to create a vertical  hierarchical system of the organs of privatization, subordinated  to the FDMU, that accelerated the process of creating the  organization. Everybody understood that this was yet another  attempt at linking the channels of management through Kiev.  However, varied approaches are necessary at the local level,  where it is necessary to act flexibly. Thus, Taras Pakholyuk  maintains that auctions run into practically no resistance in,  for example, rayon seats such as Stryy, Drogobych, and  Chervonograd. It is primarily local companies that privatize  property, and the threat of an invasion of foreign capital,  which some ultrapatriots are so afraid of, is nowhere in  evidence.    Evaluating the progress of privatization in Lvov, Taras  Pakholyuk indicated that a list of 67 facilities to be  privatized had been confirmed at the last session of the city  council, and seven winners of an economic competition in October  had been designated (the labor collectives of the latter are  entitled to buy out their enterprises; however, Business P-P has  already written repeatedly about the system of privatization in  Lvov along the lines of commercial competitions). The chairman  of the Lvov FKM said that this was being hindered somewhat;  therefore, it was resolved to extend the deadline for the filing  of privatization petitions by the labor collectives of the  facilities. As far as the current winners in the commercial  competitions are concerned, at present their property is being  inventoried and the price at which it will be proposed to  enterprises to buy it out is being determined. Then it will  remain for them to confirm their desire to be bought out within  15 days. If the decision is favorable, an economic unit based on  the labor collective--a joint-stock company or an association of  buyers--will become the owner of the property. They will be  granted the right to lease for a five-year term.    Taras Pakholyuk maintained that in principle privatization  deadlines set by the government for Lvov are realistic. However,  there are problems, too. "Privatization definitely will not be  completed before the end of the next year. There are many  enterprises that need to be privatized. Even if we privatize 70  percent of the enterprises in Lvov, about 1,700 facilities will  remain, and it is difficult to privatize them within one year.  The process will most likely be completed before mid-1995.  However, there is another snag. Certainly, less than one-half of  the enterprises will be sold through competitive privatization  techniques (auctions, economic competitions). Since to date we  have witnessed the desire to block them, no changes for the  better are expected. The results will be apparent at the end of  this year or the beginning of next year, when we finish  accepting petitions for 67 facilities, of which there should be  no fewer than three per enterprise. Auctions will then begin."</p>

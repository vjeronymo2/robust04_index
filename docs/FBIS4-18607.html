			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Lothar Ruehl: "Russia, Where Are You Going?"] </F>   [Text] The internal development of Russia in its  continuing crisis is having a backlash on Russian foreign policy  and, beyond that, on the feelings of the Russians toward an  alien outside world. The Zhirinovskiy phenomenon and the  delaying tactics of the opposition in the State Duma against the  Partnership for Peace with the Atlantic Alliance, as offered to  Russia, are new examples for it.    However, it is most likely that such a Partnership for Peace  will come about if Russia is conceded a relationship of  "particular quality" with NATO, including adequate  considerations for legitimate Russian interests and the  recognition of Russia's position as a major power, as was  recently demanded by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev in Bonn.  After all, President Boris Yeltsin, The Russian military  leadership and Russian diplomacy -- as represented by Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev -- are sticking to the declared  intention to conclude such an agreement with NATO for the  benefit of both sides. On the other hand, one must not ignore  the flare-up of greater Russian chauvinism, including  threatening gestures toward Russia's neighbors, particularly the  former non-Russian peoples of the empire: The demands voiced by  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Aleksandr Rutskoy to restore the  imperial union within the borders of the USSR has cast warning  signs across East Europe.    Zhirinovskiy's pan-Slav-Orthodox unity party, together with  a  clear turn against the West and Islam, has once more raised the  question of Russia's orientation. Will it return to Europe or  -- as frequently in the past -- will it seek to continue to  isolate itself against the West and link East Europe again with  a Russian empire in a firm bloc?    Zhirinovskiy's pan-Slav vision will turn out to be a chimera  like that of his 19th century predecessors, Aksakov, Samarin,  Fadeyev, Danilevskiy (the totalitarian philosopher of an  all-Russian-pan-Slav utopia), Katkov, and Ignatyev, or that of  the milder "neo-Slav" new edition of the beginning of this  century. Any attempt politically to unite, for example, the  Poles, Slovaks, Czechs, Slovenes, or Croats, let alone the  Ruthenian-Galician West Ukrainians, under Russian leadership in  a "Slav Union" in line with Zhirinovskiy's model, would fail  merely as a result of these nations' determination for national  independence along the cultural dividing line between the  Latin-Catholic and the Byzantine-Orthodox cultural heritage of  East Europe.    Thus, the Moscow Congress of Slav Peoples will not be able,  either, to show the way to overcoming historical antagonisms,  which 100 years ago, when religion and the pan-Slav idea were  still creating a lot of emotion, set external limits to  political pan-Slavism. Russia's Balkans policy suffered severe  setbacks between 1875 and 1878, then again at the beginning of  our century, in all the Balkan wars, even after military  victories, and, finally, during the war in 1917, leading to the  collapse of the Czarist Empire, whose borders have also been  requested by Zhirinovskiy as has a new division of Poland  between Russia and Germany.    What remains is -- apart from the illusionary pan-Slav  appeal  -- the strongly anti-Western orientation of the new  nationalistic front line. With his turn against London and  Paris, Zhirinovskiy is returning to Bolshevik foreign policy,  which regarded Germany as a partner against West Europe, and  which contributed to the isolation of the Soviet Union --  temporarily continued by Stalin until World War II, and  transferred first of all to the United States after 1945. For  Russia, this return would lead to becoming detached from Europe  and isolated without the rank of a major power, because the  foundations of Stalinist power policy cannot be restored. Times  have changed since the collapse of the Soviet Union.    The impression created by the pan-Slav and  all-Russian-imperialist appeal particularly in Ukraine, Poland,  the Czech and Slovak Republics, and also in the Baltic countries  and in Hungary, Slovenia, and Croatia, will even strengthen  these countries' urge to move west near the protective umbrella  of the Atlantic alliance. This will make it even more difficult  for the NATO states to keep the necessary balance between the  integration of East-Central Europe into the alliance and the  equally necessary cooperation with Russia in a special  "strategic partnership" for European security, as recently  mentioned by Federal Defense Minister Volker Ruehe in St.  Petersburg.    Yet a European balance as a basis for joint security and the  extension of the alliance to those countries that feel  politically and culturally part of West Europe and are also  seeking European Union membership, is the precondition for the  structural stability of the post-Soviet nations, including the  freedom of peoples and independence in a European home of  security. On the other hand, Russian participation will require  moderation in Russian foreign policy and cooperation with the  North Atlantic alliance on mutually acceptable conditions for  preserving security in Europe without a "condominium" on the  former allies of the USSR in an extraordinary political  relationship -- as accepted by the Partnership for Peace  principle.    President Yeltsin, his government and the Russian Army have  a  lot of interest in it because cooperation with NATO would  stabilize them at home, too, and would prevent Russian  isolation. This dual consolidation is now the most urgent task  of joint security policy.</p>

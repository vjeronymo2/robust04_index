			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / US Money and Credit: Fed adds to confusion and gloom THE US fixed-income market starts this week disheartened and distinctly confused by the latest thoughts and actions of the Federal Reserve and their implications for interest rates. Last week's market activity was dominated by two Fed developments. On Tuesday, it announced it was cutting the proportion of checking account deposits that banks have to hold as reserves, which do not accumulate interest, from 12 per cent to 10 per cent. The move, which does not come into effect until April, will lower banks' cost of funds, improve their balance sheets, and - hopes the Fed - encourage them to lend more to US business and help the nascent economic expansion. The following day, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, went before Congress and gave his semi-annual report on the economy and monetary policy. His tone was distinctly upbeat, albeit hedged around with caveats. The economy, he said, was poised for recovery. He estimated it would grow this year at an inflation-adjusted 1.75 to 2.5 per cent, while inflation would drop to the lowest rate in a generation. All this thoroughly depressed the bond market. The reduction in reserve requirements was seen as monetary easing in another form, and thus a move which reduced the likelihood of a further cut in interest rates. And gloom was increased by the thought that Mr Greenspan's optimism might actually be right, for the fixed-income market dislikes economic growth, with attendant inflation, which undermines the value of its securities. However the gloom could be a little overdone. First, the market may have read too much into the change in reserve requirements. For as the bond analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette point out, when the Fed undertakes reductions in reserve requirements it usually sterilised the effect of the move by draining excess reserves from the banking system. Mr Geoffrey Dennis, of brokers James Capel, says the move is 'yet another effort by the Fed to kick-start bank lending, which has continued to be held back in recent months both by supply constraints imposed by the banks and a lack of demand from customers'. Second, if the Fed really believes the economy is poised for recovery, why does it need to add a further stimulus to the banking system now? A logical explanation is that it is not yet fully convinced that recovery is sustainable, and the banking move is a relatively low-cost, non-inflationary means of bolstering the financial system. Certainly, the past week has produced a rash of statistics which, at first sight, support some economic optimism. Car sales jumped in early February; January retail sales were strong; and the housing market has shown further signs of a pick-up, albeit from a very low base and in limited regions of the country. Money supply has also started expanding strongly: M2, the broad money measure closely followed by the Fed, rose Dollars 9.5bn in the latest reporting week, putting it comfortably within the bank's 2.5 to 6.5 per cent target rate for 1992 growth. None of all this provides conclusive evidence of sustained growth. Cynical analysts point out that many of these same factors also occured last year, offering a false dawn of economic recovery. Yet there are huge differences this time around: interest rates are much lower; the banking system has gone a long way to repairing its balance sheet; and corporate America has also been through a wholesale restructuring. The Fed's hopes for a gradual recovery seem to leave its monetary policy on hold for now. If fresh signs of weakness emerge, such as a disappointing February employment report, due early in March, it could yet cut the Fed funds rate from 4 per cent to 3.75 or 3.5 per cent. But if it thinks the recovery is sustainable, the US may already be at the bottom of the interest rate cycle - and that thought produced substantial falls in bond prices last week. At one point, the benchmark Treasury 30-year bond rose almost to the psychological barrier of an 8 per cent yield. The market is focusing far more on Mr Greenspan's growth forecasts than his more encouraging inflationary expectations, which he predicated upon 'appropriate economic policies'. For in an election year, with President Bush suffering a severe setback in New Hampshire last week, it would be unwise to bank on either Congress or the White House acting appropriately.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                             Last    1 week  4 wks  12-month  12-month                             Friday  ago     ago    High      Low Fed Funds (weekly average)  3.75    3.88    3.87   11.00     2.00 Three-month Treasury bills  4.02    3.89    3.90    8.29     3.76 Six-month Treasury bills    4.18    4.03    4.06    7.70     3.89 Three-month prime CDs       4.25    4.15    4.15    7.17     4.01 30-day Commercial Paper     4.20    4.03    4.00    7.12     3.90 90-day Commercial Paper     4.20    4.05    4.00    7.02     3.92  --------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------- US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                         Last      Change           1 week   4 wk.

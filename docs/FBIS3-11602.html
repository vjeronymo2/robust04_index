			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] Acting Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno spoke  today in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas, about the Chiapas  electoral process scheduled for 21 August and the presidential  elections that will be held throughout the country. Lopez  Moreno said conditions have forced authorities to reschedule  Chiapas gubernatorial elections two months after the previously  scheduled date. He warned, however, that there will not be  another acting governor in the state because the people are  against it.    Juan Carlos Antollo was in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas this  morning. He is now back in San Cristobal de las Casas, one hour  from the Chiapas capital, and filed this report on what is  happening in Chiapas. Good evening, Juan Carlos, how are you?    [Antollo] Good evening. After traveling a road with 326  curves and three straight segments, we made it to San Cristobal  de las Casas, Chiapas. As you pointed out, it was said today  that there will be no more acting governments in this state. It  was decided that the gubernatorial elections, which some  proposed be postponed until 1995, will be held this year in  October. This will guarantee that the transition of state  executives is made within the timeframes established by the  Chiapas Constitution.    Chiapas Government Secretary Pablo Salazar Mendicoechea made  the aforementioned statements while disclosing a report that  Governor Javier Lopez Moreno will send to the Chiapas Congress.  Salazar Mendicoechea said the governor held a series of  meetings throughout the state during which it was decided that  this year's gubernatorial elections would be held in October  instead of 1995. The document added: This decision was made  because right now the state is facing difficult situations. If  these situations are indeed taking place, however, the electoral  process should go on as mandated by law.    [Begin Moreno recording] For this particular occasion, we  propose that the gubernatorial elections be held on Sunday, 16  October. The local deputy and mayoral elections will be held as  scheduled in August 1995. No more acting governors will be  appointed because most Chiapas residents are against that.  There will be new electoral legislation that will allow  equality in political campaigns, new prerogatives for parties,  reliability in electoral organizations, and credibility in the  results.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Zasurskiy under the rubric "Reforms": "The </F> Dualism of Boris Fedorov: Any Radicalism Will End Up  Crossbreeding Hedgehogs and Grass Snakes"]    [Text] Boris Fedorov has always been considered a liaison  between Russia and the West, which attached a certain weight to  him in Russian politics. In the past his unwavering intent to  achieve financial stabilization by any means went hand in hand  with the confrontation strategy of the Kremlin. It would be  interesting to see whether this politician is undergoing an  evolution.    The minister's new year's article in IZVESTIYA is  indicative;  in it, he appraises the current reforms and offers some  forecasts regarding the development of the Russian economy in  the event of a change of course. The inveterate radicalism of  the very first phrase of this press communication by the deputy  prime minister makes one shudder: "The current financial policy  brings out a harsh reaction on the part of the opposition. This  means that we have succeeded in implementing a consistent  financial policy." More quotes: "...cutting through fierce  resistance put up by the Central Bank and a number of members of  the government," "...despite the resistance on the part of the  Central Bank and various sectoral lobbies," "our unceasing fight  against the Supreme Soviet, the Central Bank, and sectoral  lobbies in the government."    Whether Boris Fedorov wants it or not, he is not only the  minister of finance, but also a politician; and while the first  part of the article, in which he relates the accomplishments and  the fighting, shows us the minister of finance, only Fedorov the  politician could propose a minimum program for any cabinet for  the next year.    What is included in this minimum program? Ensuring truly  positive interest rates in order to attract savings and "paying  reasonable compensation from noninflationary sources to citizens  for losses incurred because of liberalization." The population's  real income should increase from $100 to $250 a month. It is  necessary to introduce tax regulators that will reduce the gap  between the rich and the poor. Inflation should be brought down  to 5 percent a month--an equivalent of 80 percent a year--in the  nearest future. As the budget deficit is reduced to 5 percent of  the GNP and below, the tax burden on producers of goods can be  reduced.    Following that, in order to scare the reader, Boris Fedorov  presents a list of horrors that will befall us in the event of  abandoning the reform: prices rising at 2,000 percent a year; an  exchange rate of 10,000 rubles for a dollar; an increasing  dollarization of the economy; fixed prices on some goods and  confiscation of money in the banks; and a shortage of goods. Of  course, one senses in this juxtaposition a single-vision  perception of the development of the Russian economy (if we do  not achieve stabilization we will get "Ukrainization") and the  same complete lack of substantiation and fanatical adherence to  the "party line." "God save Russia from deviating again from the  correct road," Fedorov ends his article.    How does Boris Fedorov intend to solve the problem of  employment and raise the population's average income considering  that 10 million people will have no job at all, and enterprises  that have not gone bankrupt will nevertheless be unprofitable  because of the low exchange rate of the dollar? What  expenditures will then be required for maintenance of law  enforcement organs? How does one bring inflation down  considering that any tightening of the money supply produces  only a cash crisis? Why, finally, can we today try to index  people's savings "through noninflationary monetary means" while  only yesterday this was rejected under a threat of  hyperinflation?    There may be only one answer to all this: I am the minister  of finance; these are not my problems. However, while such a  position on the part of the minister of finance is completely  consistent and beyond reproach, can Fedorov the politician--a  man who should be aware of what results his departmental zeal  will produce--formulate the issue this way?    "We should stop attempting to crossbreed a hedgehog and a  grass snake--as is known, the product of it is barbed wire. The  elections gave us a warning," wrote B.G. Fedorov. Fedorov is  wrong. The elections did not give us a warning. The Russia's  Choice radicals lost the elections. And they lost not to  communo-fascists, as had been expected, but to a new force,  capable of using social discontent to a highest degree. And if  we consider that, Russia either needs to be crisscrossed either  by a hedgehog-grass snake hybrid right now or we have to realize  that the country on which we conduct experiments in fighting  inflation by monetarist methods will fall into Zhirinovskiy's  hands in 1996. And it will again end in hedgehogs and grass  snakes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "Moscow Tries to Stop Serbs Going </F> Over the Edge]    [Text] Belgrade/Moscow -- The Serbs' decisive offensive  against the Muslim enclave of Gorazde on 16 April placed Europe  on the brink of a major war. It was only weather conditions  that prevented NATO aircraft from delivering a new and this time  massive strike against Serb positions.    Russian diplomacy is desperately trying to save the  situation. President Yeltsin's special representative Vitaliy  Churkin went to the Bosnian Serbs' capital, Pale, while Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev paid an emergency visit to Belgrade,  where on Saturday night through early Sunday morning he met with  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.    According to the original plan, Kozyrev was to have flown to  Yugoslavia no earlier than Sunday. The rapid deterioration of  the situation forced him to act without delay. The members of  the Russian delegation discovered that the visit had been  switched to Saturday only two hours before the flight out.    Addressing the press after the talks with Kozyrev, the  Serbian president was unperturbed, repeating again that both  Belgrade and the Bosnian Serbs favor a peaceful solution and the  only reason for the deterioration of the situation around  Gorazde is provocations on the part of the Muslims.    But in private conversations Yugoslav officials admit that  there is another reason -- the implacable stance of General  Ratko Mladic, commander in chief of the Bosnian Serbs. Neither  Radovan Karadjic, leader of the "Serb Republic" in Bosnia, nor  Milosevic himself can control this man's actions. What with his  powerful friends in the Yugoslav army's top leadership, Mladic  is to a large extent invulnerable, even where the all-powerful  Serbian president is cocnerned.    According to information from reliable sources, two years  ago, during Kozyrev's first visit to Belgrade, Russian diplomats  pressed the Yugoslavs to get rid of Mladic, who was obsessed  with the idea of creating a "Greater Serbia" and was prepared to  enter into confrontation with the whole world in order to  realize his dream. But Milosevic made it plain that he could do  nothing.    Now he is reaping the fruits. The belief among Kozyrev's  entourage is that Milosevic's promise to influence the Bosnian  Serbs and persuade them to cease firing on Gorazde was entirely  sincere. As were Karadjic's assurances, when he swore to  Churkin that he would immediately halt the offensive against the  Muslim enclave. Despite this, the attacks continued and Serb  tanks captured the suburbs of the city that had been declared a  "safe area" by the United Nations.    "The Serb military is acting independently, often ignoring  the will of the political leadership," a Russian diplomat  dealing with the Balkans, who wished not to be named, told  IZVESTIYA. "Mladic is a sinister figure. He will not have any  compromises. It is his profound belief that neither NATO nor  the United Nations is prepared to take decisive action and all  their threats are empty ones. Our main task was to convince  Milosevic and Karadjic that the situation was far more serious  and that events might take a very nasty turn if the Serbs did  not respond to the UN demand and pull back from Gorazde."    "In conversation with Milosevic Kozyrev voiced our concern,  to put it mildly, over the Bosnian Serbs' behavior. He took a  very tough stance," Galina Sidorova -- the minister's political  adviser -- said after the talks. If Belgrade helps to defuse  the situation in Bosnia, Kozyrev promised to demand a relaxation  of international sanctions against Yugoslavia. There is  information that suggests that the Americans were prepared to  join the Europeans in supporting Russia's initiative, having  hitherto opposed any concessions to Belgrade.    But this can only happen in the event of the normalization  of the Gorazde situation. The latest reports from the area do  not provide any grounds for optimism, unfortunately. Battles  between Serbs and Muslims are continuing and NATO air strikes  could be launched at any moment. Even Vitaliy Churkin, who  tends not to be pessimistic about things, on this occasion acted  out of character, declaring that he did not believe a ceasefire  in Gorazde was possible.    If the Serbs continue the offensive, Gorazde is bound to  fall. Militarily the enclave is doomed -- the Muslim army is  incapable of defending it. The capture of the city would be a  public slap in the face not only for the United Nations, but for  the North Atlantic bloc as well, which would have demonstrated  its impotence. Neither Butrus-Ghali, nor the leaders of the  Western states can accept this. It would jeopardize the  prestige and political future of many Western leaders -- and  Russia's protests would no longer stop them in that event.    The question for NATO now is not whether to launch another  strike against the Serbs, but how to make it as effective as  possible. According to information at the disposal of people in  Smolenskaya Square, NATO headquarters is working on plans for a  ground operation in Bosnia. But that would require a massive  amount of preparation and a great deal of time. NATO will  obviously have to confine itself to an aerial war in the  foreseeable future. Experts believe it would be futile to go  hunting for Serb tanks and mortars in mountainous and wooded  terrain. A strike against Serb units attacking Gorazde would  not have any significant effect either. The Serbs are employing  ideal tactics: Rapidly breaking through the enemy's line of  defense, they are mixing with the civilian populace, which makes  them invulnerable to NATO aircraft.    If Western leaders decide to switch from a show of force to  major combat actions, they will be forced to attack the Bosnian  Serbs' strategic facilities -- headquarters, communications  centers, ammunition dumps, and, most important, several bridges  over the Drina River, linking the "Serb Republic" in Bosnia to  Serbia. The destruction of these bridges would be a terrible  blow to the Bosnian Serbs, because it would mean that Belgrade  would be unable to come to their rescue.    In that case the conflict would be in danger of developing  into a military clash between NATO and Yugoslavia. Belgrade has  repeatedly made it clear that it would regard the bombing of the  bridges as a declaration of war...    For Russian diplomats this prospect is a nightmare they want  to avoid. Unfortunately, the current situation is such that  none of the potential scenarios, including that one, can be  dismissed.    The efforts of Kozyrev and Churkin have given a ray of hope  of a peaceful resolution of the crisis. But the situation as a  whole remains critical. According to UN spokesmen, a Serb shell  was fall on Gorazde every 20 seconds on Monday morning.</p>

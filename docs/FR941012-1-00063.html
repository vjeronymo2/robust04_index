Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 17, 1986, the President signed into law the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (``SARA''). Pub. L. 99&hyph;499 (1986). Title III of SARA established a program designed to require state and local planning and preparedness for spills or releases of hazardous substances and to provide the public and local governments with information concerning potential chemical hazards in their communities. This program is codified as the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11001&hyph;11050.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subtitle A of EPCRA establishes the framework for local emergency planning. The Statute required that EPA publish the Agency's list of ``extremely hazardous substances'' (``EHSs''). This had previously been published in November, 1985, by the EPA Administrator in Appendix A of the ``Chemical Emergency Preparedness Program Interim Guidance'' (CEPP Guidance), as the list of acutely toxic chemicals. The Agency was also directed to establish ``threshold planning quantities'' (``TPQs'') for each extremely hazardous substance. Under section 302, a facility which has present an EHS in excess of its threshold planning quantity must notify the State emergency response commission and local emergency planning committee as well as participate in local emergency planning activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the extremely hazardous substance list is to focus initial efforts in the development of State and local contingency plans. It is not intended to be a complete list of all chemicals that could potentially be hazardous to a community. The identification of a chemical that meets the EHS criteria does not in itself indicate the potential for serious effects in any release, accidental or routine. Thus, inclusion on the EHS list is not meant as a signal to state or local communities to ban or otherwise restrict use of a listed chemical. Rather, such identification indicates a need for the community to undertake a program to investigate and evaluate the potential for accidental exposure associated with the production, storage or handling of the chemical at a particular site. EPA also encourages communities to go beyond the EHS list when evaluating the hazards of facilities in their community, in that facilities handling chemicals not on the EHS list could be as hazardous as those handling EHSs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

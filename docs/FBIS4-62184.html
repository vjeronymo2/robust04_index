			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Armen Khanbabyan in the "Armenia" column: "The </F> Risk of War Has Given Way to the Risk of Peace. Yerevan and  Stepanakert Are Content With the Results of the Bishkek Meeting"]    [Excerpt] Armenian parliament speaker Babken Ararktsyan  believes that realism has triumphed at the meeting in Bishkek.  Its main achievement, according to him, has been the  recognition by all the participants in the negotiations of some  political realities, without which the advance to peace is  impossible. These are: a stable cease-fire, recognition of  Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict, and lifting all  blockades -- and only after this, discussions about the status  of the region. Ararktsyan stressed several times that the  proposed plan is based on a "land in exchange for peace"  formula, which carries a substantial share of risk for Armenia  and Karabakh. But in exchange Armenia and Karabakh will get  territories, from which their troops will be pulled out, as well  as the lifting of the blockade, and peace. Both acquisitions,  in Ararktsyan's opinion, are fairly fragile because the blockade  can be easily resumed and peace breached. But Yerevan and  Stepanakert are ready to take "the risk of peace" even with  minimum guarantees, which provided a foundation for their  signing the Bishkek protocol without any provisos.    Baku's hesitations, on the other hand, were quite lengthy.  Yerevan is inclined to believe that they were primarily related  to the fact that Azerbaijan lacks a coherent policy with respect  to the CIS and, secondly, its hope to secure support in NATO  headquarters and in Ankara, which Geydar Aliyev has visited.  And only when it became clear that NATO is not disposed toward  serious military support of Azerbaijan, and Ankara confined  itself to purely rhetorical statements, was it decided to sign  the protocol, although with some qualifications. The addition  of the word "international" to the term "observers" apparently  suits Yerevan and Stepanakert no less than it does Baku. True,  the replacement of the definition "acquired [zanyatyye]  territories" by "captured [zakhvachennyye] territories" does not  seem just so unequivocal because this immediately raises the  question of who exactly captured them. On this count,  incidentally, Vladimir Shumeyko, in his closing statement in  Bishkek, said that during the discussion of this point the  Karabakh side agreed even to the term "occupied"  [okkupirovannyye], but demanded the specification that these  territories were occupied precisely by the Defense Army of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. At the time this was assessed as an  aspiration toward indirect affirmation of status, and the  formulation was rejected.    Even so, neither Yerevan nor Stepanakert so far has any  official confirmation that the Azerbaijan side has really signed  the protocol. According to Ashot Antinyan, adviser to the  Armenian parliament speaker, "Apart from a telephone assurance  by Rasul Guliyev, we have no other evidence about this." The  speaker's aide furthermore expressed a certain amazement over  the fact that of the two [authorized] copies [ekzemplyary] of  the text of the protocol, one is in St. Petersburg, at the  headquarters of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, and the  other is in Bishkek, and therefore it is not clear which of them  has been signed by the head of the Azerbaijan parliament.  Duplicates [Kopii] in such cases have no legal validity.  According to Arkadiy Gukasyan, foreign minister of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, neither has anyone in Stepanakert  seen the text signed by Guliyev. [passage omitted]</p>

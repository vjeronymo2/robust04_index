			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger sugar deficit forecast WORLD SUGAR production will fall 2.84m tonnes below consumption in 1992-93, according to Czarnikow, the London trade house. The group's latest sugar review puts production at 111.6m tonnes, down 3m tonnes from the last estimate in February, and substantially below last year's 116.42m tonnes. Consumption is now estimated at 113.9m tonnes, and 600,000 tonnes has been allowed for what Czarnikow terms 'unrecorded disappearance'. The deficit is well ahead of the International Sugar Organisation's figure of 1.61m tonnes, announced earlier this week. Mr Chris Pack, analyst at Czarnikow, said yesterday that the latest figures showed a swing from last season's surplus to this season's deficit of 7m tonnes. 'It is not surprising that the market has moved sharply ahead,' he said. 'It is trying to find a new level.' For most of the six months between last September and February, the New York nearby raw sugar contracts were trading between 8 and 9 cents a lb. But as perceptions increased of much lower crops than expected in Cuba, Thailand and India, the market has risen sharply. On Monday the New York July contract reached a high of 13.26 cents a lb before profit taking set in. Yesterday in late trading it was at 11.98 cents a lb. Czarnikow estimates Cuban production at 5.5m tonnes, on the high side compared with other forecasters but still well down on last year's 7m tonnes. Indian production is put at 11.5m tonnes, down 3m tonnes from last year, while Thailand is expected to produce 3.8m tonnes, down from 1991-92's 5.1m tonnes. Mr Pack said that now a clearer picture of production was emerging, the market was looking for signs of demand, which has been restricted by the higher price levels. 'This market is fundamentally driven,' he said, 'but demand is a little cool for some of the rampant bulls to follow.'</p>

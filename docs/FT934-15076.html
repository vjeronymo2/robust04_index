			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips stagnant as mid-size stocks surge Wall Street US BLUE chips ended a lacklustre session little changed yesterday, although mid-size stocks and over-the-counter issues rose to new record highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.28 at 3,593.13. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.24 higher at 461.12, while the Amex composite finished up 2.91 at an all-time high of 470.50, and the Nasdaq composite up 4.81 at a record 772.46. Trading volume on the NYSE was 265m. The stage was set for some early gains when trading in New York opened, but they never really materialised. Although overseas markets were weaker overnight, analysts still felt that conditions were right for a bullish market yesterday. They believed that sentiment would strengthen after Monday's modest advances in stock prices, that the morning decline in long bond yields to an all-time low of under 5.9 per cent, and that a series of better-than-expected third quarter corporate earnings reports would all boost demand for stocks. However, after breaking through 3,600 in the early part of the session, the Dow fell back quickly as buying petered out. A retreat by bonds after midday, spurred by a rise in gold and other commodities prices, did not help, and by mid-afternoon the Dow had slipped into negative territory. Secondary stocks traded on the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market, however, remained strong throughout the day. Among individual stocks, brokerage issues were in demand after three of Wall Street's biggest securities firms - Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber and Bear Stearns - all reported record or near-record quarterly earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations. The news lifted Merrill above Dollars 100 for the first time, and it came as no surprise when it announced plans for a two-for-one stock split. Merrill shares ended up Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 101 5/8 , PaineWebber up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 34 3/8 , and Bear Stearns up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 24 3/4 . Also higher were Morgan Stanley, up Dollars 3 3/4 at Dollars 88 1/2 , Primerica (owner of brokerage house Smith Barney Shearson), Dollars 1 5/8 higher at Dollars 48 1/4 , and Salomon, up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 49 1/4 . Strong earnings from Motorola, which reported third quarter net income of 92 cents a share, well above analysts' estimates, lifted the technology sector. Motorola firmed Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 103 3/8 , fellow semiconductor stock Texas Instruments added Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 66 1/2 , and Compaq put on Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 61 1/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Wellfleet jumped Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 53 1/4 in volume of 3.9m shares after reporting a more than doubling in first quarter net income to 36 cents a share. Centocor climbed Dollars 3 to Dollars 14 1/4 in busy trading after the company said tests showed that its Panorex antibody cut the cancer death rate by 30 per cent after five years. Canada TORONTO prices closed solidly higher in moderate trading, as gold issues surged on rising gold prices. According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 composite index rose 40.04 points, or 0.98 per cent, to close at 4,107.31. American Barrick rose 1 1/4 to 33 1/4 and Placer Dome jumped 1 to 29 3/4 . Another gold stock, Franco-Nevada Mining, gained 1 to 70  1/2.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Fall in output predicted to continue OUTPUT BY manufacturers will continue to decline over the next few months, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply forecasts. A survey published today by the institute, which represents purchasing managers in manufacturing, shows that prices of imported raw materials increased sharply in December for the third successive month, as a result of the fall in the pound since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16. Another report published today, by Infolink, a business information company, indicates that the outlook for the consumer sector may be brighter. It says demand for credit by consumers for purchases of cars and retail goods rose in November for the second successive month. An index published by the purchasing institute showing levels of economic activity among member companies fell slightly to 49.2 in December from 49.5 in November. This indicates that an imminent upturn in manufacturing is unlikely. Companies last month reported a slight increase in new orders, with export orders in particular benefiting from sterling's devaluation. Much of the rise in orders was seasonal, related to an expansion in demand ahead of Christmas. Companies continued to run down stocks in December. The number of companies sacking employees 'continues to substantially outweigh those recruiting', the institute says. The weak state of the European economy may hold back a significant upturn in the UK, according to the latest world economic forecasts from Oxford Economic Forecasting, an economic consultancy.

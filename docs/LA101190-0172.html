			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS;  </P> <P> VARIETY IN STOCK;  </P> <P> IN THIS OFFBEAT STORE, YOU MIGHT WALK OUT WITH A JOSE CANSECO ROOKIE CARD OR A  CHINA SET.  </P> <P> Looking for the perfect gift to give that baseball card/fireplace mantle  collector in your life?  </P> <P> Well, for one-stop shopping you might want to try the Premier Sports Cards and  Collectibles shop in Ventura.  </P> <P> You could pick up a Jose Canseco rookie card for about $100 and that mantle  piece for $650.  </P> <P> And why not toss in a Marilyn Monroe print, a used Duran Duran compact disc, a  set of basketball cards and some jewelry.  </P> <P> This offbeat business is owned by Mike Lynch and Mike Wills, two 27-year-old  Ventura County natives who decided to chuck desk jobs for something a little  more exciting. They opened the shop in August.  </P> <P> "I thought I was stagnating. I was constrained as to what I could do at my  other job," said Lynch, formerly a financial analyst at Northrup Corp. "The  only similarity between that job and this one is that I have to get up in the  morning."  </P> <P> Lynch said he's had customers come into the shop to look at sports items and  walk out with furniture.  </P> <P> "A mother came in with her son to look at the cards," he said. "She ended up  buying a china set."  </P> <P> A word of caution: There's a book sitting on the fireplace mantle titled "How  to Sell Anything to Anybody."  </P> <P> Remember last week we told you about a delivery service in Newbury Park that  will send packages to the Persian Gulf at no cost?  </P> <P> If you plan to send paperback books or magazines here's a tip from Mary Lynch,  librarian at the Ray D. Prueter Library in Port Hueneme.  </P> <P> "You can't send pictures of women into Saudi Arabia," she said. "Bare arms are  a no-no." That includes the appendages of women featured in magazine ads.  </P> <P> Lynch knows what she's talking about.  </P> <P> The library sent some magazines via a Seabee battalion and plans to send an  additional 500 paperbacks that are ready to go overseas whenever arrangements  can be made to get them there.  </P> <P> "The Seabees took a lot of romances and a lot of mysteries," she said. "But  some of the covers had to be torn off the romances."  </P> <P> Anyone who'd like to donate some reading material can call 486-5460.  </P> <P> In the announcement for its annual Sespe Rendezvous, the Ojai Valley  Muzzleloaders Assn. listed some of the scheduled activities:  </P> <P> "Black powder cartridge match, cannon match, wild savage attack, PLUS pancake  breakfast with hot coffee." You know, a savage attack just isn't the same  without some flapjacks and a cup of java.  </P> <P> Most of the activities will be pretty authentic -- with costumes and equipment  from the 1830s.  </P> <P> One thing that probably won't be authentic, though, is the menu. Said organizer  Charles Bates: "We don't have access to buffalo."  </P> <P> Is your bone marrow clean enough?  </P> <P> Talk to Bill Berk. He'll be teaching an introductory class on the Chinese art  of internal power exercise, Tuesday from 7:30 to 9 p.m. For information on the  location call 486-0459.  </P> <P> The exercise, Berk said, is a three-step process that demands some mental and  physical exertion.  </P> <P> "First you do a stationary meditation in a squat position with your arms in  eight different positions," he said. "You hold it for anywhere from five  minutes to three hours."  </P> <P> Step two is bone-marrow washing. It involves lightly beating certain  acupuncture points with metal rods wrapped in cloth. "It creates more blood  cells and improves your immune system."  </P> <P> Then there's step three, which can't really be discussed in a family newspaper.  </P> <P> Let's just say it has to do with swinging and holding weights with certain  parts of one's body to improve the immune system.  </P> <P> Hey, don't knock it. Berk said his teacher lived to be 117 years old. LEO SMITH  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Santo Domingo, 26 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today under  protest, Representatives of the opposition Dominican  Revolutionary Party (PRD), which nominated Jose Francisco Pena  Gomez as its presidential candidate, joined the second day of a  review of the Dominican elections.    After opposition parties filed charges of electoral fraud,  107 electoral boards decided to review the vote count  certificates for the 16 May elections, an activity which the  [word indistinct] joined this Thursday under the premise that  not all the certificates had been manipulated.    Pena Gomez said the fact that he is joining the certificate  review does not mean he is validating the figures manipulated by  the vote counting center. The politician said he will prove  that the tens of thousands of people who supported him, which he  described as a considerable number, are twice the number of  those who supported the Reformist Social Christian Party (PRSC),  which nominated President Joaquin Balaguer.    The PRD said the majority of its members could not vote  because their names were not included on the voter lists even  though they had their credentials. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Patten likely to escape probe into schools row MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, last night appeared likely to avoid an embarrassing Commons inquiry into his clash with teachers over the national curriculum and school testing. In a move that may signal an ebbing of Tory anxiety, one of Mr Patten's fiercest critics, Sir Malcolm Thornton, Conservative chairman of the Commons education committee, denied suggestions that he favoured MPs launching an investigation. 'There seems to be no purpose in having an inquiry unless we can do something positive to help the situation,' he said - but added that he still wanted the scrapping of tests planned for this summer. Sir Malcolm's comments came as other Tory committee members backed Mr Patten's refusal to heed teachers' calls for the suspension until 1994 of this summer's tests. Mr Robert Spink, Tory MP for Castle Point, said he had been 'astounded' to hear hints from Sir Malcolm over the Easter weekend that the committee might launch an inquiry. The tests for 14-year-olds were urgently needed. 'I don't think that we can delay another year,' he said. Mrs Angela Knight, Tory MP for Erewash, said: 'If you say that we are not going to have tests this year, after a three-year programme, how many children are going to go out of school without necessary skills?' Mr Patten has been helped by a growing consensus among Tories that the teachers' unions have proved themselves largely politically motivated. But he still faces widespread concern at Westminster. Labour MPs on the education committee will probably urge a fresh inquiry when it meets today, and many Tory MPs remain worried about Mr Patten's uncompromising attitude towards the teachers. One Tory said: 'He has misjudged it. He doesn't appear to be listening to the teachers and that is not working to his advantage.' Mr Patten will address the Tory backbench education committee soon - where support is likely to be mixed. Mr Alan Haselhurst, committee vice-chairman, said: 'I think that the party would be solidly behind what he is trying to do. But they would be worried about implementation in the circumstances that have arisen.' Sir Rhodes Boyson, Conservative MP for Brent North, said: 'I'm backing John Patten. At the same time, John Patten must say much more clearly that the national curriculum has is to be cut back and the tests made much simpler.' Letters, Page 20</p>

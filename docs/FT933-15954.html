			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD closed lower on the London bullion market after initial support from European investor buying was capped by producer selling. Dealers still saw the recent rally carrying the yellow metal through the psychologically significant Dollars 400 a troy ounce. But technical analysts expect significant resistance at that level. COPPER prices closed higher on the LME, while other metals closed mixed after a largely lacklustre day. Dealers said there was little market-moving news and, with the US market closed for Independence Day, the LME lacked interest for long periods. Compiled from Reuters</p>

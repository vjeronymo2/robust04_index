			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Arts: Carter's new 'Partita' - Music in Chicago Since Elliott Carter has now passed the age of 85, his current works will be recalled as 'late Carter'. But the phrase feels all wrong. His new Partita, earlier this month by the Chicago Symphony under Daniel Barenboim, is as fizzy as anything he has composed: bright, mostly fast, always fleet, and with an extraordinary subtlety of detail. Eight years ago he produced a three-minute orchestral firework display entitled A Celebration of Some 100 x 150 Notes. The new score, lasting six times as long, must contain something close on a hundred thousand of the things, disposed in artfully worked strokes: almost every chord is vitalised by staggered entrances and exits of instruments; every line an internal energy of swirling colour. The title, according to the composer, refers not to the Baroque musical form but to the standard meaning of the word as 'game': a kind of mental football match, where the play is brisk and athletic, and the spectator has to be alert to what is going on right across the field. Speed of change is not new in Carter's music; what does seem to be coming through more strongly now is a similar liveliness in music of slower pace. Soon after the start of Partita, the stage is taken by a pair of flutes carefully exchanging notes, but their duet soon becomes a glowing ensemble of flutes and violas all in echo and half-echo (the sheer beauty of sound in this score needs to be emphasised). This same effect is achieved within a solo line, as when the English horn keeps restarting a simple musical sentence. Continuity and interruption: these keep the game moving forwards. As the composer has noted: 'My music seeks the awareness of motion we have in flying or driving a car and not the plodding of horses or the marching of soldiers that pervades the motion patterns of older music.' Nevertheless, a touch of 'older music' survives. There are signs in Partita that the dances of old Bach have not been completely forgotten, and it is not only the prominence of the piano in the scoring that keeps us in touch with Stravinsky. Somewhere inside Carter there is still the voice of his teacher Nadia Boulanger insisting on order and courtliness. The struggle against constraint, the breaking of the mould, perhaps has to be re-achieved in each new piece: this is the nature of the game. Partita abounds in invitations to its performers, and a great many of them were thrillingly taken up by the orchestra.</p>

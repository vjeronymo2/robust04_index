			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sip forecasts profits improvement for 1993 Sip, Italy's state-controlled telecommunications utility, expects to announce 'clearly better' profits for 1993, according to Mr Ernesto Pascale, chairman. In a letter to shareholders, Mr Pascale forecast that, based on preliminary figures, Sip's 1993 net earnings should be higher than the L486.4bn (Dollars 288m) made in 1992. The group's official results should be released in early April. Mr Pascale made no dividend forecast but implied Sip's payout could go up. The likelihood of higher profits, in spite of the recession, has been raised by changes to Sip's heavy investment policy of recent years. The company said its cash needs in 1993 had been lower than the previous year. Moreover, a higher proportion of investment spending had been met by internal cash flow than in 1992, he added. As a result, Sip's net indebtedness at the end of last year was lower than the L23,283bn reported on December 31 1992. The letter to shareholders gave no indication of revenues from Sip's highly lucrative cellular communications services, now the third biggest in Europe in subscribers. Mr Pascale said Sip viewed the entry of a second mobile communications operator 'with great serenity'. The impending onset of competition in the group's hitherto monopoly would help to expand overall demand, he predicted.</p>

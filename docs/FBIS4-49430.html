			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Punishments will now be  handed out for transporting, selling, storing and using poppy  capsules illegally; disturbing public order and damaging  people's health through religious activities; and stirring up  conflicts between nationalities, hurting unity of nationalities  and inciting separation of nationalities.    These are three of the 18 new offenses which have been  included in the draft supplementary provisions to the  regulations governing offenses against public order, which was  submitted to the current session of the Standing Committee of  the National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislative body,  for deliberation this morning.    Minister of public security, Tao Siju, explained to the  session that along with the present changing social order, some  new problems and offenses have occurred which have disturbed the  social order and public security and hurt public interests.    "However, the original regulations had made no provisions  about these activities and it has become difficult to handle  these cases according to law," said the minister.    The existing regulation was put into effect on January 1,  1987.    Other newly prescribed offenses include:    -- disobeying the provisions on the management of social  organizations, and carrying out activities under the name of a  social organization without registration; or to keep on working  under the name of social organization after its registration was  revoked, it has been ordered to disband, or simply banned;    -- organizing activities of superstitious sects and secret  societies to disrupt public order, do harm to the public  interest, or damage people's health through feudal superstition;    -- disobeying supervisory provisions while undergoing a  period of being put under surveillance, or deprivation of  political rights, probation with suspended prison sentence or  being paroled.    Those who commit such offenses, but not to the extent to be  punished according to criminal law, will be put under 15 days  detention, with fines of up to 200 yuan or a warning.    Meanwhile, those fabricating or distorting facts, spreading  rumors or otherwise disrupting public order, or doing harm to  the public interest through other means, will be put under 15  days detention and ordered to write a confession or warning, if  the offenses are still not severe enough for criminal punishment.</p>

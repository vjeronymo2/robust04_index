The negotiations lasted two days. The  Karabakh Department of Press and Information (DPI) told SNARK  the sides continued discussing the Russian peaceful initiative  on the Karabakh conflict settlement.    Meanwhile, during the Kazimirov's staying in Stepanakert the  Azerbaijani aircraft three times invaded the Karabakh airspace.  About half past three the Azerbaijani jets bombarded the suburbs  of Stepanakert.    "I consider wrong and unacceptable these actions of the  Azerbaijani aircraft", Kazimirov commented on the last air-raid.  DPI himself estimated these actions of Azerbaijan as an obvious  provocation aiming to fail the intermediary efforts of Russia.    Today morning Kazimirov has left Stepanakert.

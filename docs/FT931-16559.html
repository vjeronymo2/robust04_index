			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / People: Knox joins Bank of Scotland board The Bank of Scotland, which says its policy is to make 'interesting but competent appointments regardless of sex and age', has chosen Lesley Knox as a non-executive director, the first woman to join the board of Scotland's second biggest bank. At 39, Knox is going on for 20 years younger than most of the other directors, who include Sir Bob Reid, Sir Alick Rankin and John Menzies. She is the second non-executive appointee since Bruce Pattullo took over the governorship in mid-1991. In that year three non-executive directors retired; Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of Argyll, joined with effect from last August. Its bigger rival, the Royal Bank of Scotland, has had a woman - Elizabeth Nelson - on the board for the past five years. Now running the institutional investment management side of Kleinwort Benson, Knox became a director in 1986 - making her the first female director at any merchant bank in the City. Her connections with the Bank of Scotland are on one level sentimental in that it was the first company in which she owned any shares. Aged 18, she turned up to her first agm: 'I thought I would go along to see what happened,' says Knox, who was brought up in Edinburgh. Since then, when working in the corporate finance division of KB, she was on the team that advised the Edinburgh-based bank when it was considering the purchase of a US regional bank four years ago. Company secretary Hugh Young recalls how impressed the board had been with a presentation she made to them at the time. 'With (the) Cadbury (recommendations on corporate governance), the age of directors is going to drop. Under our regulations, they can carry on to 70, but I don't think they will in future,' he adds. Subsequently, through her corporate advisory work, Knox has met a number of the other directors, including Thomas Hutchison, deputy governor of the bank and a non-executive at Cadbury Schweppes. 'I hope they know I'll be making a vociferous contribution,' she says.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Arts: Purcell's 'Dido and Aeneas' - Concert and semi-staged opera performances at the Barbican and Queen Elizabeth Hall An instrumental prelude led into the Prologue. This turned out to be a pageant of the sea, an allegory in the French style, featuring Phoebus attired in gold with a richly plumed headdress, Venus, nymphs and shepherds, the men in this stylishly costumed production all looking the spitting image of Charles II. For those who had not read the small print, the identity of the opera would be a mystery. Surviving copies of the text for Purcell's Dido and Aeneas show that at some point it acquired a prologue, but the music is lost and the opera has become known without it. In this staged performance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Monday the English Bach Festival tried a re-construction: other short pieces by Purcell were interspersed throughout the verses, which were spoken. As a one-off exercise, it had its value. Assuming Purcell ever did write the music to go with this opening, the drama would have taken on a wider significance in the person of the goddess of love, representing all the Didos of the human race. No doubt the score would also have brought a deeper resonance to her utterances - but without the music, we just do not know. It was telling how the performance jolted into life, as soon as we moved into the opera proper. An important feature of Dido and Aeneas is that Purcell wrote it to be sung all the way through, but that effect is lost if the Prologue can only be performed like a masque, as spoken drama with music. The inherent power of the opera itself was in any case marvellously shown by this EBF production, a noble realisation for all its evident need to watch the pennies. No Restoration extravagances here. Tom Hawkes provided just simple stage effects and a producer's acumen in how to bring out the devastating emotional force in Purcell's drama. In this hall an orchestra of seven (strings, lute and harpsichord) proved sufficient; but a chorus of four was more of a sacrifice, as they could hardly be expected to echo themselves from afar. Kathleen Tynan was an excellent Belinda and Nigel Leeson-Williams sang a burly warrior of an Aeneas. Still all this might not have succeeded, if the performance had not found so striking a focal point in its central performer. A specious argument was proffered in the programme as to why Della Jones had been asked to take on the roles both of Dido and the Sorceress, but her magnificent accomplishment of the task was reason enough. As the Sorceress, she pushed her voice; but as Dido, she triumphed in regal style. In an uncanny way her performance spanned the centuries: sometimes the clean singing of intricately decorated vocal lines suggested period practice, at others she left all that behind and let fly with the full-range of modern-day expression. More important, the whole tragic spirit of Purcell's Dido seemed to be alive in her hands. It was there that this Dido and Aeneas found its true raison d'etre.</p>

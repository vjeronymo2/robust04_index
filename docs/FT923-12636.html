			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / EC plan for dual-use arms exports BRUSSELS yesterday put forward its long-awaited plan for EC states to tighten controls on militarily useful exports crossing the Community's external frontier, to let them dispense with such checks along internal borders, David Buchan writes from Brussels. The European Commission's draft regulation, covering the tricky category of dual-use and nuclear goods which have a military as well as civil application, is designed to remove another pretext for keeping customs officers busy at internal EC borders after January 1, when the single EC market is due to take effect.</p>

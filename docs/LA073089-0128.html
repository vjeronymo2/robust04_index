			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GODDESS THEORY  </P> <P> I was disturbed by the tone Jacques Leslie took regarding archeologists who  disagree with Marija Gimbutas' vivid picture of prehistoric life in  southeastern Europe ("The Goddess Theory," June 11). Leslie is prepared to  render those archeologists as boring scholars "who think that archeology is  legitimate only to the degree that it is grounded in science" -- as if this  were a horrible insult?  </P> <P> Archeologists must fight their desire to be flightful because other  archeologists -- and, more important, the general public -- assume that what  they propose has scientific grounds. The information generated by archeologists  is considered scientific, and, as a result (rightly or wrongly) is often  accepted as fact.  </P> <P> Scientists of any kind have a responsibility to indicate the degree of  certainty with which they are able to make claims or generate hypotheses, and  they should be applauded when doing so, not condescended to.  </P> <P> MONICA GYULAI  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

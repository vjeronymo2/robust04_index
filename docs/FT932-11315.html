			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Investment banks 'stall' Maxwell pension search TWO CITY investment banks are blocking efforts by liquidators of the Maxwell pension fund management company to trace the ownership of nearly Pounds 130m in assets that have gone missing, a select committee heard yesterday. Mr Neil Cooper, partner at Robson Rhodes, liquidators to Bishopsgate Investment Management, fund manager for more than Pounds 700m in Maxwell company pension assets, told MPs he had been obliged to take the unusual step of forcing the investment banks into court in order to obtain access to staff or documents. The two investment banks are Lehman Brothers International and Credit Suisse, Mr Cooper said. He added that it was highly unusual in insolvency for liquidators to have to resort to the courts to obtain information. 'Most solicitors are aware of the powers of liquidators and the vast majority of the information we receive is obtained without court order,' he said. Asked by Mr David Shaw, Conservative MP for Dover, to speculate on why the investment banks were not co-operating, Mr Cooper said the banks may fear that inquiries and subsequent actions may go beyond the question of ownership of the contested securities. In one case, MPs heard, Lehman Brothers, which had made an individual available for extensive questioning, declined to produce the individual for a second round of questions. Lehman Brothers said yesterday: 'We believe we have been very co-operative.' It added that it felt the time had come to say 'enough is enough'. Lehman is believed to be holding Pounds 70m to Pounds 80m in assets that may belong to pensioners. Credit Suisse, MPs heard, had refused to supply information and the liquidators won a court order to force them to supply it. The bank then challenged the order, forcing the liquidators back into the court, again successfully. Mr Cooper also said the liquidators were about to begin proceedings in France to recover an estimated Pounds 33m of shares in Euris, an investment bank, held by Banque Nationale de Paris. The shares were allegedly transferred by the former directors of Bishopsgate to Banque Nationale where they allegedly served as collateral for a loan to Headington Holdings, a privately-owned company of the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Cooper said the current administrators to Headington Holdings, Arthur Andersen, confirm that they have no legal title to the shares.</p>

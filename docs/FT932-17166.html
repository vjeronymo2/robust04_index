			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Death of royal who nurtured democracy DON Juan de Borbon, Count of Barcelona and father of King Juan Carlos, died in hospital in Pamplona aged 79 yesterday. Don Juan is to be buried with the full funeral honours accorded to a reigning monarch, although he never was one, reflecting the vital role that Don Juan played in identifying the monarchy with the return of democracy to Spain. It was largely because of Don Juan's lifelong defence of political pluralism that his son, Don Juan Carlos, was able to credibly project himself after General Franco's death as a constitutional king. Son of King Alfonso XIII and Queen Ena of Battemberg, a grand-daughter of Queen Victoria, Don Juan left Spain with the royal family when a republic was proclaimed in 1931. In 1945 Don Juan issued a manifesto calling on General Franco to step down and setting an agenda for restoration of the monarchy and free elections. His stand earned him the enmity of Franco who jumped the line of royal succession and chose Don Juan Carlos, who had been educated in Spain, to succeed him. The tables were turned following Franco's death in 1975 when Don Juan Carlos turned out to be his father's heir rather than the dictator's. In May 1977, a month before the first post-Franco general elections, Don Juan moved back to Spain and renounced his right to the throne.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrew Grice and Michael Prescott report: "Tories Head for </F> Third Place in June Election"]    [Text] John Major's prospects of surviving as prime  minister suffered another setback last night following new  evidence that the Conservatives face a crushing defeat in next  month's European Parliament elections.    The most comprehensive survey of Thursday's [5 May] local  elections for THE SUNDAY TIMES shows that if last week's voting  pattern is repeated on June 9, the Tories will finish third  behind Labour and the Liberal Democrats, losing more than half  their Euro-MPs in Strasbourg. A computer analysis of 2.8  million town hall votes in 100 constituencies shows the Tories  would win only 12 of the 84 Euro-seats, a devastating loss of 20  seats. The Lib Dems [Liberal Democrats] would be the big  winners, capturing 14 Euro-seats, their first election victories  in the European Parliament.    Labour would remain Britain's biggest party in Strasbourg,  winning 56 Euro-seats, a gain of 10.    The analysis was carried out by Colin Rallings and Michael  Thrasher, acknowledged authorities in electoral analysis, at the  Local Government Chronicle elections centre at Plymouth  University.    Senior Tory MPs admitted last night that it would increase  the pressure on Major. They said the survey's most worrying  finding was its projection that, on the basis of last week's  votes, more than 200 Tory MPs would lose their seats in a  general election, giving Labour a majority of 127.    There were signs yesterday, however, that Major will win a  breathing space with a majority of MPs and local party chairmen  rallying behind him. A survey of 75 backbenchers by THE SUNDAY  TIMES since Thursday found that 60 MPs did not want him to stand  down, only 14 did and there was one "don't know." Asked whether  they believed Major would still be Tory leader at the next  general election, 45 said "yes," 24 said "no" and there were six  "don't knows."    A SUNDAY TIMES survey of 50 constituency chairmen found that  44 did not want Major to stand down, three wanted him to resign  and there were three "don't knows." Thirty-six chairmen  believed Major would lead the party into the next general  election, only three thought he would not and there were 11  "don't knows."    In spite of this support and Major's determination to fight  on, there were also reports yesterday of high-level Tory moves  to oust him in the immediate aftermath of next month's elections.    Some ministers loyal to Major expect the Euro-results to be  worse for the Tories than last week's rout. Ministers say fear  of higher council tax bills being imposed by Labour councils  persuaded many Tory supporters to stay in line last Thursday, a  factor that will be missing on June 9.    Senior figures will hold informal talks this week on  contingency plans to prevent open civil war breaking out in the  party if the Euro-results are as bad as expected. Sending a  powerful delegation to Major to ask him to stand down is among  the moves being canvassed.    Close colleagues insisted last night that Major would send  such a deputation away "with a flea in its ear" but one minister  said: "Things could happen very quickly in June."    In another sign of crisis manoeuvring, it emerged that  informal links have been established between groups of Tory  backbenchers on the right and the left. Some MPs involved talk  of building a consensus for a "new start" with Michael  Heseltine, president of the board of trade, as prime minister  and Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary and leading  right-wing candidate for eventual leadership, as chancellor of  the exchequer.    Major's supporters continue to insist the public will not  accept a party which ditches its leader twice in less than four  years. "If we do that," a senior Tory said, "we will be turned  out and there will be a minority Labour government, followed by  a deal with the Liberal Democrats giving them electoral reform  and, in my view, never a Tory government again."    Former cabinet heavyweights on the Tory right rallied to  Major yesterday. Lord Tebbit, the former Tory chairman, said it  was "no time for a leadership election." Sources close to  Baroness Thatcher said she, too, was preparing to intervene on  Major's behalf after the Euro-elections.    Tory divisions over Europe resurfaced yesterday when Sir  Edward Heath, the former prime minister, criticised Portillo for  speaking out against a single European currency. "Obviously  what he said was out of keeping with the prime minister's  policy," Heath said. If the Tories were to do well in the  Euro-elections, the government needed to face up to its mistakes  quickly, he said    If Major does fall, Heseltine remains the MPs' favourite to  succeed him. He was chosen by 14 MPs in our survey, five opted  for Portillo, two preferred Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and  one wanted John Redwood, the Welsh secretary.    Even if Major survives the Euro-results, his allies admit a  leadership contest in November looks inevitable. Major's  critics claimed yesterday that about 60 Tory MPs are ready to  request an election -- almost twice the 34 needed under the  rules -- and some Major supporters concede his position would  become untenable if between 80 and 100 MPs voted for a "stalking  horse" challenger or else abstained.    Evidence of Major's unpopularity with the voters emerges in  a  poll for today's ON THE RECORD programme on BBC1. Gallup  examined the views of 1,613 people who voted Tory in the last  general election.    Of the 988 "lost Tories" who were not planning to vote  Conservative last Thursday 58 percent wanted Major to resign, 34  percent wanted him to stay and 8 percent expressed no view. Of  the 625 who remained loyal to the party, 22 percent wanted Major  to quit, 72 percent wanted him to stay and 6 percent expressed  no view.    Sir John Nott, the former defence secretary, said last night  the Tory party could do with a period in opposition. Writing in  THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH, he said: "Politicians in opposition can  renew their acquaintance with the real world. They have the  time to stand back from events and seek out the real issues."</p>

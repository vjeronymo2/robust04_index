			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (1): Crucial stage of the reform programme - China's economic reforms have brought huge changes and excited investors around the world, but as Tony Walker reports from Beijing, the biggest tests are yet to come CHINA stands today at the threshold of a new and more testing phase in the gargantuan task of bringing a creaking centrally planned economy into the modern era. The country's second revolution, launched 15 years ago by Mr Deng Xiaoping, has wrought a remarkable transformation, both in improved living standards and in relations with the outside world. But challenges abound. Not least of these lie in deepening the reforms that have brought China in little more than a decade from poverty and backwardness to being viewed as the world's next economic superpower. Such claims may be premature in a country whose vast population remains predominantly peasant farmers. However, China's opening to the outside world has kindled extraordinary enthusiasm among foreign investors. In the first three quarters of this year Dollars 15bn was actually invested by foreigners, and Dollars 83bn pledged in new contracts, according to official figures. Utilised foreign investment now stands at Dollars 52bn since China's opened its doors to foreign business in 1979. For all these promising indications, China, burdened by an unwieldy and impoverished state sector, is still far from achieving its goal of creating a an orderly market economy as it moves to the next, more complex, stage of its reforms. These will be aimed at better regulating the raw entrepeneurial energies that have been unleashed and - perhaps more important - reasserting central control over increasingly unruly provinces where powerful local officials have been carving out their own small empires. Mr Deng could hardly have anticipated the monumental changes that have overtaken China in the years since the third plenary session of the eleventh Central Committee in December 1978, when the reform drive was launched. But the words employed then have an historic resonance now. Casting off the burden of Maoist dogma, the party demanded 'great growth in the productive forces,' and observed prophetically that the modernisation of China would prove to be a 'profound and extensive revolution.' The 89-year-old and enfeebled Mr Deng has remained true to those sentiments, arguing recently for a renewed commitment to growth even as his lieutenants were seeking to rein in a runaway economy growing at 13 per cent this year for the second year running. THE veteran communist, whose exhortation last year to 'do it faster' prompted an explosion of commercial endeavour, may go down in history as one of the great advocates of accelerated economic activity to deal with potential political problems. Chinese leaders need look no further than across the Russian border to be reminded of the costs of economic stagnation. The reformers have already travelled further down the road of economic change than even the greatest optimists might have predicted. However, the next steps, including an overhaul of the banking system, far-reaching reforms of the tax regime, further trade liberalisation, and creative approaches to dealing with debt-ridden state enterprises, will require persistence and nerve. Among the most critical tasks is to arm institutions like the People's Bank, the country's central bank, with the authority to assert reasonable control over the economy, and thus help China avoid the wild fluctuations from 'boom' to 'bust' that have bedevilled the reform phase. China also has to find ways to ensure that adequate funds reach priority areas such as infrastructure. Serious bottlenecks in transport along with inadequate power supplies are a drag on economic activity. In some ways this second stage of China's 'second revolution' may prove more difficult politically than the first. Reform of state enterprises is already falling foul of powerful vested interests at the centre and in the provinces. Mr Zhu Rongji, the reforming vice premier in charge of the economy, was obliged to ease credit restrictions in August and September after he had sought in mid-year to impose stricter discipline on loss-making industries. The episode raised doubts about the longer-term integrity of the anti-inflation fight, and also emphasised just how difficult is the task of enterprise reform. Details of the new reform programme were endorsed at a meeting of the Central Committee held in Beijing this month. This was the Third Plenum of the Fourteenth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and officials, with an eye to history, drew bold comparisons with the Third Plenum of 1978. They hoped that in the same way this latest event would act as a springboard for reform. It was also aimed at bolstering the reforming consensus among Party leaders lest any might be entertaining ideas of backsliding once Mr Deng goes to 'meet Karl Marx' - his euphemism for death. Although this gathering of the Central Committee - the Party's supreme policy-making body between sessions of its National Congress - emphasised collective leadership, factional differences were unlikely to be far below the surface. Chinese leaders are now fully engaged in manoeuvring for power in preparation for the post-Deng era. The party can ill afford to be distracted, since it faces challenges on many fronts. Not least of these is the widespread public perception that, bereft of new ideas and new faces, it is less relevant. Attempts to shore it up by engaging in campaigns like this year's anti-corruption drive are hardly convincing. In the end, the party's survival will depend not on propaganda but on the ability of China's rulers to continue delivering improved living standards. For the time being, political liberalisation has been ruled out, but inevitably, the sheer pace of economic change is eroding the party's ability to assert control as before. Faint voices can also be heard advocating greater pluralism, although political dissent continues to be stamped upon. Among China's supreme challenges is to deal with the widening income gap between prosperous coastal regions and the impoverished hinterland, and also between peasant farmers and urban dwellers. With surplus labour of 100m among China's 900m peasants, there is no room for complacency. Widespread peasant unrest this year - more than two hundred separate incidents had been reported by mid-year - unnerved the leadership, and prompted an urgent review of measures to improve the farmers' lot, including prompt payment of money owed for produce acquired by the state. Older generation Chinese leaders had not forgotten that it was the peasants who were the footsoldiers of the revolution. While domestic issues, including the succession struggle and attempts to bring the economy under control without risking severe retrenchment, have tended to preoccupy the leadership, other concerns have also intruded. China's spirited but unsuccessful campaign to secure the 2000 Olympics for Beijing would have reinforced among senior officials the realisation that engagement with the outside world will never be easy. Human rights issues, including memories of the Tiananmen square massacre of 1989, almost certainly helped to torpedo the Chinese bid. But these officials would understand that China's ambitions to be a world power, economically and politically, by early next century mean that retreat into brooding isolation has long ceased to be an option. Trade issues, including China's application to re-join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its efforts to preserve its Most Favoured Nation trading status with the US, make it imperative that Beijing strike out even more boldly into the international mainstream. Among promising developments is the decision of Mr Jiang Zemin, China's president, to attend an Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation leaders' conference this week in Seattle. President Clinton and Mr Jiang have much to talk about, not least how to place Sino-US relations on a more businesslike basis, and thus avoid the risk of rupture over issues ranging from human rights to arms proliferation. If the early 21st century is to be the era of the Pacific, there is hardly a more important relationship than that between the remaining superpower and a rapidly modernising state with more than one-fifth of the world's population and economic ambitions to match.

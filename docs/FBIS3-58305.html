It has been discovered that the CIA received an  intelligence report that the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]  planned to assassinate Ciller. It immediately informed Ankara  and the police in Belgium about the matter. Acting on that  information, the police in Belgium took maximum security  measures. Meanwhile, police officials have said they have taken  additional measures but do not believe that an attempt to kill  Ciller is possible.    The source of the information received by the CIA agents,  who  have been working in Brussels for many days because President  Clinton will attend the NATO summit, has not been disclosed.  The police in Brussels called the Turkish Embassy two days  before Ciller arrived in Belgium to tell the officials about the  information they received on the assassination attempt.  Ciller's arrival in Brussels was delayed for two hours in  accordance with the additional security measures that were  implemented.    The information on the assassination attempt by the PKK  militants, who selected Belgium as a base after the PKK was  banned in Germany and France, has created as wave of anxiety.  The fact that the information on the assassination attempt was  received only a week after PKK militants created incidents in  that country has added to the state of uneasiness. Ciller  postponed her departure from Ankara to Brussels for two hours  yesterday. She was scheduled to leave Ankara at 1200. She  arrived in Brussels in the evening and found herself in the  middle of a wall of police officials.    The police officials said they took all the necessary  measures to protect Ciller but added that they did not take the  information on the assassination attempt seriously. Prime  Minister Ciller went to the Hilton Hotel after arriving in  Brussels. She gave statements to the BRTN and RTBF Television  Networks in Flemish and French respectively in her hotel last  night and received the representatives of the Turkish community  in Belgium. She was briefed by the representatives on the  incidents the PKK created in Belgium last week. Ciller also  appeared on a live CNN telecast with Frank Fesno.    Minister of State Necmettin Cevheri will fill in for Ciller  while she is in Brussels to attend the NATO summit. The  circular on Cevheri assuming the prime minister's duties was  published in the official gazette yesterday. Minister of Labor  and Social Security Mehmet Mogultay will fill in for Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin, who has accompanied Ciller to Brussels.</p>

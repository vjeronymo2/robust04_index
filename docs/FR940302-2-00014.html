			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 7:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Komatsu argues that the adjustment that the Department made, in its preliminary results, to costs of subcontracted work performed by a particular related-party supplier, was based on a misunderstanding regarding the method used to calculate costs for that work. In fact, Komatsu claims, in calculating the actual cost of the related-party inputs, it inadvertently overstated the costs by a specific profit percentage. Komatsu contends that, given the above, the costs of the related-party inputs should be reduced rather than increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with Komatsu. Komatsu did not clearly demonstrate at verification its alleged overstatement of the actual costs of the related-party inputs by a profit margin. Given that the information reviewed at verification indicates an understatement, rather than an overstatement, of costs, an upward adjustment to the value of these related-party inputs for a portion of the period loss incurred by the related party is warranted. (See cost verification report dated October 25, 1993, pages 7 and 8.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 8:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioner asserts that the Department should increase Komatsu's submitted costs to account for losses incurred by certain other related suppliers during the review period. The petitioner notes that the Department failed to verify the costs of inputs from these suppliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Komatsu argues that the amount of Komatsu's purchases from those suppliers was clearly insignificant, as would have been any adjustment the Department might have made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Komatsu. At verification, the Department tested those related party transactions that made significant contributions to the subject merchandise. See cost verification report dated October 25, 1993, page 7. Adjustments to costs for transactions with other related party suppliers, even if warranted, would not have significantly affected the margin analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 9:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Komatsu argues that the Department should allow an offset to the general and administrative expenses for the gains on sales of plant assets recorded at its head office, which relate to the company's general and administrative activities. Komatsu adds that these gains should be offset against the company-wide general and administrative expenses, in addition to the offset the Department allowed for the gain on sales of plant assets at the Komatsu plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Norsk Hydro Norsk Hydro's collection of commodity-based businesses was always likely to enjoy the first half of the year. With interests ranging from aluminium to ammonia to PVC and crude oil, the group looks tailor-made to benefit from the early stages of a turn in the commodities cycle. Having asked shareholders for Nkr4.7bn equity earlier in the summer, management may also have felt obliged to squeeze every last krona out of the business. Even so, yesterday's second-quarter figures exceeded even the stock market's high expectations. While commodity price rises are public knowledge, the extent of operational gearing came as something of a surprise. This was especially true in fertilisers, the subject of a massive restructuring charge two years ago. Firmer fertiliser prices, decent demand outside Europe and lower exports from eastern Europe all helped improve the position over last year. But cost-cutting was the foundation of the five-fold rise in divisional operating profits in the second quarter. European companies with less well-appointed spreads of business - or which have been less vigorous in pursuit of efficiency - can not be expected to deliver such a spectacular rebound. Neither can Norsk Hydro count on further sharp rises in all its main commodities at once. But companies which have been shaving costs through recession and are now achieving modest price increases may also surprise with the speed of recovery.</p>

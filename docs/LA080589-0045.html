			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> VENEZUELANS LEERY OF SCANDAL JUSTICE  </P> <P> Most Venezuelans doubt that authorities will find those guilty of stealing  billions of dollars in a government corruption scandal, according to a poll  published Friday.  </P> <P> The survey said 59% of 1,000 respondents nationwide believe a judicial probe  will fail to uncover the people responsible for cheating a now-defunct  government department set up in 1983 to sell dollars to Venezuelan importers at  a discount. Many think cover-ups are hindering the investigation.  </P> <P> An estimated $30 billion passed through the Office of Differential Exchange  Rate Controls -- known by its Spanish acronym Recadi -- and up to $8 billion of  it has not been accounted for, according to government sources.  </P></p>

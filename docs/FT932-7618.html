			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram board wins day on auditor ANGRY small shareholders tried but failed to oust Arthur Andersen as auditor to Spring Ram, the Yorkshire manufacturer of kitchens, bathrooms and home improvement products, at the company's AGM in Leeds yesterday. They won on a show of hands by 48 to 40, but Mr Bill Rooney, the chairman, said he had 105m proxy votes for reappointment of the accountancy firm and only 8m against. The vote on the floor was re-taken and most of those against then abstained. However, this was the only blemish on the day for Mr Rooney, Spring Ram's founder. Shareholders backed him unanimously after he apologised for management mistakes and promised appointment of a second non-executive director and a strong finance director within weeks. The value of Spring Ram's shares has halved recently after two surprises. First, the company revealed false accounting at a subsidiary. Then shares were suspended briefly to allow an announcement that last year's pre-tax profits would be nearly Pounds 13m below expectations of Pounds 39m after Arthur Andersen had insisted on a more conservative approach. Clearly nervous, Mr Rooney told the packed meeting of about 200 people that a senior manager in Balterley Bathrooms, a subsidiary, had overstated profits to impress his superiors, mainly by manipulating stock figures. Although no money was stolen, Mr Rooney said, the fraud was so clever that neither management nor auditors could have reasonably been expected to spot it. Mr Rooney added that all new accounting standards had been, or would be, introduced ahead of obligations. New systems also ensured that no manager could act alone to falsify figures, reducing risks of problems arising again. Spring Ram's report and accounts and dividend were approved unanimously on a show of hands, as was the election of Mr Roy Barber, a company doctor. Mr Barber will supervise internal audit and oversee corporate governance policy. Mr Rooney said Spring Ram had continued investing heavily throughout the recession. 'But we didn't expect 4 1/2 years of depressed times. Had we known, we would have phased developments.'</p>

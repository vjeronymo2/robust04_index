			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "New Chiefs of Staff </F> for Navy and Air Force"]    [Text] On a proposal by Defense Minister Francois Leotard,  the cabinet appointed two new chiefs of staff for the Navy and  Air Force yesterday.    Admiral Jean-Charles Lefebvre was appointed to the post of  Navy chief of staff effective as of 1 July, at which time he  will also receive his fifth star. He replaces Admiral Alain  Coatanea, who reached the age limit for his rank at the end of  March.    Born on 1 May 1938, Jean-Charles Lefebvre has commanded the  Naval Action Force (FAN) since June 1992. A former student of  the Naval Academy and nuclear engineer, he commanded an escort  ship, the frigate Georges-Laygues and, from 1985 to 1987, the  aircraft carrier Clemenceau. At the Navy staff, he was the head  of the planning and finance division from 1990 to 1992. He has  a reputation for great intellectual rigor. He becomes head of  the Navy at a time when it has been rocked by the accident of  the nuclear attack submarine Emeraude, when the Armed Forces are  being increasing organized on an interforce basis, and when the  way is opening up toward a European defense policy. At the Rue  Royale, where the "Optimar" plan was launched, he is the one who  will have to implement and lead the military programming law  (with the priority of maintaining the credibility of the  strategic ocean force and the preparation of the project for a  second nuclear aircraft carrier by 1997). He will also ensure  that the Navy indeed remains, as Admiral Coatanea would like,  "above a critical size."    General Jean-Philippe Douin has been promoted to general of  the Air Force and he succeeds General Vincent Lanata as chief of  staff for the Air Force. .  <H5>  Changes To Be Implemented </H5>   Born on 8 April 1940, Gen. Douin is a fighter pilot. Since  October 1992, he has been the deputy chief of staff of the Armed  Forces, the deputy to Admiral Lanxade, after serving as the  second in command for operations at EMA [Military Air Force  College] and earlier in the Air Force.    The Air Force, of which he will take command on 1 July, has  experienced profound changes in the past two and a half years  since the Gulf War, under the authority of Gen. Lanata. There  has been a series of administrative and operational  reorganizations, as well as a major rejuvenation of its combat  aircraft fleet. Going beyond the minimum of 460 combat aircraft  on line, it has opted for fewer aircraft (390), but more modern  ones. By summer, it will be possible to refuel all of its  combat aircraft in flight.    This reorganization, which will give the Air Force "more  muscle," will be offset by a considerable -- some say excessive  -- downscaling of its size. The programming law calls for some  5,000 jobs to be cut, including 1,600 officer positions, and  therefore the closing of several bases.    Gen. Douin will have to implement these changes. He will  have to pursue the Rafale (to be operational by 2002) and Mirage  2000-5 (to be operational in 1998) programs; launch the major  future transport aircraft program; decide on the withdrawal in  1996-97 of the Mirage-IV's from the strategic Air Force; prepare  the eventual launch of a second component of nuclear deterrence,  the one favored by Gen. Lanata, i.e., the duo comprising the  Rafale and a long-range surface-to-air missile.    He will also have to ensure that the modernization of the  combat fleet is maintained through a steady series of new orders  and deliveries. This is an ambitious objective since, if the  current pace is maintained, three-fourths of this fleet will be  more than 10 years old in the year 2000, whereas today, half of  it is less than 10 years old.    To succeed Gen. Douin as deputy chief of staff at the Armed  Forces staff, the cabinet appointed another aviator, Lieutenant  General Jean Rannou. For three years, Gen. Rannou was head of  the military staff of the defense minister (under Pierre Joxe  and then Francois Leotard), where he proved to be an efficient  organizer and a loyal adviser. A master at speaking frankly,  which is actually a rather rare (and sometimes burdensome)  quality, he knows how to speak in confidence, which is even  rarer in the military world.</p>

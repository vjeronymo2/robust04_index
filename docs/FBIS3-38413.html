The special units and the snow and mountain  commandos commanded by high-ranking officers, who were already  on a state of alert in southeastern Turkey, moved to begin their  operation, code-named "Destroy," under falling snow yesterday  morning. Several snow vehicles acquired from the United States  are being used in their operations.    The security forces have intensified their operations in the  triangle between Diyarbakir's Lice and Hani districts, Bingol's  Karliova and Genc districts, and Mus. They have also  intensified operations on the heights of the Gabbar, Namaz, and  Cudi mountains. It has been reported that hit-and-run attacks  have been organized against predetermined PKK shelters in the  region under unfavorable winter conditions.    Specially trained civilian security teams have intensified  their operations to control the intercity highways as a  precaution against any move by the PKK to block them.    Meanwhile, the planned reconnaissance flights over the  border  areas and the Zhalah camp have been postponed because of weather  conditions. A high-ranking official who prefers to remain  anonymous has recalled the government's view that 1994 will be a  year of determined struggle against the PKK. He said: "The  security forces will carry out spontaneous cross-border ground  and air attacks in the future. The attack on the Zhalah camp  has destroyed the PKK's training center. It also removed the  logistics support that camp gave to PKK units in Turkey. Turkey  is able to monitor the movement of PKK militants through its  satellite systems. We waited for an opportunity for a long  time. Significant blows will be inflicted on the PKK  terrorists, who have withdrawn to their shelters because of the  winter. The established targets will be quickly destroyed."</p>

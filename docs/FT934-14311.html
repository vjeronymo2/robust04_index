			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Thatcher wades into defence budget debate BARONESS THATCHER, the former prime minister, yesterday waded into the heated debate over the defence budget, issuing a blunt warning against further deep cuts in spending on the eve of a two-day Commons defence debate. Interviewed on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost, Lady Thatcher steered clear of specific references to the current cabinet dispute but argued that to 'weaken your defence below a certain level is very dangerous'. 'That after all is what we did between World War One and World War Two,' she said. 'There are still aggressors in the world, we have seen it from Serbia.' She continued: 'The only way to make certain that we can beat a tyrant whenever he shows his hand is to keep your defences strong. 'The great thing about President Reagan, President Bush and myself was, whatever we had to do, we never had to think 'have we got the equipment, the trained men, or the latest missiles?' because wise foresight had seen to it that we had.' Her remarks came as Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative chairman of the cross-party Commons defence committee, wrote to Mr John Major, the prime minister, saying that further cuts would put Britain's armed forces under an unacceptable level of stress. Such actions are part of a strong rearguard action launched by opponents of further defence cuts in response to the Treasury's targeting of the Ministry of Defence's Pounds 23.5bn budget in this year's public spending round. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, has demanded a full-scale review of Britain's armed forces if the Treasury refuses to drop its demands for more cuts. Mr Rifkind is expected to use this week's debate - at which several Tory backbenchers will voice their opposition to further cuts - to announce the shelving of plans for a new nuclear missile for the Royal Air Force which would have cost up to Pounds 3bn. He is also expected to outline the government's views on the future of the royal dockyards including moves towards private-sector ownership. In her Frost interview, Lady Thatcher served notice that the rightwing tone of the Conservative party conference had helped to put Mr Major back in her good books. His speech to the party conference this month had led to a 'sea change' in her attitude towards him, she explained. 'Thatcherism is alive and well. I believe that was confirmed very much by the prime minister's speech at the party conference which was back to fundamental principles.'</p>

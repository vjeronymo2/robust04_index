			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz April 17 TASS--Russian troops loyal to  the temporary administration have begun a large-scale operation,  removing mines on the North Ossetian territory where a state of  emergency remains in effect. Lieutenant-General Vladimir  Kulakov, commander of the Vladikavkaz military garrison, told  ITAR-TASS that field engineers have been instructed to draw a  chart of mine fields within a week and check the safety of  economic facilities, transport thoroughfares and gas pipelines.    Several incidents were reported in the Prigorodny region,  where agricultural machinery and several agricultural workers  exploded on mines planted by terrorists. Military sources say  that the situation in North Ossetia where a state of emergency  was extended until May 31, remains rather complex, but kept  under control by Russian peace-keeping forces and local law  enforcement bodies.    Local observers believe that a second round of talks held in  Nalchik by North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov and Ingush  President Ruslan Aushev gave a certain impetus, helping to  relieve tension in the Prigorodny region.    Local observers believe that a discussion of problems of  stabilisation in the region expected to be held by the Russian  Federation Council and the Russian Security Council in the  context of the Russian president's decree on the return of  refugees will help to disentangle a difficult knot of  international problems.    Akhsarbek Galazov met with commander of a special Caucasian  border guard district, Lieutenant-General Viktor Zemtsov, the  press service of the North Ossetian president reported on  Sunday. During the meeting the sides discussed a number of  problems connected with reinforcing Russia's southern borders.  The talks were attended by North and South Ossetian government  officials who expressed concern about the fact that the  introduction of the network of border-check points on the  Transcaucasian road will remove a "transparent border", which  will impede integration processes between the two republics in  the area of science, economy and culture.</p>

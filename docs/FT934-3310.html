			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / NFC to raise Pounds 263m in first rights issue NFC, the UK-based transport and logistics group, yesterday launched a Pounds 263m rights issue - the first since the group was privatised by an employee buy-out in 1982. After the issue, NFC will have net cash of Pounds 89.4m - a turnround from gearing of 53 per cent. It plans to expand its distribution and house-moving businesses internationally. The rights issue reflects NFC's unusual share structure. About 45 per cent of the company's shares are in private hands and 85 per cent of the group's 32,000 employees are shareholders. The 1-for-4 issue is priced at 195p and NFC's shares closed 13p higher at 247p. Small shareholders who do not wish to take up their rights will be offered 14p per new share to which they are entitled by BZW, which is underwriting the issue. Mr Peter Sherlock, NFC's new chief executive, said the issue would increase the number of shares available to institutional investors, but he stressed he did not want to lose NFC's distinctive culture - which includes an annual meeting attended by more than 1,000 shareholders. He said: 'It is much easier to articulate a philosophy of enhancing shareholder value if 85 per cent of the employees are shareholders. But we must not let it act as a restraint on the business, which employees also understand.' Current employees - who constitute 14 per cent of the share register - have double voting rights, but only so long as their total stake is more than 10 per cent. Even if no employees take up their rights, their share of the register would only fall to 11 per cent, so there is no immediate threat to their special position, but it is clearly on the way out. The 14p per new share being offered to investors with fewer than 150,000 shares is the midpoint between the rights issue price and the theoretical ex-rights price, based on Tuesday's closing price of 234p, minus the grossed-up dividend for which the new shares do not rank. BZW will underwrite 62 per cent of the shares at 195p and the 38 per cent held by smaller shareholders at the higher price of 209p. Cazenove and UBS are joint brokers. NFC announced the rights issue alongside annual results which showed a 17 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 104.9m. Results, Page 26 Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alok Mukherjee: "Germany Will Stay Neutral on </F> Kashmir"]    [Text] Bonn, Feb. 3--India has conveyed to the German  Government the latest position in the bilateral talks with  Pakistan at the Foreign Secretary level, held in Islamabad this  January and the follow-up in terms of exchange of "Non-papers."    At Germany's request, India has given a summary of the  discussions that took place. Also handed over are copies of two  non-papers presented by Pakistan, including the one on  plebiscite in Kashmir, which were subsequently rejected by  India, and the six Indian proposals pertaining to  confidence-building measures aimed at improving bilateral  relations.    These documents were handed over during the Foreign  Secretary-level discussions here on Wednesday. The Indian side  was led by the new Foreign Secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, who  flew into Bonn to be part of the Prime Ministerial delegation.  Wednesday's discussions were the fourth in a series of talks  structured by India and Germany for closer political contacts.  The earlier three rounds were conducted by the then Foreign  Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, and his predecessor, Mr. Muchkund  Dubey.    Though maintaining a neutral stance on Kashmir and  Indo-Pakistan relations in general, Germany is interested in  seeing an early resolution of the problem and improvement in  ties between Delhi and Islamabad. The same dilemma confronts  Germany over Pakistan's strident propaganda against India on the  question of alleged human rights abuses.    The talks here took notice of the shrill speech by the  Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, at the Human Rights  Conference in Geneva on Tuesday, when India conveyed its  displeasure at the Pakistani move to try and get a resolution  passed against it. The Indian side has conveyed to Germany what  New Delhi's attitude would be if the resolution is indeed moved  and the consequences.    In response, Germany, typically, remained non-committal,  saying it was neutral on the issue and added that moving such a  resolution would not help in improving Indo-Pakistan bilateral  relations.    The other matter that came up for discussion pertained to  the  restructuring of the United Nations. Germany already filed  papers for election as a non-permanent member in the Security  Council and solicited Indian support. India kept its options  open, saying many others had filed papers and a final decision  on supporting a particular country would be taken later. The  decision would, of course, depend on the status of India's  bilateral relations with the contending countries, it was said.    Strategic alliance: According to observers, the  significance of the Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao's visit to  this country twice within a short span of two years is part of a  strategic alliance India and Germany want to form. While trade  and economic exchanges are in the forefront of such an alliance,  the political aspect is equally significant.    India, on the other hand, is keen on taking advantage of  Germany's new Asia policy under which it wants to focus on the  continent with emphasis on China, Japan and India. India,  therefore, wants closer political contacts with an emerging  global power as well as one of the key nations of Europe.    The idea is to have greater interaction so that Germany will  have a better perception of the Indian position on various  thorny issues, including Kashmir and human rights, which are  being internationalised. The fact that Mr. Kohl in particular  and Germany in general enjoy a good rapport with the United  States administration under Mr. Bill Clinton is also taken note  of.    To keep up political contacts, with Germany a series of  bilateral visits has been planned for the current year, though  this is year of elections, also involving the offices of  President and Chancellor, are to be held in Germany.    Talks at the level of officials are also on for finalising  treaties on double taxation avoidance and extradition and a  bilateral agreement for investment guarantee.</p>

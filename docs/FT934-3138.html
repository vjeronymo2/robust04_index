			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Jobs in councils fall by 50,000 Local government employment in England and Wales fell by 50,000 in the year to September 1993. This allowed a static pay bill in spite of an increase in pay over that period of more than 3 per cent, the Local Government Management Board said yesterday. Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, said the government had broken its assurances that council-tax capping would not lead to job cuts. The government will argue that the figures show it is possible to keep the pay bill flat, as required until 1997, and still award wage rises. The total number of jobs in local government in England and Wales is slightly below 2m. The 50,000 fall excludes the effects of the transfer of further and higher education out of the local authority sector, cuts due to compulsory competitive tendering, and changes associated with schools moving to grant-maintained status. About 11,700 of the total is due to redundancy and the rest derived from natural wastage. The 50,000 fall included 20,800 full-time non-manual workers, 12,700 full-time manuals and 27,700 part-time manuals. Part-time non-manuals increased over the period by 11,700.</p>

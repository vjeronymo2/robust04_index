			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN CHINA;  </P> <P> CRACKDOWN ON DISSENT;  </P> <P> PICTURE OF JIANG EMERGES FROM INTERVIEW AFTER 1986 UNREST;  </P> <P> NEW PARTY CHIEF AT HOME WITH LINCOLN, MARX  </P> <P> During a wave of Chinese student demonstrations at the end of 1986, Jiang  Zemin, then the mayor of Shanghai, noticed wallposters at one of the city's  leading universities quoting the Gettysburg Address: "All men are created  equal."  </P> <P> The proud mayor immediately launched his own propaganda counteroffensive. As  Jiang later boasted in an interview with this reporter and several other  Western correspondents, he stood up before thousands of students at the school,  Jiaotong University, and recited the entire Gettysburg Address to them -- in  English. And then he told the students they didn't understand it.  </P> <P> "You only know Lincoln's speech in words," he told the students. "You don't  know the historical context of the speech." He proceeded to give the students a  lecture whose message was that Chinese society is vastly different from that of  the United States. Lincoln's address referred to American slavery, he  explained, while China's Communist revolution was aimed at overcoming the  exploitation of man by man.  </P> <P> That story illustrates the character of the man who was appointed Saturday to  be the new general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.  </P> <P> On the one hand, Jiang is well educated, a linguist, quite familiar with the  world outside China. He is likely to try to continue China's policy of opening  to the outside world and seeking to attract foreign trade and investment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Uphold Marxism-Leninism  </P> <P> On the other hand, he is a firm believer in upholding traditional  Marxist-Leninist ideology. Over the past three years, Jiang has repeatedly made  clear his firm opposition to the demands for Western-style democracy and  freedom of the press that have been pressed by Chinese students and  intellectuals.  </P> <P> "These students need re-education," Jiang said in the interview. "We have  underestimated the influence of bourgeois liberalization (a Chinese phrase  meaning Western influence) upon them."  </P> <P> In Jiang's attitude toward the current generation of Chinese students, there  was a strong undertone of generational resentment. He acted much like  then-Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, who, during the Vietnam anti-war  protests of the late 1960s, once snarled at a group of student demonstrators,  "When I was a student at Berkeley, we were much tougher than you are."  </P> <P> Jiang recalled that he himself had graduated from Jiaotong University, the same  Shanghai school where he had observed wallposters of the Gettysburg Address.  "Their (living) conditions there now are much better than ours were," he said.  " . . . These students, they lack the deep, real knowledge of Chinese history  and the Chinese revolution."  </P> <P> There is considerable irony in Jiang's appointment Saturday. For, as he  recalled in that interview two years ago, his rise to become mayor of Shanghai  -- the job that launched his career in top-level Chinese politics -- was helped  by, among others, Zhao Ziyang, the man he is now replacing as party chief.  </P> <P> In late 1984, Jiang was working in Beijing as China's minister of the  electronics industry when Zhao, then China's premier, made an inspection tour  of Shanghai. Zhao brought Jiang with him.  </P> <P> The issues at that time were strictly economic ones -- then, there were no  student demonstrations in the city. Shanghai's economy was a mess, and its  industry was decaying and unproductive.  </P> <P> Jiang was a logical companion for Zhao. He was the head of one of China's most  important industrial ministries. Moreover, as he later told reporters, Jiang's  wife was from Shanghai. Jiang himself had gone to school and university there  and had worked there on two previous occasions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mayor of Shanghai  </P> <P> The following year, in 1985, with Zhao's backing, Jiang was appointed Shanghai  mayor. It is one of the hardest and most important jobs in Chinese politics,  and Jiang admitted he had mixed feelings about taking the position.  </P> <P> "To be a mayor is more difficult than being a minister. When I was working as a  minister in Beijing, I didn't have to worry about the weather and the food  supply. That was (the mayor of Beijing's) problem," he said. " . . . As mayor,  you have to handle everything -- food, housing, toilets, everything. For  example, the Shanghainese are very demanding about getting fresh vegetables."  </P> <P> He sprinkles his conversation with Chinese folk wisdom. When Jiang wanted to  demonstrate his determined optimism about the future of Shanghai, he quipped:  "There's an old saying, 'When Lao (Old Man) Wang sells his melons, he always  says they are sweet. He never says they are bitter.' "  </P> <P> In personal style, Jiang is jocular and informal. In the interview, he wore a  Western shirt and tie -- but coupled that with a zippered sweat-suit jacket  instead of a sports jacket.  </P> <P> Like Premier Li Peng, the 62-year-old Jiang has a chubby face and a paunchy  midriff -- a reminder that, unlike the older generation who made the Long  March, China's current crop of leaders now get plenty of food and not much  exercise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bound by Tradition  </P> <P> Despite his knowledge of English, Jiang conducted that March, 1987, interview  in Chinese, speaking to reporters through a translator. That is the traditional  format for interviews with foreign correspondents in China, and Jiang did not  appear to be the sort of person anxious to break with tradition.  </P> <P> He seemed eager to reassure foreigners that, despite the ouster of  then-Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang two months earlier and the  party's ideological campaign against "bourgeois liberalization," China in  general and Shanghai in particular remained open to foreign investment.  </P> <P> In fact, Jiang suggested to reporters, the entire crackdown on student  demonstrations at the beginning of 1987 was aimed at protecting China's policy  of opening to the outside world.  </P> <P> "If the masses are striking on the street, how can we attract the foreign  investors to . . . Shanghai?" he asked.  </P> <P> During the demonstrations in Shanghai in December, 1986, tens of thousands of  students jammed Shanghai's streets. At one point, students at Jiaotong  University had a tense, edgy confrontation with Jiang, their mayor.  </P> <P> "The students told me they have the right to demonstrate," Jiang later told  reporters. "I said, 'You have the right to demonstrate. The (Chinese)  constitution says it. But I personally don't agree that you should. There are  12 million people in Shanghai, and you can't guarantee there won't be people  (in the demonstrations) who will commit crimes.' "  </P> <P> Furthermore, Jiang told the students, "Shanghai is the old nest of the Gang of  Four (the ultra-radicals who led the Cultural Revolution.) Those people would  take advantage of these student demonstrations."  </P> <P> At the time, Jiang was full of praise for Zhao Ziyang, then China's premier.  Zhao had just become the acting Communist Party secretary, the heir-apparent to  China's top leader, Deng Xiaoping.  </P> <P> Zhao had taken over as party leader from Hu Yaobang, who had lost his job in  part because of those huge student demonstrations in Shanghai.  </P> <P> "Our premier is a great premier," Jiang Zemin said at the time. "Why, his  remarks about combatting the influence of bourgeois liberalization in China are  just marvelous."  </P> <P> Now, it will be up to Jiang, a true believer, to see if he can combat Western  influence in China, after the failure and ouster of his two predecessors.  </P></p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / EC may set precedent on Steetley deal with Tarmac EUROPEAN Commission merger control experts may set a legal precedent by allowing the UK authorities to examine a proposed merger of the brick, clay tile and concrete businesses of Steetley and Tarmac, two large UK building materials groups. If the commission allows London to examine the case, it will be the first time since the merger rules came into force in September 1990 that Brussels has given up its right to look at a merger which falls automatically under its jurisdiction. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, must rule on the case before the end of next week. Germany has twice asked for the right to examine mergers, but in both cases it has been overruled. The decision could have an important bearing on a rival Pounds 600m bid by Redland for the whole of Steetley. British regulatory authorities are currently considering whether to refer the bid by Redland - another UK building materials group - for investigation by the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Because of the large size of Steetley's and Tarmac's combined turnover, it has fallen to the European Commission to conduct preliminary investigation into the joint venture plan, rather than the UK authorities. At the end of last month Mr Peter Lilley, the British trade and industry secretary, asked for the right to examine the Steetley/Tarmac deal in London on the grounds that it might affect a 'distinct market' in the UK. Mr Lilley's request - taking advantage of a special clause in the merger rules - seems to be receiving serious consideration. Lex, Page 14</p>

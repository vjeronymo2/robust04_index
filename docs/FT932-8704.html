			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Friction over ERM strains cabinet unity THE PRIME MINISTER'S office yesterday distanced itself from remarks by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, that Britain was unlikely to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism before the next general election. Mr Clarke's weekend comments annoyed Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who has been careful to avoid specifying a timescale for Britain's return to the ERM. They also added to speculation that Mr Clarke is eager to succeed Mr Lamont in a summer cabinet reshuffle. In words believed also to reflect Mr Major's frustration at Mr Clarke's intervention, a Downing Street spokesman said the home secretary had offered 'a personal view'. Although most cabinet ministers agree privately with Mr Clarke that British ERM re-entry is a long way off, the obligations of the Maastricht treaty have restricted public comment on the likely timing. Downing Street made clear yesterday that it did not believe the second stage of European monetary union, due from January 1994, would run according to the Maastricht timetable. A spokesman said Britain was 'most unlikely' to be in the narrow bands of the European exchange rate mechanism, as envisaged under stage two, by then. Mr Clarke, among the most pro-European of cabinet ministers, has annoyed the Treasury by straying into its policy areas - although the home secretary's colleagues believed he was stating the obvious. UK government policy remains that re-entry depends on the conditions set out by Mr Lamont: principally on UK and German monetary policy being closer in line, and on a fundamental review of how 'fault lines' in the ERM can be overcome. The friction between Mr Clarke and Mr Lamont added yesterday to the continuing tension and nervousness within Tory ranks. Amid rows over British Rail privatisation, the government is also preparing for a confrontation tomorrow with its own backbenchers over the threat to rural Post Offices of moves towards the automatic transfer to bank accounts of state benefits. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, will use a Commons debate to try to calm Tory MPs' fears that manifesto commitments to a nationwide network of Post Offices could be broken in the quest for cost savings. Yesterday Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security spokesman, said the government should withdraw any leaflets given to pensioners which do not make clear that decisions on the method of payment will lie with the customer. Rightwing Tory MPs last night increased pressure on Mr Major for a cabinet reshuffle after their own inquest into the Tories' recent disastrous local and by-election performances. A meeting of about 35 members of the 92 Group heard concerns about Mr Lamont's unpopularity. Afterwards a senior MP in the group said the prime minister had to heal the wounds inflicted on the party by the Maastricht treaty by 'mutual respect' for its pro-Europe and Euro-sceptic wings. The 92 is to make a presentation, urging greater emphasis on law and order and deregulation, to Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, later this week.</p>

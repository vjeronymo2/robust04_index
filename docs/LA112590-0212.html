			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A  </P> <P> Q: As a conservative, 35-year-old first-time investor, I'd like advice on  something. Changing Times magazine said the value of Coca-Cola stock is  expected to rise substantially in the next few years. What does Wall Street  think? -- Amherst, N.Y.  </P> <P> A: Joseph Frazzano, one of the top beverage analysts on Wall Street, likes  Coca-Cola as both a short-term and long-term investment. "I think it's one of  the better worldwide players, and it will generally outperform the stock  market," says Frazzano, who works at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Frazzano is predicting that Coca-Cola's stock, now selling at around $46, will  be 50% to 75% higher within the next two years. And you'd have a hard time  finding any expert right now who thinks the overall market will perform  anywhere near that level.  </P> <P> Coke's near-term outlook is also bright. With the dollar much weaker this year,  the revenues from the ocean of soft drink that Coca-Cola sells overseas will  get translated back into the dollar at a favorable rate. Keep in mind, however,  that when the economic condition of this country improves, the dollar will  rally and Coke will have to contend with poor currency translations. Coca-Cola  now gets 80% of its profits from overseas sales. So it is truly resistant to a  U.S.-only recession, Frazzano says. Its earnings would be hurt only if  economies of the rest of the world followed the U.S. down.  </P> <P> Frazzano believes that Coke will earn $2.05 a share this year and $2.40 in  1991. That compares to a profit of $1.68 a share in 1989. The average 1990  estimate from all analysts is $2.10 a share, $2.37 a share for 1991.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q: I have a 1923 Sears, Roebuck catalogue called "Thrift Book of a Nation." It  originally sold for $2.95 and is in fair condition. Is it worth anything? --  North Hollywood  </P> <P> A: The Chicago retailer started issuing its catalogues in 1888. That first one  featured only watches and jewelry. The first full-sized general merchandise  catalogue came out in 1896. Sears says it doesn't have any idea what old  catalogues are worth. But Gary Garland, an expert on such things at Swan  Galleries in New York City, says that if the catalogue is genuine (and not one  of the many replicas) it could be worth anywhere from $150 to $250 "in decent  shape."  </P> <P> The "decent shape" part of his answer is problematic since Sears didn't design  these catalogues to last long. After all, they were put out twice a year in the  1920s. A catalogue that is "not in good shape," says Garland, might only be  worth $50. "It depends on the extent of the damage," he says.  </P> <P> Of course, any collectible is only worth what you are able to get someone to  pay for it. And the first step is making contact with potential buyers. Garland  and several other experts said so-called paper shows -- antique fairs for paper  documents -- may be the best way to hook up with would-be buyers.  </P> <P> These shows can be difficult to locate. They tend to be small and poorly  advertised. There is a monthly trade publication called the "Paper and  Advertising Collector" that lists "paper sales." And maybe the Ephemera Society  could be of help at P.O. Box 37, Schoharie, N.Y. 12157. It specializes in paper  collectibles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q: My wife and I have 10 utility stocks, with both of us as the owners. Upon my  death, would she have to send certified death notices to all the firms'  registrars? Also, we have only one heir -- a daughter. How would my wife go  about creating a joint-tenant survivorship with her? Could she request that the  registrars add our daughter's name as a joint owner? Or would she have to sell  the stock and repurchase it in her name and my daughter's? This, of course,  would involve capital gains and broker fees. -- Hemet  </P> <P> A: If you die, your wife should send a letter to the transfer agent named on  the stock certificates stating that she is interested in making your daughter  the co-owner. Your wife should sign the letter, include her Social Security  number and have the letter notarized. She'll also have to prove you are  deceased.  </P> <P> You can also change the ownership on the stock right now. Both you and your  wife would sign the letter and have it notarized.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q: In today's economic environment, with the deficit, recession, inflation and  the Middle East crisis, how will gold fare in the next couple of years? I was  told that gold is very undervalued now, and I have invested in the precious  metal. -- Los Angeles  </P> <P> A: How will gold do? Who knows. There are as many opinions as there are people  who wear jewelry. But here's one person's view.  </P> <P> August Arace, a gold expert at Tucker Anthony Inc., does not think gold will do  well in the next few years. Arace, who is the portfolio manager for the Freedom  Gold &amp; Government Trust mutual fund, says "the outlook is bearish."  </P> <P> Arace has been down on gold for 10 years. He says that ever since the U.S.  government deregulated banks in the early 1980s, real interest rates (after  adjusting for inflation) have been high.  </P> <P> "This has been a hammer on gold," says Arace, who advises his clients to keep  no more than 5% of their assets in gold.  </P> <P> Questions for John Crudele can be sent to P.O. Box 610, Lincroft, N.J. 07738.  </P></p>

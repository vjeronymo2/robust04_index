			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Additional rail links to Heathrow urged BAA, which owns and operates Heathrow airport, hopes to encourage the creation of additional railway links to Britain's busiest airport. It will announce tomorrow that it is to spend Pounds 500,000 on a feasibility study to look at ways of linking the airport with the regions. BAA has no plans to finance the construction of further rail links or to own and operate them itself but it wants to encourage the train operating companies and Railtrack, the state-owned track and signal operator, to do so. BAA has contributed to the Pounds 300m cost of building the Heathrow express link with Paddington station in central London. It is now looking to establish links with the West Country and Wales, the Midlands and the north. South West Trains, which operates services from London Waterloo to Southampton and Portsmouth, is keen to open a direct link from Waterloo to Heathrow. This would require only a short link between existing lines and the airport. BAA said additional rail links were seen as complementing rather than replacing motorway connections with the airport. The government is nevertheless under strong pressure to replace road-building programmes with spending on public transport. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, is reviewing the government's road-building programme and cuts in it are expected in the Budget later this month. One of the most controversial schemes still in the programme is the widening of parts of the M25 motorway to up to 14 lanes. Airport traffic accounts for only a small proportion of vehicles using the M25 so improved rail links would make little difference to congestion on the motorway.</p>

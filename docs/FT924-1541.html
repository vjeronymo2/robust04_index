			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Swissair to open register to foreigners SWISSAIR, the Swiss airline group, will swap all its bearer shares into registered ones and open its share register to foreigners. At the moment, foreigners can only buy the group's non-voting dividend right certificates. After by-law changes planned for the next annual meeting, no single shareholder would be allowed to hold more than 3 per cent of the shares or exercise over 3 per cent of the votes. However, shareholders on the record today with larger holdings will be allowed to hold and register them. Swissair said it would take further measures to ensure Swiss majority ownership of the group in conformity with its bilateral air services agreements. Baloise Holding, the Swiss insurance group, said its consolidated pre-tax profit for 1992 would be slightly lower than last year's SFr140m (Dollars 99.32m) but the SFr30 dividend would be maintained. The group said premium income would rise 3 per cent to SFr6.3bn. Life business growth was weaker than in 1991 but satisfactory.</p>

Carlos] </F>   [Text] Batangas Bay has been chosen as one of three pilot  areas in Asia to showcase a marine pollution management project  geared at helping mitigate pollution damage in East Asian seas.    Once fully operational, it will be the first program of its  kind where pollution and its risks are confronted and studied in  depth for more systematic and effective management.    Cosponsored by the United Nations Development Programme  (UNDP) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the project  will have an initial funding of $8 billion.    The two other projects will be piloted in Xiamen Bay in  China  and Malacca Strait in Malaysia.    The project is designed to strengthen East Asia's capability  in marine pollution management by demonstrating the  effectiveness of an integrated coastal zone management approach.    The mechanism provides a conceptual framework within which  the cumulative, multisectoral environmental consequences of  industrialization can be managed to remain within tolerable  limits.    With the project in place, rapidly industrializing countries  in East Asia will have an idea on managing marine resources on a  sustainable basis.    The program will support the development of a regional  marine  pollution information management and monitoring network.    It also seeks to strengthen the capacity of the region and  the countries to enforce and comply with international  conventions in controlling marine pollution.    Equally important, the project also aims to initiate  sustainable financing options for marine pollution management.    The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)  will play the lead role in the project's implementation.    DENR is hopeful the project can also mitigate pollution  damage in the waters of Manila Bay, Lingayen Bay, Tanon Strait,  Calancan Bay, and Iligan Bay.    DENR's Robert Jara told BUSINESS WORLD one of the reasons  Batangas Bay was chosen as a pilot area was on the active role  of government and the private sector in protecting the bay's  marine resources.</p>

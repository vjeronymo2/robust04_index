			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A judge refused Friday to lower the $1-million bail for an Imperial Beach man  accused of using a hunting rifle to shoot a 12-year-old Mexican boy at the  border.  </P> <P> Dwight Ray Pannel, 23, is charged with murder in the May 18 shooting death of  Emilio Jiminez Bejines, who had just crossed the international border with his  family.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Luis Aragon said during Friday's bail review hearing that  his office has a statement from a person who quoted Pannel as saying he had  robbed some Mexican immigrants earlier in the day for beer money.  </P> <P> In refusing to lower the bail, Municipal Judge Robert C. Coates said that  Pannel had proven himself to have "very low integrity." The judge said Pannel  is "someone who has behaved with contempt for human safety, life and dignity."  </P> <P> A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for Jan. 25.  </P></p>

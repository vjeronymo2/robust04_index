			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Krezimir Zubak, president of the </F> Croat-Muslim Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, by Ana Fernandez  in Geneva; date not given]    [Text] Geneva -- Krezimir Zubak has been president of the  brand-new Croat-Muslim Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina since 1  June. Enormously discreet and of a negotiatory turn of mind,  this 46-year-old lawyer and father of two has exchanged weapons,  which gravely wounded him, for words to end this war which has  been devastating the former Yugoslav republic for over two  years. On Bosnia's future, Zubak says that Serbs, Croats, and  Muslims must coexist. "We have lived and will have to live  together."    Although it is not the first time that he has come to Geneva  -- he has been a member of the Croat delegation on many  occasions -- the new round of UN-backed negotiations is proving  a baptism of fire for this "political amateur," as he describes  himself, since on this occasion he shares the billing in the  same delegation with Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, who, at  least publicly, calls the shots.    [Fernandez] Does the setting up of the Croat-Muslim  Federation mean that the differences between these two peoples,  who were enemies until a few weeks ago, have disappeared?    [Zubak] The setting up of the Bosnian Federation is an  extremely important step for creating trust between Muslims and  Croats. With it, a political agreement which satisfies both  peoples' interests has been reached, and we believe that it is  also a good framework which can accommodate and satisfy a third  people's interests.    [Fernandez] But after two years of war and ethnic cleansing,  is it still possible to believe that the Serbs will wish to join  this federation?    [Zubak] The war will have to end some day, and it will have  to end with a political agreement. There have been several wars  in our nation's history, and all of them were ended. This war  will be ended, too.    [Fernandez] Do the Croat and Muslim military chiefs also  accept this agreement without reservations?    [Zubak] The agreement which has been reached is a package of  measures. When we concluded the political agreement, we signed  a military agreement which has now begun to be implemented, and  in fact it is the one which is producing better results on the  ground. Immediately after the signing of the military  agreement, the hostilities between Croats and Muslims ceased,  and this means that the two peoples have achieved a political  solution, which is the way to end this war. We have lived and  will have to live together. Let us hope that the Serbs will  also reach the same conclusion.    [Fernandez] How do you explain the many turnabouts by the  Croats, who at the beginning of the war were on the side of the  Muslims, then of the Serbs, and now of the Muslims again?    [Zubak] I believe that this is a mistaken conclusion. The  Croats have always had a very clear political option, and this  option was to set up a federal state or a confederation. We  have always been in favor of Bosnia-Herzegovina's being a  pluralist country. Now we have agreed with the Bosnians the  framework for this country, which means that our political aim  is being achieved.    [Fernandez] What are your territorial claims for the new  federation?    [Zubak] We claim 58 percent of the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, based on the 1991 census, in which the  Bosnians and Croats were the majority, and this is in line with  the principles expressed by the international community, which  rejects ethic cleansing and aggression. The offer which we  currently have gives us 51 percent, and the remaining 49 percent  for the Serbs.    [Fernandez] But the international community supports the  51-49 percent plan, including the United States, which initially  supported your 58-percent claim.    [Zubak] This means that they do not respect their own  principles. We are prepared to reach a compromise if  Bosnia-Herzegovina is a viable state and if the international  community gives us assurances that this agreement will be  implemented.    [Fernandez] Are you in favor of lifting the arms embargo  imposed on the Bosnians?    [Zubak] I repeat that nothing is resolved through war. I am  in favor of resolving problems through political agreements. If  this were not possible, it would be just to grant the Croats and  Bosnians the right to defend ourselves.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BUSINESS-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 30 May -- "The adoption of a new land code  has been necessitated by a discrepancy between current land laws  and the Russian constitution, as well as a number of  presidential decrees and government resolutions," according to  Russian Federation Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin, speaking  to the participants in a meeting at the government house. The  main disadvantage of the 1991 code, i.e. the lack of the concept  of "land ownership," has been eliminated in the draft of the law  submitted today for debate by heads of administrations.    For the first time a land law stipulates a procedure for  acquiring land by juridical persons (by transferring land plots  and parcels of land to enterprises' authorized capital or  through purchase of land), V. Chernomyrdin said.    The draft of the new land code also contains a description  of  procedures for land deals by physical persons (buying, selling,  or mortgage operations), as well as giving or inheriting land.  It stipulates that owners of inherited land plots can become  owners if they wish. However, if a land plot is larger than the  maximum size allowed for a transfer of land ownership free of  charge, the remaining part may be kept as non-transferable  inheritance or bought out in credit.    In accordance with the current constitution, the draft of  the  land code transfers a larger proportion of land regulation  rights to the constituent parts of the federation, unlike the  present land law, the prime minister said.</p>

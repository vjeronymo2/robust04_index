			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- Southeast Asian countries  have indicated a strong willingness to strengthen financial  cooperation with the Republic of China [ROC], Samuel C. Shieh,  governor of the Central Bank of China (CBC), said Saturday [9  April].    "The willingness was repeatedly expressed when central bank  governors of major Southeast Asian countries met here earlier  this week," Shieh said.    The participants, he stressed, had been deeply impressed by  Taiwan's dynamic economy during three days of discussions.    Central bank governors from the forums's nine member states  -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,  Sri Lanka, South Korea, Nepal and the host ROC -- participated  in the discussions April 6-8 about how to promote regional  financial cooperation. Cambodia, Fiji, Laos, and Tonga also  attended the event as observers.    With the economic and trade ties between Taiwan and  Southeast  Asian countries growing closer, strengthening of financial  cooperation is necessary, Shieh said.    As to complaints of financial investment barriers set by  Southeast Asian countries, he said those countries are already  pushing for the easing of restrictions on the establishment of  branches by foreign banks.    ROC investment in Southeast Asia totals around US$16.5  billion, making Taiwan a major capital supplier to the region.    The central bank governors exchanged views on topics ranging  from international currency cooperation, world economic reports,  currency policies of the countries in the region, foreign  exchange management and financial outlooks.    The forum, a government-level regional financial cooperation  organization founded in 1966, will meet in Nepal next year.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / MPs pass six-hour Sunday shopping for stores MPs last night voted to allow large stores to open for up to six hours on Sundays and small shops to open all day, ending years of law breaking by retail chains. After an emotional debate on the Sunday Trading Bill, the Commons rejected alternative plans for complete deregulation or tight restrictions which would have closed all but the smallest shops. The decision was taken on a free vote conceded by the government after the failure of two previous attempts to reform the ignored 1950 Shops Act. It was welcomed by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, an alliance of large retailers which campaigned strongly for the six-hour option. Baroness Jay, the council's chairman, said the decision reflected public opinion. 'Consumers have been given the freedom to shop at a time and in a manner of their choosing,' she said. Mr Nigel Whittaker, executive director of Kingfisher, parent company of B &amp; Q, Comet, Superdrug and Woolworths, said the vote was a victory for consumers. 'It will be a great relief to millions of shoppers,' he said. The six-hour option was approved by 333 votes to 258, a majority of 75, after deregulation had been defeated by 404 votes to 174, a majority of 230. The restrictive option, backed by the Keep Sunday Special (KSS) campaign and a group of retailers, including Marks and Spencer, was defeated by 304 votes to 286, a majority of 18. Mr Michael Schluter, director of KSS, said the campaign would explore 'every avenue we can use to lessen the impact of the bill on the vulnerable sectors of society'. He said they would fight 'line by line' during the committee stage to ameliorate the worst effects of the bill. The outcome represents a decisive defeat for the government, which made no secret of its preference for deregulation. Most of the cabinet voted initially for deregulation, including Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary. Most then voted for six-hour opening. Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, was the only cabinet minister to vote for tight regulation. He was joined by Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, a member of the supermarket family. Mr Sainsbury also voted against the six-hour option, for which J. Sainsbury had campaigned. The outcome prompted angry scenes on the Labour benches as leftwing MPs protested at the party leadership's endorsement of the six-hour option. Campaigners rejoice, Page 12</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BOARD OKS $12.8-MILLION BUDGET  </P> <P> The Ojai Unified School District has adopted a $12.8-million budget for the  next school year.  </P> <P> "We are not cutting programs or staff," said Leo Molitor, assistant  superintendent of business services.  </P> <P> But he said the district is not painting some of its buildings or repairing  some roofs because of limited funds. The district had a $12.4-million budget  last year.  </P> <P> "If we get more money from the state or we get more students than predicted,  then we could make some changes," Molitor said.  </P> <P> The budget, approved unanimously by the school board, is based on a projected  enrollment of about 3,350 students. In the 1988-89 school year, enrollment  increased by 27 students.  </P> <P> The budget includes no pay increase for the district's 141 teachers, although  the Ojai Federation of Teachers has asked for a 12% pay raise next year.  Contract talks between the district and teachers union will begin Sept. 17.  THIA BELL  </P></p>

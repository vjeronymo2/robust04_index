			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Wellcome worldwide share issue set to meet target WELLCOME TRUST, the UK medical charity, last night appeared to have met its target of selling more than half of its 73.5 per cent stake in Wellcome, the drugs group. The issue, concluded in spite of adverse market conditions, would be the largest non-privatisation secondary offer ever achieved. Robert Fleming, the merchant bank handling the global share sale, is understood to have received offers for more than 360m shares at a price above 800p. The trust has indicated it wanted to sell about 330m shares. Wellcome's shares fell 4p to 826p. The shares are likely to be offered at a small discount close to the 800p floor set by the trust. Demand in the UK and the US is understood to have strengthened considerably in the past few days and to have exceeded targets. In the UK, applications for about 200m shares may have been received against a target of 150m. US applications are thought to total 80m-100m against a target of 80m. The Japanese syndicate, led by Nikko Securities and Nomura Securities, is expected to have received applications for nearly 20m shares against a target of 25m. The poor state of the Japanese equity market has made it difficult to release funds. Demand from continental Europe has been poor, while Canada has been particularly disappointing. The UK retail offer received applications about Pounds 100m of stock, less than the Pounds 180m set aside, representing 15m shares against a target of 20m. The scale of the offer and the strike price will be decided by Mr Roger Gibbs, trust chairman. A decision will be made by Sunday when allocations will be made. The seven non-UK regional syndicates will fly to London for meetings with Fleming today. Allocations will be decided by the level of bids and their timing as well as their quality. The trust and company are anxious for an orderly after-market and will allocate shares to those appearing most willing to keep them. Fleming is also understood to be anxious to punish those who drove the company's share price down in the weeks before the offer by refusing them shares. The trust and its advisers have maintained a 'green-shoe' option which allows Fleming to buy back shares for the trust from the market if it considers there has been over-allocation.

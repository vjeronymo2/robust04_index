			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: US economy Wall Street's calm reaction to yesterday's much-improved manufacturing purchasing managers index for January is the latest reminder that US equity prices are discounting plenty of economic recovery. After January's unexpectedly strong rise in construction spending, the market appears to have concluded that it will take either a nasty set of employment figures later this week, or poor retail sales for February, to restore the possibility of a further interest rate cut. In the meantime, evidence of recovery is gradually coming from a broader range of sources. The central issue now is the extent of the revival from what looked like the beginnings of a dip last November - not least because a robust rise in the economy could yet be evident in time to tip the political scales in George Bush's favour. The employment component of yesterday's purchasing managers index shows that jobs were still being shed last month, albeit at a slower rate. Fear of unemployment remains the dominant sentiment among consumers. While that is the case, the US economy is poorly positioned for a sustained recovery, if only because the unwillingness to spend - also confirmed in yesterday's figures - will be hard to shift. But perhaps that matters less than the fact that recovery is visible at all.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <H5>  Katsuhiro Nozaki and Hiroshi Asakura </H5>   [Text] The liquid crystal industry is rushing into a new  era. Color TFT, the leader, has abruptly changed the market,  panel technology, and materials and components technologies. If  the last four to five years were the start-up phase of the first  generation, the next few years will be second generation which  will be an active period. In the market, the spread of new  useful situations like mobile computing and green personal  computers has a strong affect on the spread of liquid crystal.  Liquid crystals will also be widely spread by the full-scale  realization of small-sized video games and car navigation. To  respond to these demands, there will be rapid progress in  lowering the power consumption, widening the visual field, and  lowering the reflectance of the panels. Power consumption will  be 1W per VGA panel, wide viewing angle technology will become  mass production technology, and products with vertical viewing  angles of 80 will become common. A 2% surface  reflectance  has been achieved. Term 2 lines bet on by leading major panel  manufacturers will begin operation in 1994 with the goal of  three times the productivity as term 1 lines. Components and  materials will move towards lower prices and get into full gear.  New technologies like unpolished glass substrates will appear  one after another.  <H5>  CONTENTS </H5> <H5>  Part 1.

The applications market, the panel  technology, and the components and materials technologies have  all changed dramatically. In addition to conventional notebook  computers in the applications market, the performance of TFT  color LCDs matches the new trends of mobile computing and green  PCs. Moreover, the market base for the full-scale realization of  car navigation will expand. Therefore, the development of panel  technology for these applications is very active. Low power  consumption, wide viewing angle, and low reflectance  technologies are beginning to be applied to mass-produced  panels. In order to expand the market, price reductions will  continue for components and materials to reach &yen;50,000 for  10-inch models by 1995.    According to Isamu Washizuka, Sharp's executive director,  LCD  production is ``at the brink of rushing headlong into the second  generation.'' The formation of a business base centered on TFT  LCDs was completed in 1993. Hiroshi Shiba, NEC's executive  director, believes the ``period of rapid progress'' will finally  arrive in 1994. The production line for the second generation is  starting and will, according to Koichi Suzuki, manager of  Toshiba's Liquid Crystal Department, ``give form to new  applications'' that will certainly reach one billion yen in  production.    LCD production began a few years before 1993.[.sup]1[/] If  those years are designated the first generation of TFT color  LCDs, the next few years beginning in 1994 will be the era of  the second generation. The reason is the abrupt change in the  applications market, panel technology, and components and  materials technologies.  <H3>  Dramatic change in the market, panel technology, and  components and materials technologies </H3>   In the applications market, in addition to laptop and  notebook personal computers and compact portable televisions,  the core of the TFT color LCD market in the first generation,  the market is strongly advancing with products that incorporate  new ideas about mobile computing in the second generation (Figs.  1 and 2). The market will expand for TFT LCD camera video and  portable game devices, as well as for vehicle-installed market  through the realization of car navigation.          In order to provide energy savings in offices and to avoid  the spread of electromagnetic radiation that is becoming a  problem of CRTs, desktop personal computers that use TFT LCDs  have appeared in accordance with the Energy Star Program in the  United States. Even in the desktop world where CRTs are  unrivaled, the conversion to color TFTs will gain headway in the  future.    According to a survey conducted by the Japan Electronic  Machinery Manufacturer's Association, if the price of color TFTs  for 10-inch VGA (640x480 pixels) becomes &yen;60,000, the scale  of that year's demand will approach &yen;800  billion.[.sup]2[/] Only TFT color LCDs will reach one  trillion yen in 1996.    In addition to advancing towards mobility, panel technology  will improve the visibility and enhance the portability, then it  will be applied to mass production (Fig. 3). Advances in low  power consumption are continuing to realize portability and in  wider viewing angles and lower reflectance for better visibility.       To expand the market, panel manufacturers will start term 2  lines which are full-scale mass production lines in 1994 (Table  1). To lower the costs of the panels to be produced, in addition  to improving line productivity and yield, lowering the prices of  parts and materials will become decisive. These hard to decrease  prices will finally begin to fall in 1994 (Fig. 4).       -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

There are ot-|  |her manufacturers, like Sharp, that have large-scale plans that will s-|  |oon be implemented. [.sup]*[/]The investment, the beginning of const-|  |ruction, the operating period, and the level of mass production by San-|  |sei Denshi is estimated for this article.                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------       <H5>  The LCD market opened up by mobile and green PCs </H5>   In the future, information devices that can be used  ``anytime, anywhere, by anyone'' will open up a large market  directed at individuals. A concrete image of the mobile  computing to accomplish this has appeared. Regardless of whether  thinness, light weight, low consumption power, and rich  expressive power for implementing portability are obtained,  there will be no expansion without color LCD panels.    Improving the portability of conventional personal computers  was clearly shown in the marketing of subnotebook computers  which are more compact than notebook computers. IBM Japan began  to manufacture ThinkPad 220 last May. It uses a 7.7-inch,  VGA-compatible STN-monochrome LCD manufactured by Kyocera. As a  result, Chikara Maruyama, executive director of the Personal  Systems Division of IBM Japan Information Systems, stated the  true meaning is the move into high-level personal computers that  can be carried around.    Of course, the Windows operating system and applications  used  on desktop personal computers will be used unchanged and the  office environment can be reproduced anywhere. LCD panels  somewhat smaller than conventional 10-inch class are used. In  the 10-inch class, the 8.4-inch panel from Sharp can be diverted  unchanged for use in subnotebooks.    On the other hand, personal digital assistants (PDA), the  electronic notebooks, also were beginning to appear on the  market in 1993. MessagePad from Apple Computer, Inc. in the US  seems to be getting underway favorably with orders for several  thousand a week since they went on sale in August.[.sup]3[/]  Sharp's PI-3000 is a portable information device for everyday  use. The &yen;65,000 price will be cheaper than those of  conventional products and enter the same price range as advanced  system notebooks.[.sup]4[/] Although it can be only used as  at close distances, an infrared data communication function is  also supplied.    Still, STN-monochrome displays are the only displays used in  the PDA field. If viewed by eyes accustomed to the office  environment that is moving towards color, Katsuichi Tomida,  sales promotion manager at NEC Personal Computer Sales  Promotion, feels it is obvious that ``these monochrome displays  will become unsatisfactory within the next one to two years.''  Even with price concessions, Sharp's Mr. Washizuka believes  ``the wave towards color TFTs will even advance into portable  information devices.''    The trend of green computers that considers energy savings  in  offices and improved environmental conservation is strong  motivation for converting the CRTs in desktop computers to TFT  color LCDs.[.sup]5[/] In the future, Mr. Maruyama of IBM  Japan's Information Systems sees these trends ``gradually  expanding and permeating'' throughout the world under government  direction. This is a model market example capable of  demonstrating the true value of LCD panels. In addition, new  proposals are also appearing where LCDs will eat into the  desktop market but not as replacements (see pp. 74-75 for  details).  <H5>  Outdoor measures that adopt new technologies </H5>   Even in the amusement field, the demand for carrying  displays  outdoors has become strong. The demand for color was strong from  the beginning. In contrast to character-based PDAs that transmit  information, the objective is to enjoy images and graphics. In  addition to portability, moving images and full-color screens  are demanded. TFT color LCDs are being advanced by PDAs at this  time.    New technologies were installed in the LCD ViewCam made by  Sharp for full-scale outdoor use. One technology is  antireflective processing of the screen's surface by multilayer  film to prevent the reflection of external light.[.sup]6[/]  According to Yoshio Okano, Sharp's A1176 Project team leader,  anti-flare processing in conventional OA ``cannot handle strong  sunlight.''[.sup]7[/] Also, a semihot tube with low power  consumption was used in the backlight lamp for high luminance;  an Ushio Denki product is used.    The realization of the car navigation market was apparent.  The market scale was 150,000 to 160,000 units/year in 1993; this  will rapidly expand to about 500,000 units/year in 1995 and one  million units/year in 2000 (Matsushita Communications  Industries). Since a prerequisite of navigation systems is use  will be in narrow vehicles and highly accurate color is required  in displays of map information, TFT color LCDs will be used.    Although today the only function available confirms the  position of the vehicle on a screen, in addition to the  infrastructure provisions of traffic information like vehicle  information and communication systems (VICS), more varied  service can be provided.[.sup]8[/] Based on this, market  expansion can be expected by opening the market beyond the  conventional navigation function.    Furthermore, by combining with the cellular phone network,  individual data communication becomes possible and the car  becomes a ``moving office'' (Susumu Nakata, business manager of  Automotive Devices Division of Matsushita Communications).  Because the developments for information systems that accomplish  the uses of personal computers can be expected, the market  expansion effect will be huge for TFT color LCDs.  <H5>  Advances in portable technology and lower costs </H5>   In panel technology aimed at these markets, low power  consumption that reached 1W in VGA-compatible panels and a  2%  screen reflectance made outdoor use possible (for details see  ``Rapid Advances of TFT in the Second Generation: Reflective  Color To Be Marketed by 1996,'' pp. 76-82).    Term 2 lines of major panel manufacturers will finally start  up one after another beginning in 1994 (see the article on pp.  71-73). In these lines, productivity will be three times better  than term 1 lines. In addition, the mother glass will be larger  and the processing capacity of the production equipment will be  increased substantially.    In order to achieve the &yen;50,000 goal for 10-inch panels  in 1995, the prices of materials and components which were  difficult to decrease from 1991 to 1993 will finally begin to  decrease by 20% annually. The material manufacturers will  introduce new technology that can decrease costs in each field  (see ``Successive Technologies Like Unpolished Glass Target  &yen;50,000 Panels'' on pp. 83-87). The application to mass  production will begin sometime in 1994.  Footnotes    1. After the triumph of TFT color LCDs over the various  types  of flat-panel displays in 1990, investments were made to begin  operating large-scale mass production factories. The ability to  obtain over 50% yield in large-scale lines was confirmed  by  1992. The market rapidly expanded in 1993 primarily because of  notebook personal computers. The 1993 production costs for TFT  LCDs at Sharp, the largest LCD maker, are &yen;100 billion. This  was the first sign of a reversal from simple matrix models  centered for STNs costing on 75 billion yen.    2. ``R&amp;D Report on the Year 2000 Vision for Electronic  Display Production,'' Japan Electronic Machinery  Manufacturers Association, pp. 1-26, July 1993.    3. Manufactured by Sharp. The same product is marketed in  the  United States under the name ExpertPad.    4. The Bible-sized advanced system notebook from Philo Fax  Ltd. in the UK is prices at &yen;150,000. The usual price range  for advanced products is from &yen;50,000 to &yen;60,000.  Popular products are &yen;10,000 to &yen;30,000.    5. This is the name of the series of low-power consumption  personal computers developed at IBM Co. in the US in accordance  with the Energy Star Program of the US Environmental Protection  Agency.    6. This method prevents reflection by forming multiple films  on a polarizer of the liquid crystal module by vapor deposition  and lowers the reflection of external light.    7. Although this method prevents the reflection of external  light as in antireflective processing, the unevenness on the  surface of the screen in this method and scatters reflected  light. Therefore, production is less costly, but there are the  problems of a decrease in the effect of decreasing reflected  light, lower panel transmittance, and lower resolution of the  screen.    8. This system supplies in real-time traffic information to  drivers and is promoted by the National Police Agency, Ministry  of Posts and Telecommunications, and the Ministry of  Construction. Traffic congestion information, accident  information, regulation information, and parking information are  included in the data. Information is supplied by radio by  beacons, multiplexed FM transmission, and tele-terminals. A  navigation system equipped with a communication terminal is  required at the receiver. With the objective of full-scale  operation in 1995, the related ministries and agencies are  consulting with each other.  <H3>  Rapid Advances of TFT in the Second Generation: Reflective  Color To Be Marketed by 1996 </H3> <H5>  Isamu Washizuka, Executive Director at Sharp </H5>   LCDs have entered the second generation. During the first  generation which began in 1988, TFT color LCDs matured while  contributing to STN LCDs. In the future, TFTs will advance  rapidly not as simple parts, but for widespread use as important  components in products (Fig. A).       In 1996, the TFT market will exceed &yen;700 billion.  Seventy  percent will be VGA or half VGA (320x240 pixels) screens. The  price of 10-inch models will without a doubt become &yen;50,000  by the end of 1995 to 1996, and a total of 10 million units will  be sold annually.    There are two major sources of energy at work in the LCD  industry as we move towards this 1996 market. The first is  development to replace CRT monitors larger than 10.4 inches.  Because of activity to promote energy conservation by office  automation equipment in Europe and in the United States, using  LCDs in desktop monitors has become important. Since it is  possible both VGA and XGA will be required, the preparation of  XGA panels must be guaranteed.    The second source is the development of reflective color for  portable information terminals, like PDAs. To ensure  portability, backlights must not be used and power consumption  must be on the order of milliwatts. The development of internal  drivers by low temperature polycrystalline Si is indispensable.  Even in areas where 6- or 7-inch VGA or half VGA panels are  used, TFTs are likely winners.  <H3>  Reviving LSI Technology Supporting Both High Image Quality  and Low Cost </H3> <H5>  Hiroshi Shiba, Executive Director at NEC </H5>   TFT color LCDs will become a major product for the next  dozen  years and the future is truly looked forward to. While laying  the foundation of the business lasted through 1993, the plan is  to launch stabilization and expansion in 1994 (Fig. B). Since  personal computers are steadily becoming notebook sized and  gaining color, the urgency is great. The term 2 line at  Kagoshima was settled in three months and operations began in  December 1993. Investment up to 1996 will total 110 billion yen  and a system will be established for a monthly production of 170  to 180 thousand panels at the shipping base.       Next, effort will be made to develop audio visual equipment  using analog full-color technology. Since polishing is performed  in conventional LCD technology, the business of panels for OA  equipment has shrunk. In the future, the image field including  multimedia will be reclaimed. For example, 6.5-inch VGA panels  for use in subnotebooks can also be used in high-resolution  personal televisions.    Basically, LSI technology that has been fostered is used  freely and will coexist with lowering costs while pursuing  highest image quality. Therefore, when the panel has as simple a  structure as possible, the burden of improving the images is on  LSI. Since the price of an LSI is determined by its chip area,  no matter how good the circuitry's performance is, costs can be  reduced if size is reduced. Although the reliance on parts is  the same at other companies, LSI is a unique field where as much  invention as possible occurs.  <H3>  Three Times the Productivity Confirmed for the Term 2 Line:  Largest Panel Size with 4 Bevels </H3> <H5>  Koichi Suzuki, Manager in Toshiba's LCD Division </H5>   In 1994, LCD panels will begin to directly respond to new  demands. The second generation line will start and a new market  will be created (Fig. C).       The established goal was to realize three times the  productivity in the term 2 line. Verification took place in the  prototype line at the Fukaya Works. By improving productivity,  1.5 million 9.4-inch panels can be shipped annually by DTI's  term 2 line. The term 3 line will have larger glass substrates  and five times the productivity of the term 1 line is expected.  However, the operating period will probably be 1997 at the  earliest. Equipment development will not catch up. The term 2.5  line is designed to fill the gap. Glass substrate dimensions are  not changed from the term 2 line.    The 1995 target of &yen;50,000 for only the 10-inch class  has  the productivity of the term 2 line. Moreover, its realization  is possible with the added condition of a decrease in the price  of color filters. In fact, the prices of color filters are not  decreasing at all. Therefore, purchasing from outside is also  expected in the future.    As expected, 9.4-inch VGA panels for notebook personal  computers will continue to be the royal road. But users demand  large panels like the 10.4-inch panel in IBM's ThinkPad. In  order to have panels that are as large as possible within an  A4-sized frame, the largest panel size having 4 bevels from  360x465 mm[.sup]2[/] is also being studied.  <H3>  The Multiple Display System: Proposal for a New Use of LCD  Panels </H3> <H5>  Norihiko Naono </H5>   A display system is proposed that is flexibly expandable by  software. The objective is to satisfy the demands of the users  of operating system with multitasking environments like Windows.    Multiple applications can be used simultaneously in multiple  windows in a multitasking environment. However, a large area,  high resolution display is required and the price of this kind  of CRT monitor remains high.    We come to only think of the form of one display in one  computer. This display is suited to the desk in a GUI  environment. If many documents are opened on a narrow desk, work  efficiency drops. Buying a large desk as a replacement is good,  however, a high price must be tolerated. The fundamental idea  behind this system is to provide a winged desk corresponding to  the task. Thin, lightweight LCDs are suited to this task.    Fig. D shows a specific product conception. In this system,  work is possible while simultaneously looking at displays of  different windows. The program manager, calculator, and schedule  management is normally displayed on a small display. The  wordprocessor and spreadsheet can be displayed in separate  windows, and a both can be referenced when documents and graphs  are created. By buying a large monitor, new area can be obtained  inexpensively.       This system does not require particularly new technology. An  interface card equipped with multiple display controllers and  Windows display drivers is acceptable. Only board design and  building drivers are required. The huge desktop PC AT market  will immediately become a new application market for LCD panels.  Memory and hard disks can be expanded in response to need, only  excluding the display is unreasonable. If this system is  accepted, I believe an extremely large market can be cultivated.  Note.    This proposal is currently being investigated. For a  detailed  discussion, see Flat Panel Displays 1994 (Nikkei BP)  and the report from the Nomura Research Institute to be  published in February.  <H5>  Part 2. Panel Technology </H5> <H3>  The Push to 1W Power Consumption and Wide Viewing Angles in  Mass-Produced Products </H3> <H5>  Term 2 line targets three times the productivity </H5> <H5>  Hiroshi Asakura </H5>    By combining TFT color LCDs with the second generation  application environment that stresses portability and high  visibility, lower power consumption, wider viewing angles, and  lower reflection are rapidly advancing. VGA panels with a low  1.5W power consumption have been implemented and is entering the  stage where portable use is possible. Wide viewing angle  technology that achieves about twice the conventional viewing  angle is increasingly being installed in mass-produced panels.  Low reflectance reached 2%, one-tenth the conventional  reflectance. The objective was to achieve the goal of increasing  the productivity of the mass production line to three times that  of the term 1 line. The evaluation of the wafer processing  equipment that handles the 4-beveled glass substrate has ended  and an 80% yield seems possible.    TFT color LCD panel technology will be dramatically  different  in the second generation. With the appearance of mobile  computing, the use environment is changing from the fixed  environment on a desk to the mobile environment that is carried  outdoors. TFT panels are spurring portability and improved  visibility (Fig. 1).    To improve portability, lower power consumption is being  advanced to extend the battery drive time in particular. The  power consumption of TFT panels is cut in half by using one  backlight instead of two. Cuts of 2W in VGA panels are appearing.       The technology revolution in wider viewing angles and lower  reflectance for improving visual confirmation is remarkable.  Since a wider viewing angle is ``required in portable devices  where the viewing angle differs with the use,'' asserts Seiya  Hijikawa, a director at Sharp, each company is quickly moving to  the mass production of panels. Without accelerating the process,  mass production of technology that doubles the visual angle will  follow in 1994. Lowering the reflectance will be indispensable  technology particularly for use in an outdoor environment. The  technology to lower the surface reflectance to 1/10 is suited to  products.    The term 2 lines of major panel manufacturers that include  these technologies will finally be operating in 1994 (Fig. 2).  The industry objective of &yen;50,000 10-inch VGA panels in 1995  will be achieved and productivity will improve significantly.  The aim was a three-fold improvement in productivity over the  term 1 lines.     <H5>  From one backlight to reflective color </H5>   The TFT panel's backlight is being converted to one  fluorescent light; this will cut power consumption in half in  second generation panels. By pursuing better image quality,  luminance is sacrificed, but designs that stress low power  consumption are encouraged.    Sharp has a 6.4-inch, VGA-compatible color panel with a  converging lens film that produces an image luminance of 70  cd/m[.sup]2[/] using only 1.5W. The vignetting factor of a  TFT panel is 35%. Mass production will begin in the  middle of  1994. In the future, Sharp will increase the vignetting factor  to 40%. Given the objective of a less than 1W reflective  STN-monochrome that can be driven by a genuine dry cell battery  drive, Isamu Washizuka, Sharp's executive director, has handed  down the order to ``quickly develop a reflective color panel  that does not use backlights.'' He expressed the desire ``to see  its realization using the TFT method by 1996.''    Casio Computer attracted attention by exhibiting a  reflective  color panel at Electronics Show '93. Since the reverse of the  coloring effect is used by the double diffraction effect of an  STN LCD, colors are changed by the magnitude of the voltage.  According to Susumu Mineo, executive director of Casio Computer,  a 64x64 dot matrix display has already been implemented (Fig. 3)  and will be marketed in the fall of 1994. Its power consumption  is that same as that of reflective STN-monochrome.     <H3>  Mass production at each company moves towards wide viewing  angle panels </H3>   After 1994, the mass production of wide viewing angle panels  will follow. Until now, techniques where the production process  becomes complex were applied to a portion of high quality  panels. However, processes that are not processes added in the  second generation have been developed for mass-produced panels  (Table 1).       Table 1.

Both Sharp and Sanyo Denki used conventional equipment  unchanged and developed technology to widen the viewing angle  without expanding the process. Sharp only changed the molding  process conditions for oriented film and increased the vertical  viewing angle to 80. Beginning in the spring of 1994, this  process will be adopted in products (see article on p. 79).  Sanyo Denki uses a method to expand the vertical viewing angle  to 100 by only changing the opposing poles' mask patterns.    Panel reflectance will be instantly lowered to 1/10 in the  second generation. Processing was developed to prevent  reflection by the black matrix that produced the largest  reflectance so far and by the polarizer. The black matrix was  one layer of conventional chromium (Cr), but has a lower  reflectance in a two-layered structure with Cr oxidized film.  Reflection prevention for the polarizer is an effective method  where an inorganic film is formed by multilayered vapor  deposition. A method to remove the protective layer on the front  surface was also fabricated (see article on p. 80). Since the  multilayered vapor deposition process is a batch process, the  manufacturing cost of the polarizer jumps up three- to ten-fold  depending on the production quantity. Future development of the  coating method for the multilayered film will be active from the  cost side.  <H5>  Three-fold productivity improvement realized in term 2 line </H5>   Term 2 lines for TFT panels that will operate in 1994 will  immediately improve productivity by three fold. The evaluation  of equipment where the 9.4-inch panel has 4 bevels is almost  finished. Koichi Suzuki, manager in Toshiba's Liquid Crystal  Department, is confident that the three-fold improvement in  productivity can be proven in the prototype line. Then, in the  term 3 lines, the objectives will be for each company to make  larger substrates and line fabrication with 6 to 9 bevels for  the 10-inch class (see pp. 81-82 for details).  <H3>  Technology To Widen Viewing Angle Stressed Productivity and  Multi Domain Model Doubled the Vertical Viewing Angle </H3> <H3>  Shigemitsu Mizushima, Sharp Liquid Crystal Division, TFT  Development Center </H3>   Technology is being developed to widen the viewing angle of  TFT color LCD panels that maintain exceptional productivity with  the goal of implementing them by the spring of 1994. A vertical  viewing angle of 80, which is twice the conventional angle,  was achieved.    Specifically, the method developed this time uses the  conventional TN display mode. The viewing angle characteristic  was improved by nonuniformly orienting the liquid crystal  molecules that had been uniformly oriented. Since fluctuations  in the electro-optical characteristics that arise by the  nonuniform orientation of liquid crystal molecules are visually  averaged in one pixel, the viewing angle characteristic can be  improved. By designing this kind of nonuniform liquid crystal  molecule orientation, a wide viewing angle characteristic is  obtained.    In the actual process, the coating process for a  conventional  oriented film is used and only the material preparation for the  preceding and following processes and the process conditions are  changed. In this method, an oriented film with a nonuniform  orientation direction is fabricated and the orientation of the  liquid crystal molecules are nonuniform. There is no additional  processing like exposure and the rubbing process is performed  once. Since the wait process which is the source of impurities  is not needed, the increase in production cost is small and the  reliability does not decrease. Moreover, since existing  production facilities can be used with almost no changes and the  process is slightly changed, the effect is small on the  production process that has been mastered.    The display performance obtained by this process does not  deteriorate the basic electro-optical characteristics compared  to previous products, but only the viewing angle characteristics  can be improved (Fig. 4, Table 2). In addition, the design  specifications for the module power consumption and driving  voltage are not affected. The data in Table 2 are examples of  the TFT panel characteristics used in this method. By changing  the orientation design of the liquid crystal, a viewing angle  characteristic suited to the use can be obtained.          -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

This  technology does not expand the full-scale process, use special  materials, lower quality, or lower reliability. A wide viewing  angle technology is desired in the basic specification that  doesn't require a major revision of existing lines constructed  with substantial investments. Of the various proposed methods  that are advancing development towards realization, which will  be the one to take the lead depends on future research and  development. Currently, this method has advantages over other  methods.  <H3>  Surface Reflectance Lowered to 1/10 by AR Processing, Making  Outdoor Use of TFT Panels Possible </H3> <H3>  Hideki Yakushigawa, Sharp Liquid Crystal Division, TFT  Development Center </H3>   By lowering the reflectance and increasing the luminance of  TFT color LCD panels, their visibility outdoors will improve  markedly. They can be used outdoors even without a hood. The  liquid crystal ViewCam would probably never have been born  without this technology.    In a conventional TFT color LCD, incident light is reflected  at the interface between the front protective layer and the air  layer and at the surface of the polarizer (Fig. 5). In terms of  the transmittance of the polarizer, light that reaches the glass  on the color filter side becomes about 44% of all the  incident  light on the panel. Since the reflectance is about 30%  because  of the black matrix, the reflected light is again returned to  the display's surface. The total amount of reflected light that  reaches the display's surface that included the light reflected  at each interface reaches 23.3% of the incident light.       The characteristics of low reflectance panel (Fig. 6)  developed here are lower reflectance of the black matrix and a  polarizer processed with low reflectance coating, and the  elimination of the air layer interface where reflectance takes  place by removing the front protective layer.       The low reflectance coating is called antireflective (AR)  processing. The principle used is reflected light is absorbed by  interference of the light in multiple layers of film. The  antireflective process is widely used in panels intended for OA  to prevent reflections. The antireflective process simply  scatters the incident light and reduces reflection by directly  decreasing the reflection of the illumination and sunlight.    By using these antireflective processing in the liquid  crystal ViewCam, the reflectance of the whole display was  reduced to 2.6%. The current reflectance which is close  to 10%  made using TFT LCDs outdoors possible. However, this is  considered to be unsatisfactory with the reflections of direct  sunlight on clear days. The goal is reflectance below 1%.  <H3>  300% Productivity Achieved in Term 2 Line with Larger  Substrates and Equipment with Improved Processing Performance </H3> <H5>  Yoshiaki Kobayashi, Toshiba LCD Technology Division </H5>   Productivity in term 2 mass production line for TFT color  LCDs improved 300% over the term 1 line (Fig. 7).       There were a number of indications of the many problems  found  in the term 1 line. The TFT array process in particular is a  process that created one million transistors in the 10-inch LCD  panel and that process equipment is significantly inferior to  LSI (Table 3).       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

Growing equipment, especially, had to be drasticall-|  |y improved. Through joint development with the equipment manufacturers, the |  |small-scale wafer equipment for the term 2 line achieved resource conservat-|  |ion, energy savings, and space savings.                                     |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Productivity in term 2 line increased 300% </H5>   Along with expanding the market for TFT color LCDs,  positioning the term 2 line can be viewed as the production line  on which hangs the survival of each company. By pursuing  performance and costs in color CRTs that already exist, the  market for TFT color LCDs will be more certain.    The construction of a line with 300% improved  productivity  was the aim of the term 2 line. First, the productivity index  per equipment investment increased 300% in the array  process  that commanded a large investment (Fig. 8). Next, in the cell  process that advances the development of the line, the  productivity index per hour increased 300%. In module  processes  requiring many workers, the productivity index per worker  increased 300%.       Here, the productivity index represents the product of the  number of panel bevels per mother glass substrate, the number of  glass substrates processed per hour, the operating rate, and the  yield. This equals the product of the number of processed panels  per hour and the yield.  <H5>  Making larger glass substrates and saving space </H5>   The specific measure to improve to 300% began by  first  increasing the size of the glass substrate that can double the  number of bevels from 2 bevels in the conventional 9.4-inch to 4  bevels. Second, the equipment for growing film represented by  CVD equipment and sputter equipment is replaced by more compact  wafer equipment with improved operating rates, more stable  performance, particle suppression, improved maintenance, and  decreased running costs. The result enabled resource  conservation, energy savings, and space savings.    Third, the focus of the lithography process is the  importance  of improving the transport method and the line duct with  revamped processing. Fourth, various inline inspection devices,  such as optical pattern inspection devices and dust monitors,  were developed and introduced. These are essential tools for the  process to have auto-termination.    Fifth, CIM that includes monitoring the process conditions  and lot tracking is active and the yield was improved. While the  equipment still has a low degree of completion, it is crucial to  suppress fluctuations in the process conditions. Sixth, in  expanding the types of manufactured products, automation of the  cell and module processes to improve productivity is critical.  In order to handle a variety of products in the module process,  in particular, equipment that takes plan changes into  consideration was developed.  <H5>  Larger substrates in the term 3 line </H5>   The 500% improvement in productivity, which is  target for  the term 3 line will be achieved by (a) increasing the substrate  size from the 2 bevels of the 9.4-inch panel to 6 bevels, (b)  improving the throughput by increasing the tact time and  improving equipment performance like improved yield, and (c)  decreasing the number of process steps with the intent of  decreasing the total investment. Specifically, the first result  of (a) is over 300% productivity, and (b) and (c) each  increase  productivity by 130%, for a total improvement in  productivity  of 500%. To decrease the total production cost, the costs  of  components and materials will also decrease.    In the development of equipment for the term 2 line, the  technology development for the term 3 line and the specific  investigations have begun. The main points are (1) increasing  productivity by using large-scale substrates, (2) decreasing  initial investments and running costs by effectively using clean  room, (3) decreasing the power, indirect materials, and chemical  expenses, (4) decreasing the number of process steps and  integrating the processes, (5) introducing low cost processes  and decreasing equipment prices, (6) improving equipment  reliability and maintaining a high operating rate, (7) overall  development of CIM and AGV, and (8) application to a large  variety of cell and module processes.    In the term 2 line, a 360x465 mm[.sup]2[/] glass substrate  that has a 9.4-inch panel with 4 bevels was selected. The  substrate size will be made larger in the term 3 line depending  on which panel size is optimum.    After developing equipment using the 360x465 mm[.sup]2[/]  for the term 2 line, the substrate size in the term 3 line will  be determined based on when the equipment manufacturer can  develop equipment for the substrate size. The problem is how  will the panel manufacturers standardize the next term's  substrate size. Although one candidate is  500x600mm[.sup]2[/], recently, the change will probably be to  360x465 mm[.sup]2[/], the size used in term 2.  <H5>  Part 3. Parts and Materials Technologies </H5> <H3>  Successive Technologies Like Unpolished Glass Target  &yen;50,000 Panels </H3> <H5>  Solving the problem of standardizing various specifications </H5> <H5>  Katsuhiro Nozaki </H5>    The prices of components and materials for TFT color panels,  that were hard to bring down from 1991 to 1993, have started to  move towards the goal of &yen;50,000 in 1995. Added to the  effect of mass production by expanding the market, large price  decreases can be expected by introducing new technology. The  glass substrate is not subjected to polishing or annealing, for  a target cost decrease of 40%. The color filter also  introduces  a printing process and electrodeposition to move towards a  40%  cost decrease and a productivity improvement. Now, one backlight  with a brighter lamp improved the transmittance of the unit.  Advances are being made in the direction of cutting &yen;2,000  during 1994. On the other hand, the trail of high additional  costs was discovered, for instance, the nonreflecting polarizer.    The prices of components and materials used to build the  second generation TFT color LCD panels are moving the panel  price to &yen;50,000 for 10-inch models in 1995 (Fig. 1).  Starting in 1994, panel manufacturers will charge headlong into  full-scale production. Parts manufacturers who are confident of  an expanding market will finally begin to decrease costs.       However, &yen;50,000 cannot be reached only by the effect of  mass production. New technologies must be developed in each  field that will make price cuts possible. Many prototype  components and materials introduced by new technologies in 1993  will be incorporated into products during 1994.  <H5>  Glass substrates that further no polishing </H5>   First, the prices of glass substrates will start to move.  The  direction is towards shortening the process by eliminating  polishing the glass in order to lower prices and to increase the  melting and molding yield. While each company adopts both, the  established targets are a price of &yen;3,000 for 10-inch models  in 1992 and reach half that price, &yen;1,500, in 1994 and 1995.    Corning, Inc., the largest manufacturer, and NH Technoglass  have put effort into eliminating polishing. At the beginning of  1993, Corning already began to apply this technique to mass  production. By improving the melting and molding processes,  flat, clean surfaces were obtained immediately after molding.  Koya Iwai, business and planning manager at Corning Japan  believes the process that eliminated the annealing process will  be applied to mass production at the end of 1994. Overall, costs  can be decreased 40%. At the earliest, NH Technoglass  will also  use unpolished glass in mass production in the spring of 1994.    Takao Sakamoto, executive director of technology at NEC  Glass, states that NEC Glass effectively decreased costs by  improving glass melting and molding yield. The yield that was  usually less than 50% will be increased to about 60 to  70%.  Therefore, a multihead furnace for melting and molding was  developed. Since the large furnace can handle all models in  contrast to the small furnace that differs with each  conventional model, the contact area with the furnace wall  becomes small and there are few defects.    Activity has begun to introduce a printing method (see p.  85)  and electrodeposition. The goal is to decrease production costs  by 40%. Masatake Nagao, executive director of Dai Nippon  Printing, would like to see the current cost of &yen;20,000 for  a 10-inch model fall to &yen;7,000 sometime in 1995 or 1996. The  application to mass production will proceed in 1994. According  to the business division of Toppan Printing Electronics, another  direction is towards decreasing the costs in the pigment  dispersion process. The cost of materials and the quantity used  will decrease. Also, by cleaning, the yield will be increased  from 60% to 80%; this will be 10% of the  panel's price in  1995.  <H5>  Backlight unit converts to one light </H5>   The plan is to lower the &yen;3,000 price of the 10-inch  model in the backlight unit to below &yen;2,000 sometime in  1994. The whole unit will convert to one light. The effect of  increasing the unit's transmittance and the lamp's luminance  will be significant. Masahiro Tomatsu, deputy manager of  technology at Fujitsu Kasei, states a 30% decrease in  cost is  possible by using one light.    The mainstream of light conducting planes is moving towards  the molding process. This is already beginning to be applied to  mass-produced products for small 4-inch panels. Koichi Matsui,  deputy director at Meitaku Systems, states that 10-inch molded  products will be rushed to market during 1994. However, because  production efficiency is low, by standardizing the size and  shape, according to Hiroshi Kikuchi, manager of the Backlight  Department at Empress Optonics, the lot is collected and there  is an effect on large-scale mass production. There is also a  manufacturer who will eliminate the light conducting plate (see  p. 86).    The polarizer which affects the transmittance of the whole  panel is being increased in price by efforts to lower its  reflectance (see p. 87). Since there is a 3- to 10-fold jump in  unit cost, lower costs will be introduced into the coating  process.  <H3>  Reducing the Average Cost Targeting a 40% Production  Cost  Reduction by Introducing a Printing Process </H3> <H3>  Takuya Hamaguchi, Micro Products Division, Dai Nippon  Printing </H3>    The goal is to reduce production costs by 40% by  changing  the manufacturing process for color filters to a printing method.    The characteristics and costs of the currently popular  pigment dispersion method were compared to the printing method  (Table 1). Although the printing method is inferior in terms of  quality and precision than the pigment dispersion method, when  productivity is considered, the possibility of lowering costs is  highest. The currently popular offset method is made practical  by planographic printing and engraved printing (Fig. 2).       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

The pr-|  |inting method is still worse than the pigment dispersion method in term of |  |quality, but it possesses many advantages on the production side.          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------         In terms of precision, although the printing method can have  a resolution of 15 to 30m patterns, problems remain in  dimensional stability and linearity of patterns in each  printing. If the line width is about 100m, precision below  8% can be guaranteed. In addition, since a rubber blanket  cylinder is introduced in offset printing, the transfer pattern  expands and contracts. Because the pitch accuracy is changed  from several tens of micrometers per 400mm. However, the  application to fine patterns is still difficult.    A remaining problem is the cross-sectional shapes of striped  patterns become semicylindrical. Therefore, after RGB printing,  the processes of flattening with a roll, polishing, and applying  an overcoat layer are performed. From the perspective of  quality, exterior defects like bumps, unevenness, pin holes are  problems. Since these originate in the printing process,  materials, and operating precision of the printing machinery,  they are handled by improving precision.  <H5>  Dealing with lower material costs and standardization </H5>   To lower costs, first, the number of process are increased  to  flatten the surface shape. However, this leads to concern about  cost increases and lower yields. So the costs for leveling and  processing of the ink material are lowered. Secondly, overall  there are improvements in the precision of processes, materials,  and printing machines with respect to defects that influence the  yield.    Thirdly, an advance towards the standardization of glass  plate sizes and characteristics is required. The substrate size  in the term 2 line is moving in the direction of unification.  However, the light distribution characteristics and film will  differ with each manufacturer. Standardization by the main panel  manufacturers are desired. Fourth, decreasing the cost of the  black matrix will become important. Plans must be put into place  to decrease the cost of the whole filter by combining with a low  cost black matrix.  <H3>  Decisive Development of a Thin, Lightweight, Low Cost  Backlight with No Light Conductor </H3> <H5>  Ken Kojima, SBC Business Division, Chatani Industries </H5>   Because of the stringent demands for decreasing power,  lowering costs, and making thinner and lighter TFT color LCD  panels, the development of new backlight units is demanded. As a  result, by developing a structure that eliminates the light  conductor, the aim is to reduce costs by simplifying the  structure and making it thinner and lighter. At the same time,  the manufacturing process can be shortened since printing the  dot pattern on the light conductor will be eliminated.    A backlight unit without the light conductor consists of a  reflector that has a diffused reflector and a cold-cathode tube  on the unit's side (Fig. 3). Light emitted from the cold-cathode  tube is diffusely reflected in the air layer by the diffused  reflective layer. Special ink which is uneven and has a high  density is used by the embossing process on the inside surface  of the reflector to form a diffuse reflective layer.       In the region near the cold-cathode tube, the luminance of  the backlight surface by direct illumination is brighter than in  other parts. This lessens the uniformity of the illumination on  the surface and causes bright lines to appear. Therefore, a  semi-transparent or nontransparent reflector is provided near  the cold-cathode tube.    Light dispersed by the diffused reflective layer on the  bottom is converged by a special converging lens on the top. The  converging lens consists of one or two lenses. The lens used in  the prototype has less directionality than conventional prisms,  lenses, or films. Rather, it has light convergence and light  diffusion close to those of current diffusers.    Together with making a thinner and lighter weight backlight  unit that does not contain a conductor, there can be little  attenuation of light by the light conductor. About one-tenth of  light output by the cold-cathode tube can be obtained as the  surface luminance of the backlight unit. This backlight unit is  one-third the weight of a conventional unit and two-thirds its  thickness. The luminance can be increased 20 to 40% and  power  consumption can be suppressed to a low 10 to 20% (Table  2).       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

At this time, the transmittance of the  TFT panel was assumed to be 6% and the transmittance of  the STN  panel to be 3%. The plan is to implement this kind of  backlight  unit without a conductor in the fall of 1994.  <H3>  Reflectance of Polarizer Reduced to 1/10 in a  Vapor-Deposited Multi Coat </H3> <H5>  Tadashi Matsuo, Technology Dept., Polatechno </H5>   By adding antireflective to the polarizer, the loss of the  amount of light transmitted is decreased and scattering of the  reflected light by external light reflection is prevented. In a  typical glass plate and polarizer, about 4% surface  reflection  arises for each light that passes through the air interface.  When external light multiplied by 4% of the amount of  light is  added to the image light, the visibility of the image is  markedly decreased. The surface reflectance required for outdoor  use will become one standard of less then 0.4% which  corresponds to 1/10 the reflectance of a normal polarizer and  the glass plate (Fig. 4).       Methods to grow the antireflective layer are roughly  classified into vapor-deposited multi coats and applied coats.  By performing vapor deposition in a vacuum for the  vapor-deposited multi coating, materials that have different  refractive indices are grown in layers on the film's surface.  This method can suppress the lowest surface reflectance.    Established technology for molded products, primarily  optical  products, have problems with low productivity and high costs in  batch processing. Inorganic compounds like SiO[.sup]2[/],  TiO[.sup]2[/], or ZrO[.sub]2[/] with various refractive  indices are each 0.1 to 0.2m thick which corresponds to 1/4  the wavelength of visible light.    Applied coating coats a material with a low refractive index  onto a polarizer and a supporting film. This technique suits the  continuous roll film processing and is being adopted in mass  production. Additionally, its cost is below that of the vapor  deposition. On the other hand, the properties of surface  reflectance and hardness are usually somewhat worse than the  vapor deposition. Inorganic and organic fluoride compounds are  used in the materials.    The two processes of indirect and direct methods are being  developed as film growing processing. In the first process of  indirect methods, an antireflective process treats a transparent  hard coat support film. This forms the antireflective polarizer  that is affixed to the polarizer with an adhesive. The direct  method is an antireflective coating that is directly applied to  the surface of the hard coat polarizer. In addition to a thinner  shape, a shorter process is also advantageous in terms of cost.    Fingerprints on the surface are a problem in the  antireflective process (Table 3). By including water repellant  processing in the vapor deposition and the dipping process on  the film's external side, an anti-soiling effect is produced.  Currently, however, the level where absolutely no fingerprints  remain has not been reached.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

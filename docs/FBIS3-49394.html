This is a special form of the repression of  Serbian officials, a report of the Human Rights and Freedoms  Defence Council in Prishtina said. The data provided by the  report show that Albanian fellows who were forced to join the  Serbian Army were born from 1966 to 1974. Most of them were  arrested in streets or their homes and some of them were brought  to military court. All Albanian recruits were sent to the  barracks of the Serbian Army established outside Kosova.</p>

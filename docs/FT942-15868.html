			<p>940413 FT  13 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Laura Ashley Mr Jim Maxmin has always looked vaguely ill at ease in Laura Ashley. So his departure from the chief executive's slot is perhaps unsurprising. Some of the company's operational problems have been sorted out in the last three years. Others, most notably in the US, have not. Several of the more serious wounds were self-inflicted. Yet his departure, accompanied only by a brief statement, is unsatisfactory. The appointment of Mr Hugh Blakeway Webb as executive chairman looks like a victory for the old guard, who have let shareholders down before. Convincing explanations will be needed at tomorrow's results presentation.</p>

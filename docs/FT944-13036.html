			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / The incredible shrinking chips: How miniaturisation is boosting computer power The astonishing pace of electronic miniaturisation, which has made possible the information technology revolution of the past two decades, is set to continue or even to accelerate for the foreseeable future. Transistors and other electronic components on today's silicon chips are one-thousandth the size of those in the early 1970s, and semiconductor researchers say the technology is being developed to make them thousands of times smaller still early in the next century. Since the capacity and speed of computers increase as their components shrink, the outlook is for dramatic further advances, with cars and domestic appliances acquiring the processing power of supercomputers. 'Many new applications will emerge over the next 25 years which no one has even thought of now,' Professor Michael Pepper, director of the Toshiba Cambridge Research Centre, said this week, as he announced a breakthrough which could keep the miniaturisation process going after current chip technology reaches its fundamental physical limits. 'Think of all the changes in computing and communications in the last 25 years, and try to extrapolate those 25 years ahead.' The centre, a collaboration between the Japanese electronics company and Cambridge University, has developed a process for making 'quantum effect integrated circuits'. The components on these chips are so small  - no more than 10 atoms across or 100,000 times thinner than a human hair - that the electrons in them behave both as particles and waves, in accordance with the somewhat bizarre predictions of quantum theory. They are making positive use of an effect that will eventually limit the miniaturisation of conventional chips, because electrons leak out of their circuits when they become too small. A quantum chip, the size of a fingernail, could contain 1,000bn memory cells or logic gates, switching at 1,000bn times a second. And it would consume virtually no power - a big advantage for portable applications, compared with today's battery-draining chips. Most of the world's semiconductor makers are experimenting with quantum devices. Toshiba says its great achievement is to find a way of mass-producing them at reasonable cost on integrated circuits, like conventional chips. The process is based on a technique for laying down single layers of atoms with molecular beams. Unfortunately, the quantum effects used by Toshiba are so sensitive that the technology works well only when cooled in liquid helium to temperatures close to absolute zero. A formidable technical effort will be required to remove the need for special cooling. Researchers at NEC's Tsukuba laboratories in Japan are developing a different type of quantum device, the Surface Tunnel Transistor, which makes use of a more robust effect that already operates at room temperature. 'We expect to achieve an operational integrated circuit in the laboratory in 1997-98,' says Roy Lang, general manager of fundamental research at NEC. Another Japanese company, Hitachi, has made an experimental 'single electron memory' - which actually uses about 100 electrons to store a bit of information - at its Cambridge Laboratory in the UK. In the US, Texas Instruments, AT&amp;T, IBM and others are making encouraging progress with quantum technology. All concerned are convinced that quantum devices will eventually replace conventional electronics. But there is vigorous scientific debate over which version of the technology will turn out best in the long run, and over the likely timing of the transition. Lang says: 'Quantum devices have to compete very seriously with present-day silicon technology. People predicted in the past that silicon technology would reach its limits much sooner and at much lower performances than is actually happening.' The first memory chips introduced by Intel of the US at the beginning of the 1970s held 1,000 digital bits of information on circuits 6.5 microns (millionths of a metre) wide. The most powerful memory chips on sale today, the 16-megabit D-Rams, have a capacity of 16m bits and a linewidth of 0.5 microns; the 64 Mbit generation, expected in 1996, will go down to 0.35 microns. The conventional technique of optical lithography, which uses ultraviolet light to write circuitry, will probably continue to work well for the first gigabit (1bn bit) chips in about 2004. But their 0.18 micron linewidth may be the lower limit, says Andrew Norwood, a semiconductor analyst with Dataquest, the electronics industry consultancy. Below that, the wavelength of ultraviolet light will begin to produce unacceptably fuzzy lines. For the 4 Gbit generation, forecast for 2008, manufacturers are likely to turn to X-rays, which can produce finer lines with their shorter wavelengths. Earlier this month four leading US electronics groups - IBM, AT&amp;T, Motorola and Loral - announced a collaborative venture with federal funding to develop X-ray lithography for future chips. Using X-rays and other new lithography techniques, such as electron beams, the semiconductor industry may be able to push silicon chips through several 'gigabit' generations during the second decade of the next century. Indeed Toshiba's Japanese research centre has shown the way this year by designing an experimental silicon transistor just 0.04 microns wide, with special features to prevent the electrons leaking away through quantum effects. The company says this could be used to develop 100 Gbit memory chips. But at some point conventional silicon will reach its technical limits. Whether new-style quantum devices begin to make significant inroads into the semiconductor market before then will depend not only on fundamental technological factors but also on manufacturing costs. One of the clouds hanging over the industry is the exponential growth in the cost of building new chip fabrication plants or 'fabs'. As conventional chips have become more complicated, the total price of a fab has risen from Dollars 20m in the mid-1970s to at least Dollars 1bn. Mitsubishi of Japan estimates that its total investment in developing and manufacturing the 1 Gbit generation of memory chips could reach Dollars 15bn - more than for a new aircraft. According to Intel, the leading microprocessor manufacturer, conventional silicon may reach an economic barrier to miniaturisation when linewidths fall below 0.18 microns, because X-rays or electron beams may be too expensive for the industry to install, even on a collaborative basis. At that point quantum chips will be cheaper to manufacture, their advocates say. Prof Pepper concedes that the Toshiba process is technically complex, with several stages, but he insists that it 'is highly manufacturable'. Another possibility is that entirely new production techniques - for example, using 'scanning probe microscopes' to manipulate individual atoms - will be developed to make atomic-scale quantum devices at reasonable cost. The best guestimate is that quantum chips will reach the market for specialised applications in about 10 years. They might become the main agents of the information technology revolution around 2015.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Alberto Ronchey: "Minister Martino's Hasty </F> Steps"]    [Text] A few days ago the visit to Washington by new  Foreign Minister Antonio Martino had the aim of launching a "new  look," a great Italian diplomatic presence on the international  scene. This purpose was favored by the cordial welcome granted  by such newspapers as the WASHINGTON POST to the minister who  knows how to "say things openly in clear and correct English."  The endeavor also entailed some legitimate, though not easily  negotiable, demands.    The first issue was the demand for a permanent seat for the  Italian Government on the UN Security Council, if and when the  Germans and Japanese are admitted to that body. According to  reports, Warren Christopher's sole reply was that it can be  discussed. But in what terms? If it is true that Germany and  Japan, unlike Italy, will not take part in UN military  operations, it is also true that they are two crucial world  economic superpowers.    The second issue was the demand that the Italian Government  be admitted soon to the "contact group" that decides on  interventions in Bosnia, which has hitherto been confined to the  United States, Russia, France, Britain, and Germany. Again,  according to reports, Warren Christopher apparently replied by  citing certain difficulties. So Antonio Martino, perhaps  anxious to exert the maximum pressure, publicly acknowledged the  possibility that Italian troops could serve as Blue Helmets in  Bosnia as long as the action is conducted under NATO command and  is definitely a peacekeeping operation of short duration after  an agreement is reached among all the warring sides.    But it is reasonable to express cautious and serious  objections to such a prospect. On the basis of the disturbing  experiences had hitherto, nobody can guarantee that agreements  between the enemy sides will be honored, that the so-called  peacekeeping operation would not degenerate and/or that it would  be short-lived. As everyone knows, the theater of events lies  across ancient borders between inaccessible or turbulent regions  that have always been in discord -- those formerly governed by  the Austro-Hungarian Empire and those that belonged to the  Ottoman Empire. If the offer of Italian troops to serve as Blue  Helmets is based on conditions that are bound to prove  impossible, then this is merely a policy of gestures. If,  however, the aim is also to challenge the unknown or to take  chances, then the risks to the Italian people are incalculable.    UN operations in areas at war or affected by guerrilla  warfare are, under the regulations, entrusted to troops  belonging to non- bordering nations that have never in the past  been occupying powers.    Germany is excluded from any military operation, on the  basis  of constitutional exclusions. For its part, Austria, neutral  since 1955, is almost like Switzerland. Why send the Italians  -- the sons or grandsons of the soldiers of 1941 -- to Bosnia?  Better the French, British, Russians, or even Ukrainians. This  geostrategic peninsula is like an aircraft carrier at the  service of the United Nations and NATO over the Adriatic.  Infantrymen are needed more in Calabria, against the tormenting  internal guerrilla warfare of the Mafia.    In the ghastly upheavals in the Balkans, the Croats, Serbs,  and Muslims do not forget anything about their ancient conflicts  or their respective ancient wrongs, let alone the wrongs of  others. Anyone who has traveled widely through the lands of the  now- dissolved Yugoslavia is well aware that the polite welcome  afforded to Italians from Ljubljana to Skopje implies neither  unconditional friendliness nor forgetfulness. Nobody wants to  see a return of German, Austrian, or even Italian troops, with  or without Blue Helmets. Indeed, nobody has forgotten the fact  that the invasion by Hitler's Panzer divisions was prompted in  April 1941 by Italy's surrender on the Greek-Albanian front, nor  have they forgotten the partitioning of Slovenia between Hitler  and Mussolini, or the handing over of the kingdom of Croatia by  Pavelic to Duke of Spoleto Amedeo Savoia Aosta.    Antonio Martino will of course have considered all this, but  perhaps not enough. The question is not how a well-intentioned  but risky operation should begin, but how it might end. Back in  1992 it was proposed that Italian troops be used at least in  escorting humanitarian convoys bound for Bosnia. To the  objection that the route would be long and full of obstacles,  perhaps under cross-fire from Serbs, Croats, and Bosnian  Muslims, some people replied that history is also composed of  such bold expeditions as the wagon trains headed for the  American West in the last century. This was an ill-considered  and ill-augured example, since it evoked memories of the deadly  ambush at Little Big Horn in which General Custer met his death.  And that was the last that was heard of it, until now.</p>

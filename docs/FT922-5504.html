			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Markets: At a Glance - Property shares hit by 'Canary factor' People living in London who want to know the reason for the property sector's awful performance need not look far. Canary Wharf and its now infamous tower are not owned by a quoted company, but their troubles this week inflicted further damage on a sector which has been out of favour for more than three years. Olympia &amp; York's problems were the most spectacular, but Mountleigh's decision to call in the receivers also knocked shares elsewhere in the sector.</p>

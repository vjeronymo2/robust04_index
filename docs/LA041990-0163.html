			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARRIORS' SECOND CHANCE SINKS CLIPPERS  </P> <P> Terry Teagle scored 30 points and the Golden State Warriors, after blowing an  18-point first-half lead, used a 30-10 second-half run to beat the Clippers,  133-120, Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The Warriors, who broke a five-game losing streak, set a single-season  attendance record of 601,000 with their 57th consecutive sellout. Golden State  has won seven consecutive games over the Clippers at Oakland.  </P> <P> Tim Hardaway added 22 points and 16 assists for the Warriors, though leading  scorer Chris Mullin had only 13 points.  </P> <P> Michael Young scored a career-high 27 points and was the only Clipper to score  more than 20.  </P> <P> Golden State outscored the Clippers, 12-4, in the final two minutes of the  third quarter to take a 104-92 lead, then started the final quarter with an  18-6 run. Hardaway's fast-break layup with 8:04 remaining gave the Warriors a  122-98 lead.  </P> <P> The Warriors let their 18-point first-half lead shrivel in the second quarter  as the Clippers rallied for a 66-66 halftime tie.  </P> <P> Teagle's 30-point performance off the bench, including 12 of 19 from the field,  was nothing new to Clipper Coach Don Casey.  </P> <P> "He's been doing that to me ever since he was at Baylor and I was at Temple,"  Casey said. "He can shoot over our smaller lineup. They've got a bucketful of  shooters over here."  </P> <P> Teagle, the beneficiary on most of Hardaway's 16 assists, helped pick up the  slack left behind by Mullin's off night. Mullin averages 25.1 points.  </P> <P> "An all-star doesn't have to play well every night," Teagle said. "And Chris is  definitely an all-star. Sometimes it's up to us to make up for it."  </P> <P> With the game having no bearing on the playoff picture, both teams increased  playing time for reserves.  </P> <P> "We started to commit a lot of turnovers, and that's when they got us," Young  said. The Clippers committed 23 turnovers against an effective defensive trap.  </P></p>

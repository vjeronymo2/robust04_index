			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: Nestle's first-half profits jump 16.5% NESTLE, the world's largest foods group, has reported a 16.5 per cent jump in consolidated net profits for the first half to SFr1.18bn (Dollars 950m ) on sales up 13.3 per cent to SFr26.3bn. The group, which acquired Source Perrier, the leading French mineral water group, in July, said sales volume growth of 3.3 per cent would be maintained or improved in the second half. But it warned that if the dollar and yen remained weak and the Swiss franc strong against other European currencies until the year-end, the profit growth rate would slow. Volume growth in all regions was over 4 per cent, except in Brazil where it declined after a very strong 1991. Margins improved 'significantly' in all areas except Europe. Net financing costs rose 26 per cent to SFr307m, reflecting higher interest charges and a 9.4 per cent rise in net borrowings to SFr7.1bn at June 30 compared with a year earlier. The 1992 net debt figure was struck before paying SFr3.4bn for Perrier. Capital spending rose 16.2 per cent to SFr1.3bn during the first half. Perrier will be consolidated from July 1. See Lex</p>

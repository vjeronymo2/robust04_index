			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ube takes stake in BP chemicals subsidiary UBE Industries, the leading Japanese producer of materials for the nylon industry, is to acquire 30 per cent of Proquimed, a Spanish chemicals subsidiary of British Petroleum. Terms of the deal, an unusual move by a Japanese company, were not disclosed. Proquimed, which manufactures caprolactam, a raw material for nylon, has an annual turnover of about Dollars 80m a year. BP acquired it as part of its purchase of Petromed, Spain's third largest oil refiner and retailer, in 1991. The plant, capable of manufacturing about 54,000 tonnes of caprolactam a year, was kept with BP's oil division rather than being moved to BP Chemicals. Ube said the deal will include the transfer of its technology to the Spanish company to upgrade the production of caprolactam. The Japanese group is one of the world leaders in caprolactam manufacture. The plant employs about 300 people. As with most other Japanese chemicals companies, Ube's sales have fallen in tandem with the slowing of the economy, and it is expected to report a pre-tax loss of about Y5bn (Dollars 40m) for the year ending in March, a sharp turnaround from a profit Y12.7bn last year. Ube is also a leading producer of cement and has an extensive machinery division, but has been hurt by rapid expansion during the late 1980s, and is now restructuring its operations. It has already stopped production of some building materials. The difficult domestic market conditions have encouraged the company, for which exports account for 19 per cent of sales, to broaden its international base. Ube expects the purchase of the stake in Proquimed will enable it to secure supplies of caprolactam for the still growing Asian market without the need for costly capital investment in Japan.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK grants for Polish banks BRITAIN has agreed that its grants to the Polish stabilisation fund, amounting to Dollars 100m (Pounds 70.4m), should be used to recapitalise the Polish banking system, Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said yesterday. The Polish stabilisation fund was set up in 1990, with a total capital of Dollars 1bn, from donations and loans from western countries. Its primary objective was to support the convertibility of the zloty, but it has never been called upon. Mr Major, who was speaking after talks in London with Ms Hanna Suchocka, the Polish prime minister, also said that Britain continued to back wholeheartedly Poland's eventual membership of the European Community. It would, however, take a number of years for the Polish economy to become sufficiently efficient to face the full blast of competition from the EC members. Ms Suchocka said she had had a sympathetic hearing from Mr Major for her request that Poland should be upgraded as a recipient of British export credits. At the moment cover is available from the Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD) for short-term export credits. But Poland, which feels that it should no longer be classified among the poorest countries, would also like to be able to benefit from medium and long-term export credits. Mr Major said an answer would be given after further talks in the club of creditors.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Ruhr miners protest GERMAN miners went on strike yesterday to protest against job cuts announced by recession-hit Ruhrkohle, Germany's largest coal producer. Miners broke off early from their morning shifts to join fellow workers protesting in the streets of all major towns in the Ruhr valley, Germany's industrial heartland. Most of the miners went back to work in the afternoon, except those from the Monopol pit at Bergkamen, which will be closed under the plans, and those from the Niederrhein area, who said they would stay out until Chancellor Helmut Kohl intervenes. The miners' anger was prompted by Ruhrkohle's decision on Tuesday to axe an additional 6,000 jobs next year.</p>

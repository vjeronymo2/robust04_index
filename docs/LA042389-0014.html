			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S OK TO FUDGE A BIT ON NORTHERN MICHIGAN TRIP  </P> <P> In the late 1800s, wealthy families from Ohio and other Midwest states would  travel by rail, boat and horse-drawn wagons through rugged wilderness to reach  this tiny lakeside town in northern Michigan.  </P> <P> Today the rustic community is not much bigger, still set among seemingly  endless stands of pine trees and an intricate system of serene rivers and  lakes. But now it is easily accessible and more than living up to the Michigan  slogan, "Water Wonderland."  </P> <P> Indian River lies at the southern tip of Burt and Mullet lakes, two of the  largest lakes in the state, about a four-hour drive north of Detroit. It is a  center for water sports and outdoor activities, from fishing and bicycling to  canoeing and boating. (The annual National Championship Outboard Marathon Races  will be held on Indian River Aug. 12-13.)  </P> <P> Because northern Michigan is almost as well known for its fudge as its vacation  appeal, visitors have come to be known as "fudgies" by the locals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Via Highway or River  </P> <P> Luckily for the fudgies, northern Michigan is easy to navigate by land or  water. The main highway, Interstate 75, extends from one end of the state to  the other, passing through Indian River and into the Upper Peninsula.  </P> <P> To get a feel for the area's rugged past, the adventurous shouldn't miss taking  a canoe trip down the Sturgeon River. The Sturgeon wriggles its way across  wilderness, through Indian River and into Burt Lake. There are two canoe  liveries in town, and because both are owned by the same family, the rates are  identical and so are the routes.  </P> <P> Viewing the scenery is exhilarating, but the canoe ride is occasionally rough  where fallen trees have created challenging obstacles. Fudgies and other novice  paddlers should start with a one-hour trip, allowing time to bail out the  canoe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fishing Boat -- or Pontoon  </P> <P> For those who prefer a more substantial craft, River Junction Marina on the  Indian River rents fishing boats and equipment, Burt Lake Marina and Crooked  River Marina (in nearby Alanson) rent pontoons. Indian River, a long,  meandering connection between Burt Lake and Mullet Lake, is a popular route for  fishing or sightseeing.  </P> <P> At piers along the way the boater can buy gas and supplies. One pier belongs to  Pinehurst Inn in Indian River, a rustic bar/motel that's more widely known for  its lounge, food and, on some evenings, live entertainment.  </P> <P> If seasickness should set in, there's Burt Lake State Beach, where landlubbers  can camp or picnic beneath the pines on Burt Lake or sunbathe on the beach.  </P> <P> But outdoor recreation isn't the only draw at Indian River. It also can be used  as a central base to visit the Upper Peninsula and other northern Michigan  attractions.  </P> <P> Within a 45-minute drive are historic St. Ignace and Mackinaw City, both  gateways to Mackinac Island. And 1 1/2 hours away are the Soo Locks in Sault  Ste. Marie, a hub of trade and shipping activity in the mid-1800s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home-Style Cooking  </P> <P> When dining in northern Michigan you'll notice that portions are plentiful and  inexpensive. A good place in Indian River for a home-style meal is  Christopher's, where most meals are under $10.  </P> <P> Waterfront lodging in Indian River runs about $30 to $40 a night; campgrounds  include Burt Lake State Park, Spring Lake (formally KOA) and Jelly Stone Park.  </P> <P> If a rustic motel in the woods or cottage on the river isn't your idea of a  vacation, St. Ignace and Mackinaw City are larger towns where Best Westerns and  Ramada Inns will take you out of the woods.  </P> <P> Mackinaw City is the northernmost city of the lower peninsula (at the "tip of  the mitt"); St. Ignace is the southernmost of the Upper Peninsula. The  8,614-foot suspension Mackinac Bridge, "Mighty Mac" over the Straits of  Mackinac, connects the two peninsulas where Lakes Michigan and Huron meet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> View of the Island  </P> <P> St. Ignace is a little less congested and easier to navigate than Mackinaw  City. A cluster of contemporary beachfront motels, on State Street overlooking  Lake Huron, offer a clear view of Mackinac Island for $48 to $86 a night.  </P> <P> Nearby is Al's Pancake House, once a private home, on a hill with an impressive  view of Mackinac Island. Blueberry pancakes made with fresh blueberries,  sausage gravy with homemade biscuits and three-egg omelets make it tough to eat  a light breakfast.  </P> <P> From St. Ignace or Mackinaw City the public ferry lines -- Shepler's, Arnold's  or Star Line -- take you on the 15-minute ride to Mackinac Island. All charge  $9 for adults and $5.75 for children 6-12, round trip.  </P> <P> Setting foot on Mackinac Island is like taking a step into the past, when Ft.  Mackinac stood guard over the bustling northern fur trade. No motorized  vehicles are allowed on the island. Transportation is by foot, bicycle or  horse-drawn taxis.  </P> <P> Fort tours are $5.50 for adults and $2.75 for children. Guides dressed in  American Army uniforms (the fort changed hands several times between the  French, British and Americans during its 115-year military history) give  demonstrations of cannon and musket firings and tours of the barracks, school,  supply house and commanding officer's home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Landmark Grand Hotel  </P> <P> Another popular island landmark is the Grand Hotel, made famous in the film  "Somewhere in Time." The hotel still maintains its formal air, requiring men to  wear ties and jackets to dinner. It costs $5 to enter the hotel and tour the  grounds. Rooms at the Grand range from $230 to $400.  </P> <P> Without quite the prestige of the Grand Hotel, but putting forth the effort, is  the recently remodeled Mission Point Resort, which until 1970 housed Mackinac  College. Breakfast and dinner are included for the average $170 room rate.  Facilities include a swimming pool, three tennis courts and bike rental.  </P> <P> Among a dozen or so bed and breakfast homes on the island is the Metivier Inn.  The three-story Victorian home, built in 1877, offers several turret rooms with  a view of the straits from $84 to $145.  </P> <P> The Windermere, built in 1887, is one of several waterfront hotels. It was  turned into a hotel by Patrick Doud in 1905 and is still operated by the Doud  family. Cost for two, $110 to $120.  </P> <P> (Some rates are higher during the July 15-17 Chicago-to-Mackinac and July 22-24  Port Huron-to-Mackinac sailboat races.)  </P> <P> Most of the island's hotels are within a couple of blocks of Main Street, where  souvenir, specialty shops and restaurants are intermingled with a dozen or so  fudge shops. There are several bike liveries, and the scenic three-mile ride  around the island's shore offers some pleasant diversion.  </P> <P> You can easily spend a day on Mackinac Island, and the same is true of Sault  Ste. Marie. It's less than an hour north of St. Ignace and is the oldest town  in the state. It offers a wealth of information about the state's history and  one of the most important waterways in the nation, the Soo Locks.  </P> <P> A two-hour boat tour goes through the locks, the only waterway connecting Lake  Superior to the other Great Lakes. Before the locks were built, anyone  traveling or shipping on the lakes had to portage their canoes or cargo around  the St. Mary's River rapids. To complicate matters, Lake Superior is 21 feet  higher than Lake Huron.  </P> <P> Near the locks is an information center, offering some history of the area and  a miniature model that demonstrates how boats are lowered and raised from Lake  Superior and Lake Huron.  </P> <P> For information:  </P> <P> Mackinaw Area Tourist Bureau, P.O.

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BERLINE WINS TWO MORE FOR NOTRE DAME  </P> <P> Think Notre Dame High softball Coach Cindy Kramer has tongue in cheek when she  says, "As Becca Berline goes, so goes Notre Dame"?  </P> <P> Hardly. Just compare the team's record to Berline's.  </P> <P> Berline (9-3) tossed a pair of two-hit shutouts Thursday as Notre Dame (also  9-3) remained unbeaten in pool play of the Easter Bunny Bash softball  tournament at Chaparral High in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> In the first game, the senior right-hander struck out nine and walked none as  Notre Dame defeated Rolling Hills, 1-0. Catcher Simona Errico supplied all the  offense with a third-inning home run, her third of the season.  </P> <P> In the second game, Berline struck out six and walked none in a 7-0 win over  Chaparral. Karen Erickson and Susan Gulliver each slammed their first home runs  of the year for Notre Dame.  </P> <P> Against Chaparral, Berline pitched 5 2/3 innings of no-hit ball before settling  for a two-hitter. The four hits allowed by Berline in the two games were all  singles.  </P> <P> Notre Dame can win its pool with a victory over Mar Vista today.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> Chatsworth 6, Mt. Carmel 5 -- Terry Powell's bunt single in the bottom of the  seventh inning scored Mike Mancuso from third base with the winning run as  Chatsworth finished fifth in the Far West Classic in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Chatsworth (13-3-1) rallied from 3-0 and 5-4 deficits. The Chancellors scored  two runs in the bottom of the seventh to win, the first coming in when Mitch  Root singled to score Nestor Martinez.  </P> <P> Trailing, 3-1, in the fifth, Chatsworth scored twice. Martinez delivered a  run-scoring triple, then scored on a passed ball. Chatsworth took a 4-3 lead in  the sixth on a fly by Doug Dean. Mt. Carmel scored twice in the seventh.  </P> <P> Chaminade 11, St. Genevieve 4 -- Justin Stark hit his second two-run home run  in as many days and Ted Corcoran (3-3) allowed three hits and struck out eight  in five innings to lead visiting Chaminade (9-6-1, 2-2) in a San Fernando  Valley League game.  </P></p>

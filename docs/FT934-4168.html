			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Books: Tales of love and betrayal LIONS OF GRUNEWALD by Aidan Higgins Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 8.99, 302 pages TELLING THE PICTURES by Frank Delaney HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 414 pages These two novels seem to have nothing in common but the Irishness of their authors. Higgins writes in dense prose, 'poetic' in the sense that its meaning lies in the drama of the words. Daring to a point that sometimes only just stops short of nonsense, he spins places, characters, events, further and further out of our grasp and then, like the master craftsman he is, whisks them back in front of us again. Delaney uses words to tell a well-worked story, the life arising from the people he has created, not in the describing of them. Higgins words will not lie still on the page, they dazzle and confound. Delaney writes in a near documentary style; his words know they are tools. Yet there is an unforced link between the novels. Delaney has chosen as heroine a young woman living in Belfast during the second world war who has a particular gift with words. It is Belle who 'tells the pictures', entertaining her mill worker colleagues as she acts out the latest film showing at the Ritz. Belle is famous for this and this fame defines her whole character so that real life hardly impinges on her. For her, the film world is her chosen world and she preserves an innocence and beauty at odds with the raw society in which she has grown up. It takes the kiss of a handsome prince to wake her from her dream. But, since he is a Catholic, from the Republic and she is a Protestant whose father was killed by the IRA, her awakening brings tragedy rather than happiness. Now Delaney is revealed to have a serious purpose, to be intent on revealing corruption in high places, showing the cruelty of sectarian loyalties, the bitter unfairness of Ulsterman towards Catholic. It is a black picture, turning a book that seems set to be a romance into a thriller. Delaney may not impress with stylistic fireworks, but he certainly knows how to use bleak material to shocking and (perhaps shocking to say) entertaining effect. Separating content and style is not a very productive exercise with Higgins. His story is slight. Professor Weaver, his wife Nancy and son, Nico, are living in Berlin, kindly paid for, although not enough for the Weaver's excesses, by DILDO, a mysterious organisation. Weaver is captivated by Lore, a gloriously exciting young German girl. Nancy finds out and abandons home in an attempt to bring her errant husband to his senses. But Weaver cannot decide between his women. On a visit to Ireland, he goes to a fortune teller who tells him he loves neither woman and, since he is not very good at loving, it is just as well he does love his son. Weaver returns to Munich and Lore. Around this tale of love and betrayal, Higgins weaves a cast of extraordinary characters who dance puppet-like through the pages, although their habits tend to be very flesh and blood. Higgins often gets a laugh out of the physical: 'Bog was staring raptly rudely at the slowly descending stiffly corseted determined no-longer-young rump that was slowly heavily yearningly descending . . .' Starting from a well-observed image, he rockets into the stratosphere, leaving trails of hilarity. Less amusing are little Nico's onomatopoeic stories or the pages when a heavy Irish mist seems to shroud any meaning. If you do not appreciate a chapter that opens as follows, then Higgins is not for you: ''Everything is something trembling on the verge of something else,' quoth Vlad the Impaler, lepidopterist extraordinaire, with his customary pernickety prescience and acumen. Illusion, froggy transilience, as the very stuff of happiness.' I enjoyed Lions of the Grunewald - in breath-holding gulps with sorties out of it for air.</p>

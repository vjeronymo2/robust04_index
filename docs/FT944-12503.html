			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Accor pulls the shutters down - John Ridding and Michael Skapinker examine the group's position Mr Gerard Pelisson and Mr Paul Dubrule have seen many more ups than downs in the 27 years in which they have built Accor of France into one of the world's largest hotel and travel groups. The past two months, however, have brought a series of setbacks which the group's founders and co-chairmen would probably prefer to forget. In September, Accor was defeated by Forte of the UK in a fiercely contested battle to win control of Meridien Hotels, which had been put up for sale by Air France. A few weeks later, Mr Pelisson and Mr Dubrule became entangled in a wrangle with Suez, the financial and industrial group which is Accor's largest shareholder. Last week, the group announced its first-ever loss, saying it had incurred a net half-year deficit of FFr264m (Dollars 51m), compared with a net profit of FFr109m for the same period in 1993. The financial performance and signs of shareholder disaffection raised important question about the group's prospects and strategy. They even prompted some to consider whether France's flagship leisure company be taken over. Could a successful predator break up the group, finding buyers for some of its assets, which range from the Novotel hotel chain to the Europcar car rental business to luncheon vouchers? Analysts were particularly intrigued by the apparent breach between Accor and normally loyal French institutional shareholders. Last month, after protracted discussions, Accor said it had broken off negotiations aimed at increasing Suez's 12.4 per cent stake, held through its subsidiary Societe Generale de Belgique. Accor cited 'unreasonable' demands by Suez, which it claimed was seeking a significant management role and the right to select a successor when the co-chairmen stand down. Messrs Dubrule and Pelisson have little time for speculation about instability on the shareholder register. 'We have no fear of a takeover. SGB has said it would keep its holding and 'we have faithful long term investors', said Mr Pelisson, citing Societe Generale, the French bank, and Union des Assurances de Paris, the insurer. The Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the French state financial institution, has also distanced itself from speculation that it might sell its 6.14 per cent stake in Accor. An additional reason for caution concerning the emergence of predators is that both the group and industry analysts think Accor's situation is better than might have been expected. Accor itself is sanguine in the face of last week's loss and is upbeat about prospects for the rest of the year. The company points to improved operating results, arguing that 15 of its 18 principal profit centres were ahead at the nine-month stage compared with the same period in 1993. They explain that much of the reason for the loss at the net level in the first six months was the absence of exceptional gains from disposals. First-half profits of FFr109m in 1993 were achieved only after capital gains of more than FFr400m during the period. This perspective is shared by many industry observers. 'I was not surprised by the loss,' says an analyst at one French merchant bank. He, like many industry observers, was also encouraged by the chairmen's optimism following the announcement of the results. Mr Pelisson said: 'The bad news is the loss. The good news is that over the past several months we have seen a substantial improvement in the hotels business.' Nevertheless, there is still concern about the group's prospects and strategy. Most immediately, the company continues to struggle under a debt burden of about FFr22bn, about one and a half times shareholders' equity. The rise of the debt reflects the aggressive expansive strategy pursued by the company, notably the acquisition of the Motel 6 chain in the US in 1990 and of Wagons-Lits, the Belgian travel group in 1991. 'The debt situation is a concern,' says one Paris-based analyst. But he believes that the company is now taking active steps to improve its financial position. This sentiment is shared by investors who have pushed Accor's share price up by 20 per cent since the announcement of the first-half results, recovering from the sharp losses prior to the news. The COB, the French stock-market watchdog, is investigating the falls over the previous two weeks. The strong rally reflects a belief that the company will now focus on core businesses and reduce its debts. Accor has identified FFr5bn of potential assets it could sell, from which FFr2.5bn worth of receipts are expected by the end of 1995. The group is looking for an investor in its Sofitel luxury hotel chain after its failure to win control of Meridien. Accor wants to continue running the chain, but would like an investor to take a majority stake in the assets. Mr Paul Slattery, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson, says: 'That's going to be a tall order. Sofitel is a very tired brand that has suffered from under-investment.' One solution may be Prince Al Waleed of Saudi Arabia. The prince gave financial backing to Accor's bid for Meridien. Last month he took a 25 per cent stake in Four Seasons Hotels, the Toronto-based luxury hotels chain. Neither chairman would be drawn on the prince's possible interest. But one industry analyst said: 'He is a definite possibility. He has capital and he isn't hostile.'</p>

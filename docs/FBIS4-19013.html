In the midst of reports of escalating hostilities in the  capital of the violence-torn central African country, the  ministry said the C-130 flown to Kigali today carried from  Nairobi Italian paratroopers and other members of the military  who were immediately deployed with Belgian and French forces in  the capital to safeguard the airport and assist with evacuation  operations.    Another Air Force C-130 was reported to have landed at the  Kigali airport in the evening to continue the evacuation of  expatriates. Eighty more Italian Army paratroopers were  scheduled to arrive in the evening today aboard an Air Force  Boeing 707 which will turn around tomorrow to air lift out other  Italian civilians.    The Foreign Ministry said a group of twenty Italians were  due  to arrive in the Rwandan capital from the east and another  twenty were coming from Gitarama. Eleven Italians working for  the nongovernmental organization Giuseppe Tovini, with five  Belgian nationals and forty Rwandan orphans who will be brought  to Italy, had been blocked in Riilima by the advance of rebel  forces but were now making their way to Kigali.    The evacuation of the volunteer workers, the Belgians and  their charges, said the Foreign Minister, was made possible by  Belgian troops who acted on an appeal issued by the Italian  government.    The evacuation of Italians, said the ministry, is  coordinated  by the embassies in Kampala and Nairobi with the ambassador to  Kampala in Kigali since yesterday to follow developments at  first hand. The entire operation is going forward under the  management of the ministry's crisis unit and the  Chiefs-of-Staff's operations center.    Further evacuation flights will be scheduled according to  security factors and in cooperation with Belgian and French  forces, said the ministry.    Two Italian Air Force planes, a G-222 and a Boeing 707, took  off from the Pisa Air Base this evening bound for Nairobi with  equipment and eighty paratroopers of the Col Moschin battalion  who will join in Rwanda 80 Italian troops sent Sunday aboard  three C-130 transport planes.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Letter: What the outsiders at Lloyd's would do well to recall Sir, Most correspondence on Lloyd's indicates that the greatest casualty is that market insiders have managed to lose the trust of their employers - the outsider Names. Sadly, many critics are deciding that they have had enough and leaving. Without critical Names the engine for reform at Lloyd's will stop. All the essential changes that have taken place in past years, and those suggested by the Rowland task force, have been wrested from the society by campaigning outside members. Not only have none been volunteered by the society itself but usually suggestions of change in the status quo have met strong resistance. It is essential that all the recommendations made by Mr David Rowland are implemented without delay and I hope that ministerial pressure will be applied to ensure that this is done. Judging from the speed that key recommendations about restructuring the market governance were rejected by Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, such pressure will be needed. But the report did not deal with problems of the past. They still remain unresolved and it is clear that no attempt is to be made to deal with them. Contrary to the tale sold by the Lloyd's PR machine, complaints from ruined Names are not just moaning and whingeing about losses fairly suffered in a well ordered market place. Outside members, trusting the reputation of Lloyd's for fair dealing, were not told that there were insider syndicates and as a result many never made significant profits even in the much vaunted good years. Many of those outside members were misled by their employees - their trusted agents. Whether these matters are resolved or not, in future, outside members will do well to recall Emerson's comment: 'The more he talked of his honour the faster we counted the spoons.'

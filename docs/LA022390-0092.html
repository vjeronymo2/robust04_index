			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WORKERS MARCH TO DOOR OF EX-EMPLOYER,  DEMAND PAY  </P> <P> Four undocumented workers who said they were cheated out of $1,600 in back pay  by their former employer marched down a quiet suburban street to the man's  rented hilltop home in Granada Hills Thursday, demanding payment.  </P> <P> The men were joined by about 20 other immigrant workers in a demonstration  outside Fernando Esquivia's two-story home on Elnora Place.  </P> <P> Many carried placards with the messages, "No More Abuse for Undocumented  Workers," and "We Are Not Animals. We are Human Beings. Exercise Social Justice  for Undocumented Workers."  </P> <P> The men, accompanied by reporters and representatives from the Coalition for  Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles, knocked on the door of the home, but no  one answered.  </P> <P> Esquivia, in a later interview, said that he did not owe the men any money.  </P> <P> "They're liars," Esquivia said. "If I owed them money, I would give it to them.  I'm not guilty."  </P></p>

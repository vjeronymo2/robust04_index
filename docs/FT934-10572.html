			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Foreign buying triggers concern in India - Stefan Wagstyl and RC Murthy on special discounts to multinational companies INDIAN entrepreneurs are protesting at the sight of foreign multinationals buying stock in their Indian subsidiaries at a fraction of the market price. Taking advantage of rules designed to tempt foreign groups back into India, over 30 groups have increased their stakes in their Indian units, at discounts of up to 90 per cent to market prices. Colgate Palmolive, the US toiletries group, bought stock in its Indian affiliate at a 90 per cent discount to the market; Burmah, the UK oil company which controls Castrol, secured an 89 per cent discount on shares in Castrol India; and ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering combine, bought shares in ABB India at a 78 per cent discount. Indian business families claim this is unfair because they, too, would like to buy stock cheaply. As Mr Rahul Bajaj, chairman of Bajaj Auto, the world's biggest scooter maker, says: 'If foreign companies are allowed to buy stock at a discount, so should domestic companies. We need a level playing field.' Indian business families generally own less than 20 per cent of their listed companies and would like to increase their holdings to secure better control. Some are concerned that they will be swept away by the multinationals, which, having secured control of their subsidiaries, will buy out indigenous Indian industry as well. The finance ministry has yet to decide what to do. 'We have not reached a conclusion. You can say there's a policy vacuum,' said one senior official. The origins of the argument lie in the 1970s, when multinationals were forced to cut stakes in their Indian affiliates to 40 per cent or less - often at fire-sale prices. In 1991, when the government raised the limit to 51 per cent as part of the liberalisation programme, foreign companies were slow to buy back their shares because prices were high. Last year, Indian financial institutions, which are controlled by the government and hold the bulk of Indian equities, agreed on a formula under which controlling shareholders could buy their stock at a price/earnings multiple of 15 - compared with a market average of 30. The multinationals seized their chance and arranged for their subsidiaries to sell them cut-price shares. The discounts were sometimes far greater than the Indian authorities had expected, because prices were determined by the previous year's profits - low profits meant a low price. The finance ministry did not object, since it was keen to attract the multinationals back to the country and the sums involved were modest - generally less than USDollars 10m. The share issues were subject to approval by shareholders owning at least 75 per cent of the company. But there were few objections because most shareholders thought foreign companies that increased their stakes might also bring other benefits to their Indian subsidiaries - and so bring value to shareholders. The Indian Companies Act permits such preferential issues to any shareholder, whether Indian or foreign, as long as it is approved by shareholders with 75 per cent of the stock. And some Indian groups have, like the multinationals, taken advantage of this rule. Tata, the country's largest combine, increased its holding in Tata Steel, its biggest operating company, from 8 per cent to 12 per cent about two years ago. Families which have recently raised stakes include the owners of Indian Rayon, a textile group (43 per cent discount to the market price), Vysya Bank, a leading bank (97 per cent) and Nahar Shipping (55 per cent). However, this wave of cheap issues has worried the financial institutions. Last week, they forced Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, a vehicle maker, to amend plans for an issue of equity warrants which would have enabled the founding Mahindra family to buy stock at about Rs80 (Dollars 2.55) a share, compared with a market price of Rs270. The institutions decided, in private meetings, that this was too cheap - but agreed to a price equivalent to about Rs120. With the encouragement of the finance ministry, the institutions are likely to examine future proposals for preferential issues more closely. At the ministry, some officials believe that foreign groups deserve special treatment because of the enforced losses they suffered in the 1970s. They argue that Indian business families do not deserve special protection - any more than founding families in the US and other developed countries are entitled to maintain control through preferential share issues. However, these views are not unanimous. Other officials believe the ministry should not be over-accommodating to foreigners at a time when critics of government economic policy - including the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, the right-wing Hindu party - accuse ministers of favouring foreigners at the expense of Indian companies. Indian businessmen say some techniques available in other countries are banned in India, such as using shares as security for a bank loan or issuing non-voting stock. Mr Onkar Singh Kanwar, managing director of Apollo Tyres, a leading tyremaker in which the founding family holds about 19 per cent, says: 'Foreign companies have an unfair advantage over us.' One way of ensuring fairness would be to amend the Companies Act and ban altogether the issue of shares on preferential terms to favoured shareholders. Given this possibility, it is not surprising that companies are rushing to complete their share issues lest they leave it too late.</p>

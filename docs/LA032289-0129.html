			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P> DataWorks of San Diego, a closely held publisher of business systems software  for manufacturing companies, announced it has signed a marketing contract with  NCR of Dayton, Ohio, that could generate $60 million more in sales for  DataWorks over the next four years.  </P> <P> According to the agreement announced Tuesday, NCR will market its Tower  computer system bundled with a DataWorks software package called Manufacturing  Resource Planning, or MRP II. Total sales of computer systems are projected at  $100 million over four years, of which 60% will flow to DataWorks, president  Stuart W. Clifton said.  </P> <P> Clifton described the potential market for the Tower computer system as about  60,000 manufacturing companies with sales "from $3 million up to the Fortune  500 level." DataWorks will be happy if 1% to 2% of that market buys the  $250,000 Tower systems annually, he said.  </P> <P> As a result of the contract, DataWorks plans to increase employment at its  Sorrento Valley plant from 70 workers now to 150 by mid-1990 and to 250 in  1993, Clifton said. Over that period, the company's annual sales should  increase from $5.5 million last year to $30 million in 1993, he said.  </P> <P> Founded in 1977, DataWorks was acquired by Clifton and his partner, Mark  Howlett, two years ago.

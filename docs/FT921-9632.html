			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Pay rises above inflation for 1.5m public employees: Review body average of 6.5% accepted THE GOVERNMENT decided yesterday to grant pay increases to 1.5m public employees at well above the rate of inflation. This means that pay rises in the public sector are running between 34 and 107 per cent higher than the latest average of increases in manufacturing industry. The government accepted in full review-body recommend-ations for raising the pay of the armed forces, nurses, doctors, professions allied to medicine and teachers by between 5.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent. The increases will average nearly 6.5 per cent, and take effect from April 1, ahead of the widely expected general election date of April 9. At the same time, the Confederation of British Industry reported that pay settlements in manufacturing industry fell to their lowest level since it began collecting such data in 1980. Latest figures from the CBI pay data bank showed that settlements in manufacturing averaged only 4.1 per cent in the final quarter of last year, down on the 5.1 per cent recorded in last year's third quarter and under half the 9 per cent average rises recorded in the final quarter of 1990. Yesterday's rises cover around 30 per cent of public sector employees and are the first to be awarded in full since 1989. They will cost the taxpayer about Pounds 1.84bn and are expected in the course of the year to lift the average weekly pay packet of public sector employees above that of private sector employees. The government's decision to award pay rises at well above the present 4.5 per cent rate of inflation drew strong criticism from some opposition politicians. It was denounced as a 'cynical volte-face' by Mr Alex Carlile, the Liberal Democrat party's economics spokesman, while Mr Jack Straw, Labour's education spokesman, pointed out that the last time teachers received a significant real pay increase 'was just before the 1987 election'. The government responded by saying these were the lowest awards for many years and covered groups which had not done well in the past. There was no significant move in the direction of performance related pay for any of the groups. But performance pay, favoured by the government, will be a feature of next year's awards. Among the various professions, general dental practitioners emerged with the highest pay increases: they received 8.5 per cent to reflect recruitment difficulties in the profession and an increased workload. But with a 7.5 per cent across-the-board increase in all scales from April, 420,000 teachers in England and Wales did better than any other public sector group in the pay review awards. Their increase is on top of the 9.5 per cent awarded to teachers last year. The total value of the teachers' award is 7.8 per cent, taking the average classroom teacher's salary - including allowances - to Pounds 18,200. Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, said the award was 'greater than the government had contemplated'. He defend-ed the decision to give teachers review-body status as 'an essential step in restoring the status of the teaching profession'. The armed forces will receive an average increase of 6 per cent; doctors 5.5 per cent while nurses will get rises of between 5.6 per cent and 6 per cent based on grading. The spread for the professions allied to medicine is 6.2 per cent to 6.5 per cent. The Top Salaries Review Body was not included in the announcement. The government agreed to the request from the review body to delay its report until mid-year, so it would not be affected by electoral considerations. It is expected to recommend large catch-up rises for top civil servants, judges and generals.

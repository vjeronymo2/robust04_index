			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Welsh electronics company buys Grundig TV factory in France A Welsh company is to rescue a television plant in eastern France where the German consumer electronics manufacturer Grundig had planned to stop production at the end of the year. Gooding Consumer Electronics, a privately owned and newly formed company, is paying FFr160m (Pounds 18.28m), supported by a French government grant of FFr50m, to buy the Grundig Electronique factory at Creutzwald in the Moselle region. Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, announcing the deal yesterday, said Gooding would keep 350 of the 550 jobs at the plant and the workforce could increase to more than 450 by the end of 1995. Gooding Consumer Electronics is jointly owned by Mr Alfred Gooding, a leading entrepreneur in Wales, and Mr Koen van Driel, until recently commercial director of Astra, the European radio and television satellite station, and a former managing director of Grundig UK. Mr Gooding is chairman of the new company and Mr van Driel chief executive. Mr Gooding is also chairman of two manufacturing companies in south Wales, Race Electronics and Gooding Sanken, a joint venture company with Sanken Electric of Japan which makes power supply units. The Creutzwald plant's existing capacity is 500,000 sets a year, but Mr Gooding said yesterday he intended to go for a volume market, mainly in 14in, 20in and 21in sets, and to boost production to 1m sets a year in three years. Philips, the Dutch electronics group which owns 31.6 per cent of Grundig and has management control, said in January that from the beginning of 1994 production would be switched from Creutzwald to factories in Germany and Austria. The new company is acquiring the Minerva brand name from Grundig, and is setting up a company to sell the televisions made at Creutzwald. It is also buying the brand name Continental Edison from Thomson of France, and will initially market the televisions under this name in France.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Florida's revised application includes new regulations which the State developed to be technically comparable to the requirements of the federal criteria. Florida's revised regulations became effective on January 2, 1994, and have been deemed technically comparable to the federal criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although regulatory language and structure in certain of Florida's regulations may not reflect the exact language and structure in the corresponding EPA requirements, EPA has determined that Florida will ensure compliance with 40 CFR part 258. The following paragraphs detail the major issues for which Florida was required to demonstrate technical comparability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Daily Cover_40 CFR 258.21 requires that six (6) inches of earthen material be placed over the working face of MSWLFs at the end of each working day to control blowing litter, scavenging, etc. Directors of EPA-approved states have the flexibility to allow daily covers made of alternative materials and thicknesses. Florida's regulations previously provided MSWLFs owner/operators an exemption from daily cover if the period between cessation of operation on one day and start of operation the next was 18 hours or less. Florida revised their regulatory language to eliminate this exemption and require daily cover. Florida also added language to allow a reusable tarpaulin (to be rolled out over the working face at the end of one day and taken up at the beginning of the next) as an acceptable alternative to a soil daily cover.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Liner Design_40 CFR 258.40 requires that new landfills and lateral expansions to existing landfills be constructed with a specific composite liner and leachate collection system or an alternative which ensures that drinking-water-based maximum concentration limits (MCLs) are not exceeded in the uppermost groundwater aquifer at a predetermined point of compliance (POC). The POC must be on the landfill owner/operator's property and within 150 meters (approximately 500 feet) of the landfill unit boundary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Headquarters has interpreted the federal criteria to also afford states the opportunity to present alternative liner designs to regional offices for review. If a state demonstrates, via mathematical modelling, that the proposed alternative(s) meet the minimum federal performance standard based on ``worst-case'' conditions (considering hydrology, geology, climate, groundwater flow, etc.), then the EPA regional office can approve the alternative(s) to be used as state standard(s) in lieu of the federal standard composite liner system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida's regulations allow several alternative composite liner designs and a double synthetic liner design with primary and secondary leachate collection systems. Florida has presented information, including analysis data from the MultiMed mathematical modeling program, to adequately demonstrate that each of their liners meets the federal performance standards. Additionally, Florida determines the need for corrective action due to contaminant releases from the landfill into the subsurface based on analysis of groundwater sampled at distances within 100 feet of the landfill unit boundary (as compared to the federal range of 0 to 150 meters (or approximately 500 feet) from the unit boundary). Further, in addition to sampling and analyzing groundwater, Florida performs annual analysis of leachate collected from the landfill, to determine which constituents might be expected to be found in groundwater in the event that a release does occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Groundwater Monitoring and Corrective Action_40 CFR 258.54 requires detection monitoring for sixty-two (62) constituents. Florida's original detection monitoring program required analysis of fewer and several different constituents than the federal. Florida has revised their regulatory language to include analysis of all constituents listed in 40 CFR part 258.54 in addition to their original parameters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

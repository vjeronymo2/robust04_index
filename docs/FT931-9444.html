			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Scottish Widows cuts pay-outs - At a Glance Scottish Widows has cut bonuses on its with-profits contracts. The company said that in spite of a good 1992, bonuses had to take account of low nominal investment returns compared with the 1980s, and the current low base rates. Maturity values for a policy started by a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 per month premiums are Pounds 58,754 for a 25-year policy, down from Pounds 61,505 last year. Over ten years, maturity values on the same assumptions fell from Pounds 7,295 to Pounds 6,619.</p>

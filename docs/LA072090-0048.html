			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE ORDERED TO RELEASE $539 MILLION;  </P> <P> FINANCES: RULING WOULD PROVIDE FUNDS FOR MEDI-CAL AND IN-HOME CARE PAYMENTS  HELD UP BY BUDGET IMPASSE. ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE PLANS APPEAL.  </P> <P> Capping a week of court rulings that got vital payments flowing despite the  state's record-breaking budget deadlock, a federal judge Thursday ordered the  state to release $539 million to providers of medical and social services --  including hard-pressed in-home care workers.  </P> <P> Acting on a request by a state employees union and a nonprofit legal  foundation, U.S. District Judge Jack E. Tanner issued a temporary restraining  order in Sacramento that forces the state to release $489 million in Medi-Cal  funds to thousands of hospitals, doctors and pharmacies.  </P> <P> He also ordered the payment of $50 million to 134,000 people who provide  in-home care for the elderly and disabled and who have not been paid in more  than a month. Before the court ruling, many had reported being down to their  last few dollars.  </P> <P> Many home-care workers, who clustered inside the federal courtroom Thursday,  welcomed Tanner's ruling.  </P> <P> "I just hope we get the checks soon," said Genie Scott, who receives $499 a  month to take care of a 91-year-old woman. "It's been hard. We've been . . .  getting by day by day."  </P> <P> Katrina Wash, an in-home worker who is supposed to receive $263 a month, said  she had been unable to afford even a bus ride since she stopped receiving her  state paycheck. But she said it's been even tougher for the two 90-year-old men  she cares for. "They're helpless. If I can't provide for them, they're going to  die," she said.  </P> <P> Controller Gray Davis, who supported the legal action, said that without the  court ruling he would not have been able to release the funds until the  Legislature and governor adopt a state budget for the fiscal year that began  July 1.  </P> <P> When the judge's ruling was announced at 11 a.m., Davis was in the Assembly  chamber, where lawmakers were meeting to vote on a series of budget bills.  Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) announced the ruling and told Davis:  "Now you can make the payments."  </P> <P> Thursday's ruling came a week after a similar action by another federal judge,  who ordered the state to release $149 million in welfare funds. Earlier this  week, a Sacramento County Superior Court judge ordered the state to release  $330 million in Medi-Cal funds to hospitals and nursing homes by Monday.  </P> <P> Tanner's order, which releases all of the Medi-Cal funds immediately,  apparently supersedes the Superior Court ruling. "I want clients to get their  services right now," the judge said.  </P> <P> Deputy Atty. Gen. Eugene Hill had argued that the court should not intervene in  the state budget process, but Tanner shot back: "The political process is fine,  but for those that can't help themselves -- that's just tough. That's what  you're saying."  </P> <P> Hill said his office would appeal Tanner's ruling to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court  of Appeals in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Despite the ruling, about $800 million, mainly to meet the state's mid-month  payroll and obligations to local governments, remains frozen because of the  budget impasse, according to Davis' office.  </P></p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Tsongas stays out of presidential contest MR Paul Tsongas, former senator from Massachusetts, decided yesterday not to revive his bid for the White House, virtually conceding the Democratic party's presidential nomination to Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. The New Englander had suspended his campaign after mediocre support in Illinois and Michigan had convinced him that he would not be able to take on the southerner in the New York primary this week. Yet Mr Tsongas continued to win votes. His 29 per cent in New York - second to Mr Clinton's 41 per cent but ahead of former governor Jerry Brown of California, the only other candidate still formally in the race - prompted him to consider relaunching his bid. Yesterday, Mr Tsongas said he could have re-entered the race only as a spoiler, a role he rejected. He said he wanted to preserve his message - liberal social policies and pro-business economics - but declined to endorse either of the two remaining candidates. The Clinton campaign estimates that it now has 1,327 of the 4,288 delegates who will pick the Democratic nominee at the party's convention in July. Mr Tsongas would have had to win virtually every remaining delegate.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Janos Vekas, deputy chairman of the </F> Democratic Union of Hungarians in Vojvodina, by Geza Mucsi;  place and date not given: "Janos Vekas on Aid to Vojvodina"]    [Text] Hungary intensively aids Vojvodina.  Apparently, problems do exist; Janos Vekas will speak about  these.    [Vekas] We are trying to function in the Vojvodina Hungarian  community as if the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Vojvodina  [VMDK] and the VMDK-member local government deputies formed some  kind of national minority parliament. Even now, this body can  be said to be pluralist: It includes everyone from the  Christian democrats to the social democrats, even the socialists  (but not socialists like the ones sitting in the Serbian  Parliament), and the various ideological platforms. We have  many differences, but we are held together by one fact, namely  that we want autonomy. The VMDK's national board can be seen as  an executive body, and we feel that our mandate obliges us to  deal with all issues affecting the situation of the Vojvodina  Hungarians. This is the reason we established the operative  organizations that can fulfill certain tasks, and this is how  the Vox Humana was established. Naturally, this organization  deals with humanitarian aid. At the moment, this is the only  reliable organization. However, we think that problems are  arising that affect both the professional and the political  aspects of aid. We would like to find out what proportion of  the aid that is collected under the heading of helping the  Vojvodina Hungarians actually reaches them.    [Mucsi] What about international aid?    [Vekas] We do not receive anything from the big  international aid organizations. The distribution of this aid  is largely done against us, regardless of what the intent of the  international aid organizations is. The European Union [EU]  clearly intends the aid for the refugees and for those families  who host or support refugees. What happens in practice is that,  for example in Temerin, the Hungarians can see the Serbs line up  at the town hall and take away the bacon. Hungarians in  Vojvodina are in a very delicate situation. If they, for  example the Hungarians in Zenta [Senta], conditionally accept  that they are hosting so-called refugees, then they can get  EU-aid, but this also means forced settlement in the Vojvodina,  or they exclude themselves from the aid. We have told this to  European leaders.    [Mucsi] What was the reaction to this?    [Vekas] We did not get a direct and clear answer to this  question. We collect what we can in the West through our own  resources, but this is of course negligible compared to the big  international aid services. However, in Hungary, parcels are  usually collected to help the Hungarians in Vojvodina, or, as it  were, to help the Vojvodina.    [Mucsi] This is of course different....    [Vekas] We are convinced that people in Hungary generally  think of the Hungarians in Vojvodina, however, the Hungarians  receive very little from these packages. We would like to  clarify this issue. What we can do is that, if we receive  adequate information on the collections in Hungary, and it is  clearly shown to whom, for what purpose, and where the aid is  intended, then we can say whether the consignment has arrived at  its destination. Naturally, everyone has the right to decide  whom he wants to help, and for what purpose he gives the aid --  in this sense, we do not wish to prevent anyone from aiding, for  example, the Bosnian Serbs. However, in our view, it is  dishonest to forward the aid that is collected specifically for  the Vojvodina Hungarians to some other destination.</p>

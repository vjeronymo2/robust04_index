			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Letter: Quintessential nature of Hong Kong governor's office overlooked Sir, Your leader-writer ('HK governor', January 9) is jumping the gun. When he prescribes that the successor to Sir David (now Lord) Wilson will need to be 'not only an effective representative of departing Britain, but also alert to the needs of Hong Kong people . . . a politically adept, sensitive, robust and open chief executive', he is describing the sorely-tried incumbent himself to a T. But when he adds that the next governor should not be a symbol of the Raj, he is surely overlooking the quintessential nature of the office recognised alike by Her Majesty's government, the Chinese Peoples' government and the people of Hong Kong themselves which must needs continue right up to the 1997 handover to Peking. Or are we to interpret him as advocating by implication a headlong rush to autochthonous democracy in Hong Kong, in which case why does he not say so openly? Whatever the sequel to the present regime - and none of the candidates so far canvassed appears to offer the desirable combination of personal qualities, professional expertise and political nous - long before 1997 the cry will surely go up in Hong Kong: 'Come back Wilson, all is forgiven]' William Harding, 11 Shelley Court, Tite Street, London SW3</p>

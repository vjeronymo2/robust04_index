			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Investigators dig deeper into BCCI: Extradition proceedings continue - High Court backs 'enterprising' compensation scheme / The continuing probe into the bank, shut down a year ago tomorrow ONE year on from the day the Bank of England closed the doors on Bank of Credit and Commerce International, many of those who helped conceal the fraud continue to evade the efforts of law enforcement agencies in the UK and the US. Attempts by the Serious Fraud Office to interview the 18 former BCCI executives who have been detained in Abu Dhabi since September last year continue to be rejected. Abu Dhabi is assembling its own case which it wants to try in the emirate. In the 12 months since the closure, the SFO has made three arrests and one of the main targets of its investigation is being held by police in France. The UK government has started extradition proceedings against Mr Syed Ziauddin Ali Akbar, the former head of BCCI's treasury operations which lost Dollars 633m in 1985 when he was in charge. Investigators in the US are preparing a request for the extradition from Pakistan of Mr Agha Hassan Abedi, BCCI's founder, who was indicted in the US on fraud and racketeering charges. Pakistan, however, is unlikely to accede to such a request. Mr Abedi, who lives in Karachi, has been an invalid since he underwent a heart transplant four years ago. Neither is Saudi Arabia likely to welcome any approaches from the US seeking the arrest of Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, head of National Commercial Bank, and of a banking dynasty which maintains close links with the Saudi royal family. Through a spokesman he has described the US fraud charges unveiled earlier this week as 'completely unwarranted and without justification'. Sheikh Khalid, once the second largest shareholder of BCCI, became the second of the Arabs with close connections to the bank to face charges in the US. The first was Mr Ghaith Pharaon, the mercurial Saudi businessman who is believed to have spent much of his time since the bank's collapse on his yacht in the Aegean. Mr Pharaon was indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington last November on racketeering charges connected with the purchase by BCCI in 1985 of the Independence Bank of Encino, California. He was indicted again in March in connection with an alleged fraud at CenTrust Savings Bank, of Miami, Florida. While Mr Pharaon and Sheikh Khalid remain out of reach of the US authorities, the UK investigation has secured the co-operation of two other prominent Arab businessmen connected with BCCI. The agreement to testify in the UK by Sheikh Kamal Adham and Mr AR Khalil is regarded as a crucial development for the SFO investigation. Sheikh Kamal was interviewed voluntarily in the UK by the SFO this year. The SFO has also collected evidence from Mr Khalil, a distinguished Saudi who runs a museum of art history in Jeddah. Both men were former shareholders in BCCI and both were directors with Mr Akbar of Capcom Financial Services, a UK company closely connected with BCCI. The US Federal Reserve Board has alleged that they helped to conceal BCCI's secret ownership of First American Bankshares in Washington. As a result of the interviews Sheikh Kamal could emerge as a key witness in the BCCI cases being assembled in the UK. He has not been indicted in the US, but investigators there say he is still under investigation. The co-operation of Sheikh Kamal in the UK investigation is not surprising given his long-standing relationship with the UK and the US, forged when he was head of the Saudi Arabian Intelligence during the 1970s. Another active area of investigation by the SFO centres on the role of some auditors who worked for Price Waterhouse at the time of the audit. Police raided PW offices in the Cayman Islands last month, and also visited the homes of two executives, Mr Richard Fear, a former accountant with PW, and Mr Richard Harris, a partner in PW's Caribbean firm. One other target figure which the SFO rates as highly as Mr Akbar in relation to the fraud is Mr Abbas Gokal, head of the shipping family whose business in Switzerland has been placed into liquidation. Mr Gokal has left Switzerland and is thought now to be living in Pakistan. Just how much the Gokals owe BCCI is still not clear. How much is recoverable from the collapse is difficult to gauge. Touche Ross, the provisional liquidator, has identified Dollars 10bn of liabilities. So far Touche has recovered in the region of Dollars 200m from disposals, but it has been promised Dollars 1.7bn for the pot from Abu Dhabi if creditors agree to waive their rights to sue the sheikhdom. Lord Justice Bingham's report into the actions of BCCI's regulators will study whether the Bank of England acted quickly and effectively enough when it began to receive information that suggested wrongdoing at BCCI, and whether it heeded sufficiently the warning signs in preceding years. While the closure of BCCI sent a shockwave around the financial capitals, the findings of the Bingham inquiry are likely to have their most serious repercussions in the City and its creaking framework of financial regulation.</p>

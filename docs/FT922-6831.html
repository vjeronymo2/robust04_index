			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Letter: Future view Sir, There are several points one could make about Joe Cryans' letter (May 16), but I would make just one. Canary Wharf may currently appear as 'one of the more visible mistakes of the markets', though, no doubt it seemed a good decision at the time. Perhaps it is worth saying that neither the 'New Right' nor, perhaps, the 'Old Left' is infallible. And, who knows, future generations may thank us for our wisdom and foresight in building such a wonderful office complex. J H Bescoby, 4 Bishops Court, Knoll Hill, Bristol, BS9 1NS</p>

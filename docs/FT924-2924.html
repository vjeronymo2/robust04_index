			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Letter: Snicker bar gains currency in Russia Sir, Observer should take comfort ('Basket cases', December 8) that there have been no Treasury whisperings about the Mars bar as an alternative currency. On a visit to Moscow last week, I found that the Moscow Tribune, a daily free newspaper celebrating its 20th anniversary (20 days, not years, of uninhibited publication), was running a Snicker index. Present street kiosk prices for the Snicker chocolate bar are inflating by 20 per cent a week. Travellers to Russia might bear this in mind when debating which 'currency' to take with them.

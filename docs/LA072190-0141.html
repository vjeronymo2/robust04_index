			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALFED REPORTS FIRST QUARTERLY LOSS IN 8 YEARS;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE PARENT OF CALIFORNIA FEDERAL BANK BLAMES THE $53-MILLION HIT  PARTLY ON THE STATE'S WEAKENING COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET.  </P> <P> The parent of California Federal Bank, one of the nation's largest savings and  loans, reported its first quarterly loss in eight years Friday in another  indication that problems with commercial real estate loans in California are  spreading further through the state's banking system.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based CalFed Inc. said it lost $53 million in the second quarter  because of $78.3 million in additions to loan-loss reserves as well as $13.4  million in losses on real estate in which it had a direct investment. The  company earned $19.1 million in the second quarter of 1989.  </P> <P> The announcement comes hard on the heels of news earlier this week that another  large California S&amp;L company, HomeFed Corp., lost $108 million in the  second quarter, also because of problems with commercial real estate loans.  </P> <P> "I don't think this is the last time you're going to see problems with  commercial real estate in California," said Peter Treadway, analyst for Smith  Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. "I think the market is going to  provide more unpleasant surprises in the next two years."  </P> <P> The red ink is reminiscent of the losses that some commercial banks in  California sustained in the mid-1980s when their real estate loans went sour.  California Federal last lost money in the early 1980s after interest rates  soared sky high and drenched the entire thrift industry in heavy losses.  </P> <P> Jerry St. Dennis, chief executive of CalFed, blamed the current problems mainly  on declining real estate values and an oversupply of commercial real estate.  CalFed said its problems are occurring in California as well as in Arizona and  the Southeast.  </P> <P> Properties that have gotten into trouble include an apartment building in  Southern California, an office building near San Francisco, a hotel in Florida  and a shopping center in South Carolina, company officials say.  </P> <P> In a phone interview, St. Dennis said the California commercial real estate  market is in the grip of a slow decline that will probably last two years  before the market rebounds. Downtown Los Angeles, San Diego and suburban San  Francisco are particularly overbuilt, CalFed officials say.  </P> <P> The losses by CalFed and Home-Fed also reflect a tougher stance by banking  regulators, who are pushing financial institutions to recognize their problems  more quickly and accurately.  </P> <P> These losses are "not a surprise to anyone who follows this industry," said  Allan G. Bortel, financial analyst for Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco.  "Regulators are taking a very tough stand. CalFed is not alone. They are  neither the first nor last to be setting up these reserves."  </P> <P> The losses are also another reminder that California's largest savings and  loans, once regarded as the best-run in the industry, have lost their immunity  to the problems that have devastated so many of their smaller competitors.  </P> <P> Once-healthy thrifts such as Great American Savings in San Diego and Columbia  Savings in Beverly Hills have sustained huge losses in recent months and seen  their long-time chief executives step aside.  </P> <P> About the only large California thrifts that have escaped heavy losses are  those devoted almost exclusively to single-family mortgage lending, the  traditional staple of the savings and loan industry. These include World  Savings and Home Savings of America.  </P></p>

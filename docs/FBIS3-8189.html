[Stastny] Does our policy of reinforcing the Czech units  follow some long-term objective, and when will the name of our  officer who has been appointed commander of the South Sector  units be published?    [Novotny] Our Republic was officially requested to  commission an officer to assume command of the South units on 30  April 1994. The officer's name will be released as soon as the  appointment is approved by the appropriate UN bodies. I believe  that it shows an appreciation of the work of our soldiers in  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and recognition of the fact that  our battalion has operated in the region since the beginning of  the conflict. At this time, we have in Yugoslavia a chief of  staff, Taichman, whose work is highly valued.    [Stastny] Did the reinforcement of Russian units to double  the original strength take place at the request of the UNPROFOR  command, or did the initiative come from the Russian side?    [Novotny] According to my sources, the Russian side offered  its units, and the UNPROFOR command accepted the offer. All of  the other activities, including the transfer of Russian units to  other territories, are conducted at the request of the command.  I believe that these units are subordinated to the UNPROFOR  command like all of the others. This body expressed its  agreement to their transfer to the Sarajevo region and, as far  as I know, additional paratrooper units have also been offered,  but that is a matter for UNPROFOR to comment on.    [Stastny] Have you been consulted regarding Minister  Baudys's initiative?    [Novotny] At the time this idea was taking shape, I was  abroad--with our soldiers in Serbian Krajina. Moreover, a  subordinate cannot assess the work of his superior.</p>

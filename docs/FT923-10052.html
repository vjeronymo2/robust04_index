			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Lloyds weak on interim FOLLOWING the interim trading report, Lloyds Bank slipped 23 to 401p. Operating profits for the half year fell to Pounds 697m from Pounds 729m and chief executive Mr Brian Pitman said trading conditions are likely to remain tough, with little economic recovery in sight. He added that 'with continuing high real interest rates and slack loan demand we shall continue our efforts to to enhance customer service, reduce costs and improve the quality of our loan portfolio.' Turnover was at least double the usual daily level at 5.8m shares. Provision for bad and doubtful debts, excluding problem countries, declined to Pounds 401m from Pounds 429m in the first half of last year, while an improvement in the outlook for problem country debt meant there was a net release of these provisions of Pounds 72m. The bank's first half profits rose by Pounds 38m, or 11 per cent, to Pounds 369m, but retail banking profit in the UK was only Pounds 11m against Pounds 56m. Operating expenses were lower, due largely to a reduction in the number of employees, but positive factors were offset by a fall in net interest income. Trafalgar upset Worries that Trafalgar House may be in danger of breaching some of its banking covenants persisted in the market yesterday undermining the shares in heavy turnover of 5m. Trafalgar's interests in shipping, property, hotels, engineering and construction have borne the brunt of the recession and anxiety about the group's debt position have emerged before. The company yesterday took the unusual step of issuing a statement saying it saw 'no reason' for the share price fall. Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull said: 'We have been concerned about the company's short-term liquidity, but have been assured by the company that it has no onerous covenants and that it has Pounds 700m of unutilised committed banking faciltiies.' Trafalgar shares, which stood at 160p at the beginning of May, yesterday tumbled back to 45p before recovering to 51p, a net fall of 3 on the day. Press reports that a recent warehouse fire may have pollution repercussions for Allied Colloids sent the shares down 8 to 166p. Sentiment was not improved as Hoare Govett reiterated its sell stance on the stock. The resignation of a director at Laporte sent the shares into hasty retreat before a late rally. They closed at 521p after touching 505p, a net 10 off. Following ICI's demerger plans, Fisons continued to attract interest on speculation that it could be in line for a takeover by one of the new ICI segments. Fisons shares rose 5 to 178p. After Thursday's huge jump, ICI retreated 8 to 1163p. Property group MEPC jumped 10 to 236p in turnover of 6.9m - its highest volume for nearly three years - as some in the market felt that the downgrades and negative sentiment in the sector had been overdone. Hotel group Forte was the best performer in the leisure sector as talk that new non-exceutive directors might be appointed soon and that they would bring substantial weight to a board long-criticised by analysts for lacking fresh blood. There were also suggestions that Forte had been legitimately buying its own stock over the last couple of days, although Forte was later said to have denied this. The shares jumped 7 to 157p in brisk turnover of 4.6m. Forte was also reported gleeful that its Gardner Merchant subsidiary had won a substantial contract from its arch rival Compass Group. Shares in the latter slipped 2 to 409p. However, Ms Sarah Clements at Paribas, moving to a strong buy stance, said that Compass was a good defensive stock and that the shares had an upside potential of 530p in the short-term. A proposed management reorganisation at TI Group was well received and the shares put on 4 to 308p. Conglomerate Harrison and Crossfield was subject to adverse comment and a bout of profit-taking following results on Thursday. The shares slid 7 to 127p. News of improved holiday bookings lifted sentiment in photograph processing group London International, with both Hoare Govett and Lehman Brothers positive. The shares jumped 16 to 186p. A series of reviews of the media sector by UK brokerage houses inspired activity in several of the leading names. Reuters, the global business communications network, extended its recovery from the fall of around 13 per cent since the interim trading statement, gaining 24 to 1042p. Investment optimism was encouraged by yesterday's announcement that two of Chicago's largest futures contracts will be listed for trading on Reuters' Globex system from this weekend. Reuters shares have been obvious beneficiaries of this week's recovery on Wall Street but London buyers were in evidence yesterday following a recommendation from Hoare Govett which described the stock as 'undervalued'. But publishing stocks continued to suffer from their association with the fall in advertising revenues. Reed International, with 40 per cent of revenue taken in the form of advertising, lost 10 to 483p, although it was identified by SG Warburg Securities as 'poised for early recovery and equally resilient if it arrives at glacial speed.' Unilever was unchanged at 942p despite hopes of higher interim profits on August 7. Analysts are looking for a rise to Pounds 862-Pounds 882m from Pounds 840m previously. Hot European weather in May and early June is expected to have boosted ice cream sales, in which Unilever is the leading producer. Shares in jewellery chain Ratners were unchanged at 9p after the company said it plans to poublish its delayed accounts 'as soon as practicable.' Accounts for the year-end to February 1 were due to be issued by August 1, but has notified the Stock Exchange of the delay. The group said it is at an advanced stage in finalising negotiations with its lenders to continue existing facilities. British Gas lost 6 1/2 at 240p, ahead of an announcement by Ofgas, the industry watchdog, that it will make a monopoly reference on the gas transportation industry. BP slipped 2 to 212p on rumours of a broker downgrading, but Shell improved 5 to 471p as its US arm turned last year's second quarter loss of Dollars 68m into a profit of Dollars 183m. Troubled exploration group Lasmo gained a penny to 132p, but County NatWest said the company is not yet out of the woods, despite this week's news of a maintained interim dividend. Profits will remain under pressure, while there are two more year of rising debt and gearing, according to County. Banks had a generally weaker tone, in sympathy with Lloyds. Barclays fell 5 to 314p and National Westminster gave up 8 at 317p, but HSBC gained 3 1/2 to 339p in positive reaction to this week's interim figures from its Midland Bank subsidiary. There was little relief for holiday park operator Euro Disney, amid gloom over poor attendance figures and losses. The shares rounded off a bad week in the market shedding a further 33 to 875p.

			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. JET DROPS BOMB ON NAVY CRUISER; 5 HURT  </P> <P> A U.S. warplane accidentally dropped a 500-pound bomb Monday on the Navy  guided-missile cruiser Reeves during maneuvers in the Indian Ocean, slightly  injuring five sailors and leaving a 5-foot hole in the ship's main deck, the  Navy said.  </P> <P> The bomb, which detonated on impact, set off a small fire that was quickly  extinguished, Lt. Bruce Cole, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon, said.  </P> <P> Cole said the injuries occurred "as a result of flying glass and concussion"  from the exploding bomb. The sailors were treated on board the Reeves, he said.  </P> <P> The bomb, described as about 4 feet long and 14 inches in diameter, did no  damage to the outer hull, Cole said.  </P> <P> The aircraft, a single-seat F/A-18 Hornet, had been dispatched from the carrier  Midway. It returned to the carrier, where the pilot was debriefed by Navy  officials, Cole said.  </P> <P> Cole said that the pilot "inadvertently" dropped the bomb during "routine  weapons training."  </P> <P> The cruiser was about 32 miles from Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.  </P> <P> The Midway and the Reeves are permanently based in Yokosuka, Japan.  </P></p>

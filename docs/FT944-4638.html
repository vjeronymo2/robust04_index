			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Final call for Brazilian airline sale - Embraer's sell-off has been much delayed Embraer, Brazil's aircraft manufacturer, finally comes to the Sao Paulo stock exchange today after a series of delays and a financial restructuring. in an auction at Sao Paulo's stock exchange. The leading manufacturer of regional aircraft, once regarded as one of the country's best-run government enterprises, has been hit by the depressed world aircraft industry, falling orders from the Brazilian air force and government investment restrictions. Over the past four years accumulated losses have risen to about Dollars 600m. The government is selling 6.2m shares, 55.4 per cent of the voting stock, at a reserve price of RDollars 153.7m (USDollars 179.3m). The government holds 87 per cent of the voting capital, which makes up 91 per cent of the total capital. So-called privatisation currencies - debt securities of the federal government and public sector companies - will be accepted in the auction. Brazilian pension funds, which hold a large number of these securities, are likely to end up controlling the company, according to Embraer's financial director Mr Manoel de Oliveira. Under the terms of the sale, the purchasers will also have to provide RDollars 30m in cash for a capital increase. Direct competitors of Embraer in the aerospace industry are prohibited from buying shares, although some foreign investors may take part in the sale via local brokers. Furthermore, the government is to retain a 'golden share', allowing it to veto decisions it regards as against the national interest, such as the transfer of military technology abroad. The government will continue to hold 20 per cent of the voting stock. Employees and the public will be offered 10 per cent each and the government-controlled Banco do Brasil holds 4.6 per cent. The sale has been postponed four times because of the company's financial problems; its debts stood at about Dollars 1bn at the end of 1993. A financial restructuring has been achieved following a government capital injection of about Dollars 350m, combined with debt agreements with Banco do Brasil and company bondholders, and its September balance sheet showed a positive net worth - the first time for eight years - of RDollars 411m. The company, which has 5,600 workers, is based at Sao Jose dos Campos, about 80km outside Sao Paulo. The main aircraft produced are the 30-seat Brasilia, , of which 230 have been sold in the US, and the military trainer Tucano, which has 60 per cent of the market for training aircraft, according to Mr Oliveira. The Tucano production line is the only one operating at full capacity, due to an order for 80 aircraft from the French government in 1991. The company is betting on two projects for future growth: a 50-seat regional jet known as the Embraer 145 and the Super Tucano, an updated model of its current training aircraft. Embraer will be sold jointly with its three subsidiaries: Neiva, which makes small aircraft for agricultural use, and its two trading and maintenance companies in the US and France.</p>

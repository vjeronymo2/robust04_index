			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Flooding keeps Chicago trade low TRADING at Chicago's futures markets and other businesses suffered for a third day yesterday after floods and power cuts following an accident in the underground system on Monday. The Chicago Board of Trade, the largest futures exchange in the world, opened for just two hours yesterday and will open only a few more hours today. The market has traded the equivalent of only one full day over the three days since the floods. Department stores were still closed yesterday. Unofficial estimates put the losses in damage and lost sales since Monday at around Dollars 1m (Pounds 565,000) a day. Mr Thomas Donovan, CBOT president, said it was essential the futures markets opened 'as soon as possible'. Trading volume at the London International Financial Futures Exchange had increased by about 400 per cent since the flood on Monday, according to Mr Donovan. The CBOT's closure has also affected the financial and agricultural markets. There has been no trading in the CBOT's futures on the US Treasury bond, the most actively traded futures in the world. In the grain market, the inability to hedge transactions has led to cancellation of orders from around the world and has virtually halted the movement of grain into US storage elevators. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's second largest futures market, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the world's largest options market, and the Midwest Stock Exchange, were trading normally yesterday. The business district has been declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.</p>

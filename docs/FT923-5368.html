			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Merseyside pharmaceutical facility A manufacturing and packaging centre to be constructed by TARMAC CONSTRUCTION for Glaxo on Merseyside could be the quickest building project ever undertaken by the pharmaceuticals giant. Under a 'fast-track' Pounds 7.7m contract, Tarmac is scheduled to complete the structural work by next February. The facility, alongside Glaxo's existing plant at Speke, Liverpool, will play a key role in the production of a new generation of inhalers for asthma sufferers. The facility, with its high-technology manufacturing equipment, will represent a total investment of Pounds 17m by Glaxo at Speke. Production at the plant is expected to start in July creating an extra 80 jobs. The futuristic 6,000 sq metre building will have a spacious and eye-catching glass-fronted reception area. Another feature includes a viewing gallery for visitors to look out over the entire production area. The facility will also have its own extensive laboratories, engineering workshop, training and changing rooms, and a delivery bay for production materials.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Customs poses hospitality threat Over-enthusiastic claims by companies for rebates of value added tax on business entertainment expenses yesterday prompted Customs &amp; Excise to threaten a clampdown on corporate hospitality. Customs believes that goods or services bought for the purpose of business entertainment should not be eligible for VAT refunds. European and English law has long prevented VAT relief on pure business hospitality, but it has left a grey area when it comes to other business activities which include an element of entertainment. In the light of a series of contradictory VAT tribunal and court judgments, Customs said yesterday it would put all appeals on such cases on hold while seeking guidance from the courts. The problem started with Plant and Repair (South Wales), a small Cardiff-based company, which tried to claim back as office expenses some of the VAT on its costs for maintaining a box at Cardiff Arms Park, the rugby stadium. The company insisted it used the box primarily as an office and only incidentally for entertaining clients at the weekend. The VAT tribunal was unconvinced and forbade any rebate. It took the same sceptical view of a rebate claim from Thorn-EMI, which asked for its VAT back on some of the costs of running its chalet at the Farnborough Airshow. But the High Court upheld the company's claim in March, arguing that its chalets were temporary offices and that it was possible to apportion its expenses between business and entertainment costs. Customs said yesterday it would appeal, while conceding in the meantime that companies may claim back VAT on their non-entertainment costs.</p>

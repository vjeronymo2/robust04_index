			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Brijnandan Singh: "Will the By-Elections Change </F> the Balance?"]    [Text] The Election Commission has decided the date for  holding the vidhan sabha by-election in Uttar Pradesh [U.P.] The  political corridor of the state started to buzz as soon as the  election was announced and political activities are increasing  as the election date approaches. All the political parties will  try to test their strength in this by-election as this will be  the first election since the November 1993 election that will  show which party still has the hold on the people and which  party is losing its support.    There were seven seats vacant in the state and the Election  Commission is holding elections for six of these seats. The  election for the remaining seat will be possible only after the  Supreme Court issues its decision as several cases associated  with this controversial district are being tried in the Supreme  Court. The seven districts where elections are to be held are:  Hastinapur (Meerut), Nidholikala, Kasganj (Eta district),  Jaswant Nagar (Etawah district), Unnao (Unnao district),  Manjhanpur (Allahabad district), and Gazipur (Gazipur district).  The Commission has suspended the by-election in Jaswantnagar  until the Supreme Court makes its decision. Therefore, at  present election will be held only in six districts. Among  these, Hastinapur (Meerut) and Manjhanpur (Allahabad) are  reserved seats.    The most important election races will be in Nidholikala and  Kansganj because the candidates who later became chief ministers  had run for elections here and these seats were vacated because  of their appointments. Present Chief Minister Mulayam Singh had  run from Nidholikala and former Chief Minister Kalyan Singh from  Kasganj. These chief ministers had run for election from other  districts also and had to give up these seats because they had  won there as well. The national working committee of the BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party] has decided that tickets for these  seats will be issued to the same candidates who had ran for  election here the last time and has decided the names of its  candidates already. It will make the announcement after looking  at the list of candidates running on the main rival, the SP-BSP  [Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party] coalition. If necessary,  candidates may be changed in special situations. It is difficult  to change candidates once the announcement has been made.  Meanwhile, the names of SP-BSP coalition candidates have also  been decided. According to their agreement, both BSP and SP will  have candidates run in two constituencies.    The two major political parties of the state--the Congress  and the Janata Dal--will not stay behind. They also consider  these by-elections important. The Congress and the Janata Dal  will also have their former candidates in those districts run  again. However, both these parties need strong candidates with  money and power behind them in Nidholikala and Kasganj  districts. The Janata Dal will nominate Yadav candidates in both  districts because they had Yadav candidates the last time also.  Anil Yadav had run on the Congress ticket in Nidholikala last  time, however, the Congress Party can also change its both  candidates for the by-elections.    The Kasganj and Nidholikala districts are more important  than  others. The political situation in Nidholikala and Kasganj is  very similar, because both districts are similar in size and  population. The make up of voters is different. In Kasganj  vidhan sabha district, there are 45,000 Lodhis, 18,000 Brahmans,  20,000 Banias [trader caste], and the rest is made of other  castes. The former Chief Minister Kalyan Singh had ran for  election here keeping this distribution of voters in mind.  Kalyan Singh was successful because all the votes of higher  castes (Lodhi, Brahman, and Bania) went to him. Kalyan Singh got  the Lodhi vote because of his caste, and Brahman-Bania votes  because of his party. Kalyan Singh had won the election by  45,000 votes. The remaining votes of Harijans, backwards, and  Muslims were shared by all candidates. The number of these votes  was small.    The voter distribution in Nidholikala is similar to Kasganj.  The majority of voters (40,000) are Yadavs. There are 19,000  Rajputs, and 10,000 Lodhis. The remaining votes are of other  caste members. Mulayam Singh had run for elections considering  the Yadav votes as his base. He was successful as he got 40,000  Yadav and some Harijan and Muslim votes as well as 2,000 Lodhi  votes. The specialty of these two seats and the two candidates  was that both of them were candidates for chief ministership  which helped them get the votes of their own caste as well as  vote from support groups. The situation in these by-elections is  very different. There is no chief minister aspirant who had put  the caste pride in the hands of the voters of their own caste,  which this had helped remove all in-fighting and differences.  Those who were running for vidhan sabha seats could not raise  any issue or slogan as caste was controlling everything here.    The caste will not control the election this time. The  people  will focus on development projects and issues, and will votes  after analyzing the good and bad deeds of the government. The  government has started some work to keep Harijans and Muslims  happy. Recently, a confrontational situation had developed  between the Harijans and the police over a statue of Amedekar.  The state government transferred the police officers from  Shergarhi police station and took over the task of installing  the statue and finding land for it.    In order to charm the Muslim voters, the government changed  the name of Kanpur village to Akbarpur. The people there were  openly opposing it. The leaders of other parties complained that  the government was changing names of places following the policy  of appeasement in order to benefit in the by-election. The  question is whether the Harijans will vote for the party in  power again because the incidence of confrontation between the  Harijans and other backward castes has increased after the  SP-BSP government was installed. The Harijans have not forgotten  it. The officials in the government media are also opposing the  government's publicity methods.</p>

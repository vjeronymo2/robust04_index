			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI Any change in the high street landscape is guaranteed to make headlines. But yesterday's announcement from Thorn EMI that it is pulling out of UK electrical retailing is less dramatic than it seems. Thorn never made any secret of its wish to get rid of Rumbelows, which has been losing money steadily for five years. The best solution would have been to find a buyer for the whole business. Not surprisingly in such an overcrowded sector, there were no takers. Shutting the operation was ruled out by the length of some of the unexpired leases and the size of the writedowns involved. In the event, a compromise has been reached which should result in the sale of 50 out-of-town Atlantis outlets and the incorporation of perhaps 250 of the remaining 450 Rumbelows stores into Thorn's existing UK rental activities. There are obvious risks at this stage in the cycle, not least in the fact that Granada is also sharpening up its act. But even assuming that concepts like rent-to-buy prove less appealing than Thorn hopes, the cost of further slimming will be cheaper with the passage of time. The issue for investors is not so much when the likely Pounds 40m-Pounds 45m extraordinary charge for the year soon ending will be recouped above the line. The question is whether Thorn's new premium rating can be sustained. A prospective multiple 15 per cent above the market average can perhaps be defended on the grounds of the company's defensive strengths. The danger is that the shares, resting on the fortunes of two solid cash generators, will be eclipsed when the time comes to buy the cyclicals.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Longer-term loans in demand - Fixed rates continue to rise Fixed-rate mortgages are continuing to move upwards because of a general rise in fixed interest rates. Halifax's latest rates are roughly half a percentage point higher, Abbey's are between 0.3 and 0.4 of a point higher, while Lloyds bank has raised most of its fixed rates by 0.74 of a point. The highest rises, according to Walter Avrili of mortgage broker John Charcol, are concentrated in the three- to five-year fixed rate market. 'After months of rates coming down, fixed rates have been increasing, and we may find there was a window of six months when five-year rates dropped to an exceptionally low level,' he adds. Halifax and Nationwide, the two largest building societies say five-year fixed rates have been increasing in popularity at the expense of those over two and three years. Until recently, most five-year fixed rates had been at, or below, the standard variable rate of 7.64-7.74 per cent. But the table shows that new five-year rates are now above this level. Most of those listed are at 8.49 per cent (Barclays, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, Halifax) but Lloyds bank is offering a five-year fix at 7.99 and Britannia one at 8.25 per cent. Some lenders are giving special offers, such as cash refunds and free valuations, but terms can vary substantially. C&amp;G no longer charges a valuation fee and Abbey National will refund the valuation fee on completion. At Nationwide, you need a 15 per cent deposit to escape the valuation fee. Barclays bank has introduced a new system of charging the early redemption penalty, initially on its three-year fixed rate only. The penalty will be based on the amount of time the fixed rate has run and the level of interest rates when the early redemption is made. Other lenders, such as C&amp;G, Halifax and Nationwide already reduce the size of the penalty in the later years of the fixed rate term. On the other hand, Halifax charges three months' gross interest beyond the term of its two- and three-year fixed rates. 'We want customer loyalty and at least a three-year relationship with a customer,' the society says. Should borrowers wait to see if fixed rates will fall before making a move? The illustration shows how important timing can be when it comes to fixing your mortgage, although fractional changes in fixed rates will not make a significant difference. 'Without a crystal ball, no one knows whether fixed rates will fall back to the same levels,' says Avrili. 'There could be another window later this year, but borrowers should ask themselves if it is worth taking the risk of waiting and then finding rates continuing to move up.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 NEW FIXED-RATE MORTGAGES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              Rate %    Fixed    Loan to  Fee    Redemptn      Special Lender       (APR)     period   value    pounds  penalty       offers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey      6.49 (6.8)  30/6/96  95% max  250*    60 days          - National   7.25 (7.6)  30/6/97  95% max  250*    90 days          -            7.55 (7.9)  30/6/98  95% max  300*   120 days          -  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Barclays   7.59 (7.9)  28/2/97  95% max  300    variable         #            8.49 (8.9)  28/2/99  95% max  300**   6 mnths          -            7.99 (8.3)  28/2/99  95% max  200     6 mnths      FTB only            8.99 (9.5)  29/2/04  95% max  400**   7 mnths          -  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Britannia  4.95 (5.3)   1/5/95  95% ##   100  60dys+Pounds 150 FTb only bs         6.50 (7.0)   1/5/96  95% ##   200  90dys+Pounds 200    -            8.25 (8.9)   1/5/99  95% ##   275  90dys+Pounds 350    -  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cheltenham 8.49 (8.9) five yrs  95%      250  variable           ### &amp; Gloucs bs  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First      6.25 (6.6) 31/1/97+  75%      250  3 mnths+            - Mortgage Secs  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Halifax    6.99 (7.4)  31/1/96  95%      150  3 mnths++         cash            7.49 (8.0)  31/1/97  95%      200  3 mnths++      incntve            7.99 (8.6)  31/1/98  95%      250  variable         of up            8.49 (9.1)  31/1/99  95%      250  variable            to            8.99 (9.7)  31/1/04  95%      250  variable    pounds 500  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lloyds     4.99 (5.2)  31/5/95  95%      250   3 mnths        FTB+++            6.99 (7.3)  31/5/96  95%      250   3 mnths            -            7.99 (8.4)  31/5/99  95%      250   3 mnths            -            8.99 (9.5)  31/5/04  95%      250   6 mnths            -            9.5 (10.1)  31/5/09  95%      250  10 mnths            -            9.5 (10.1)  31/5/14  95%      250  10 mnths            -            9.5 (10.1)  31/5/19  95%      250  10 mnths            -  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Nationwide 6.89 (7.4)  2 years  95%##   250??? 3 mnths          ####            7.69 (8.3)  3 years  95%##    295  variable            8.79 (9.5)  5 years  95%##    295  variable            9.29(10.1)  7 years  95%##    295  variable  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes: Abbey National's rates apply to new house purchases. * Pounds 90 for first-time buyers.  # valuation fee refunded on completion if application made by May 3; **  Pounds 100 returned if life insurance-related policy.  ## lower rate if loan to value is less.  ### no valuation fee payable; borrowers interviewed in a C&amp;G branch receive Pounds 50 off moving costs on mortgage completion.  ++++ Rate also offered as capped, minimum loan term is 10 years; one month's interest early redemption penalty in variable-rate period.  ++ until 31/7/97. +++ Conditional on insurance-related product.  *** Refunded with valuation fee if application before May 31 1994.  ???

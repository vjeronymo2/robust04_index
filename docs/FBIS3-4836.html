			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Should Forget About </F> Compensation Claims"]    [Excerpts] It was like dry-season lightning when the  foreign press began reporting that the United States began talks  with Cambodia on 24 February on compensation claims arising from  the takeover of Cambodia by the communists in 1975. The claims  also encompass all private debts.    The claims by the United States are correct based on the  view  that the new government should inherit all the legacies from old  governments. Logically, however, the United States' demands  appear to be totally unreasonable.    It is widely known that the Polpotists seized all private  assets, whether or not they were owned by U.S. or Cambodian  individuals or any other countries. It is widely agreed that  the current government cannot be accountable for what the Khmer  Rouge clique seized. The Khmer Rouge pulled themselves out of  the UN-organized peace process. They should be asked to pay for  private property they destroyed. If Washington is determined to  claim compensation, it would only be diplomatic excess.  Moreover, it is worth noting that what happened in Saigon and  what happened in Phnom Penh after 1975 were completely different  -- the communists who confiscated private assets in Cambodia  have already been outlawed, a situation completely different  from that in Vietnam. [passage omitted]    The United States should forget about compensation claims  from Cambodia as it has done with other Third World countries.  What the Cambodian people want to see from the United States is  its determination to make a success of the international  conference on the reconstruction of Cambodia to be held in  Tokyo, Japan, on 10 and 11 March 1994, according to the wish of  Cambodia, one of the poorest countries of the world.</p>

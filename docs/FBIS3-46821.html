"It is an intolerable national misfortune that our  homogeneous nation who has glorified its 5,000 year long history  with Tangun as its father is still living, divided into the  North and South for nearly half a century, failing to remove the  tragedy of national split forced on it by outside forces," she  said, adding that the cause of national reunification must be  achieved at an early date to meet the unanimous, ardent  aspirations of the whole nation and hand down the reunified  country to the posterity.    She pointed out that the South Korean authorities, however,  ignoring the DPRK's magnanimous proposals and sincere efforts,  have staged large-scale military exercises against the DPRK  frequently in collusion with foreign forces and have been  jeopardizing North-South relations by clamouring for "military  counteraction" and an "international cooperation system" on the  pretext of its "nuclear problem".    "This shows that the South Korean chief executive's  `promise'  to place the nation above anything else in the discussion of the  reunification question was a sheer lie and that the present  `regime' too is a flunkeyist, traitorous `regime', an  anti-national fascist `regime' and a separatist `regime' that  does not differ from the successive military dictatorial  regimes," she said, and stressed:    "If the South Korean authorities really want a solution of  the national reunification question, they must, though  belatedly, stop their anti-national acts to harm and stifle the  same fellow countrymen by dancing to the `nuclear' tune of  outside forces and must turn to the stand of national  independence, not hinder the nuclear problem on the Korean  peninsula from being solved fairly through DPRK-USA talks but  join in the efforts to achieve national reconciliation and unity  in response to our 10-point programme of the great unity of the  whole nation."</p>

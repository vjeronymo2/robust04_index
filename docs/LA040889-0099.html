			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERATIC RICHES ON THE PORCH  </P> <P> I must express my regrets over music critic Martin Bernheimer's recent forays  in New York. I'm an opera fan who does not think it is the job of The Times to  tell me what's going on in the Big Apple. (The fact that I couldn't care less  what Marty thinks also has something to do with it.)  </P> <P> With San Francisco and San Diego running full tilt, there is enough opera in  California without having to send out Mr. B. as our good-will ambassador. (Now  it all becomes clear why Angelenos have such a bad rep in N.Y.)  </P> <P> I realize "everything is local news," but opera reviews don't travel well.  Let's focus on the riches on the back porch, shall we?  </P> <P> PATRICK J. MACK  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Forte aims for agreed settlement to Savoy imbroglio FORTE, the hotel and restaurants group, has decided it will try to avoid a hostile bid for Savoy Hotel when a five-year truce between the two companies ends in November next year. Although Forte would still like to gain control of Savoy, it is believed to favour an agreed settlement. It is thought to fear that an announced bid would drive up the Savoy share price and make an acquisition more expensive. Forte fought a bitter battle to take over its rival during the 1980s which gave it a majority of Savoy shares but a minority of voting shares. The two groups reached a stand-still agreement, under which Forte said it would give 12 months' notice if it wanted to increase its shareholding after November 1994. This means that if Forte wants to gain control of Savoy as soon as the five-year period ends it will have to give notice next month. This is now unlikely to happen. Instead, Forte is expected to try to persuade Savoy that a merger of the two companies' luxury hotels is preferable to a reopening of hostilities. Mr Forte has said he would like to create a new luxury hotel group over which Forte would have majority control. The group would encompass the Savoy establishments, which include the Savoy, the Connaught and Claridge's. Forte would place its Exclusive Portfolio of hotels in the group. These include the Grosvenor House and Hyde Park Hotels in London, the Westbury and Plaza Athenee in New York, the Ritz in Madrid and the George V in Paris.</p>

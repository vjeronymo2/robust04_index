			<p>BFN     [Text] The number of newspapers now registered in Sierra  Leone under the new press guidelines has risen to 11. These  include two newspapers that will be in circulation for the first  time -- [newspaper names indistinct]. So far, out of the number  of newspapers that operated under the 1993 press guidelines,  only two have so far not been fully registered -- THE NATION and  GLOBE newspapers. According to the public relations division of  the government information services, there are all indications  that more newspapers will be in circulation this year,  particularly so (?since) the 1993 deadline for registration and  reregistration has been abolished.</p>

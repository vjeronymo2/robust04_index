			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE WRITERS' CONTEST;  </P> <P> WHY FROGS GO A-COURTIN' AND OTHER ODD MYSTERIES  </P> <P> Why do poison toads attend a frog orgy? Are you aware there is irrefutable  evidence of intelligent life on Mars? And if the moon takes a month to revolve  around Earth, why is it seen over Detroit every night?  </P> <P> Those strange questions -- and a bizarre variety of theories -- were contained  in several dozen letters received by the nation's science writers and entered  in a contest called "Ideas Galileo Never Thought Of."  </P> <P> The Northern California Science Writers Assn. sponsored the contest during the  recent annual meeting of the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science in  San Francisco.  </P> <P> Science writer James Cornell, publications manager at the Harvard-Smithsonian  Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., swept first, second and third  places with letters that landed on his desk.  </P> <P> The winning entry came from a Cambridge woman befuddled by news of mass mating  rituals among frogs in Malaysia.  </P> <P> "What I have been wondering is whether all those different kinds of frogs  managed to find their own kind of frog to mate with, what with the crowds and  confusion and all; or whether they got all mixed up, which would mean that by  now we are faced with the specter of ever new varieties of weirdo frogs," she  wrote.  </P> <P> "Also, what were the poisonous toads doing there? They're not frogs, after all,  and why should they even bother showing up at a frog orgy, just because they  happen to be amphibious and hop? Please have your frogologist respond as soon  as possible because I'm starting to get really hung up on these issues."  </P> <P> Detroit Free Press science writer Nancy Ross-Flanigan got an ungrammatical  letter from a man who didn't know the Earth rotates as the moon orbits it.  </P> <P> "The moon is supposed to travel around the Earth in a month time. Then what is  this moon that revolve around the city of Detroit every day to every other day?  And what is it doing?" he asked.  </P> <P> In another letter to Cornell, a Cincinnati man asserted that his 12-year study  of Mars photographs "resulted in irrefutable evidence of a civilized society of  intelligent beings on the Red Planet."  </P> <P> Cornell said the writers of such letters "are harmless. They just have a skewed  view of what the world is. I wouldn't want anyone to make fun of them. . . .  They are simply attempting to establish their own version of scientific  reality."  </P> <P> But, he added, "I must admit some of them do break me up."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small Bang Theory  </P> <P> Charlie Petit, a San Francisco Chronicle science writer and president of the  National Assn. of Science Writers, got a letter from a man who theorized that  continents formed and life on Earth started when a moon named "Yasoon" hit the  planet.  </P> <P> Such correspondents mean to be serious, and although their ideas "may be silly  and funny, I would never regard the people who think of them as ridiculous,"  Petit said. "I tip my hat to them for daring to say things that elicit giggles.  I would not want to be a member of a society where nobody came up with crazy  ideas."  </P> <P> Some offer more than ideas.  </P> <P> "I am willing to . . . have one of my hands amputated and scientifically  demonstrate how Regenerative Medicine Works. As a result, a new hand will grow  back," said a Brazilian man's letter to a scientist at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> The researcher forwarded the letter to free-lancer Lynne Timpani Friedmann,  then a university spokeswoman, with a note saying, "Please add this to the  wacko file."  </P> <P> The contest's second-place letter, written by a Texas man, began: "Dear Sir: It  is generally believed by scientists that the Earth is a giant magnet, but this  is not quite true. . . . The Earth is, in reality, a GIANT photoelectric cell."  </P> <P> In third place, from South Carolina, was this complete letter: "Dear  Presidents, Directors and Other Communications Coordinators, Global abstinence  from March 15 through April 15, combined with curative measures, as needed, can  virtually eradicate gonorrhea, and much more. How many months have 11 days?"  </P> <P> Among other contest entries:  </P> <P> * A letter to Petit, outlining a new theory on "The Nature and Treatment of  Stupidity -- Diagnosis and Prognosis." It began: "Human beings (deceitful,  neurotic, talking predators) are uniquely stupid organisms because they are  talking organisms."  </P> <P> * A Connecticut man's letter to Scientific American magazine contending that  the universe didn't start with the "big bang" but with a "big knock."  </P> <P> * San Diego Tribune science writer Ann Gibbons got a letter from a man who  claimed he could eliminate local wildfires, floods, sewage problems and traffic  jams at no cost to the taxpayers. "Before heading this letter to the nearest  trash can, please read carefully all of it," he wrote.  </P> <P> * A Miami Beach man's letter to Cornell claiming credit for being the genius  who "suggested that spare tires be narrow so they would occupy less trunk  space," "suggested that all cloth used for clothing be preshrunk," "suggested a  method for curing mental disease with electronics," and "presented some  evidence that black holes do not exist."  </P> <P> * One man's letter detailing a "formula for the nature and natural order of the  universe." His simple theory: "What must be, must be, and what cannot be,  cannot be. Such is Mother Nature's way of informing mankind of right and  wrong."  </P></p>

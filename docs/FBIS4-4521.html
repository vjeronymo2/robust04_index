			<p>BFN     [Text] Toyama, April 4 KYODO -- Hisashi Owada, the Japanese  ambassador to the United Nations, stressed Monday [4 April] that  China's role is essential in bringing the North Korean nuclear  problem to a peaceful resolution. In a speech to an  international forum, Owada said the major powers must have  cooperative ties to maintain international order in the  post-Cold War era.    A good example, he said, is the cooperation of China in the  standoff over North Korea's refusal to allow full international  inspections of its nuclear facilities.    Commenting on Japan's bid to become a permanent member of  the  U.N. Security Council, Owada said the focus should be on how  Japan can aid the United Nations in maintaining global order  rather than on simply winning permanent membership of the  Council as a symbol of its powerful status.</p>

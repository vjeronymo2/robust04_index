			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Dutch dredger in share placement Boskalis Westminster, the Dutch dredging group, placed around 18 per cent of its outstanding share capital with Dutch and international institutional investors yesterday, in a transaction worth nearly Fl 190m (Dollars 109m). Boskalis Trust, a company trust which owns about half of the group's shares, sold slightly more than 4.56m shares to ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, which sold them on to investors at Fl 40.80 each. The shares carry full rights to the 1994 dividend. The company, which describes itself as the world's largest dredger, said the sale was designed to widen ownership of the shares. The sale also brings to an end the workforce's indirect stake in the company's share capital, Boskalis said. Trading in Boskalis shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange was suspended briefly before the transaction was announced. When trading resumed, the shares fell to close at Fl 41.20 compared with a pre-suspension price of Fl 41.90, but this remained well above the private placement price.</p>

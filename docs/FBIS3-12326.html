			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Feb (MENA)--The Arab League Council has  condemned the ugly Israeli crime against unarmed Palestinian  worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron on the occupied West  Bank in which scores of people were martyred and hundreds of  others were wounded and has called it a terrorist action that  expresses organized state terrorism.    In its emergency meeting this evening at the Arab League  headquarters, the council held the Israeli occupation  authorities responsible for this crime and those committed by  the Israeli settlers. The council called on the Israeli  authorities to disarm the Israeli settlers.    The Arab League Council decided to reaffirm its Resolution  5269, adopted in its extraordinary session on 11 and 12 January  1993, calling on the United Nations to find a suitable mechanism  to implement the provisions of the fourth Geneva Convention by  detailing a UN force to provide protection for the Arab citizens  in the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories.    The council called on the cosponsors of the Madrid  Conference-- the United States and Russia--in view of their  special responsibility for ensuring the success of the peace  process to undertake a principal role in providing the necessary  protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied  territories.    The council also called on the UN Security Council to send a  UN committee to investigate this serious incident and adopt the  necessary measures to enable the committee to carry out its  mission.    The council also called on the Security Council,  particularly  the cosponsors of the Madrid Conference, to immediately  implement the council resolutions regarding Israeli settlements  in the occupied Arab territories as illegal and an obstacle to  comprehensive and just peace, particularly Resolution 465 of  1980, which called for the dismantling of the existing  settlements and suspending any plans for the establishment of  new settlements in the occupied territories, including Jerusalem.    The Arab League Council decided to consider 15 Ramadan of  every year a day to commemorate the martyrs of the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre to remind the international community of the  inhuman Israeli actions.    The council called on the Arab states to provide all forms  of  aid and support to the families of the Palestinian victims and  martyrs.    The council decided to ask the Arab League secretary general  to continue his contacts with all the international bodies to  ensure the implementation of this decision and urge them to  adopt whatever is needed to protect the Palestinian people in  the occupied territories.    The Arab League Council called on the cosponsors of the  peace  conference to work seriously to achieve peace by enabling the  Palestinian people to secure their legitimate rights, including  their right to self-determination, and establish their  independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.</p>

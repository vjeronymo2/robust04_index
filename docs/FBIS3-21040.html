			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Richard Sietmann under the rubric "Industry. </F> Technologies of the 21st Century": "Photonics: Future of  Broadband Technology. Light for Communication. Communication  Networks Becoming the `Optical Ether' With Circuits for Lasers";  first paragraph is an introduction]    [Text] Berlin, 14 Jan 94 (VDI-N)--Microelectronics in  optical-fiber transmitting and receiving peripherals still  decide the transmission capacity of optical systems. However, in  the future photonics--optoelectronic signal processing--will  decide the traffic capacity of broadband networks.    Less than 0.005 percent of the more than 50 Tbps (equal to  50,000 Gbps) estimated transmission capacity ("bandwidth") of a  single optical fiber is being used today. And even if one takes  into account the fact that the required cascading of  intermediate repeaters reduces this bandwidth to perhaps 5 Tbps,  a nearly inexhaustible potential remains. This is reassuring to  communications engineers, because it is becoming more and more  obvious that retreading is in store for the largest and most  complex machines--worldwide telecommunications systems.    If multimedia terminals capable of video teleconferencing  come of PCs, "it is unlikely that such machines will make do  with 64 kbps," for instance, says John Buckley of British  Telecom Laboratories (BTL) in referring to the foreseeable  bottlenecks in the narrowband ISDN. And, in addition, the  transmission capacity requirements will shoot up with mobile  communications, if because of a shortage of terrestrial  frequencies the base stations of the cells have to be connected  via optical fiber dedicated-circuit networks. Specialists like  Buckley estimate that within two decades with an average user  bandwidth of 100 Mbps the traffic in national networks will  increase to a total of 150 Tbps. It must be at around 75 Gbps  today in Germany.    So, the trend toward bit transfer rates rising into the  multigigabit range will continue undiminished: 2.5 Gbps systems  are already the state of the art, and 10 Gbps systems are about  to be introduced. The electronic components for 40-Gbps links  are already being developed in the laboratory. And with plans  for bit transfer rates of 100 Gbps, engineers and scientists are  already looking beyond even these targets, which should be  attained in approximately four to five years.    Photonics is still confined to optical-fiber external  wiring.  Optical signal representation is employed only in point-to-point  connections, with a transmitting laser at the input and a  receiving diode at the output of the optical-fiber link.  Microelectronics predominate in terminals and network nodes: The  gating and switching as well as the subsequent processing of  digital signals take place electronically.    No one doubts that fast electronic circuits based on gallium  arsenide semiconductors, as those being developed by Siemens,  Alcatel SEL and the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid-State  Physics (IAF) in Freiburg, for example, can cope with bit  transfer rates of 40 Gbps and more. However, as matters stand,  the potential bottlenecks are becoming fewer in communication  systems, "but are to be found in network nodes," Sonny Johanson  of Swedish Ellemtel reckons. "It is important to avoid eyes of  the needle that substantially restrict use of the network."    The drawbacks of electronic switching stages at switching  centers are obvious with ever increasing data rates. "Signals  are processed bit by bit in such switches, so that power  consumption could prove to be problematic," says communications  engineer Hans Melchior of ETH [Swiss Technical College] in  Zurich, cautioning against a strategy of "more of the same." And  if electronic circuits can no longer keep pace because of the  high data rates, "the switching medium at switching centers will  inevitably have to be optical," Buckley of BTL believes. This  means that photonic components will have to take over both  space-division, time-division, and frequency-division multiplex  functions in communication systems (see below).  <H5>  Photonics </H5>   By means of photonics, in the future signals are no longer  to  be subject to any kind of conversion from an optical to  electronic representation on the way from the transmitter to the  destination station. This means that photonic components will  have to take over both space-division, time-division, and  frequency-division multiplex functions in communication systems:    Space division multiplex stages are switching  arrangements that direct the signal from an input optical fiber  to the desired output optical fiber.    In time division multiplex stages the timing  sequence (timing relationship) of packets interleaved with one  another is changed from various terminals according to the  destination. They require ultrafast optical switching devices  and optical buffers.    In frequency division multiplex stages the  switching process consists in converting the desired signal from  one light carrier at frequency f[.sup]1[/] to another at  frequency f[.sup]2[/] .    Several of these functions have already been implemented in  the laboratory by means of photonic switching devices. For  instance, engineers at Alcatel SEL AG in Stuttgart have  developed a "Y-laser" whose Y-type optical waveguide with one  input and two outputs makes it possible to use it as a signal  splitter or optical filter. As the basic module of a  space-division multiplex stage the just 1.5 x 1 mm[.sup]2[/]  device can guide optical signals transparently to one optical  fiber output or another, and as the fast switch of a time  division multiplex stage it can also extract individual  packets--ATM cells, for example--from the optical bit stream.  Scientists at the Heinrich Hertz Institute in Berlin  demonstrated in the past year by means of a nonlinear  semiconductor laser the same function in connection with  synchronous frequency conversion.    Into which network level these functions will be placed is  thus far still an open question. For, with the almost unlimited  transmission capacity of optical fibers, the network topology  can in principle be simplified to a great extent: If the entire  bandwidth is available at the subscriber station, no central  office is needed any longer, and the terminals themselves can  select the channel on which to communicate.    "The core network is both simple and passive, then," says  John Buckley of BTL, "but this simplicity is paid for by the  availability of the full bandwidth at the terminals." Such a  futuristic network is making the rounds among specialists as the  "optical ether," because it bears a resemblance to terrestrial  radio traffic through the "ether." According to this plan the  optical fiber network would have a function similar to that of  the data bus in the backplane of a computer. For instance, just  as one inserts special cards into slots in a computer, new  services would be offered then through the functionality of the  terminals.    As simple as this idea seems to be, the way to implement it  is just as unclear. Rather, photonics is like a lottery for the  semiconductor industry: One cannot predict today which ticket  will win and which components will later on lead to value added.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wa'il al-Abrash, Karim Subhi, and 'Isam 'Abd-al- </F> Jawad: "Extremists Rule Prison Administration"]    [Text] Intervention is immediately required by the minister  of interior, Major General Hasan al-Alfi! Decisive, rapid,  immediate, and radical intervention! Extremists' jails have  become totally chaotic and an absolute farce. The silence about  them is a crime, and to remain silent is a tragedy. This is what  is going on in your ministry's jails, Mr. Minister!     -  Legal opinions to shed blood and assault criminal  prisoners:    -  Abducting officers and guards in prison cells and releasing  them only after negotiations with the prison administration;    -  A declaration made inside prison: We will kill Christian  prisoners;    -  Extremists deciding to abolish radios, impose censorship on  newspapers and magazines, and ban children's pictures.       After the uproar accompanying the announcement of mediation  between security forces and the extremists, "decrees" were  hastily issued by the extremists' leaders in Tarah Penitentiary,  changing the amirs of certain groups in various Egyptian  prisons, who had classified themselves as moderate doves, and  replacing them with hard-line hawks.    This affair, therefore, resembled the hasty ministerial  change. Furthermore, an amir of extremists in prison is only  appointed by decree from his leaders in Tarah. Not only that,  but strict instructions were issued in other decrees from Tarah  to the new amirs to intensify the rules and penalties against  criminal prisoners, who refuse to join up today, and against  prisoners affiliated with other movements. These rules are also  to be enforced against prison guards, including guards and  officers to be tried in special courts inside prison cells, even  if it reaches the point of shedding blood by special legal  opinions.    This is nothing new. The extremists are running the prisons.    However, what is new is that they have decided to govern  them  in a more dictatorial fashion, and their bloody mentality is for  the purpose of compensating them for their failure to apply  their ideas in society.    In this context, the massacre in Abu Za'bal Penitentiary, in  which three were killed and 87 criminal prisoners wounded,  occurred after a trial--conducted by the extremists' amir in his  prison cell--of five criminals, in which legal opinions to shed  blood were issued. Used in the massacre were sharp instruments,  pocket knives, wooden clubs, and faucets and water hoses after  they were uprooted to be used as weapons. The massacre continued  for five straight hours. Prison guards were unable to do  anything except watch. The oddity is that the same prison  experienced another, no less serious, incident two months ago,  where some extremists were able to abduct an officer and a guard  from the guard force. They stripped them of their weapons and  held them inside a cell, threatening to kill them unless the  prison administration complied with their demands, or if anyone  tried to approach them. It took several hours before the two  were released, after difficult negotiations, during which the  prison administration promised not to harm the extremists.    Before that, one of the extremist prisoners had gouged out  an  eye of one of the officers in the prison courtyard because the  officer had dared to ask him not to make disturbing noises. At  one time, the most prisoners could do to express complaints and  issue protests was to bang on the iron doors with aluminum  dishes and utensils and shout hostile threats, abuse, and  insults. Today, the extremists protest inside prisons by gouging  out the eyes of officers and guards, or detaining or killing  them. Egyptian prisons have had armed clashes between extremists  and prison administration at one time or another. Mostly, the  guard force of officers and men are unable to end the  extremists' rebellion and cannot even enter the cells. If one of  them dared to enter any cell, he would be trampled by the  extremist prisoners. Ultimately, this situation requires  summoning black-uniformed special forces, who use tear gas  thrown into the cells, and then storm the barracks. The  extremists' tricks are unable to stop the tear gas.    An infamous clash occurred several years ago in al-Qanatir  Prison, which was like a war between special security forces and  extremists. The extremists resorted to a clever trick--one that  only combatants would know--to thwart the effectiveness of the  tear gas. They placed buckets inside the cells, filled with  water. As soon as the canisters landed in the cell, they threw  them into the buckets to try to extinguish them. But, in the  end, they surrendered because they were unable to continue  resisting.    However, they succeeded in capturing the commander of the  guard and detained him in one of the cells. They stabbed another  officer with a sharp instrument and tipped the scales to their  advantage again. The clash continued until night time. The  prison commander, Colonel Muhammad Marsa, suffered a stab wound  in the stomach, and about 100 officers, guards, and extremists  were wounded before security forces were able to gain control of  the situation. The rebellious extremists were transferred to the  Appeals Prison in central Cairo. The oddity is that the clash  occurred after the extremists announced that they were an  independent state inside the prison, which would not carry out  anyone's orders. They declared their insurrection and stated  they were not obliged to carry out the instructions of the  prison administration.    Their efforts for power do not stop even after their  arrests.  They are working to build their hypothetical state behind iron  bars. They will not accept less than everyone's submission to  them.    The extremists call these clashes, "intifadah." They  remember  them as if they were history. They say: "The intifadah of  al-Qanatir Prison," the Abu Za'bal Revolution, and the battle of  Tarah."    Even inside the prisons, the extremists stir up sectarian  strife and do not hesitate to kindle it.    In al-Qanatir Prison, one extremists clashed and fought with  a Christian prisoner. A rumor circulated in prison that the  extremists would kill all Christian prisoners. The Christians  gathered together inside the prison in a state of alarm and  despair. When an officer intervened to break up the fight, the  extremists hit him. The beaten officer went to the area  director, Brigadier General Muhammad al-Wakil, took off his  uniform, threw it on the floor, and asked him to restore the  honor of the police and discipline the prisoners. Brig. Gen.  al-Wakil asked the group's amir to turn over the prisoner who  had attacked the officer, so that he could be punished. The amir  refused, and al- Wakil gave them a 1600 deadline. When the  deadline expired, he summoned the black-uniformed special  security forces. They stormed the cellblock and arrested the  wanted prisoner.    The extremists' influence transcends the prison to the  prisoners' dock in the courtroom.    Aside from acrobatics, abuse, and insults that are uttered  inside the wire cage during the trial, after the session has  begun the extremists mostly resort to sit-ins inside the cages,  refusing to return to prison. The security forces encircle the  cages and point gas canisters at the prisoners, forcing them to  go to the transport vehicles, but only after long hours of  negotiations.    The extremists' control over Egyptian jails is demonstrated  by the fact of families inside the prisons. There was the  Islambuli family and the al-Ramaz family, but the most famous  was the al-Dumayri family, which totalled eight persons under  detention. They were called the Al al-Dumayri.    Extremists look at criminal prisoners--perpetrators of  crimes  of murder, robbery, etc.--with an air of superiority, because  they consider them corrupt elements. They try to proselytize and  recruit them to get them to submit to the extremists'  leadership. Those who refuse to yield are subjected to a special  trial in one of the cells. They issue decrees and legal opinions  against them, which could lead to bloodshed, as happened in the  Abu Za'bal incident. The extremists forbid the criminals to  listen to the radio, play backgammon or cards, appear in  Ministry of Interior uniforms, or dress in shorts, as per  promotion of virtue and suppression of vice. Much of the  friction and clashes between the extremist and criminal  prisoners is due to these prohibitions. This is especially true  when applied to playing backgammon, which the extremists make  from cardboard, while the dice are cut from the center of a  bread loaf and distributed among the criminals for  entertainment. The extremists are not prepared to offer any  concessions to the criminals regarding these prohibitions.    On the contrary, sometime ago through comprehensive strikes,  they forced the prison administration to gather up all radio  sets in the possession of criminal prisoners, on grounds that  the songs coming out of the radios could be heard in the  extremists' cells. In fact, an officer went to the cells,  accompanied by a guard carrying a large carton, in which the  radios were placed. This is a well-known fact that reveals the  extent of the prison administration's weakness and the  criminals' passivity vis-a-vis the extremists.    However, most of the clashes between extremists and  criminals  in Egyptian prisons occur because of the practice of wearing  Ministry of Interior uniforms, or shorts, by some of the  criminal prisoners.    Moreover, those who write articles and stories inside prison  are considered by the extremists to be in violation of Islam.    In all these cases, they conduct special trials inside  cells.  The group's amir issues verdicts to flog the violators. In the  face of that, a large number of criminal prisoners are forced to  let their beards grow and to demonstrate loyalty to the  extremists and their amir, out of fear of their ruthless action.  The extremists have formed an internal system to censor  newspapers and magazines that entered prisons. They cut out all  pictures, even pictures of children, using batteries to do that.    Commercial activities, carried on by extremists, have spread  inside prison. They deal in food, beverages, and tea. In this  regard, they also have succeeded in making certain special games  for children, which they then sell during visits.    In prison, extremists do not belong to just one movement.  There is Jihad, the Islamic Group [al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah], the  Repudiation Movement, the Qutbiyun, and others. Clashes between  these movements are increasing and, in many cases, turn into  fistfights and battles with sharp instruments.    Putting believers in different movements in the same cell is  a smart ploy that the security forces use to take advantage of  the arguments between them. In this way, they can learn new  information and secrets that might be revealed during their  debates.    Prisons have been the scene of bloody battles among the  various Islamic movements. For example, when the Salafiyahs in  al-Istiqbal Prison stated the legal opinion that those who  murdered the Central Security personnel in Asyut must repent and  atone for the crime that they had committed, the Islamic Jama'ah  adherents were furious. They assembled inside the prison and  gave speeches, analyzing the terrorist deed that they had  carried out. The scene quickly changed into fist and knife  fights. Within prison, the extremists do not trust the Muslim  Brotherhood. They accuse the Brotherhood of being in alliance  with the administrations of the detention camps, which always  allows activities in the prisoners' barracks to be led by young  men belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood also  plays a major role in negotiations between extremists and the  camp administration. They are the communications link between  the administration and extremist groups that refuse to reach an  understanding with security forces. They insist on chaos,  strikes, and sit-in strikes in the prison and will not obey  orders and instructions from authorities.    When disputes among the various movements, to which the  prisoners belong, end up in serious fights and clashes, many of  these clashes are peculiar and strange. One reason for this is  that the al-'Azmawiyah Group forbid the killing of insects  because they are life created by God. They do not permit killing  them under any circumstances. They reject and condemn this out  of consideration that they are God's property. It is  foreordained for man, just as death is total, i.e., by fate and  divine decree.    Battles between the extremists and the al-'Azmawiyah have  not  stopped for a single day, but perhaps the most famous and  strangest was what happened at Abu-Za'bal Prison, when  fistfights and knife battles broke out between some extremists  who belonged to Jihad and prisoners from the al-'Azmawiyah  Group. The clash was caused by mosquitos.    The extremists have various movements. Each has its special  laws, which it tries to apply on the streets, in the homes, and  even in prisons. Perhaps there, behind bars, was where their  dreams for power were established.    Many of the terrorists' plans are devised, hatched, and  issued by their leaders from inside jails, which have been  turned into operations rooms for the extremists.    In the case of the assassination of Dr. Faraj Fawdah, one of  the accused confessed that he had received details of the plan  from the leader of the military wing, Safwat 'Abd-al-Ghani,  imprisoned in Tarah Prison and charged in the case of the  assassination of Dr. Raf'at al-Mahjub.    When the prison agency was alerted to the assassination  plans, bombings, and terrorism that spread on Egyptian streets,  some of which were coming out of the prisons, it intensified  measures of custody and sentencing, in order to suppress the  terrorists. But the extremists threatened the prison commander  and, in fact, carried out their threats and tried to assassinate  the commander of Tarah Prison.    However, the real joke, revealed through the deficiency of  the Egyptian prison system, was the number of cases of extremist  escapes. At the beginning of the year, the amir of the Islamic  Jama'ah in Bani Suwayf, Ibrahim Muhammad Sayyid Ahmad, was able  to escape from jail. He dressed in the clothes of a veiled  woman, brought to him by one of his relatives during a visit. He  was able, in fact, to leave with the visitors, but the prison  administration discovered the operation. The police forces  quickly pursued the amir who was killed by gunfire from the  prison guards. However, he had in fact gotten outside the prison  gates.    Prior to this, a well-known major escape incident occurred,  in which extremists 'Isam al-Qamri, Khamis Muslim, and Muhammad  al-Aswani managed to escape from jail. This incident revealed a  major defect in Egyptian prisons, led to the resignation of the  prison agency's director, and changed the guard force and  administration in Tarah Penitentiary, who were investigated.    Despite the fact that the escape plan was simple, its  organizational level poor, and the resources used by the  escapees meager, the plan basically relied on the chaos of  Egyptian prisons.    The amazing thing is that there are four authorities that  supervise, organize, and operate Egyptian prisons. This confirms  that the regulations are strong and that the creation of a new  supervisory agency is not required.     -  The prison administration, responsible for administering  the prison's affairs in all its management, financial, culinary,  health, social, and punitive aspects. It manages the affairs of  prisoners and the guard force. The prison has a doctor to  supervise the prisoners' general health. There is a social  supervisor to solve their problems, a culinary supervisor to  ensure the safety and suitability of their food. There is  security supervision represented at the top of the prison  pyramid by the commander, his deputy, officials, officers,  noncommissioned officers [NCO], and troops.    -  Prison secret police. This is a bureau subordinate to the  agency, out of consideration that the prison is an independent  community in itself, where crimes peculiar to it occur and of  which the prisoner himself is the source. Crimes are committed  through the visitors who bring in prohibited items to help  spread corruption inside the jail. Moreover, the crime may be in  collusion with an NCO or a guard and the prisoner. Therefore,  prison secret police officers use informers among the prisoners  to supply them with information.    -  State security secret police. They concentrate on political  prisoners and everything concerning them, either inside the  prison, during visits, or when being transported.    -  Finally, there is the role of the prison guard force which,  if  necessary, rely on special support forces to operate with them  to put down cases of rebellion and riot. These guard forces are  also supported by forces from Public Security and Central  Security, if necessary. As for outside prison guard forces, they  are supported by rapid fire automatic weapons.       In the past, the guard forces depended on volunteers in the  police, but today they rely on troops of the third  screening--army rejects. The majority of them are illiterate. In  Egyptian prisons, there are no modern monitoring or control  systems. Despite the fact that some of these systems were  installed in Tarah Prison during Sadat's regime, the contracting  company has not as yet operated them. Officials of the prison  agency concede the existence of two gaps that contribute to the  anarchy in Egyptian prisons and aid in allowing knives to get to  the prisoners. They are:     -  Collusion by NCO's and troops because of economic, social,  and cultural factors. In addition, and more serious than that,  is the fact that many of these guards are from Upper Egypt and  rural areas. Clan and family allegiance play a role in the  occurrence of collusion. In addition, the conscripted guards'  commitment is temporary and conditional to a definite degree.  Their illiteracy contributes to inferiority and negligence.    -  The second gap is the family visits that are always  accompanied  by a desire to bring prohibited items to the prisoner, by using  all kinds of tricks.       In addition, there is a "housing crisis" in Egyptian  prisons.  The prison agency is forced to house the political prisoners  with the criminal prisoners, and clashes occur.    According to the latest reports, the present number of  political prisoners in Egypt, in custody and sentenced, totals  3,000. We asked an official in the prison agency: How do you  deal with incidents of disorder and anarchy in Egyptian prisons,  carried out by extremists who, in fact, control these prisons?  He replied: "When disorder occurs, such as sit-in strikes,  strikes, and protests, the prison commander or his deputy must  intervene, along with his officers, to conduct a dialogue with  the prisoners and learn the causes of the disorder. In cases  like these, the degree of maximum readiness, either in the  prison administration, or the guards, or the secret police,  rises in accordance with the circumstances. Visits are  forbidden, additional forces are called in, and a cordon of  prison guards is placed around the disorderly group."    If the disorder is accompanied by acts of violence,  intervention is done with tear gas or smoke bombs, in order to  gain control of the situation. The prison agency conducts  investigations into the incident, and the disorderly are  punished by isolation, loss of visitor privileges, and are given  additional work.    The prison agency does all this to keep the prisoners from  gaining control over the jails. Shortly after the recent Abu  Za'bal massacre, we made a quick visit to the prison. Some 500  meters from the main gate, there is a black gate on which is  written "Industrial Security Prison." Close to that was a huge  sign: "Prison is Discipline, Correction, and Reform." Visiting  was permitted from 0900 to 1500, and no one needs a permit. Only  personal identification has to be shown at the gate. Therefore,  it is extremely easy.    Attached to the prison is a long hall to receive visitors.  This hall measures more than 20 meters long and 10 meters wide.  The extremists decided to paint it white, which is their  favorite color. The hall contains a large number of cement  benches and floor coverings. The daily number of visitors ranges  from 200 to 300.    Only one day before the Abu Za'bal massacre, a prisoner  named  'Abd-al-Sattar Rashwan--who was one of the extremists--died  after an electrical shock while warming food on an electrical  hot plate in his cell, despite the prohibition against  electrical hot plates and appliances.    We met with a prisoner named 'Ali, a student in Asyut  University. He told us: "Bringing prohibited items into jail is  easy and allowed, despite an informer who searches the men and a  woman who searches ladies. Everything is available in jail,  especially prohibited electrical appliances. The Islamic Jama'ah  controls Abu Za'bal Prison. When they meet a political prisoner  who belongs to another movement, they try to gain control of his  mind, by entering into dialogues with him over the course of  weeks. Most of the time the matter ends with his embracing their  ideas and joining them, willingly or not."    The prisoner related a strange story: "One day, I was in  cell  26, and I heard voices rejoicing and saying `God is great.'  Then, one of the extremists called to all prisoners, demanding  that they say the prayer of thanksgiving, because a prisoner who  belonged to the Muslim Brotherhood had renounced the  Brotherhood's ideas and had joined the Islamic Jama'ah, thanks  to the efforts of Shaykh 'Abdallah."     -  Who is Shaykh 'Abdallah?    -  "A prominent leader inside prison. His real name is  different,  but he likes this alias. He is 45 and leads a group of  extremists who collect money by force from visitors. Each  visitor pays 2 Egyptian pounds. This is a tax extorted with the  knowledge of the prison administration. Mostly the visitors pay  a larger amount, after being persuaded that this money is being  collected to buy food and cleaning materials for the prisoners."    -  But, how do you buy the food and cook it?    -  It is very easy. I have seen Shaykh 'Abdallah reach an  agreement with a prison guard to buy food on the outside, in  exchange for a commission on each order. He buys macaroni and  rice from a street vendor and cans of sauce, which are stored in  an empty cell that has been vacated because of its  unsuitability. Prisoners from the Islamic Jama'ah use it like a  restaurant, cooking the food and distributing it to the group's  supporters."    -  How do you spend your day in jail?    -  "I wake up early, because the dawn prayer is compulsory.  Then,  one of the brothers helps us memorize the Koran, before we go  out for free time in the prison courtyard at 0800. After that,  we assemble in groups and train in karate and Kung Fu, which  members of the Islamic Group [prefer]. We have breakfast, and  then the period of religious lectures begins, which continues  until 1700. During this period, which lasts for nine continuous  hours, group leaders have an opportunity to gain new recruits  from among criminal prisoners, trained to deal with the police.  We are separated from them by barbed wire, but the extremists  quickly eliminated that as a factor. They go back and forth, in  order to recruit criminal prisoners, especially those who are  close to getting out and can be made use of."       Therefore, the extremists control Egyptian prisons. Instead  of their power weakening after they go to jail, the opposite  happens. Their members increase, because they are successful in  recruiting criminal prisoners and converting them to terrorists,  at their own volition or despite themselves.    This matter, therefore, requires special consideration after  the Abu Za'bal massacre. The prisoner in Abu Za'bal revealed a  surprise when he said: "Extremists refuse to sign their release  papers; they want to remain in jail for a longer time!"</p>

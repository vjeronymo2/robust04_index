The representatives of the Chinese and British Governments  held 17 rounds of the talks on the election arrangements between  April and November last year.    Prior to the talks, the spokesman said, the two sides  reached  an understanding that the content of the talks would not be  revealed. But the British side has unilaterally made public the  content of the talks, distorting and attacking the position of  the Chinese side in an attempt to shirk the responsibility of  sabotaging the talks.    The Chinese side was thus compelled to make public the  facts,  the spokesman said.    The long statement of the spokesman consists of seven parts:    -- The British side stubbornly stuck to its political reform  bill that violates the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the  principle of convergence with the Basic Law of the Special  Administrative Region of Hong Kong and the relevant  understanding and agreements reached between the two countries;    -- The British side attempts to interfere in China's  sovereign affairs;    -- Agreements and understanding reached between the two  sides  on the issue of electorial committee must be abided by;    -- The original meaning of the elections for the functional  organizations must be persisted in;    -- The issue of "through train" can only be solved in the  frame of the decision of the Chinese National People's Congress  and relevant stipulations of the basic law;    -- The Chinese side has made tremendous efforts for reaching  an agreement on the elections for municipal council and district  boards; and    -- The British side deliberately sabotaged the talks.    The statement also includes a conclusion part.    The essence of the Sino-British dispute over the political  system in Hong Kong is not a question of whether to develop  democracy in Hong Kong. Instead, it is one of whether to act in  good faith in relations between nations and whether to converge  with the Basic Law so as to realize a smooth transition in Hong  Kong, he said.    The dispute arose from Britain's change of policy on the  Hong  Kong issue. Facts will show that such a change runs counter to  Britain's own interests and will bring about damage to Hong  Kong, he said.    The Sino-British talks have broken up because of the  sabotage  of the British side. The Chinese side deems it necessary to  solemnly reaffirm that in accordance with the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, Britain's administration of Hong Kong will come to  an end by June 30, 1997, and the Chinese Government will resume  the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997,  he said.    With the expiry of Britain's administration of Hong Kong,  its  last district boards, the municipal council and the Legislative  Council, as part of the framework of the political system  thereby Britain administers Hong Kong, will definitely come to  an end, he added.    Beginning on July 1, 1997, the political framework of the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be formed according  to the decision of China's National People's Congress and  relevant stipulations of the Basic Law, he said.    In conclusion, the spokesman stressed that Hong Kong will  return to the motherland's embrace in due time, and no one can  stop this process. The Chinese Government and people have full  confidence and ability to resume the exercise of China's  sovereignty over Hong Kong on time, implement the principle of  "one country, two systems", carry out the Basic Law and maintain  long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong, he said.</p>

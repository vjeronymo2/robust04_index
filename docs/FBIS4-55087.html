			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amir Hodzic from Vienna] </F>   [Text] The talks between the delegations of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia are continuing in Vienna today on  the implementation of the Constitution of the Federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Details concerning the borders of the  Herzegovina cantons are to be worked out today. Last night our  delegation put forward several proposals as to possible  solutions, after which the Croatian delegation asked for a break  in order to conduct additional consultations. Even though these  are delicate matters, the delegations are expected to complete  this part of the job today, and then approach the agreement  concerning the package, which includes the number and borders of  the cantons, and the distribution of the ministerial positions  in the government and the functions in the federation.</p>

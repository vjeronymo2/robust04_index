			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Jerusalem deaths mar peace visit: Hamas killers strike in city centre Peacemaking efforts in Israel by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, were overshadowed yesterday by a wave of outrage over the killings of two Jerusalemites in a late Sunday night shooting spree by Palestinian gunmen. Mr Christopher, who held talks with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and flies to Damascus today to meet Syria's President Hafez al-Assad in his attempt to broker a breakthrough in Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations, joined Mr Rabin in condemning the shooting as a crude effort by extremists to derail the peace process. While many Palestinian leaders have condemned the incident, Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, had refrained from issuing any statement as of yesterday evening, and Mr Christopher urged him to add his voice to the chorus of condemnation. Spokesmen for the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist movement in Gaza claimed responsibility for the attack in which a 19-year-old Israeli woman soldier and an Arab from a village on the outskirts of East Jerusalem were killed. They said the action had been timed to coincide with the anniversary of the October 8, 1990 killings of 18 Palestinians by Israeli security forces on the Temple Mount. The two gunmen, both of whom came from Gaza, opened fire with semi-automatic weapons as they ran down a paved side street packed with bars and restaurants in the heart of west Jerusalem at about 11.30pm Police said the pair fired about 200 bullets, and threw two hand-grenades that failed to explode, before they were shot dead by Israeli security forces. Other opposition leaders noted bitterly that one of the gunmen, Hussein Abbas, had been released early from a jail term for Hamas membership under the provisions of the Israel-PLO autonomy deal. There were also reports last night that the other gunman, Issam Johari, was a member of the Palestinian police force that has taken over responsibility from the Israeli army for law and order in Gaza.</p>

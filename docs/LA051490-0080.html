			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> MINISTRY PROPERTY REQUEST TO BE STUDIED  </P> <P> A youth ministry group's request to operate out of a building in an industrial  zone will be the subject of a public hearing tonight.  </P> <P> Lorani Ministry, a religious youth group affiliated with Grace Korean Church of  Norwalk, wants to use property on Portal Drive to hold Bible study classes and  other activities.  </P> <P> The group has about 120 high school-aged members and several counselors.  </P> <P> Group officials said they plan to use the property only as a gathering place  and do not plan to sponsor any public events there.  </P> <P> But neighbors, including a plastic molder and a sash and door manufacturer, say  they fear that the emissions, truck traffic and noise from the area's industry  would be unsafe for the group.  </P> <P> "An industrial warehouse (with) forklifts and plastic fabrication do give off  certain emissions," said Ray Steele, owner of S.C. Services, an industrial film  distribution business that would be next door to the youth ministry group. It  would be "dangerous moving in and out of their facility while trucks are  operating."  </P> <P> The Planning Commission had approved the group's request last month, but  Councilman Anthony R. Selvaggi appealed its decision to the council. The  council meets at 7 p.m. in the Council Chambers, 3191 Katella Ave. KATHIE  BOZANICH  </P></p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Singh unveils reform package INDIA at the weekend unveiled a wide-ranging package of reforms designed to integrate the country further into the global economy, including full flotation of the rupee on foreign exchange markets. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, who announced the measures on Saturday during his annual budget speech, also signalled an end to the tough economic squeeze which he put in place in July 1991, and the start of a strong push for export-led growth. The budget was widely seen as a determined effort by the government to put the economy back at the centre of the national agenda - and push aside the inter-religious passions raised by the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque in December. Mr Singh said India could not afford to spend time 'appearing to be absorbed with obscurantist preoccupations and sectarian divides'. The budget was also portrayed as an attempt by the ruling Congress (I) to recover votes lost through the government's poor handling of the Ayodhya crisis. The right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party, whose supporters stormed the mosque, condemned it as 'as an electoral lozenge.' Mr Singh cut interest rates by 1 percentage point - from 18 per cent to 17 per cent for commercial borrowers - slashed import duties, cutting the maximum rate of duty from 110 per cent to 85 per cent, and reduced excise taxes. He announced tax breaks for investors in key sectors such as power, where India suffers chronic shortages and introduced plans for further financial reforms, including a scheme to use public funds to help state-owned banks provide for long-standing bad debts. The finance minister also greatly increased spending on education, agricultural development and infrastructure. These rises will soften the impact in rural areas of planned further cuts in fuel and fertiliser subsidies. To the surprise of many economists, Mr Singh both cut revenue sources and increased public spending without raising government borrowing. Finance ministry officials explained he could do this because the severity of previous tax increases created room for manoeuvre. The target for the fiscal deficit for the year 1993-94, starting April 1, is to be 4.5 per cent of GDP, down from just over 5 per cent this year. This is slightly above the 4 per cent target favoured by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which are monitoring India's reform programme  -but close enough to allow them to continue supporting Mr Singh and his policies. Mr Singh said his budget would promote growth and boost exports massively and denied it was inflationary. The government expects GDP growth to rise from a likely 4 per cent this year to 5-5.5 per cent. Inflation is expected to fall from 7 per cent now to 5-6 per cent. Foreign investment, of which Dollars 2.3bn has been approved since the reforms began, is expected to grow further.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Japan's motor part groups 'outperform'rival UK suppliers AN ALARMING productivity and quality gap exists between UK and Japanese automotive components suppliers, according to a pioneering study to be disclosed next week. It claims that 'world-class Japanese manufacturing plants outperform their UK equivalents by at least two to one in productivity, quality, throughput time and space utilisation'. The study, by Cardiff Business School, Cambridge University and Andersen Consulting, examines the manufacturing performance and management practices of 18 component makers, nine each in the UK and Japan. They produce brakes, exhaust systems, seats and wiring harnesses for many leading vehicle makers in Japan and Europe. A third of the companies studied showed outstanding performance in both quality and productivity. All these companies were Japanese and most were suppliers to Toyota, the leading Japanese vehicle maker. Some of the other Japanese plants lagged behind this group of 'world-class' producers and 'many still have a way to go to achieve this status', says the report. The five worst performers in the study all came from the UK, however. The study claims the UK plants had an average of 2.5 defects per 100 parts coming off the assembly line, while the best Japanese plants had only 2.5 defects per 10,000 parts. Many of the UK plants produce only half as many parts as the best Japanese suppliers but with the same number of employees. The group of 'world-class' Japanese companies holds only a seventh of the inventory held by the other plants, and the best Japanese companies turn over their stock three times more quickly than the average of the other component makers. The 'world-class' plants do not use pay based on job classifications, says the report, and their employment practices are 'noticeably more progressive than those of the non-world class plants'. The study claims to be the 'most comprehensive benchmarking study of its kind'. Honda Motor profits fall, Page 10</p>

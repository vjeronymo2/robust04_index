			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 4 KYODO -- Japan's 11 major commercial  banks hold 6.7 trillion yen more in nonperforming loans than  they have disclosed, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported Tuesday. If  the undiclosed amount is included, the combined sum of bad loans  at the banks swells to 15,969 billion yen, the mass-circulation  daily said.    Nonperforming loans are loans which have become  uncollectible  due to the bankruptcy of borrowers or upon which interest  payments have not been made for six months or longer. The 11  commercial banks had disclosed such loans worth 9,273 billion  yen as of the end of September.    Among them, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank held 747 billion yen  worth of undisclosed nonperforming loans, compared with its  disclosed sum of 440 billion yen, the daily said.    The ratio of disclosed and undisclosed bad loans to the  Sapporo-based bank's outstanding balance of lending stood at 15  percent, or three times higher than the 11 commercial banks'  average rate, it said.</p>

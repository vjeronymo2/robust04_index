			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Clinton picks old hands for foreign, defence jobs: For new secretary of state it is a 'dream come true' Resurrection of Carter foreign policy set-up denied PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton yesterday unveiled a foreign and security policy team conspicuous for its experience and mainstream moderation. As expected, the new secretary of state will be Mr Warren Christopher, 67, who was number two at the state department in the Carter administration. A former deputy attorney-general under President Johnson, he was an adviser to Mr Clinton during the campaign and is currently director of the transition operation. Mr Clinton said he had doubted he would be able to persuade Mr Christopher, a Los Angeles-based lawyer for most of the last decade, who also headed an investigation into this year's riots in that city, to enter government service again. Mr Christopher said his appointment was 'a dream come true'. Mr Christopher immediately declared foreign policy was 'a continuum', and that the new administration had every intention of pursuing existing policies such as the humanitarian intervention in Somalia and the Middle East peace process, now under strain as a result of Israel's determination to deport Palestinian activists. His deputy will be Mr Clifton Wharton, 56, son of the first black career diplomat appointed a US ambassador. He is at present head of the teachers' pension fund, the largest in the US, has run universities in New York and Michigan, and is chairman of the philanthropic Rockefeller Foundation. The national security team in the White House brings back together two men who directed policy planning in the Carter state department, with Mr Anthony Lake, 52, now a university professor, as principal adviser, and Mr Samuel Berger, 47, a Washington lawyer universally known as Sandy, as deputy. The new US ambassador to the United Nations will be Mrs Madeleine Albright, a veteran of the Carter government and now a university professor in Washington. Born in Czechoslovakia, she will enjoy Cabinet rank, a precedent established by President Eisenhower but only intermittently pursued since. On the security side, Mr Les Aspin, 54, the congressman from Wisconsin and chairman of the House armed services committee since 1985, becomes secretary of defence. He worked in the Pentagon as an adviser to Mr Robert McNamara, but later came out against the Vietnam war. Mr Aspin is an acknowledged expert on the defence budget and the adaptation of the military establishment to civilian purposes. He pledged to maintain 'the superb quality of our forces and our technological edge'. The Central Intelligence Agency will be run by Mr James Woolsey, 51, under-secretary of the Navy in the Carter administration and a member of President Reagan's delegation to the Start talks with the Soviet Union from 1983 to 1986. Like Mr Clinton and Mr Aspin, he went to Oxford University and served on the staff of the Senate armed services committee. Retired Admiral William Crowe, a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and a close adviser to Mr Clinton during the presidential campaign, will head the president's foreign intelligence advisory board in the White House. Mr Clinton vigorously denied that his foreign policy establishment was merely a resurrection of President Carter's administration. He noted that Mr Carter's had been the only Democratic government in the last 16 years, but added: 'To say that this is a team of re-treads. . . is, I think, totally unfair'. The world was 'no longer a simple place with clear choices,' he stated, a sentiment echoed by Mr Christopher. The end of the cold war, the president-elect added, required 'bold new hands and the strength and courage to advance our American values'.</p>

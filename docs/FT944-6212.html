			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Tax net falls on some securities linked to indices - Capital gains The chancellor proposed measures to ensure that 'certain securities linked to a share index are chargeable to capital gains tax'. The Inland Revenue explained that the intention was 'to end the situation whereby quoted securities whose value depends on share prices can be qualifying corporate bonds so that profits on disposal escape tax'. The change will apply to disposals on or after today. The Revenue said profits on the disposal or redemption of 'deep gain' securities were chargeable as income. 'But there is an exception from deep gains treatment for 'qualifying indexed securities.' 'These are securities subject to a number of detailed conditions but, in particular, linked to the retail prices index or a similar overseas general index of retail prices, or quoted securities whose value is linked to an index of share prices. 'Securities linked to a United Kingdom share index have been issued which can benefit from both the QCB exemption from capital gains tax and the deep gains exemption for qualifying indexed securities. The result is that profits on disposal of such securities would generally not be liable to tax. 'This could lead to significant loss of tax and to distortion in the investment market.' The chancellor's proposals will prevent this by ensuring that with effect for disposals on or after today these securities are, like the underlying shares which determine their value, within the charge to capital gains tax.</p>

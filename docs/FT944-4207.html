			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Keeping an eye on the customers Shoplifters are the chief target of closed-circuit TV cameras within stores. Yet the same security cameras can be adapted to give retailers extra information about the movements of their customers, the popularity of particular displays and the length of queues at checkouts. This extra information can be obtained by using a system called SensUS, developed by Molynx Holdings, a Welsh company. It works by capturing images from a closed-circuit camera and isolating areas of movement. It then uses neural network software, which detects patterns, to count the number of customers in each camera scene. Molynx: UK, tel 0633 821000; fax 0633 850893</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Innovative buy-back at Northern Electric Northern Electric bought back 10 per cent of its shares yesterday after announcing an innovative method of effecting the purchases which could entitle sellers to significant tax credits. Although six other regional electricity companies have bought back shares none of them are near the 10 per cent level which most set as limits when seeking shareholder approval. Several have been considering programmes of the type launched by Northern yesterday but have backed off because of uncertainty over the Inland Revenue's stance. Northern yesterday made clear that potential entitlements to tax credits under its scheme would be a matter which shareholders would have to negotiate individually with the Inland Revenue. It could not give any assurance that the tax credit would ultimately be realised. However the company would provide vouchers showing information including the associated tax credit. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Northern's broker, said last night that it had bought 12.4m shares yesterday at between 812p and 818p. Northern's shares closed at 813p yesterday, a rise of 19p. Through the Northern scheme, BZW acted as an agent to effect on-market purchases rather than a market maker. The idea is that a shareholder who sells shares to the company through an agent would be treated as receiving a 'qualifying distribution', or income similar to a dividend, for tax purposes. The amount treated as a distribution is the repurchase price of the shares less their nominal value of 50p. Analysts gave it a mixed welcome. Some praised the company and its advisers for devising a scheme that gave investors the possibility of higher rewards than they expected. Others believed the market may punish the company, by downgrading its shares, if the Inland Revenue failed to give tax credits in large quantities.</p>

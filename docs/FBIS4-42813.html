			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, Silvio Berlusconi paid a visit to the  Bambino Gesu hospital where 11 Rwandan children have been  admitted. When asked about the possible solutions to the Rwandan  tragedy, Berlusconi said:    [Begin Berlusconi recording] I believe that if we have a  true  conscience as world citizens, then I believe we must find a way  to intervene. We must find a way to intervene adequately,  quickly, in an effective way; I believe that the world, those  countries that are democratic and civilized, must find a way of  setting up an army, a permanent task force for exactly this type  of intervention. This task force could be made up perhaps of  ordinary troops or volunteers. [end recording]</p>

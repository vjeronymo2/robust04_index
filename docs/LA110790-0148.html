			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> POLICE CHIEF FINALIST FOR SCOTTSDALE SPOT  </P> <P> Police Chief John Robertson is one of five finalists for the top police spot in  Scottsdale, Ariz., city officials there said.  </P> <P> Robertson, 38, who has served on the Garden Grove force for 16 years, was among  115 people from 27 states who applied.  </P> <P> Scottsdale and Garden Grove each have about 135,000 residents, but the  similarities end there. Scottsdale is a resort community near Phoenix which  covers 200 square miles, two-thirds of which is undeveloped, said Scottsdale's  director of human services, Dan Schmidt. Garden Grove covers less than a tenth  of that area at 17.8 square miles.  </P> <P> Schmidt said a new chief would be named by the end of the month to replace the  retiring chief.  </P> <P> Robertson declined to comment.  </P></p>

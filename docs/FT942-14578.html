			<p>940420 FT  20 APR 94 / Australian miners ordered to work Over a third of the 20,000 Australian coal-miners who went on strike yesterday have been ordered back to work by the Coal Industry Tribunal. The order followed applications by the Queensland Mining Council and Powercol, a New South Wales-based producer, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Separately, Peabody Resources, which is owned by Britain's Hanson group, asked the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to allow it to pursue a damages claim against the miners' union.</p>

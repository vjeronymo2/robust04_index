			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Queens Moat wins extension Holders of Queens Moat Houses' two debentures have voted overwhelmingly to extend their waiver of the right to enforce their security, this time until the end of June. At the same time, bank lenders to the hotel group, in discussions over a Pounds 1.3bn refinancing, extended the standstill agreement until May 27. The standstill had been due to expire on Thursday night. Of the votes cast, 97.2 per cent of one group and 98.9 per cent of the other were in favour of the extension. QMH hopes to publish its results for 1993 by the end of the coming week. Once these are available it aims to finalise details of its refinancing and put these to creditors and shareholders. When proposals have been accepted the group's shares, which have now been suspended for a year, are expected to be relisted. The holders of the two debenture stocks - Pounds 200m of 10 1/4 per cent and Pounds 15m of 12 per cent first mortgage debentures - have rights over 27 hotels. These were valued at Pounds 137.5m on December 31 1992. The trust deeds for the stock say that the properties must be worth at least 150 per cent of the nominal value of the stocks, and so there was a shortfall of Pounds 178.5m using that valuation. QMH could not make up that shortfall by pledging further assets so the debenture holders were entitled to enforce the security. In November, meetings of the debenture holders agreed to waive this right until April 1 and it was this waiver that was extended at Thursday's meetings. Interest payments on the 10 1/4 per cent stock, totalling Pounds 7.7m, were paid yesterday.</p>

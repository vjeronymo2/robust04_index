			<p>BFN     [Text] According to military sources, the U.S. imperialists  on 27 May perpetrated a provocative aerial war exercise aimed at  northward invasion.    Prior to this, pursuit-assault planes, vertical take-off and  landing attack planes, and electronic jamming planes flew in  from the U.S. bases in the Pacific region to the U.S. Air Force  stationed in South Korea. The overseas-based flying corps were  mobilized in the skies above Yongwol, Yangpyong, and Umsong on  this day and were frenzied in the aerial war exercise aimed at  northward invasion in cooperation with fighter planes of the  U.S. Air Force stationed in South Korea.    In the war exercise staged amid electronic jamming under the  command of EA-6, the flying corps from overseas bases and  fighter-bombers, attack planes, observation planes, and  reconnaissance planes of the U.S. Air Force stationed in South  Korea were mobilized on a large-scale.    The war exercise was a reckless play with fire aimed at  increasing their capabilities of making a surprise attack on the  North and at enhancing cooperation between overseas-based flying  corps and military planes of the U.S. Air Force stationed in  South Korea. This is a clear proof that the U.S. imperialists  are the ones who increase tension on the Korean peninsula.</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Old boys' network still obstructs working women, survey finds THE OLD boys' network remains firmly entrenched as the single biggest obstacle to female advancement in the workplace, according to the most comprehensive UK survey of management attitudes to women. Women rated the existence of 'men's clubs' at work - which men operate behind the scenes to help each other gain the best jobs - as a greater barrier to career development than no childcare provision or inflexible working hours. Forty-three per cent of women said they experienced the effects of male networks, compared with just 9 per cent who had suffered because of lack of childcare. Researchers, who questioned nearly 1,500 women managers and 800 male colleagues, said they uncovered 'widespread prejudice among male managers against their women colleagues'. They also found that the women who had battled against prejudice 'appear to have done so at considerable personal cost'. One third of the female managers were unmarried and only half had children. This contrasted with 92 per cent of male managers who were married and 86 per cent who had children. Many men surveyed had strong views on the role of female managers. One commented: 'With massive unemployment we don't need to encourage women into the workplace when they already have a role as a mother.' Another said: 'In general women do not make good managers - although they have much to offer in the workplace.' A third said: 'Successful management requires commitment with no outside worries. For women to succeed they must therefore be single or have adult children.' The survey was conducted by the British Institute of Management, which was relaunched yesterday as the Institute of Management. This follows amalgamation with the Institution of Industrial Managers. BhS, the retail chain, which has an 85 per cent female workforce and mainly female customers, sponsored the research. Separate research by the institute has indicated that only about 3 per cent of senior managers are female and about 9 per cent of managers overall are women. The latest report says: 'The economic arguments for increasing those proportions should not need rehearsing. Women now make up almost half of the workforce and will account for 90 per cent of labour force growth over the next 10 years.' Mr Roger Young, IoM director-general, said: 'Men are the prime barrier to women in management. Despite some progress, old-fashioned sexist attitudes are still common and represent a real, not imagined barrier to the progress of women.' Men's club, Page 10</p>

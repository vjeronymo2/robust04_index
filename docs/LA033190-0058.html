			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG REDUCES CRIPPLING FROM SPINAL INJURIES  </P> <P> Identifying the first treatment for acute spinal cord injury, federal health  officials said Friday that patients who receive the drug methylprednisolone  within eight hours of injury recover motor and sensory functions to a  dramatically greater extent than other patients do.  </P> <P> The drug, a steroid often used to treat symptoms of shock and to prevent  swelling after strokes or surgery, appears to halt deterioration of spinal cord  cells and tissue, according to study results announced by the National  Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.  </P> <P> Before the study, "the whole field (had) been absolutely dismal, with no hope  of improving the fate of the patient," said Dr. Phanor L. Perot Jr., chairman  of the department of surgery of the Yale University School of Medicine and one  of the study researchers. "This study gives concrete proof . . . that we can  stop the lethal process."  </P> <P> The study results are to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine  next month, but the researchers said they took the unusual step of announcing  the findings in advance because of their "immediate effect on a major national  public health problem that has been extraordinarily resistant to treatment."  </P> <P> Depending on the degree of the initial injury, methylprednisolone could  determine whether some patients will be wheelchair-bound, said Dr. Michael B.  Bracken, professor of epidemiology and public health at the Yale medical school  and the study coordinator.  </P> <P> For most patients, however, administration of the drug will allow greater use  of muscles or increased sensation that otherwise would be lost, Bracken said,  speaking at a press conference sponsored by the national institute, which  funded the study.  </P> <P> In a quadriplegic, for example, the drug could mean "the return of function of  a hand" or, in a paraplegic, "being able to stand, or move from a wheelchair to  a chair or to a vehicle without help," where assistance would otherwise be  needed, he said.  </P> <P> The improvement varies with the severity of the injury, "but all patients  benefit," Bracken said.  </P> <P> Because methylprednisolone was found to be effective only during the first  eight hours after an injury, early treatment with the drug is critical, the  researchers said.  </P> <P> "Since 95% of patients with acute spinal cord injury are admitted to a hospital  within eight hours, almost all of them could benefit from this therapy,"  Bracken said, adding that researchers hope the drug eventually will be  administered by paramedics in ambulances or "at roadside, if possible."  </P> <P> About 10,000 spinal cord injuries occur every year. Two-thirds involve people  under the age of 30, and most result from automobile accidents, according to  the institute. Survivors often are permanently disabled and face a lifetime of  specialized care and rehabilitation.  </P> <P> The cost to the federal government of such care and services now exceeds $4  billion a year, the institute said.  </P> <P> In most cases, the spinal cord is not severed in an accident but is crushed or  bruised, the institute said. In the hours following the injury, the body  responds with a series of physiological changes that worsen the damage.  </P> <P> First, the spinal cord swells, and the blood supply is reduced sharply in the  damaged area, depriving cells of needed nutrients. As a result, nerve cells  die, producing a gap in the cord, with scar tissue forming on either side of  the gap.  </P> <P> Generally, the higher the injury, the greater the disability, the institute  said. For example, an injury to the cord at the neck level could affect both  arms and legs, while a trauma at the chest level could affect the legs and  lower part of the body.  </P> <P> Since 1977, researchers at 10 medical centers, including UC San Diego and UC  Davis, have been studying different drug regimens in an attempt to determine if  any would improve long-term neurological recovery in patients with acute spinal  cord injury.  </P> <P> The study to be published next month compared 162 patients treated with  methylprednisolone with 154 patients who received naloxone, another drug, and  171 patients who received a placebo, or a medically worthless drug. Motor and  sensory functions were evaluated on admission, again after six weeks and after  six months.  </P> <P> Patients who received methylprednisolone within eight hours showed "significant  improvement" in both muscle function and pin prick and touch sensation,  compared to the other groups at each assessment, researchers said.  </P> <P> Further, the recovery was sustained throughout the six-month period, they said.  The drug was not effective when given more than eight hours after the injury.  </P> <P> Researchers said they were still evaluating patients' progress after one year  and could not comment on those results.  </P> <P> The researchers said the drug dosage was important. The study used an initial  intravenous infusion of 30 milligrams of the drug for every kilogram (about 2.2  pounds) of patient weight, followed by an additional 5.4 milligrams of drug per  kilogram of body weight every hour for the next 23 hours.  </P> <P> The treatment costs about $300, which researchers described as "a very low  price."  </P> <P> The institute has established a toll-free number that physicians can call this  weekend for additional information: 1-800-633-3425. Next week, calls will be  taken at 301-496-5751 during regular business hours, the institute said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TREATING SPINAL CORD INJURIES  </P> <P> Treating patients with the drug methylprednisolone within eight hours of damage  to the spinal cord can significantly reduce subsequent disability, the New  England Journal of Medicine will report. Highlights:  </P> <P> Rate of occurrence: About 10,000 Americans each year suffer an acute spinal  cord injury that causes paralysis. Most injuries occur in men under age 30 and  most are caused by automobile accidents.  </P> <P> How it works: The drug probably works by procecting spinal cord cells from  disintegration known to occur in the hours following injury, and perhaps by  improving blood flow to the area of injury.  </P> <P> The cost: The drug costs about $300 to treat one patient  </P> <P> The manufacturer: It is marketed by Elkins-Sinn Inc., a subsidary of American  Home Products Co.'s A. H. Robins Co. unit.  </P></p>

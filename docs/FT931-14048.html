			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Rates ease in Europe THERE were new signs yesterday that European monetary policy is on the verge of another ease, but dealers in cash and futures markets continued to view interest rate movements with caution, writes James Blitz. At the start of trading yesterday, the Bundesbank announced that it would be holding a variable rate repo for 14 days in today's weekly intervention, inviting bids from commercial banks for the allocation of funds. With call money hovering yesterday at around 8.65 per cent, there was speculation that the Bundesbank might today allocate funds at a level below last week's fixed rate repo of 8.60 per cent. Several arguments were marshalled in favour of the view that an ease in German policy might come sooner than expected. The dollar's weakness against the D-Mark this week has helped remove fears of imported inflation that were haunting the Bundesbank. Another sign of easier conditions was the decision by the Belgian and Dutch central banks to ease their key interest rates by 10 basis points. The Belgian national bank cut its central rate to 8.40 per cent, and the Dutch authorities did the same to their special advances rate. A senior dealer in one London bank recalled that Dutch rate moves could sometimes indicate the Bundesbank's thinking on policy. But the arguments against an easing in policy either at today's intervention or this week's Bundesbank council meeting were very strong. The Bundesbank's general council will probably await the outcome of negotiations on the solidarity pact currently underway between the German government, opposition, employers and trade unions, before taking a final decision on rates. Chancellor Kohl was due to announce the government's proposals late last night, but a final resolution is unlikely until after Thursday's council meeting. Amidst these different pressures, the market came out slightly bearish. Three month French francs firmed to 11 1/2 per cent from 11 1/4 per cent on Monday. The March French franc contract fell 14 basis points to close near its lows, at 90.29. In the sterling cash market, conditions were more difficult than they had been on Monday, after the Bank of England announced a shortage of Pounds 1.05bn. The overnight rate for lending pounds was quoted as high as 11 per cent.</p>

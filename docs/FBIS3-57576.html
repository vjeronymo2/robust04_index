			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Petr Zhuravlev and Dmitriy Kuznets under the </F> "Parliament" rubric: "Duma's Political Arithmetic. Were  Committees Divided `Fairly?'"]    [Text] The exciting process of "the organization of the  Duma's work" has unexpectedly ended in the peaceful distribution  of the main posts among parliamentary factions.    There has been virtually no Duma faction displeased with the  "organization." Only the "12 December Union" and the "Russian  Path," groups that did not manage to register on time and,  consequently, were not allowed to grab their share, were  mightily displeased. The other factions resolved the issue  amicably by adopting as a basis Gennadiy Zyuganov's scheme:  "The organizational strength of each faction should be  proportionate to its numerical representation at the State Duma,  taking into account, of course, the faction leaders' opinions."    The communist leader even recommended that a mathematical  method be used for calculating this: each elected post in  parliament will be assigned a certain number of points, the  points will be summed up, and the total number of State Duma  seats will be divided by the sum. Thus the "price" of each seat  will be calculated. Each faction, depending on its strength,  may thus "buy" one post or another. As a result of further  agreements, a joint "package" will be put together, which will  be approved by the Duma. Presently it is hard to say if the  faction leaders actually calculated anything, but the final  distribution of the chamber's key offices fitted surprisingly  well into Mr. Zyuganov's abstract mathematical model. For  instance, only two persons were nominated to the posts of  committee chairmen by the fairly numerous Agrarian Party [APR]  faction (55 deputies) because the Agrarians ran out of "points"  after Ivan Rybkin's election as State Duma speaker. The  aggregate numbers of committee chairmen and their deputies from  "Russia's Choice" and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  [LDPR] are equal -- the blocs hold 16 posts each. The "Choice"  faction, however, comprises 78 deputies, while that of the LDPR  has 63, so to strike "a fair deal" "Russia's Choice" was given  the post of State Duma first deputy chairman, which was  initially not foreseen, whereas the Liberal Democrats put up  with "only" a deputy chairman.    In all, the LDPR leads in the number of "its own" Duma  committee heads -- 5 out of 23. "Russia's Choice," the PRES  [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], and the "New Regional  Policy" factions have three chairmen each. The Agrarians, the  communists, and the "Yabloko" faction nominated two chairmen  each. It should be noted, however, that the value of the  committees is somewhat different. The post of Geopolitical  Committee chairman (held by LDPR's Viktor Ustinov) is clearly  lower in importance than the post of Security Committee chairman  (held by RFCP's [Russian Federation Communist Party] Viktor  Ilyukhin). Still, there have so far been no specific objections  in that regard from the Liberal Democratic chief. This may be  attributed to the fact that the Geopolitical Committee is one of  two State Duma committees where one faction (the LDPR's in this  case) has an absolute majority. The second of these committees,  on agrarian matters, is, of course, dominated by the APR.    There was no malicious intent, however, in APR's and LDPR's  "occupying" one committee each; according to the State Duma's  provisional rules of procedure, each deputy must be "assigned"  to a committee, so no wonder that the Agrarians and the Liberal  Democrats chose precisely those committees that suited them best  according to their "area of expertise." The other factions were  also given the chairmanship in committees of their "expertise:"  "Yabloko," the budget and international affairs committees;  "Women of Russia," on women's affairs; and the PRES, on regional  policy, local authorities, and on CIS affairs.    The "fair" solution of organizational matters has so far  proved only one thing: the communist-nationalist bloc of State  Duma deputies, although it has a relative majority, did not  venture to stage an open confrontation with the democrats; while  the latter, having weighed it all, did not refuse to accept  their due share. Only the disgruntled radical nationalists from  the "Russian Path" called the day on which the personal  "package" was approved "a black day for Russian patriots."</p>

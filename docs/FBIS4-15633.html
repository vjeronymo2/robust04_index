			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Ukrainian Presidential and Cabinet of </F> Ministers Press Service]    [Text] The Ukrainian president receives appeals from  believers of different faiths saying that at present, especially  during the Supreme Council elections, various political forces  seek to use the authority of the church for their own purposes.  This inevitably leads to an exacerbation of the situation,  complicated as it already is.    In this regard, the Ukrainian president expressed his point  of view on this issue.    Now, when the Ukrainian people are building their  independent  and unified state under extremely difficult political and  economic conditions, each and every citizen must realize that  the state-building process should be conducted based on  democracy and normal human relations, regardless of convictions  or creed.    The state guarantees equal rights and freedoms to all  citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs. According to  present Ukrainian legislation, interference on the part of any  state institutions or political groupings in the internal  affairs of the church is inadmissible. Particularly dangerous  for all of society are attempts by illegal military groups to  resolve interfaith problems using violent methods.  Unfortunately, such cases were reported in the past and  included among others, forcible takeovers of temples and their  property. This kind of illegal action should be controlled by  relevant state institutions responsible for applying resolute  actions to head off and stop conflicts.    One should understand that the church performs very special  functions which cannot be performed by any other state or public  institution. It instills the most fundamental human values --  spirituality, compassion, sensitivity, and love for our fellow  man. This is what its unique role in society is all about.    The present religious strifes, kindled by certain political  forces, destabilize the situation in Ukraine. And all this is  happening at an historic time, when we are in so much need of  unity, consolidation of all patriotic forces, and civil accord.    This cannot help but worry the president, because peace  among  religions is an important condition for peace in society and a  successful state-building process. Relations between church and  state should be based on present Ukrainian laws and take into  consideration the canonical teachings of all churches.    The president instructed local executive bodies to ensure  strict compliance with all Ukrainian laws regarding the church,  and held them responsible for the consequences of any illegal  actions on the part of separate individuals and political  groupings that stir up religious strife and increase tensions in  society.</p>

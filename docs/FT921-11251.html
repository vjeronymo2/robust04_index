			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pension claims 'to be toned down' IF YOU find yourself confused by claims about the performance record of competing investments, you are in good company, writes Norma Cohen. It has emerged that even professionals, such as pension fund trustees, need help in reading the fine print of fund managers' advertising. The National Association of Pension Funds, which includes the UK's largest pension plans, has published an advertising code intended to prevent fund managers from making misleading claims about their own performance. Although the code is voluntary, the NAPF is urging trustees to ignore any unsolicited advertising that does not conform to the code. 'People will inevitably show the best information that is in their commercial interest to show. And for perfectly good commercial reasons,' said David Adams, a trustee of the British Rail Pension Trust Company and chairman of the NAPF working party which drafted the code. The group's concern, he said, is not that fund managers are necessarily lying about their track records, but that they are presenting only parts of the whole picture and doing so in a misleading manner. For example, he said, a fund manager who topped the performance league tables in a single year is likely to tout that. But if professionals need a code to protect them, what of the hapless retail investor? While agreeing that personal pension plans are often sold to individuals based on the producers' performance record, Adams said the NAPF had been unwilling to ask that it be extended to retail products. John Clamp, executive director of Combined Actuarial Performance Services, which ranks pension fund performance, said: 'I've seen worse breaches of ethics in the retail market than anywhere else. It is ironic that the more sophisticated wholesale sector has chosen to regulate itself while the government has chosen to do nothing to regulate the retail sector.' Among misleading statistics that he had seen presented was a fund manager comparing the returns of a Far Eastern equities investment fund to those of a building society savings account. 'The most basic rule is that you must compare apples with apples, not with oranges,' he said. Jean Eaglesham, money policy director at the Consumers Association, said that while her group had not actively been campaigning for an advertising code of conduct in retail products, it had been pressing for the presentation of inflation-adjusted figures. It is easy to impress someone by saying that a Pounds 10,000 investment can grow to Pounds 200,000 in 25 years. But would they be as impressed if they knew that if inflation averages 5 per cent a year, that figure would be worth Pounds 59,000 in today's money?</p>

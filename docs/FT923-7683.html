			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Pension has been overpaid I HAVE been notified by my assurance society that they have overpaid my pension annuity since commencement in 1988. Although they have said they will not seek the return of the overpayment, can they reduce the pension after issuing (and my acceptance of) the policy? They are asking for the return of the policy document for amendment. Do you advise this? As a matter of good insurance practice we consider that, where a mistake has been made in your favour, of a modest amount, then a company should live with this mistake and continue paying the annuity. If the mistake is so large that it ought to have been apparent to the trustees of the scheme or their professional advisers, or to you yourself if you were the person who was shopping around in the annuity market, then the solution they are proposing is reasonable. You should not return the annuity policy as they request pending a fuller investigation. The annuity market is highly competitive and rates often change, even among the leading companies, on a weekly basis. It would be all too easy for an insurance company to underquote its competitors, get the business and then (as in your case) say: 'Sorry, we've made a mistake and we're going to correct it.' In other cases, the mistake might be genuine but the employee in the insurance company who made it could be trying to cover his own tracks. If, therefore, you judge that you are being overpaid by only a modest percentage, then we suggest that you write to the chief executive at the head office of the insurance company in question, making the points set out in this reply. If that fails to produce a satisfactory result, you should write to the insurance ombudsman: Dr Julian Farrand, City Gate One, 135 Park Street, London SE1 9EA.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 12 (AFP) -- Multi-party talks began  here Tuesday [12 April] on finalising the mandate for UN  peacekeepers to oversee a ceasefire between Georgia and its  breakaway republic of Abkhazia, a UN spokesman said.    The UN-brokered talks, attended by delegations from Georgia,  Abkhazia and Russia, were convened to fine-tune the conditions  under which the UN force will be deployed in the region  following a ceasefire accord signed April 4.    The talks are expected to last two days, diplomats said.    The Russian delegation, which comprises high-ranking  diplomatic and military officials and is led by First Deputy  Defence Minister Georgi Kondratyev, will try to persuade the UN  Security Council to accord peacekeeping status to Russian troops  in and around the separatist region, diplomats said.    Granting the request would make the Russian force, which has  been stationed in Georgia as a buffer between the two forces,  eligible for UN funding.    The principle of a multi-national peacekeeping force was  accepted by Georgian and Abkhazian authorities on April 4.    The UN's special representative to the negotiations, Edouard  Brunner, said Tuesday that it would be "premature" to release  any information on their progress.    The Security Council said Friday that the establishment of a  peacekeeping forces inside Abkhazia was conditional on the  current talks and others resuming April 19 on the future  constitutional status of Abkhazia making "substantial progress  towards a political settlement."    Abkhazia declared its sovereignty in July 1992. But Georgia  has refused to countenance changes to its borders and, with the  backing of the international community, has proposed that the  separatist republic be granted a "broad autonomy" while  remaining tied to Tbilisi.    The current round of talks are due to end at the end of  April.    Earlier rounds of peace talks took place in October, January  and February.    Separatists routed Georgian troops from the Abkhazian  capital  Sukhumi in September after 13 months of fighting which left more  than 3,000 dead.    The fate of some 250,000 Georgian refugees who fled Abkhazia  after Sukhumi fell is the subject of separate negotiations  currently taking place in the Russian Black Sea port of Sochi.</p>

On the basis of a joint decleration, jointly signed by the  representatives of Yugoslavia and Croatia in Geneva on January  19, a Yugoslav bureau will also be opened in Zagreb.    The bureaus should secure communication between the two  governments, ease the resolution of open issues, build up mutual  trust and establish the normalization of good-neighbourly  relations, cooperation and stability in the region, the Yugoslav  government said.    The Yugoslav Government also adopted a platform for talks  between the Yugoslav and Croatian vice-premiers -- Zeljko Simic  and Mate Granic -- in Zagreb on February 12 and empowered Simic  to sign a document on the status of the bureaus which will  employ eight people each.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Nigeria oil depot in full operation Anglo-Dutch Shell, which operates about half of Nigeria's oil fields, has restored the Forcados export terminal to full loading today, five days after the power was disabled by striking oil workers. Shell, which normally produces about 1m barrels a day of oil, has lost on average half its production during the past three weeks of the six-week strike by the two labour unions, Nupeng and Pengassan, which are demanding an end to military rule. Industry estimates show crude oil exports down by about 20 per cent. Overall losses by the other producers are put at about 15 per cent. Despite pressure from the government, no significant return to work by oil workers has occurred. Last week the government sacked the leaders of the two unions, legalising its action this week. The decree bans national and state union leaders, although Nupeng and Pengassan do not have state leadership but chapters for each oil company. The chapters' leaders still exist and the oil producers are talking to them. The coming week will be a test of the unions' leaders, who have gone underground, and of the resolve of the ordinary membership to sustain a strike with no end in sight. The strikers want Mr Moshood Abiola, presumed winner of last year's presidential election, freed from jail and installed in government. Mr Abiola is on trial for alleged treason after declaring himself president. The next hearing is due on Monday, before a new judge in the high court.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Roshchina: "Suits, Applications From </F> `Formers' Beset Vladivostok Procuracy and Courts"]    [Text] According to a report from the city administration  press center, a commission for reorganizing the management  structure under the leadership of acting deputy chief of the  city, V. Terekhov, has been formed in the Gray House.  Information about the course of its work has been promised  within the next few days when the document on "reorganization"  is finally ready.    Well, the "victims" have a viewpoint regarding this as well.  In the words of V. Gilgenberg, he has not seen the decree for  his ouster. After moving out of the city manager's office, from  which he managed to remove his personal belongings and money,  Vladimir Aleksandrovich filed charges in the Frunzenskiy Rayon  court against the deputy chief of the kray, I. Lebedinets,  regarding his discharge.    As it turned out, I. Lebedinets had signed no such decree,  and so the charges were filed against the wrong person. They  were transferred to the Leninskiy Rayon people's court, which  will obviously submit an inquiry to the city administration  which is located on the territory of this rayon. It is assumed  that the corresponding directive was issued by acting city chief  K. Tolstochein, and the question of the legality of firing  Gilgenberg should be addressed to him.    Further, V. Gilgenberg filed charges against the deputy  chief  of the kray, I. Lebedinets, in the Frunzenskiy Rayon court  concerning the illegality, in the plaintiff's opinion, of  Lebedinets' decree appointing K. Tolstochein as acting chief of  the city, since effective 14 March, on instructions from V.  Cherepkov, who had gone into the hospital, his duties were to be  performed by V. Gilgenberg.    In addition, Gilgenberg sent three applications to the city  procurator and also the kray procurator. The latter was  addressed also to the president, the chairmen of the Duma and  the Council of the Federation of the Russian Federation, and the  procurator general. They also discuss the illegality of the  ouster of both Gilgenberg himself and the other workers of the  mayor's office. Moreover, the former manager insisted on having  I. Lebedinets removed from his position and bringing criminal  charges against him for statements that violate, in the  plaintiff's opinion, the principles of "racial and ethnic equal  rights."    The chief of the city administration for public education,  N.  Beletskiy, reported that on 22 March two workers of the mayor's  office accompanied by a militia detail headed by the deputy  chief of the Leninskiy Rayon internal affairs department, S.  Goncharuk, had tried twice to kick him out of his office and no  documents were presented either for his dismissal or for staff  cutbacks. In Beletskiy's words, administration workers  "defended" him.    This incident was the occasion for the appeal from N.  Beletskiy to the city procurator, representatives of the State  Duma, and the investigator of the Procuracy General of the  Russian Federation.    The former chairman of the city committee for administration  of property, P. Bezukladnikov, was "luckier": He was given, in  his words, an order firing him (No. 356 of 17 March), signed by  K. Tolstochein. Effective 18 March the former chief, A.  Sazhnov, was returned to the office. P. Bezukladnikov filed  charges with the Leninskiy Rayon people's court against acting  chief of the city administration K. Tolstochein concerning the  illegality of his dismissal.</p>

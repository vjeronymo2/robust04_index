			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH VISITS U.S. TROOPS  </P> <P> Charles Krauthammer's pungent column "Why Go After Hussein? It's as Easy as  A-B-C" (Column Right, Commentary, Nov. 26) is the most incisive and  perspicacious argument yet for why Hussein must be harshly dealt with and  removed from Kuwait, even if it means an all-out attack by military forces. It  is fervently hoped that President Bush and his advisers read this extremely  important article.  </P> <P> LANNY R. MIDDINGS  </P> <P> San Ramon  </P></p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures traded around the 3,200 September Footsie level for most of the day as dealers responded to strong UK economic data and the move on US interest rates, writes Joel Kibazo. Buyers of the September contract on the FT-SE 100 were seen at the outset as dealers reacted with relief that the US Federal Reserve Board had lifted rates by a decisive  1/2 percentage point. Within the first half an hour, the contract was trading 20 points ahead. But it was the release of better than expected figures on UK inflation and unemployment that sent September sharply ahead to break through 3,200. Goldman Sachs was reported to have been among the main buyers in the market, although rumours of independent traders (locals) being short helped underpin the rise. Dealers said good selling at the higher levels was well absorbed and there was good arbitrage activity particularly later in the session. September hit a high of 3,220 but relinquished some of the earlier gains in concerted profit taking towards the close. It finished at 3,207, up 55 on its previous close, and around 6 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 10 points. Volume jumped to 18,767 lots. In traded options, volume at 46,550 was more than double that of Tuesday. The FT-SE 100 option traded 16,332 lots.</p>

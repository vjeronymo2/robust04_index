			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- The Russian Government said  Russia will pay 4.7 billion U.S. dollars as part of its foreign  debt payments in 1994.    The State Duma adopted a law on Wednesday allowing the  government to borrow as much in order to keep the balance and  grant not more than 400 million dollars in credits to other  countries.    Aleksandr Zhukov, one of the authors of the law, said this  will be enough to finish facilities in foreign countries, the  construction of which has been suspended.</p>

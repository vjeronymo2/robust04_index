			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Billiton sale news hits Shell News that Shell Transport was poised to conclude the sale of its Billiton metals business provided a motive to mark down the share price when it was announced late yesterday. The announcement that Gencor of South Africa had agreed to buy the most of Shell's Billiton upstream assets for Dollars 1.14bn after charges contained no surprises. However, the shares had driven up by almost 10 per cent since the start of the month and one oil specialist pointed out that while they normally traded at a significant yield premium to the market the rising share price had pushed the yield towards par. Also, the US oil majors began their reporting season this week and the figures have tended to match the gloomy forecasts. Yesterday Chevron reported disappointing figures. Shell Transport shares ended the day 10 lower at 732p, although the day's final turnover of 2.5m shares suggested that the bears were merely shadow boxing.</p>

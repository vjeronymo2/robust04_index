			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Characterization of Hydrocarbons. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As shown in Table 1, this rule requires the speciation of hydrocarbons for the vapor phase of combustion emissions and for evaporative emissions generated using an evaporative emission generator. The speciation is to be performed using methods that identify and determine the concentration of all hydrocarbon compounds containing twelve or fewer carbon atoms. The Auto/Oil Program procedures referenced above provide an acceptable speciation method for hydrocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Characterization of Aldehydes and Ketones. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Speciation of aldehydes and ketones containing a maximum of eight carbon atoms is required only for the vapor phase of combustion emissions. A test procedure for formaldehyde measurement is included in 40 CFR part 86 for formaldehyde. F/FA manufacturers are also referred to the Auto/Oil Program procedures referenced above for the analysis of aldehydes and ketones. Additional applicable procedures are available in ASTM D 5197&hyph;91, ``Standard Test Method for Determination of Formaldehyde and Other Carbonyl Compounds in Air (Active Sampler Methodology).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Characterization of Alcohols and Ethers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Alcohol and ether compounds containing six or fewer carbon atoms are to be characterized for both evaporative and combustion emissions, whenever the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture under evaluation contains alcohols or ethers. If a F/FA formulation contains an alcohol or ether with more than six carbon atoms, then this manufacturer is required to measure their presence in the emissions, as well as alcohols or ethers with fewer number of carbon atoms. For example, if an ether containing seven carbon atoms (e.g., isopropyl tertiary butyl ether) is part of a fuel formulation being tested in this program, then its manufacturer must characterize ethers with seven or fewer carbon atoms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the Auto/Oil Program procedures referenced above, a test procedure for the characterization of alcohols and ethers is described in 40 CFR part 80, Appendix F, entitled ``Test Method for Determination of C1&hyph;C4 Alcohols and MTBE in Gasoline by Gas Chromatography''. This procedure can be used for the identification of ethers in addition to MTBE, but will require appropriate modifications for application to gas phase samples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Characterization of Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the NPRM, EPA proposed a broad requirement for the identification and measurement of polycyclic aromatic compounds. In the final rule, this requirement is narrowed to a limited number of specified compounds which are of significant concern in terms of their potential non-carcinogenic and/or carcinogenic effects. Included are specified polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (NPAH) compounds as well as individual compounds and classes of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDFs).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

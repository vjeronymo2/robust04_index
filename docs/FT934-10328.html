			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC lead-zinc producers ask for protection PRESSURE IS building for the European Commission to take action to 'safeguard' the Community's lead-zinc producers, who claim their survival is at risk from the strong surge in imports from the former eastern bloc countries. Yesterday the German metals industry association added its voice to the debate. 'Lead and zinc are being produced in the east under ecologically irresponsible conditions and then dumped on to EC markets. Producers here are having to shut modern, expensive and environmentally-sound plants and cut jobs,' said Mr Rudolf Gabrisch, president. The German call for action came only two days after EC zinc producers agreed to work out details of a scheme to permanently close one or two smelters to bring capacity more into line with demand. While the producers seem united over the smelter 'shut-down' scheme, there is a split about whether they should urge the Commission to restrict zinc imports from the former eastern bloc. The Commission recently placed temporary restrictions on aluminium imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States and has started negotiations to persuade the CIS to limit exports in future. Some zinc producers are preparing a dossier in the hope that they can convince the Commission to take similar action on their behalf. Other companies argue, however, that zinc is a commodity and restrictions on imports to the EC would have virtually no impact on the global availability of the metal. The eastern bloc used to be a net importer of lead and zinc. But the International Lead &amp; Zinc Study Group estimates that the region will export 140,000 tonnes of lead and 355,000 tonnes of zinc to the west this year. Kazakhstan, a big producer, now directs lead exports to the west to earn dollars rather than to Russia where battery producers are reported to be short of what for them is an essential material. The zinc market has been particularly hit by a reversal in Chinese trade: China imported about 300,000 tonnes a year in the mid-1980s but, after expansion of its domestic industry, now has about 100,000 tonnes to export.</p>

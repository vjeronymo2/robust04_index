			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Jan 12, BNS -- The Jan. 10 incident was a  Russian-organized, deliberate political provocation, MP Odisejs  Kostanda, of the Latvian National Independence Movement, told  reporters Wednesday [12 January].    Andrejs Rucs, the former head of the Riga Vidzeme district  municipality, was prompted by his "impulsive disposition to join  in the incident but he was unconscious of the actual goals of  its organizers," said Kostanda.    The Homeland and Freedom faction does not support methods  used by Rucs during the incident because, currently, Latvia is  unable to turn out the occupation army by force, said faction  head Maris Grinblats.    The faction calls for more composure in similar situations,  said Grinblats. Simultaneously, Grinblats criticized the  government for "overdramatizing" the occurrence and being too  submissive to Russia's interests.    "Russian militarists quite often take the liberty to treat  Latvia's citizens in a criminal way," noted Kostanda.    Russia's military planes cross the Latvian airspace without  any permission almost daily but the Latvian Government has  notified Russia on none of these occassions, Kostanda said.    Kostanda reminded the participants of the press conference  that one of the detainees, Maj. Gen. Anatoly Vodopyanov,  conducted actions against the Latvian state in January and  August, 1991.    The other officer, Maj. Gen. Nikolay Tailokov, has  unlawfully  settled in a summer house of a Latvian citizen and refuses to  move out, said Kostanda.    Kostanda characterized the government's apology to Russia as  "irresponsible and corresponding to its disloyal policies."    The Cabinet used the incident to extend its authority by  unlawful means, said Grinblats, pointing at the amendments to  the law on municipalities. The amended law allowed for the  immediate dismissal of Rucs.    The amendments are inconsistent with the 81st paragraph of  the Latvian Constitution, said Grinblats. The new rules also  increased the dependence of municipal officials from the  government, he added.    At the same time, speakers of the Homeland and Freedom  faction pledged to pay more attention to issues related to the  procedure of Russian troops' withdrawal and the takeover of the  military property.</p>

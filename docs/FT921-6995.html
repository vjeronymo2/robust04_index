			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Japan chain stores see modest rise in sales JAPAN'S department and chain stores reported modest sales growth of 1.6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in January, compared with the same month last year, suggesting that consumer demand remains relatively strong in spite of the general slowing of economic growth. The Japan Department Stores' Association said that sales growth was curbed by a continuing fall in demand for items such as paintings and precious metals, sales of which surged during the expansion of the so-called economic 'bubble' in the late 1980s. Total sales remained above last year's level even though workers' end-year bonuses fell, while overtime in December was 16.1 per cent lower than a year earlier, reflecting a reduction in production output in a range of industries, including the electronics and car sectors. Department stores' sales of personal articles rose 5 per cent, while foodstuff sales were 4.3 per cent higher and clothing 1.5 per cent higher. But sales of household articles were flat and those of sundry goods fell by 4 per cent. The association attributed slow clothing sales to the warm winter.</p>

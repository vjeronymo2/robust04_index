			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS GIVEN TASTE OF BUSINESS WORLD'S ETHICS, ISSUES  </P> <P> It was 10:15 a.m. on Wednesday, and about 600 Orange County high school  students were doing what they normally do on weekday mornings -- going to  class.  </P> <P> But these weren't your ordinary English or math classes. The students were  taking their instruction from business professionals, who were providing them  with real-world lessons on entrepreneurship, global competition and business  ethics.  </P> <P> The one-hour classes were part of the sixth annual Business Issues Conference  held at the Anaheim Convention Center, sponsored by the Constitutional Rights  Foundation of Orange County.  </P> <P> The nonprofit educational foundation organized the conference to "increase  student awareness of the complexities of decision-making and business ethics,  to promote critical thinking and encourage dialogue between business and  education," said Patricia K. Hitchcock, executive director of the Newport  Beach-based group.  </P> <P> Twenty-six high schools from throughout the county participated in the  conference.  </P> <P> Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, the keynote speaker for the event,  said the county's job picture looks bright. "But there is growing concern," he  said, "that there's a mismatch between the skills needed and the skills  available. Education is the missing key component."  </P> <P> Most of the students at the conference said they found the workshops valuable.  </P> <P> "It helped me learn what you have to do to get into a business of your own and  to succeed in being what you want to be," said Ronnie Andrews, a junior at San  Clemente High School, who attended classes on stress management, establishing a  positive self-image and personal financial planning.  </P> <P> Students learned about the world of foreign trade from Barbara Renaud, founder  and president of Airtronics Inc., an Irvine aerospace firm.  </P> <P> Renaud stressed the importance of understanding other countries' cultures and  learning about their different business practices. In many countries, she said,  it is important to establish a trusting relationship with the foreign executive  you are doing business with before a deal can be struck.  </P> <P> "It has been very hard for Americans (to do business overseas) because they  want that deal, that money or that contract now, because that's what they've  been used to here," she said.  </P> <P> On the other hand, foreign firms have had to adjust to American firms' business  practices, such as contracts that "are 42 pages long with at least 20 pages of  amendments," she said. "It's very hard for them. Their contracts are  handshakes."  </P> <P> Several conference sessions dealt with environmental issues and the impact that  bad business decisions can have on the environment and local economies.  </P> <P> In a workshop on toxic wastes, students watched a video showing the cleanup of  the recent American Tanker oil spill off Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> The spill showed that the oil industry could have developed more advanced  technologies to speed up the cleanup, said Ray Picard, chief of the Huntington  Beach Fire Department.  </P> <P> Picard told the students that they will someday be the business people making  decisions that will affect the environment and other matters.  </P> <P> "Who's going to run things tomorrow?" he asked. Pointing to the students, he  answered: "You."  </P></p>

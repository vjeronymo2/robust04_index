			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (2): The 500 biggest European companies by market capitalisation THIS is the 10th year in which the FT500 has been published. The main table ranks the 500 biggest European companies by market capitalisation. A second table ranks the top 500 UK companies on the London Stock Exchange. A company's capitalisation is the number of its shares multiplied by the price of its shares, and therefore measures the value of a company in the eyes of investors. Capitalisation is chosen as a yardstick because it has a number of advantages over other methods. It is a good guide to performance over time; it gives a proper weighting to banks, whose positions are distorted in tables based on turnover; and it takes proper account of loss-making companies, which disappear from lists based on profits. The stock market is particularly important in the UK, whereas in Germany the banks play a larger role in corporate finance,and in France and Italy many of the biggest groups are state-owned. To take account of these factors, a separate list is included of the top 200 European concerns, whether publicly or privately owned, ranked by turnover. Rankings: The rankings of the European and UK Top 500 tables are based on market capitalisation at the end of September 1991 average exchange rates. Preference capital has been excluded for this calculation. Companies that have 75 per cent or more of equity held by one other concern, or that have only a minimal proportion of their capital openly traded on the market, have been excluded. Sources for the capitalisation figures include Datastream International, local stock exchanges, and the FT World Actuaries Index. The ranking of companies having the same capitalisation has been determined by reference to their turnover or, where necessary, their profit. Figures in the European tables are in dollars, using September 1991 average exchange rates. For ease of comparison turnover and profit figures for last year are shown at 1991 average exchange rates. UK 500 figures are in sterling. Accounts: Consolidated accounts have been used whenever possible. When parent company accounts only have been reported, these figures have been used and annotated. Turnover is shown net of sales taxes and inter-group sales. A ranking based on the latest year's figure is also given. Profit is disclosed profit before tax and minority interest. For the UK companies, it is also before extraordinary items. Return on capital employed (ROCE) is based on capital employed at the beginning of the financial year divided by pre-tax profit plus interest. For banks, capital employed = shareholders' funds. UK Investment Trusts: The rankings are based on market capitalisation at the end of September 1991. The shareholders' funds figure is based on the number of shares in issue and the stated net asset value. This table has been compiled with the assistance of County NatWest Wood Mackenzie.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     BIGGEST PROFIT INCREASES: EUROPE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               % Profit Company                             Cntry.

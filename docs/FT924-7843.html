			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (10): Let off lightly - Scotland / The market has been cushioned by a relatively mild recession SCOTLAND'S property market is unmistakeably in the grip of recession. Nonetheless, it has been let off lightly compared with some other parts of the UK. The problems of overbuilding and recession have been less pronounced than in many parts of Britain. A later and milder upturn in the late 1980s resulted in fewer new offices and shops than southern England. The property market has also been cushioned by Scotland's relatively mild recession, in which Scottish unemployment has been overtaken by that of the UK for the first time since 1923. The pressure has been mounting, however. Overall, Scottish office values dropped by another 9.5 per cent last year. That brought the cumulative fall since 1989 to 14 per cent, according to the Investment Property Databank, an independent research group. The most abrupt turnaround was in the Edinburgh office market where rental and capital values more than doubled between 1987 and 1989. But the recession in the financial services industry bit hard. Over 1990-91, capital values dropped by 9.5 per cent, more steeply than any other provincial centres except Bristol. Rents for modern open plan space fell to about Pounds 20 per sq ft, down from the peak of Pounds 25 in 1991. The downturn in demand has particularly affected offices in the Georgian New Town, where an estimated 80-100 town house offices are on the market. But the city does not have an excess of modern office space, either in the city centre or in business parks. Following completion of 1.1m sq ft of new space in 1991, office building has ground to a halt. Glasgow's vacancy rate of 14 per cent is higher than that of Edinburgh's 10 per cent. The reasons behind Glasgow's surge in vacant space are twofold. First, an upturn in supply - 1.2m sq ft came onto the market in 1991 and a further 700,000 sq ft is scheduled for completion this year. Second, demand has fallen to its lowest level for eight years, according to Lambert Smith Hampton, chartered surveyors. This is partly because of the downturn in the fortunes of banking and insurance organisations, which were the biggest absorbers of office floorspace in the late 1980s. The decision of BP's exploration arm to close its Glasgow headquarters, announced in June, has also had a depressing impact on the city. But Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors, argues that prime rents in Glasgow will firm up during 1993. Only nine buildings provide more than 10,000 sq ft of space in established and recognised core addresses. The Aberdeen office market has moved in a different cycle to other Scottish cities. Having missed the development boom of the late 1980s, rental growth stimulated new development in the last two years, with completions doubling in 1991. According to Ryden, chartered surveyors, availability has risen from 166,700 sq ft in March 1991 to 430,000 sq ft in March 1992. At the same time, the agents say there is potential demand for 350,000 sq ft of quality modern office space, which is currently not available. Looking back, Scottish property has generally held its own as an investment, compared with the UK as a whole. Total returns of Scottish offices over the past 11 years have averaged 9.6 per cent a year compared with a UK average of 8.6 per cent, according to the Investment Property Databank. In the same period, industrial total returns have averaged 11.1 per cent a year, compared with a UK average return of 11.4 per cent. In the retail market, total returns on Scottish property of 8.3 per cent over the same period have lagged behind the UK's 10.8 per cent, thanks mainly to weak rental growth in the early and mid 1980s. Through 1989-90, retail returns closely matched the UK average and last year they ran above average. The key to the future of the Scottish property market lies with the economy. Over the past three years it has outperformed the rest of the UK, thanks to a resurgence of investment in the oil industry, a slight recovery in Scotland's share of world trade, its avoidance of the worst excesses of the 1980s consumer boom and growth in government spending. Most forecasts point to a weak recovery in 1992, before gathering pace in 1993. 'With the special factors which protected the Scottish economy fading in importance, Scotland is unlikely to continue outperforming the rest of the country, but it is expected to hold its own,' concluded a report recently published by Scottish Enterprise. Looking to the future, PMA, an independent property market consultancy, forecasts that rental performance in the next five years will be close to the UK average in all sectors. In the short term, it will do better than average because of less severe oversupply and a smaller fall in rents. Just as the peak of the Scottish property boom was less pronounced than its UK counterpart, so will be its trough. PMA forecasts that real office rents in Scotland in 1997 will be close to what they were in 1989, whereas in London they will move back only to their 1986 real levels.</p>

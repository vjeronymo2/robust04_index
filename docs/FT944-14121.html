			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Tour group woos stay-at-homes: Thomson is promoting its cottage industry Majorca, Florida and Tunisia are among the usual destinations promoted by Thomson, the UK's largest holiday group. Last week, however, the company launched its brochures for holidays in Ramsgate, Skipton and Blairgowrie. While 23.5m Britons went abroad last year 32.5m took holidays in the UK. Thomson, which owns the UK's largest overseas tour operator, charter airline and travel agency, decided this summer that it could no longer ignore the holidaymakers who stay at home. In August it bought Country Holidays, the largest UK holiday cottage letting company, for about Pounds 34m. The purchase could transform the holiday industry, bringing sharper marketing and better distribution to a sector that has traditionally been fragmented and poorly organised. The overseas package holiday industry is dominated by three large companies, Thomson, Airtours and First Choice. Statistics abound on who goes abroad, where they stay and how much they spend. In contrast, Mr Geoff Cowley, marketing manager of Country Holidays, says no one can be sure of the size of the market for UK self-catering accommodation. He estimates that about 4m people a year take holidays in what the industry calls 'cottages', which can be anything from converted barns to Scottish castles. Country Holidays has 5,600 properties on its books. English Country Cottages, the second largest company, has 2,800. Mr Cowley says Country Holidays, which was founded in 1979, has not grown dramatically in recent years, preferring to weed out poorer quality cottages and add better ones. Mr Tim Fullam, English Country Cottages' marketing director, says, however, that his company has grown rapidly, reflecting an increase in demand for high-quality self-catering accommodation. Founded in Norfolk in the mid-1970s to rent out a handful of cottages, the company grew from 353 properties in 1980 to 1,329 in 1985. Since then it has more than doubled in size. Neither Country Holidays nor English Country Cottages owns any properties. All the cottages on its books are owned by people who want to rent them out, but do not have the time or experience to do their own marketing or administration. Instead the companies, for a small administration charge and a commission of between 21 per cent and 25 per cent, include pictures and descriptions of the properties in their brochures. The companies take the bookings and collect the bills. Mr Fullam said some cottage owners bought their properties as a second home and wanted to rent them out in the weeks they were not using them. Others bought them as an investment or as an eventual retirement home. Some owners have several homes as part of a more substantial business. One owner on the company's books has 20. Many are farmers who have converted some of their buildings into holiday accommodation. One owner in Scotland lives in a caravan and rents out his own home. Mr Fullam says many of the properties, which are inspected at least once a year, have indoor heated swimming pools - making unreliable weather less of a deterrent to those thinking of taking UK holidays. Although both companies say that English Country Cottages is the more upmarket brand, their customer profiles are similar. The typical customer for both companies is an ABC1 holidaymaker with children. The cost of a Country Holidays cottage for six in Devon in August is Pounds 563 a week or Pounds 93.83 a person. Both companies say their customers do not generally take a UK holiday in preference to a trip abroad. Many take two holidays, one at home and one overseas. Customers from abroad account for only 5 per cent of the two companies' business. However, with a record 20m overseas visitors expected in the UK this year, both companies are now actively marketing their cottages overseas.</p>

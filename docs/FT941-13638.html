			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / A quest for the acceptable face of intervention: Andrew Adonis weighs up the competitive edge of Michael Heseltine's aims Mr Michael Heseltine's announcement of a forthcoming government white paper on competitiveness heralds no dramatic policy shift. Instead, it looks set to bring together recent public and private-sector initiatives, add a few more, and release the package with the kind of bang that no-one in the government but the trade and industry secretary seems able to create. The new policy tone came nearly two years ago, when Mr Heseltine succeeded Mr Peter Lilley at the Department of Trade and Industry. In practice, Mr Heseltine is no more interventionist than his predecessor, but he is keener to admit how much intervention takes place - and determined to focus state resources on addressing weaknesses. As he put it to a Commons committee last week: 'I have been a minister since 1970 . . . and I must tell you that all governments intervene all the time; the only question is what form it takes.' The backdrop to the white paper is deepening concern at the capacity even of top-notch UK companies to compete, particularly against rising industries in Asia. A report last year by IBM Consulting Group, part of the US computing giant, claimed from a study of 202 UK manufacturing sites that only 2 per cent were world-class, although three-quarters believed they could match the best international standards. As a first step, Mr Heseltine has given improved export promotion a high priority. He is 'signing up' ambassadors to a new approach. Where more than one UK company is bidding for a state contract abroad, the government will generally put its lobbying weight behind just one bid 'whereas before it often just stood aside'. Mr Heseltine is even expecting ambassadors and their staff to be available for video-conference briefings with people gathered in new 'Business Links' being established across the country. Electronics components producers in Swindon should be able to ask, say, the British consul in Chicago about developments in the US mid west's vehicle industry. Spreading best practice is another key theme. Two months ago the Confederation of British Industry launched a 'competitiveness forum' geared to highlighting excellence in manufacturing industry and spreading the word. Twenty companies have been designated so far; briefings by senior executives and one-day 'best practice focus sessions' are being organised with the host company vetting the guest list to avoid commercial sensitivities. US practice is a strong influence, with its 'competitiveness councils' and annual bench-marking. So far, however, Mr Heseltine's initiatives have been more limited. To date he has: Split up the DTI's trade and exports division, with 80 named officials responsible for each export market under a director-general of export promotion. Set up a competitiveness unit headed by Mr Bob Dobbie, which is working with trade associations to 'benchmark' industrial sectors against their counterparts abroad. The results, unpublished, are said to make depressing reading. Established 'Business Links' as local outlets for DTI services currently handled by its nine regional offices, also tapping the resources of local Chambers of Commerce and Training and Enterprise Councils. As yet only four have been set up, the largest of which is in Birmingham. But the target is 200 within two years. But how much conviction is there that the new structures will make a difference? At last week's Commons trade and industry committee meeting, Mr Heseltine was asked, from his experience as an entrepreneur in the 1960s, what the government could have done to help him. 'Abolish the DTI,' came the reply.</p>

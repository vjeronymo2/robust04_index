			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Women rule the brainwaves Women have made up the bulk of the recruits who have helped to expand British universities in the past five years, government figures released today show, John Authers writes. Last year women were for the first time more likely than men to move on from school to higher education. Female participation in full-time and part-time education outstrips that of males at the ages of both 16 and 17. But traditional attitudes are still present in the subjects which women study. Only 1.6 per cent of 18-year-old women attempt A-level physics compared with 6 per cent of 18-year-old men, and more men than women take mathematics. Business studies A-level is now more popular with women, however. This is yet to be reflected in industry recruitment, where men are more than twice as likely as women to be recruited. Among recruits to the teaching profession there are almost three times as many women as men. Statistical Bulletin on Women in Post-Compulsory Education.

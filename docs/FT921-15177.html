			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Brittan warns against devaluation THE BATTLE to defend the pound was joined yesterday by Sir Leon Brittan, European Community competition commissioner, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. Both men warned of the dangers of a sterling devaluation, writes Peter Marsh. Sir Leon, a former cabinet minister, said devaluation could add two percentage points to UK interest rates, while Mr Hurd said such an option would be 'defeatist'. Their comments helped reduce pressure in foreign exchange markets on sterling, which for much of this week has traded close to its effective floor in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), partly because of worries about the UK economy. Sterling was also helped by currency investors switching large volumes of funds out of D-Marks and into dollars, a development prompted by indications that the German economy might be slowing and activity in the US picking up. The weaker D-Mark eased strains on all other ERM currencies, with sterling closing in London at DM2.84, up a pfennig on the day and comfortably above its effective ERM limit of about DM2.832. The dollar closed at DM1.5825, a rise of nearly 7 pfennigs in two days. In New York, sterling slipped back to close at DM2.8298, while the dollar strengthened slightly to DM1.5845. Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, has ruled out a devaluation, which some believe would aid exports and allow a cut in interest rates. However, nagging concern among currency investors, especially in the US, about such a possibility has been one factor stopping the pound gaining strength. Sir Leon, speaking in Exeter, supported the government's line. He said people calling for a devaluation were 'voices from a discredited past'. He said that sticking with the current ERM bands was the best way to ensure a 'sound and lasting recovery'. During the past week, sterling lost 1 1/2 pfennigs, leading to speculation that a further slide might require the Bank of England to intervene in currency markets. Mr David Brown, a currency analyst at Swiss Bank Corporation in London, said: 'The Bank has been on amber alert all week, but so far the drama hasn't turned into a crisis.' One factor reducing tension about sterling's fragility is that the pound's effective ERM floor is set by the peseta, the system's strongest currency. If investors were to sell the pound in high volumes, the limit could relatively easily be brought down by selling pesetas, a lightly traded unit. According to this view, alarm bells at the Bank and the Treasury about sterling would ring only when the pound fell close to the bottom of its 6 per cent ERM band against its central DM2.95 rate - an 'ultimate floor' of about DM2.78, some 6 pfennigs beneath last night's close.

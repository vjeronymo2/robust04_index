			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> What's June going to be like without basketball? . . .  </P> <P> Now Magic Johnson knows how Michael Jordan felt when he was strictly a one-man  team. . . .  </P> <P> But give the Phoenix Suns high marks. They could have thrown in the towel and  looked ahead to Game 6 at home when they fell behind by 15 points in the first  quarter Tuesday at the Forum. . . .  </P> <P> Who did the Suns think they were in the first quarter when they shot five for  21 from the floor, James Worthy? . . .  </P> <P> Phoenix shut up an audience that was so hyped that it booed Kurt Rambis during  the pregame introductions. . . .  </P> <P> For the first time since they came into the league in the 1979-80 season,  neither Magic Johnson nor Larry Bird will be playing in the NBA finals. . . .  </P> <P> If he develops into a force, young Shawn Kemp will make new Seattle SuperSonic  Coach K.C. Jones look like a genius. . . .  </P> <P> Larry Holmes' former trainer, Richie Giachetti, will help Mike Tyson. Giachetti  is a pro who isn't afraid to get tough with his fighters. . . .  </P> <P> Los Angeles heavyweight Mark Wills will try to repeat his 1986 upset victory  over Greg Page on the Pernell Whitaker-Azumah Nelson undercard at Caesars  Palace Saturday. . . .  </P> <P> Nelson, the WBC junior-lightweight champion who is moving up a division against  Whitaker, has even bigger game in mind. "I'm not just preparing for Whitaker,"  he said. "I'm preparing for Julio Cesar Chavez or Meldrick Taylor or even Mark  Breland." . . .  </P> <P> Fernando Valenzuela's pitching and hitting against Montreal the other night  brought to mind the time he did it all in a game during the Fernandomania  season of 1981. Well, just about all. "I was not happy with my running," he  told a translator in the special interview room. . . .  </P> <P> Bill Bene, the Dodgers' first draft choice in June, 1988, continues to make  Nuke LaLoosh look like a control artist. Bene has walked 37 batters in 27 2/3  innings with Vero Beach of the Florida State League this season. . . .  </P> <P> What's that about Dave Winfield becoming the spiritual leader of the Angels?  Newsday columnist Steve Jacobson, on Winfield's years with the Yankees: "He  lived in his own locker. Smart as he is, it isn't his nature to reach out and  make others around him better." . . .  </P> <P> The Angels and Kansas City figured to be contenders this season -- but not for  last place. . . .  </P> <P> It won't be quite the same at Wrigley Field if they don't let Harry Caray lead  the crowd in singing, "Take Me Out to the Ballgame," during the seventh-inning  stretch at the All-Star game. . . .  </P> <P> The success of the Pittsburgh Pirates has obscured the revival of  Pennsylvania's other National League East team, the Philadelphia Phillies. . .  .  </P> <P> Crazy Charley Kerfeld has replaced Mitch (Wild Man) Williams as the most  colorful relief pitcher in baseball. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Kerfeld and John Candy. . . .  </P> <P> Thirteen Dodgers, including the deactivated Kirk Gibson and Ray Searage, used  to play in the American League. . . .  </P> <P> Few outfielders make better sliding catches than Andy Van Slyke. . . .  </P> <P> Mariano Duncan should feel at home on the disabled list. . . .  </P> <P> Volleyball players are among the most skilled of athletes. . . .  </P> <P> Jennifer Capriati should adjust well to grass courts, but look for an older  woman such as Monica Seles to be the surprise of Wimbledon. . . .  </P> <P> A TV movie about the hockey-playing Mullen brothers from New York's Hell's  Kitchen is in the works. . . .  </P> <P> Two Czechs, center Petr Nedved and left wing Jaromir Jagr, could go one-two in  the NHL amateur draft. . . .  </P> <P> The NHL won't be truly major league until it gets a big-time national TV  contract. . . .  </P> <P> ESPN has offered former Pitt football coach Mike Gottfried an analyst's job for  next season. . . .  </P> <P> UCLA forward Don MacLean leaves today for Colorado Springs and tryouts for the  U.S. amateur basketball team that will play in the Goodwill Games and other  international tournaments. . . .  </P> <P> It's looking more and more as if USC will finally get an on-campus basketball  arena. Blueprints of a 10,000-seat facility are being circulated. . . .  </P> <P> USC will play host to the NCAA men's tennis championships beginning Friday at  the Hyatt Grand Champions in Indian Wells. Stanford, the two-time defending  champion, is seeded second behind Tennessee. The Vols are led by Doug Flach,  brother of Ken. . . .  </P> <P> Kentucky Jazz, who will run in the Preakness Saturday, was bred in Texas. . . .  </P> <P> My favorite race car drivers are Lake Speed and Scott Goodyear.  </P></p>

"Our  speakers put the arguments in more easily understandable terms, and the public  has an opportunity to ask questions."  </P> <P> The first of the six pro-and-con sessions, which -- like the league's upcoming  candidate forums -- are free to the public, is scheduled at the American Legion  Hall in Ventura on Thursday at 12:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Other programs are scheduled at the Thousand Oaks Library, Oct. 22 at 7 p.m.;  the Ojai Presbyterian Church, Oct. 23 at 9:30 a.m.; the United Methodist Church  in Santa Paula, Oct. 24 at 7 p.m.; Ventura City Hall, Oct. 25 at 7:30 p.m.; and  the Simi Valley Library, Oct. 26 at 7 p.m. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER  </P></p>

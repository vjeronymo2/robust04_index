			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TROUPE LEADER SEES LESSON OF HOPE IN 'EDUCATING RITA';  </P> <P> THEATER: DON LAFFOON OF THE STOP-GAP DRAMA-THERAPY GROUP SEES THE COMEDY AS  SHOWING HOW TO GO FROM VICTIM TO SURVIVOR.  </P> <P> Rita, the nearly illiterate but spirited London hairdresser of Willy Russell's  "Educating Rita," is a woman hemmed in by circumstance. Uneducated, unexplored  and with a husband who prefers a wife at home and pregnant, she lives a life of  noisy desperation.  </P> <P> In short, Rita's the type of woman that Don Laffoon and Stop-Gap, the Santa  Ana-based drama therapy troupe he runs, can relate to.  </P> <P> By choosing "Educating Rita" as Stop-Gap's latest production (opening a  two-week run today at the Curtis Theatre in Brea as part of the Festival of  Britain arts-retail promotion), Laffoon hopes to send a message to troubled or  disadvantaged women that life is not as bleak as they may think. The group's  work with Orange County clinics for battered women was inspirational in  deciding to mount the play, he added.  </P> <P> Rita is a valuable symbol because she finds a chance for fulfillment by  aggressively pursuing higher learning, which Laffoon believes is as good a  start as any.  </P> <P> "To me it's all about women making choices," he said. "We can choose between  sitting down and feeling sorry for ourselves or moving from victim to survivor.  I'm not saying it's easy, but you have to take that first step."  </P> <P> In "Educating Rita" -- which had its London premiere in 1980 and became a film  starring Michael Caine and Julie Walters in 1983 -- Rita eagerly enrolls in a  tutorial program where her mentor and tormentor is the sodden Frank, a  professor and burnout case if ever there was one. It's something of a take on  the "Pygmalion" tale, played for both humor and pathos.  </P> <P> Rita finds self-awareness and opportunity, while Frank is rejuvenated by her  earthiness and determination. There's sexual tension and a hint of romance, but  it's all ambiguous and doesn't get in the way of Russell's main theme of  personal expression and social and educational snobbery.  </P> <P> "Educating Rita" maintains an amusing tone, a fact Laffoon finds refreshing.  Stop-Gap (and Laffoon, who directs the productions) is associated with  primarily serious (some might even say didactic) "message" plays, but Laffoon  believes "Educating Rita" can't be placed in that category.  </P> <P> "Happily, it's a comedy. You know, we're famous for doing plays on topics like  incest, and I can hear people saying something like 'Oh no, Laffoon is doing  something depressing again.' Well, this isn't anything like that."  </P> <P> Still, Laffoon has been careful not to gloss over the play's implications. To  underscore the challenges Rita faces, he has cast a black actress (Kendahl  Thompson of Los Angeles) in a role customarily played by a white. Her co-star,  Christopher Ward of Los Angeles, is white.  </P> <P> "I didn't think it changed the play, but added a welcome, more interesting  texture," Laffoon explained. "'Educating Rita" was first done in the early  '80s, but now it's the '90s, a time when all women are emerging, but especially  minority women. To me, it was a decision that made perfect sense."  </P> <P>  Willy Russell's "Educating Rita" will be performed Friday and Saturday at 8  p.m. and Nov. 1 through 3 and 8 and 9 at 8 p.m., with 2:30 p.m. matinees Sunday  and Nov. 4 at the Curtis Theatre, 1 Civic Center Circle, Brea. Tickets: $12 and  $15. Information: (714) 990-7722.  </P> <P> </P></p>

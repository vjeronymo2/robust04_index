			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RANGERS SAY THEY'LL BRING RYAN BACK  </P> <P> The Texas Rangers exercised a $3.3-million contract option on Nolan Ryan for  the 1991 season.  </P> <P> "Nolan has made a tremendous contribution to the Rangers the last two years,  and we are looking forward to his being with the ballclub next year," General  Manager Tom Grieve said.  </P> <P> Ryan, 43, was 13-9 with a 3.44 ERA in 30 starts in 1990. He led the American  League with 232 strikeouts and held opponents to a .188 batting average, lowest  in the major leagues.  </P> <P> Ryan had a strong second half despite failing to get run support and winning  just two of his last 11 starts.  </P> <P> He pitched his record sixth no-hitter against Oakland on June 7 and became the  20th pitcher to reach 300 victories with a win July 31 in Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Ryan and the Rangers agreed on terms for the 1991 option last April.  </P></p>

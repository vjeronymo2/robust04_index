			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Food and Drink: A nicer crowd in Hitler's old haunt - Giles MacDonogh visits a Weimar hotel with a colourful past Weimar is unique. Elsewhere in Germany or Italy there are small towns filled with palaces, but none has the literary associations of Weimar. Almost everyone who was anyone in German literature spent some time there and many made it their permanent home. In spite of a couple of senseless American bombing raids in the last month of the second world war, their relics are still there: you may still drop in on Schiller in the morning, see Goethe before lunch and visit Nietzsche in the afternoon. Even under the old East German regime, Weimar enjoyed special privileges. The presence of the National Theatre made it a sort of German Stratford-upon-Avon. Those who went were often compelled by the vagaries of East German transport to stay the night. Unlike other East German towns there were plenty of places serving solid Thuringian food. Since what the Germans now call 'the change', the food has improved beyond measure. Arriving in a snowbound Weimar between Christmas and the New Year I dropped in on the Weisse Schwan, the restaurant which Goethe so warmly commended and which stands next to his house on the Frauenplan. One west German gastronomic magazine has included it among the country's 'best tables'. I certainly enjoyed a seasonal roast goose with a fine, crunchy consistency, served with Thuringian dumplings and shredded Savoy cabbage. Apart from a few, cheap Italian restaurants-cum-pizzerias, most of Weimar's tables existed before 1989. There is even, in the shadow of Herder's church, a famous fish restaurant which does a thousand different things to herrings. One newcomer with a distinctly western liveliness about it is Zum Zwiebel in the Teichgasse. The owners bought this old building for a song a couple of years ago and turned it into the town's best pub-restaurant. The food is wholesome and unpretentious. I liked my Soljanka soup: a spicy potion from the Ukraine introduced to the East Germans by the Soviets. I sometimes think that the recipe for Soljanka soup will be the only positive achievement the Soviet Union leaves behind. I followed up the soup with a good, earthy, pork knuckle. Another place where one may eat local specialities is in the Elephantenkeller on the Market Square. Here the dishes are more refined, and the vaulted cellar with its stone arches is a rather more impressive setting. Here is the place for red lentil soup and Thuringian Bratwurst with mashed peas. Decent wines are served in 20cl jugs. The Elephantenkeller is underneath the Hotel Elephant, one of Weimar's two famous old hotels. The other is the Russischer Hof on Goetheplatz. But, while the present owners of the Elephant have spent millions of D-Marks putting the hotel back on its feet, no such rehabilitation has taken place at the Russischer Hof. The menu in the main dining room may exhibit some of the trappings of 'modern' German cooking; but the drab decoration, the coffee, the poor orange juice and, above all, the sharp practices of the waitresses in the breakfast room, made me more grateful that I was paying that little bit more to stay at the Elephant. Both the Russischer Hof and the Elephant are hotels with fabulous pasts; but in our century it is the Elephant's story which has been the richer of the two. The reason is simple enough: the Elephant was Adolf Hitler's favourite, and it still bears his stamp. Even in the early years Hitler stayed at the Elephant and nothing changed after he achieved power in January 1933. On Schiller's 175th birthday, November 10 1934, Hitler arrived to celebrate the occasion in Weimar. Two days later the Nazi Volkische Beobachter newspaper reported: 'The Fuhrer lodged as always at the Hotel Elefant (sic) in the Market Square which, until the late hours of the evening was surrounded by a solid wall of people.' That was the old Elephant, a building which dated back to 1521. In 1937, Fritz Sauckel, Gauleiter of Thuringia and later organiser of wartime slave labour, reported to Hitler that the Elephant was in danger of falling down. Hitler decided that the old hotel should not be restored, but replaced by a new building constructed by Hermann Giesler, architect of the Adolf Hitlerplatz in Weimar, It is well known that Hitler was passionate about architecture, but just how large a role he played in the designing of the Elephant is revealed in Giesler's autobiography. The architect was summoned to Berlin to receive the commission. Hitler wanted a modern hotel 'which expresses our feelings about life', he said. It had to have a large hall, dining rooms and, facing on to the garden, a large, light breakfast room which could serve for parties and be used together with the hall. The hotel was to have all the 'requisite comforts . . . it should combine elegance with solid execution in all its details,' said Hitler. It was to be an up-to-date hotel with lifts, and telephones and wireless sets in every room. Turning to his Gauleiter he added: 'Sauckel, make sure that the prices of the rooms remain low. Even if I don't drink alcohol myself I feel a hotel bar is necessary. It could be placed in the cellar. It goes without saying that there should be a cellar restaurant with its own kitchen for preparing simple dishes.' Hitler even demanded that the Elephantenkeller should be accessible from both the hotel and the street. It still is. The new 'Haus Elephant' reopened its doors in November 1938. Hitler came down to look at the hotel and his flat overlooking the garden at the back. When Giesler went to see him he had purloined a little Cranach from the museum to hang in his room. 'Giesler, the name is fitting. It is not just a hotel, it is a house in which I am happy to live.' The Elephant has not changed much, except that you meet a nicer crowd of people there these days. In clearing away the debris of the past, the new owners - Flamberg Hotels - unwittingly pointed up the Giesler-Hitler creation: the black marble surrounds to the portals have been put back. Busts in the hallway add to the 1930s feel of the place. Only here and there a little of that art which Hitler would have called 'degenerate' has been hung on the walls. In the main hall, a strict double cube, comic strip scenes from Wagner's Ring have been painted in the panels of what is now called the 'Richard Wagnersaal'. It was there that I spent new year's eve. At first with an elderly couple, she from Halle he from Oppenheim-am-Rhein. Then I was moved to a table occupied by three strong silent types from Dortmund who did not cheer up until the third bottle of Franconian wine. Latterly I was joined by four Americans and the party began to swing. A couple of actors performed scenes from Goethe and, while we ate, a band played popular tunes of the type which Richard Wagner would have paid to avoid. Still, it fitted the mood of the occasion. When the bells were rung at midnight we went out on to the balcony from where Hitler once hectored the crowd in the market place. But on December 31 1993 we put it to better use as we watched the festive fireworks break over Weimar's night sky. It was a late night. When I awoke I found that the hotel had left a tray in my room. On it I found a bottle of mineral water, an Alka Seltzer and a little, pink marzipan pig. 'The pig brings good luck,' one of the Dortmunders had told me. I could not see it doing anything for my stomach. The present owners of the Elephant might wish to play down Hitler's role in designing the new hotel and choose instead to remember the other worthies who graced its beds and public rooms: Goethe, Schiller, Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner and Thomas Mann; but Hitler's contribution is also part of Weimar's extraordinary story, and they should realise an elephant never forgets.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / The Week in Luxembourg: ECJ upholds UK benefit rules THE ECJ has upheld UK state pension rules which discriminate in favour of women. Under UK legislation, men must contribute to the state scheme for 44 years for a full pension, whereas women need only contribute for 39 years; men have to contribute to the scheme if they are employed between the ages of 60 and 64, whereas women do not. The ECJ held that such discrimination was lawful as EC law permitted exceptions to the general rule of non-discrimination in this area, but only insofar as such exceptions were necessary in order to achieve the objectives of EC social security legislation and only on a temporary basis. The Court also stated that an enforced change of the national rules now would lead to financial disequilibrium of the UK pension scheme. Case 9/91: The Queen v secretary of state for social security ex parte the Equal Opportunities Commission, ECJ FC, July 7 1992. National waste provisions overturned In a case which provoked environmental concern, Belgium was found to have breached EC obligations by a regional Wallonian degree banning waste from other member states. EC legislation sets out procedures for the transhipment of hazardous waste; the Wallonian decree went beyond these rules and was thus unlawful. However, the ban did not breach general EC waste provisions, where states still have residual competence. Belgium is thus in the anomalous position of being able to ban imports of non-toxic waste, but not of toxic waste. The Court also found that the Rome Treaty provisions on free movement of goods applied in principle to waste. Arguments that the national provisions were discriminatory against non-Belgian waste and thus unlawful were rejected, the Court citing Basle Convention obligations on self-sufficiency and proximity in waste elimination to justify the difference in treatment. C-2/90: Commission v Belgium, ECJ FC, July 9 1992. UK immigration law unlawful UK immigration rules were ruled unlawful by the ECJ as conflicting with EC provisions on free movement. Mr Singh, an Indian national married to a British citizen, worked with his wife in Germany for two years before returning to England. On the basis of pending divorce proceedings between them, the UK authorities refused Mr Singh indefinite leave to remain in the UK. He stayed beyond the time allowed and a deportation order was made against him. He appealed, arguing that he had a Community right to stay in the UK as the spouse of a Community national. Under Rome Treaty provisions, Community nationals are entitled to reside and work anywhere within the EC. As these rights would be restricted if obstacles to the entry and residence of their existing spouses/children were raised by domestic provisions, the Court held the UK provisions unlawful. C-370/90: The Queen v Immigration Appeal Tribunal and Surinder Singh, ex parte home secretary, ECJ FC, July 7 1992. Spanish immigration law unlawful Spanish rules on dual nationality, whereby nationality is based on the last habitual residence, were held to be unlawful by the ECJ insofar as they conflicted with EC rules on establishment and the provision of services. Mr Micheletti, a dual national of Argentina and Italy, studied at university in Argentina and then came to Spain to work. He was refused a residence permit on the grounds that he was an Argentine and had last been resident in Argentina. On a reference for a preliminary ruling, the ECJ held that although member states were allowed to set their own rules on nationality, these rules had to respect EC law. Thus, where an individual had Community rights because he was a Community national, these rights could not be restricted by domestic provisions. C-369/90: Mario Vincente Micheletti and others v Delagacion del Govierno en Cantabria, ECJ FC, July 7 1992. Belgian social security law upheld The restriction of state disability allowances to Belgian nationals was upheld by the ECJ on the grounds that it did not infringe relevant EC rules. While living in Belgium, the Iranian wife of an Italian national tried to claim a disability allowance from the Belgian state on the basis that as the spouse of an EC national, she was entitled to benefits available in the member state where she resided. The Court did not accept this argument, stating that her rights to EC social security allowances were restricted to those she could receive as a member of the family of an EC national. As the spouse was seeking the allowance in her own right and not by virtue of being the spouse of a Community national, the relevant EC rules were not applicable. C-243: Belgium v Noushin Taghavi, ECJ 1CH, July 8 1992. Other cases Italy was held in breach of its Rome Treaty obligations, having failed to implement two directives relating to threadworm and brucellosis in due time. C-270/91: Commission v Italy, ECJ FC, July 8 1992. Milk quotas can lawfully be denied to farmers who have let out their land prior to demanding their quota, as it is the tenant and not the original farmer who has the use of the land and therefore the right to the quota. C-236/90: Reinhard Maier v Freistaat Bayern, ECJ 3CH, July 9 1992. A minimum level of value added tax levied on second-hand cars sold in Belgium was found to be contrary to EC VAT provisions in that it would lead to VAT being charged twice on the same good. C-131/91: BV 'K' Line Air Service Europe v NV Eularts &amp; Belgium, ECJ 6CH, July 9 1992. A German worker who worked in the UK, paid national insurance contributions and received unemployment benefit there, was entitled, on her return to Germany, to unemployment benefit in Germany. The Court emphasised, however, that such benefits could not be cumulated. C-102: Doris Knock v Bundesanstalt fur Arbeit, ECJ 4CH, July 8 1992. This completes the reports for this term. Judgments delivered in the vacation will be reported later.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / EU call on justice procedure The Belgian presidency of the European Union has called for a serious pan-European debate on the sensitive question of how to harmonise national extradition procedures within the Union. EU justice ministers discussed extradition at their meeting yesterday. EU leaders will consider the issue at their summit in Brussels next week. Mr Melchior Wathelet, Belgian justice minister, said: 'We have to clean up our extradition laws. We have adopted a resolution saying that all our taboos must be put on the table for negotiation.' He said in some countries extradition laws were more than a century old and needed to be reformed to take into account political and legal changes. For example, Belgian extradition requests are rejected by certain EU member states because Belgium retains the death penalty, although it is never used. He hoped there could be some overall agreement to modify national extradition rules by the end of 1994. EU justice ministers also agreed that plans to broaden the scope of Europol, the new Europe-wide police unit, should be finalised by October.</p>

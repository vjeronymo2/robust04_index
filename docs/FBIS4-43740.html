			<p>BFN     [Text] Helsinki, June 20 (AFP) -- The tiny Christian Party  in Finland's center-right coalition government, headed by Prime  Minister Esko Aho, decided on Monday [20 Jun] to leave the  cabinet after differences of opinion over European Union [EU]  membership.    Toini Kankaanniemi, minister for development aid and the  party's only representative in cabinet, submitted his  resignation to the premier after Aho denied him the right to  vote against the government during a ballot to decide who would  sign the country's EU membership agreement this weekend in Corfu.    The parliamentary group of the Christian Party decided later  to leave the government and refrain from naming a new minister.    All seven members of the party in the 200-member parliament  oppose Finland's plans to join the EU.    Last week the government defeated a no-confidence motion on  its plans to join the EU next year, with members of the  Christian Party abstaining.    The government, which was set up in April 1991 after general  elections, also includes Aho's Centre Party (former Agrarian  Party), the Conservatives and the Swedish Party, representing  the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland.    With the withdrawal of the Christian Party, the government  has backing from 108 MPs.</p>

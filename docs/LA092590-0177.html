			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> REVISED GNP DATA SHOWS SLOW GROWTH;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE REPORT OF A 0.4% GAIN IN THE SECOND QUARTER FURTHER FUELS FEARS OF  A RECESSION.  </P> <P> The economy grew at a barely perceptible 0.4% annual rate during the second  quarter, an even worse performance than first believed, the government said  today. Many analysts believe that it is sliding into a recession.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department's revised report on the gross national product -- the  total output of the nation's goods and services -- was the lowest since an 0.3%  rate was posted in the final quarter of 1989.  </P> <P> It was a reminder of how precarious the economy was even before Iraq invaded  Kuwait on Aug. 2, resulting in a dramatic increase in the price of oil.  </P> <P> At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the drop in  economic growth "is certainly cause for concern."  </P> <P> "It's not good news. The number is very low," Fitzwater said. "Obviously we are  concerned about the economy and the growth rate.  </P> <P> "We don't believe we are in a recession right now," he added.  </P> <P> Since oil is used in producing so many consumer goods as well as for heating  and transportation, any price increase not only slashes available funds needed  to feed economic growth but also fuels inflation.  </P> <P> Both of the department's two earlier estimates put economic growth at a  lackluster 1.2% rate from April through June. The final revision was due to  lower inventories and smaller exports than first believed.  </P> <P> The GNP rose at a 1.7% annual rate in the first quarter, down from 2.5% in 1989  and 4.5% in 1988.  </P> <P> At the same time, a price index tied to the GNP was unchanged at an annual rate  of 3.9%. But with the surge in oil prices, inflation as measured in the  Consumer Price Index jumped 0.8% in August alone and the higher prices will be  reflected in the third-quarter GNP.  </P> <P> The price of oil before the Iraqi invasion was less than $20 a barrel. It  posted a record $38 a barrel on Monday.  </P> <P> Many economists say the Persian Gulf crisis may be the death sentence for an  economic expansion lasting nearly eight years since the 1981-82 recession.  </P> <P> Half of the top economists surveyed each month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators  now believe that the economy will enter a recession this year.  </P></p>

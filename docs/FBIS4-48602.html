			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 22 SAPA -- The African National  Congress's parliamentary caucus on Sunday evening elected ANC  Secretary-General Mr Cyril Ramaphosa to chair South Africa's  Constitutional Assembly which is to draw up the country's final  constitution.    Ms Bridgit Mabandla is to be the ANC's nomination for deputy  chair, but this post may still, in terms of government of  national unity considerations, be given to a National Party  member.    The Constitutional Assembly -- consisting of senators and  National Assembly members -- is to be constituted at Parliament  on Tuesday morning.    ANC Chief Whip Mr Arnold Stofile told a press briefing after  the caucus meeting that Mr Ramaphosa would act as a "political  rudder" to ensure the principles laid down in the interim  constitution, as well as the ANC's own principles, were adhered  to.    Mr Ramaphosa had been earmarked for the position "all  along".  He would also remain ANC secretary-general, Mr Stofile said.    The caucus had also decided to appoint its own sub-committee  into political office-bearer's remuneration.    The view that the Melamet Commission had proposed high  salaries for politicians was "not an accurate reflection", Mr  Stofile said. "We think the proposals are not market-related."    Caucus hoped the cabinet would move fast in appointing a  commission into the matter, proposed by the Melamet Commission.    Mr Stofile said on average no MP would earn more than 10,000  rand a month. "I don't think that's market-related."    Salaries could even be higher, he said.    The deputy minister of finance, Mr Alec Erwin, and MP Mr  Raymond Suttner would serve on the ANC's sub-committee into the  matter.    -- Mr Themba Msimang was elected caucus chairman.</p>

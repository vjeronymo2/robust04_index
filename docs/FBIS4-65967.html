			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. Kiriakidhis] </F>   [Excerpt] Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller assured the  British and U.S. Governments that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf  Denktas will finally give a positive answer on the  confidence-building measures.    According to I MAKHI's information, a diplomatic source in  Nicosia (from a country that is a permanent UN Security Council  member) said the message has already been conveyed to the Greek  Cypriot side to calm concerns created by the delay in the  submission of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report.  British officials believe Denktas will accept the 21 March UN  document on the confidence-building measures and express this  position openly.    During a dinner on 23 May for Greek Cypriot political  leaders, British Deputy Foreign Secretary Tom Richardson  revealed that at the end of the past week the Turkish side asked  for a 10-day deadline to give Denktas the chance to "manipulate"  his "sudden" change toward accepting the measures. The British  official even asked the party leaders or representatives for  their views on how the talks procedure can move to the next  stage, that is, discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue.  He asked the leaders for their views on Butrus-Ghali's set of  ideas, which the United Nations considers the basis for talks on  the substance of the Cyprus issue.    According to I MAKHI, despite the assurances that the  Cypriot  Government received, it remains dissatisfied and disappointed  with the supportive stance that it believes the United States is  showing. The Greek Cypriot side believes the U.S. stance is  encouraging Turkish intransigence and facilitating Turkish  maneuvers. It also expresses strong concerns that Denktas will  finally accept the confidence-building measures "with  conditions" (something that is categorically rejected).    Yesterday, for the first time in public and after a week's  delay, U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia Richard Boucher described as  false Turkish Cypriot press reports that at the Vienna talks,  Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special coordinator on  the Cyprus issue, submitted new proposals that change the 21  March document. I MAKHI reported yesterday that during his  meeting with Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis the day before  yesterday, the U.S. ambassador made the same explicit denial.    Speaking at the U.S. stand at the International State Fair,  the U.S. ambassador mentioned that an effort was made in Vienna  to understand the confidence-building measures and overcome the  obstacles. He noted that the United States insists on  implementing the confidence-building measures, adding that the  ongoing efforts include studying alternative ways of action for  accepting the package.

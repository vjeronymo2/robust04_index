			<p>BFN     [Text] The evacuation of foreigners has started. The  United Nations is evacuating its staff to Bujumbura and Nairobi.  For its part, Kigali has started a real race against time to  try and contain the situation, which is slowly returning to  normal in the Rwandan capital. However, the peace accord signed  between the government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] on  4 August appears to be in doubt. From Kigali, Thomas Kamilindi  reports.    [Begin Kamilindi recording] The cease-fire seems to have  been  enforced in the capital since 8 April. But for how long? It's  difficult to tell. Hostilities seem to have resumed in Mutara  in the northeast of the country and in the northern Ruhengeri  region between RPF and government troops beyond the  demilitarized area [word indistinct] government positions.    According to a communique from the RPF, a column of at least  20,000 men are moving to within 100 km of the capital. But a  spokesman of the Kigali Army staff headquarters says it is a  whimsical deception. The government has strongly urged the RPF  to stop its war mentality and to favor dialogue in order to  establish a broad-based transitional government within six  weeks, as demanded by Resolution 909 of the UN Security Council.

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: European operations fall into loss FORD'S European automotive operations, including Jaguar, the UK luxury car maker, registered a net loss of Dollars 82m in the first quarter of 1993 compared with a net profit of Dollars 84m in the corresponding period a year ago. Excluding Jaguar, Ford of Europe net profits plunged by 92.3 per cent to only Dollars 19m in the first quarter from Dollars 246m a year earlier, chiefly under the the impact of a precipitous fall in new car sales in west Europe. New car demand in west Europe in the first three months fell by around 17 per cent to 3.06m, according to industry estimates. Ford forecast yesterday a fall of 12 per cent for the full year. Ford vehicle sales in Europe, at 436,122 in the first quarter, were 13 per cent lower than a year ago. Ford said that its European financial performance had also been hit by unfavourable exchange rate movements - in particular between the lira and the D-Mark - which had reduced pre-tax profits by around Dollars 100m, and by heavy product launch costs for the new Mondeo family car, which has replaced the Sierra. The US carmaker said that Jaguar had reduced its losses in the first quarter by 40 per cent to Dollars 56m from Dollars 93m a year ago due to increased sales volumes, in particular in the US. Jaguar sales rose by 16 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter to 6,374, helped by a 29 per cent rise in the US to 2,561, and increases in Germany, Switzerland, the UK and Belgium. Ford's European automotive operations also took a charge in the first quarter of Dollars 45m for interest and goodwill write-offs arising from its 1989 takeover of Jaguar. Ford, which suffered a record loss last year of Dollars 1.3bn on its European automotive operations, said that its objective was to break even this year, excluding Jaguar. This target would be difficult to achieve, however, if sales continued to fall steeply.</p>

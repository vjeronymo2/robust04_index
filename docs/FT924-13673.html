			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US water plan could leave crops high and dry - Reform proposals that are pitting farmers against environmentalists CALIFORNIAN growers stand to loose a significant portion of the federally subsidised water supplies they use for irrigation if President Bush signs into law a Bill that was passed by the US congress last week. The Dollars 2.4bn Omnibus Water Bill provides funding for numerous politically popular projects including dams and canals in Colorado, Utah , Arizona and other states. In California, however, it is highly controversial, pitting the interests of agriculture against those of urban water users and environmentalists. The primary impact of the Bill would be to reallocate water supplies from growers in the prime San Joaquin Valley growing region to environmental projects. Cities would also gain access to federally subsidised water supplies. The legislation addresses a century-long battle over water rights in California between agricultural and urban interests. At present farmers use about 85 per cent of the state's water while city residents and other businesses face severe water rationing after six years of drought. The Bill would reform allocation of water supplies from the Central Valley Project, a massive system of 20 dams and miles of canals built by the federal government in the late 1930s, which transports water from Northern California to the Central Valley, where it is used to irrigate about 3m acres of farmland. The system processes about one-fifth of the state's water supply. The Bill would reserve 800,000 acre/feet of water per year, or roughly 10 per cent of the water the project delivers in a year of normal rainfall, to be used to replenish river flows and reservoir levels and to restore fish and water fowl habitats. If the drought continues, however, the impact upon farmers could be far more severe, according to the CVP Water Association. 'We calculate that 2m acres would have received no CVP water last year and this year if the Bill's regulations had been in place,' says Mr Jason Peltier, president of the CVP Water Association. The Bill would also raise farmers' costs by imposing a Dollars 50m surcharge to pay for fish and wildlife restoration projects. In addition it would reduce federal subsidies and introduce a tiered pricing system designed to encourage conservation. Farmers now pay as little as Dollars 3.50 per acre/foot for CVP water compared with market rates of about Dollars 150. Farmers would, however, be enabled under the terms of the proposed Bill to sell excess water supplies to drought-parched cities and other industries. Agricultural interests opposed to the Bill claim that it would cost Dollars 4bn in lost income for the state's farmers. 'Federal water cutbacks will mean idled acreage, thousands of lost jobs and increases in food prices,' warns Mr Bob Vice, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation. The farmers , traditionally strong Republican supporters, are urging President Bush to veto the Bill. They acknowledge, however, that they face an uphill battle and that political expediency may override the president's desire to help them. Mr Manuel Lujan, the Secretary of the Interior, and Mr Edward Madigan, the Agriculture Secretary, have also said that they would urge a veto, as has California's Republican governor, Mr Pete Wilson. The Bill 'would dramatically reallocate 20 per cent of our state's water, strike a vicious economic blow to California, and create a second century of California water wars whose only winners will be the litigators,' Governor Wilson claims. The immediate problem facing Californian growers is difficulty in raising loans. 'Lenders are saying that they will only finance growers who have alternative sources of water in view of the uncertainties about CVP supplies,' says Mr Peltier. However, the reforms have broad support from business and environmental groups in California. 'We are extremely hopeful the president will promptly sign this legislation,' said Mr Carl Boronkay, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which serves 15m residents of Los Angeles and surrounding cities. 'With a stroke of his pen the president can give a shot in the arm to California's economy, as well as a much-needed environmental boost.'</p>

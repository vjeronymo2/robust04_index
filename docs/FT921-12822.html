			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): An honest man bides his time - Gestetner has taken a tumble. But in a general price fall, the good tends to go down with the bad and the over-priced YOU ARE an honest man, a man of integrity,' said the Chinese soothsayer at Wong Tai Sin Temple, in Hong Kong. He had been trying to bend back my thumbs. As the thumbs remained straight and unbent this was, supposedly, a sign of utmost honesty. As a result of trying to live up to the soothsayer's expectations, I have saved a lot of money. Shares that are mentioned favourably by newspaper columnists quite often rise in price, as a result of market makers expecting people to follow those recommendations (and thus marking up the price) and/or people actually buying the shares. Sometimes, after an initial flurry of interest, the share price falls back again as earlier investors take profits. In the autumn Quarterly Review, I selected shares in two companies (Gestetner and Taveners) for a capital growth portfolio. At that time, I did not personally own any shares in Gestetner, and I stated that for 'ethical reasons' I would not buy any Gestetner shares 'until at least one week after the publication' of the article. This was intended to demonstrate that I would not be investing in Gestetner in such a way that I could profit from having mentioned the shares in an article. However, within days of that article's being published, Gestetner issued a profits warning. The shares fell by 19.3 per cent within a week - the second greatest price fall of any UK company during that week] My self-denying ordnance had thus saved me from a considerable loss. By December, Gestetner shares had fallen to a low of 108p, compared with the portfolio's 'purchase' price of 183p. Of course, in the 'real world', on the announcement of a dramatic downturn in profits, the portfolio would have cut its losses and sold the Gestetner shares and thus limited its loss to around 20p per share, and then perhaps bought back the shares at a much lower level. The quarterly portfolio, however, can only buy or sell if a clear indication is given in an article as to the likely buying or selling price. As I had not anticipated such a sharp drop in Gestetner share price, I had not mentioned in my article the possibility of selling the shares. Thus, the portfolio was stuck with them. Why had I not foreseen Gestetner's downturn in profits? Probably for some of the same reasons that encouraged Ricoh, the Japanese office automation equipment maker, to pay 250p per share for a 24.2 per cent stake in the company last September: the company appeared to be trading quite well and had good long-term prospects with a worldwide spread of interests. As mentioned in the autumn issue, the portfolio purchased Gestetner shares taking a five-year view: either its profits would eventually be enhanced by its relationship with Ricoh, or Ricoh might make a takeover bid. In December, Gestetner announced its results for its financial year to October 31. Pre-tax profits had fallen by 57 per cent. According to a report in the FT, Gestetner's finance director had said that the profits' shortfall was caused by second-half sales being well below budget and 'management mistakes, notably a late reaction to faltering sales, had contributed to the decline'. Gestetner's chairman stated that the recession had also affected profits, as had a rationalisation of activities which had resulted in job losses for 10 per cent of the company's workforce. I still view Gestetner as a 'long-term hold' - although Ricoh's own pre-tax profits for the six months to end September, 1991, fell by 58.5 per cent. On December 24, my personal pension scheme bought some Gestetner shares, paying 114p a share. I was interested to see from the FT of December 28 that one of Gestetner's directors had purchased 100,000 shares in the company that month so, hopefully, this augurs well for the future. And surely Ricoh will want to see Gestetner's shares improve to much nearer the price it paid for its original stake in the company. My other recommendation in the autumn Review was for Taveners. The portfolio 'bought' the shares for 70p each, and they are now around 80p. Judging by the number of marshmallows my wife and youngest daughter ate during Christmas, this marshmallow and boiled-sweet manufacturer ought to have reasonable prospects. The takeover potential remains, with Finnish confectionery group Karl Fazer owning 29.89 per cent of the company. Again, the portfolio takes a longer-term view. My personal pension scheme still retains its small Taveners shareholding. The portfolio started out with Pounds 10,000 in cash and invested Pounds 5,195 of it, with the remainder being placed in Britannia Building Society Capital Trust. I have debated long and hard whether the portfolio ought to make further equity investments or keep cash on deposit. I still believe that shares in many companies in the UK and US are far too high and that a market correction - either sudden or a gradual downwards movement - will happen within the next 12 months. The 500 companies in the US Standard and Poor's index now have an average price-earnings ratio of over 20 - whereas 10 years ago the average was just over 8. With a general election in the UK, presidential elections in the US, uncertainties and major problems in eastern Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere, who can say with certainty what will happen to share prices? And during a general share-price fall, the 'good' usually falls with the over-priced and the 'bad'. I like a number of companies - such as United Biscuits and the photograph-booth operator Photo-Me, in the UK, and Dole Food, in the US  - but not at current share price levels. I considered the portfolio taking a risky, quick in-and-out gamble in the hope of rapidly making up the losses made by its Gestetner investment. For example, at the time of writing, shares in Regina (the 'Royal Jelly' firm) are 1.75p, yet in the chairman's December 5 statement in the annual report, he says that the company 'has paid off all its bank borrowings in the UK . . . and, save for a small loan in Ireland, the group has no borrowings'. The group has reversed its negative cash position and sales have 'stabilised'. But an investment on a 'quick in-and-out' basis would not be for the cautious, and so I am not recommending or including it in the portfolio. With increased attention being focused on Spain this year, as host to the Olympics and Expo '92, I had hoped that there would be a choice of major investment trusts available which specialised in Spanish investment. Sadly, all I could find was the First Spanish Investment Trust. While the company is no doubt soundly managed, at the time of writing, its interim results for 1991-92 had not been announced, and it needs a close inspection of these results before an investment could be contemplated. Its July 1991 annual report stated that the net asset value had fallen by 11.2 per cent, while the Madrid Stock Exchange index had decreased by 3.6 per cent in sterling terms over a similar period. I am also somewhat concerned that the trust's list of holdings, at May 31, 1991, had 20.31 per cent of its holdings in Spanish banking shares and 30 per cent in Spanish construction and property shares. The portfolio would certainly be interested in investing in the flotation of Britain's biggest venture capital group, 3i, due later this year - but only if the price was right. Thus, the portfolio retains its shares in Gestetner and Taveners, and keeps money on deposit ready to invest in attractive opportunities as they arise and for the possible purchase of shares in 3i.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE POUNDS 10,000 PORTFOLIO STANDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company     Number    Purchase    Cost (Pounds)   Jan 10     Current           of shares   price (p)                    price  value (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gestetner   1,500       183           2,745         119       1,785 Taveners    3,500        70           2,450          80       2,800 Cash holding                                                  4,805 Accrued interest                                                106  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                                         9,496  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash invested in Britannia Building Society  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

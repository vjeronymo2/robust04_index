			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: NFC slips 3% to Pounds 91m as pension credits hit shares NFC, the transport and logistics group, saw its pre-tax profits fall 3 per cent to Pounds 91m in the year to October 3, in line with stock market expectations. However, the shares fell 18p to 266p after the company revealed higher than expected pension credits and a sharp rise in gearing. NFC said it benefited from a Pounds 14.5m pension fund credit. This compared with Pounds 4m last year when the group's pension fund was last revalued and found to be 42 per cent in surplus. Mr Trevor Larman, finance director, said the credit reflected a full-year benefit from the revaluation and the fact the scheme had fewer UK employees. He said the credit was almost cancelled out by higher redundancy costs, which increased Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 11.4m, and a Pounds 7.2m fall in property development profits to Pounds 5.6m. But analysts said they were surprised by the size of the credit. One analyst said he was 'caught off guard' because the credit was not mentioned in NFC's statement to the Stock Exchange, although the company later explained the increase at an analysts' meeting. Mr James Watson, chairman, said that the results showed 'considerable achievement' in a difficult year. 'There is some indication the US (economy) is being more helpful. But the UK remains uncertain,' he said. Turnover increased 3.6 per cent to Pounds 1.72bn. The transport division, which includes BRS and Lynx, was affected by margin pressure due to recession. Operating profits for the division fell nearly Pounds 6m to Pounds 26.8m. But logistics, which operates under the Exel brand name, raised operating profits 23 per cent to Pounds 46.8m, helped by new contracts and overseas growth. Allied Pickfords, the removals division, lifted profits slightly to Pounds 23.2m by continuing to switch from private to commercial removals. Pickfords Travel was sold to Airtours, the tour operator, in September and earned NFC an extraordinary gain of Pounds 6.1m. NFC spent Pounds 75m on acquisitions to expand its US and European networks during the year. This investment, which included Pounds 34m of debt, increased the group's net borrowings to Pounds 181.3m and lifted gearing from 29 per cent to 55 per cent. Mr Watson said he was comfortable with this level of gearing but would not like to see it 'a lot higher'. The emphasis on overseas growth, and recession in the UK, helped lift the proportion of foreign revenue 4 per cent to 37 per cent. Operating profits increased to Pounds 102.7m (Pounds 102.1m). Higher borrowings led to an increased interest charge of Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 5m) while the profit share for employees was set at Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 3.4m). Earnings fell from 13.6p to 13.1p. A final dividend of 2.3p is recommended to raise the total 5 per cent to 6.55p. See Lex</p>

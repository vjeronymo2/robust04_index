			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Untitled POSTFACTUM report from the "Events of the Week" </F> roundup -- from the FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA section page I]    [Text] The Russian Government owes Moscow 126 billion  rubles [R]. The failure to pay this money is creating problems  for the Moscow Government in paying wages to workers in  budget-funded organizations and financing subway construction.  A few days ago Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov noted that Moscow is  honoring its commitments to the federal budget impeccably,  adding that it would be more correct if the city were allowed to  retain part of the taxes for itself "instead of transferring  them to the federal budget and then waiting for money to come  back." Luzhkov asked the tax services to examine this option  for collaborating with the federal authorities in the budget  sphere.</p>

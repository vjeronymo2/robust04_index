			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PRESERVING PIERCE COLLEGE  </P> <P> Things are happening at Pierce College that have many of us more than just  "concerned." In the past two months we have observed:  </P> <P> 1.  </P> <P> Pierce's campus/farm being proposed as an alternate site for the Arts Park  project originally proposed for the Sepulveda Basin.  </P> <P> 2. The Discovery Pavilion children's science museum continuously being referred  to in press clippings as having a future home on 6 1/2 acres on Pierce College.  </P> <P> 3. The announcement from Pierce College administration that the Farm Store has  been closed, the Dairy Program has been discontinued and the milking cows will  be sold off almost immediately.  </P> <P> 4. The highly successful forensics program has been dropped from the fall  schedule, along with a humanities program.  </P> <P> The campus and farm land at Pierce College is a public asset that must be  preserved for the educational opportunities of current and future generations.  </P> <P> The San Fernando Valley has CSUN. It is busting at the seams.  </P> <P> Another four-year college or university in the San Fernando Valley will  eventually become mandatory.  </P> <P> Where will the land come from? The public land at Pierce must be preserved for  inevitable future higher educational needs.  </P> <P> We call upon all of our public officials, from the Community College Board of  Trustees to the City Council, Mayor Bradley, and our state elected officials,  to recognize now, while there is still time, that we must look ahead.  </P> <P> It's time to stop all of the speculation and posturing regarding the proposals  for the piecemeal of the Pierce land.  </P> <P> The most prudent approach should be and must be to retain all of it for the  future.  </P> <P> ROBERT J. GROSS  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P> <P> Gross is president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Assn.  </P></p>

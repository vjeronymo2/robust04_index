People on both sides of the Line of Control dividing  the Kashmir valley also observed complete strike.    In occupied Kashmir, the All Parties Hurriat Conference  decided to observe the strike in response to an appeal made by  Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto. Today was a closed day.  Business and commercial centers, government and semi-government  offices, and educational institutions remained closed. Public  transport remained off the road and life came to a standstill  throughout the country.    The call for strike to express solidarity with the Kashmiri  people struggling for their right of self-determination was  given by the Special Committee of the National Assembly on  Kashmir. The government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto gave  all-out support to the strike, highlighting the nation's  commitment to the Kashmiri cause. Opposition parties joined  hands, demonstrating that the entire nation is united behind the  government on this national issue.    In the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, processions  were taken out and rallies organized by people of all shades of  political opinion, business, traders, students and labor  organizations to express solidarity with the people of Kashmir.  The processionists parading through various streets chanted  slogans against repression the Indian Army and paramilitary  forces have unleashed against the people in occupied Kashmir.    Addressing the rally, speakers condemned the Indian  atrocities in occupied Kashmir and demanded that the United  Nations implement its resolutions on Kashmir in order to  determine the wishes of the Kashmiri people in a free and  impartial plebiscite. They said the unprecedented unity shown  by the people throughout the country today spoke of their  determination to continue to extend moral and political support  to their Kashmiri brethren in their struggle against Indian  hegemony. They condemned the Indian president for his unsavory  comments against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and said Ms.  Benazir Bhutto has emerged as the spokesman of the Kashmiri  people.    Later, leaders of the rally went to the Indian High  Commission and handed over a memorandum.    Trade and labor organizations also staged demonstrations in  the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad to express  solidarity with their Kashmiri brethren. Carrying banners and  placards, the marchers condemned Indian atrocities and urged the  world community to halt human rights abuses in the held valley.  They supported the government policy on Kashmir and assured  that they will not rest until the Kashmiri people throw off  their Indian yoke. [passage omitted]    Supporting the call of the Pakistani prime minister, a  complete strike was observed in occupied Kashmir. Reports say  life remained paralyzed in towns and cities of the valley. All  government and private institutes and offices; schools,  colleges, and universities; banks; and courts remained closed  and transport was off the road. Agency reports say Kashmiris  staged demonstration rallies in the capital, Srinagar, and other  big towns of the valley. They were chanting slogans against  Indian troops' atrocities. Indian soldiers used brute force  against the demonstrators. The All Parties Hurriat Conference  and various religious and mojahedin organizations have endorsed  the call for today's strike to demonstrate that the people of  occupied Kashmir wholeheartedly appreciate Pakistan's stand on  Kashmir.</p>

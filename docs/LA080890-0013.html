			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LEGISLATOR SAYS LETTER CASTS DOUBTS ON PARK SERVICE'S ROLE IN HOPE DEAL  </P> <P> The chairman of a congressional subcommittee that oversees the National Park  Service says that a 1988 letter concerning Cheeseboro Canyon in Ventura County  raises new questions about the National Park Service's authority to approve a  controversial swap of federal land without legislation by Congress.  </P> <P> At issue is whether the Park Service could proceed with a proposed exchange of  59 acres of federally owned land in Cheeseboro Canyon for about 1,100 acres  that entertainer Bob Hope owns on the adjacent Jordan Ranch.  </P> <P> Opponents of the deal have sought to shift the decision-making process from the  agency to Congress, where they maintain it would probably receive a more  critical review.  </P> <P> The Park Service has not taken a formal position on the exchange pending  completion of its environmental impact review, but top agency officials have  expressed support for the proposal in the past.  </P> <P> Potomac Investment Associates, which has an option to buy the 2,308-acre Jordan  Ranch from Hope, is seeking to build 750 estate houses and a tournament golf  course on the ranch's remaining 1,208 acres.  </P> <P> They need the 59 acres of Cheeseboro for an access road to the development from  the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> Hope has agreed to sell another 4,600 acres of mountain property to public  agencies at a below-market $10 million if the exchange is approved.  </P> <P> Rep. Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of the Interior Committee's  subcommittee on national parks and public lands, asked Park Service Director  James M. Ridenour recently whether the agency has authority to trade away part  of Cheeseboro Canyon.  </P> <P> In an interview, Vento said that, under a literal reading of the law, the Park  Service does "not appear to have authority."  </P> <P> Vento has asked Ridenour to obtain a legal opinion on this question from the  Interior Department's solicitor.  </P> <P> Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) made the same request when his government operations  subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources held an oversight  hearing on the proposed swap last month.  </P> <P> Federal law permits the Interior secretary to approve land swaps within a state  if the properties are deemed of equal value or a cash payment is made to the  government to equalize the values.  </P> <P> But the law forbids such an administrative exchange when it would change the  boundaries of a national park, which requires congressional approval.  </P> <P> Cheeseboro Canyon and Jordan Ranch are within the contours of the Santa Monica  Mountains National Recreation Area, a 150,000-acre patchwork of houses, other  private holdings and public land.  </P> <P> Vento's query was prompted by a Feb. 10, 1988, letter from then-Interior  Secretary Donald P. Hodel to key members of Congress advising them that he was  making a minor boundary change to the park to incorporate two parcels at the  southern end of Cheeseboro Canyon next to Agoura Hills.  </P> <P> The secretary has the authority to take such an action but is required to  inform the chairmen of the House and Senate committees that oversee the  Interior Department.  </P> <P> About half of one of the parcels -- 30 acres that was purchased by the Park  Service in 1985 -- is part of the 59 acres in the proposed swap.  </P> <P> A second 20-acre parcel, which was donated to the Park Service, is not.  </P> <P> Donald J. Hellmann, associate counsel for the Wilderness Society, a leading  opponent of the swap, said a boundary revision that was required to add the  30-acre parcel to the park proves that a boundary change would also be needed  to remove it from federal ownership.  </P> <P> "With this evidence, I don't see any question whatsoever that this type of  exchange requires legislation," Hellmann said.  </P> <P> But Willis P. Kriz, chief of the Park Service's land resources division, said  Hodel's letter does not have any bearing on the question of a boundary change  in the exchange. "The two actions are separate and independent of each other,"  Kriz said.  </P> <P> Peter Kirsch, an attorney representing Potomac, also said that Hodel's letter,  which he noted has long been in the public domain, does not buttress Hellmann's  claim that legislation is needed for the exchange.  </P> <P> Unlike other national parks that consist of only federally owned land, Kirsch  said, most of the sprawling Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area is made up  of houses, businesses and other pieces of privately owned property.  </P> <P> Therefore, although a boundary change was legally required to incorporate part  of Cheeseboro Canyon, transferring the 59 acres to a private party does not  remove it from the recreation area.  </P> <P> "This boundary issue just keeps coming up as a red herring," Kirsch said.  </P></p>

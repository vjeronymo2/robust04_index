			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Japanese Bonds: Growing pressure to ease monetary policy AMID calls by leading politicians for an imminent cut in the official discount rate (ODR) and further evidence of a weakening economy, yields on Japanese government bonds have fluctuated in thin volumes. Speculative trading by dealers created volatile movements in the bond market. But lack of investor participation ahead of the fiscal year-end in March has left the yield on the 129 10-year benchmark bond around the 5.35 per cent level, unchanged from the beginning of the year. Market participants were shocked by remarks from Mr Shin Kanemaru, vice-president of the leading Liberal Democratic Party, threatening to 'sack' Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) governor, if the ODR was not lowered soon. Mr Kozo Watanabe, minister of international trade and industry, has urged the BoJ to ease monetary policy on several occasions. Traders fear pressure from politicians could delay the expected easing of the ODR. 'Mr Mieno has worked sedulously to establish the independence of the Bank of Japan and may want to postpone a discount rate cut,' said Mr Marshall Gittler, bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. He added such a decision could have severe repercussions in the market, since monetary easing has already been discounted into bond prices. Recent warnings of a downward revision in earnings for the current year by leading Japanese companies have confirmed the mounting sluggishness of the economy. Sony, the electronics company, recently announced it would report an operating loss of Y20bn for the year to March, its first loss since listing on the Tokyo exchange. Monetary growth has also decelerated to record lows, with money supply falling to 1.8 per cent in January. Bond market participants are now focused on the announcement of the BoJ tankan - the quarterly survey on business sentiment  - scheduled for Friday. The report is expected to confirm negative outlook by businesses, with cuts in capital investment. Mr Kermit Shoenholtz at Salomon Brothers said the tankan, fourth-quarter GNP figures to be announced mid-March, and weak corporate earnings announcements should be good news for the bond market. Mr Shoenholtz reckons the rate on the benchmark bond should fall 50 basis points in the next few months. However, a further fall in long-term rates could reduce the attractiveness of long-term bonds for institutional investors. Trading volume of the benchmark has already fallen to Y10,700bn in February, down from Y28,500bn a year ago, as investors are now turning to short-term bonds and bank debentures. Thin volumes are expected to continue to the end of next month. Most investors have closed down books for the fiscal year and are reluctant to take positions. Concerns over excess supply due to corporate bond issues, and slack demand also linger over the market. Meanwhile, the yield curve, which flattened out last September, has normalised. Short-term rates have fallen in line with the ODR, with the rate on the three-month certificate of deposit closing at 5.1 per cent last week, down from December's 6.1 per cent level.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish of 14  February 1994 on page 7 reports that Sandinist deputy Sergio  Ramirez remarked to the head of the German Press Agency for  Mexico and Central America that the Sandinist National  Liberation Front (FSLN) "needs to bury its political-military  past and strive to be a modern party...capable of confronting  the problems of the great majority." He said that FSLN leaders  must communicate more with the voters and bear in mind that they  represent a party "which rejects all methods of violence...."  Turning to the current crisis, Ramirez said that the  government's greatest weakness in its economic policy is  "ignoring the massive problems of the population" and  "overemphasizing the dictates of the international financial  organizations." Stating that he is against neoliberal policies,  Ramirez also said that he has no intention of seeking the  position of FSLN secretary general. In response to a question  about the social-democratic nature of the FSLN, Ramirez  explained that while the FSLN is a member of the Socialist  International, there is a current within the Front which  represents "the democratic left."</p>

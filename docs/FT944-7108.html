			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / No room in the Vietnamese inns: Scarce accommodation hinders business stormtroopers A serviced apartment building is going up on the shore of Hanoi's famous Ho Tay or West Lake. The price for a spacious, but by no means luxurious, two-bedroomed flat is Dollars 8,000 (Pounds 5,000) a month, plus some service charges. The rush to Vietnam is on. Encouraged by the lifting of the US trade embargo this year, foreigners are charging into Vietnam in ever greater numbers, seeking business opportunities on what many see as Asia's new frontier. But there is little room for these stormtroopers of the business world. Hotels in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (the former Saigon) are often booked out months in advance. Room rates, although not necessarily facilities and service, are equivalent to Singapore or Sydney. Tourist arrivals have gone up from 250,000 in 1990 to a forecast of nearly 1m this year. The pressure on accommodation is immense. 'It's a bizarre situation,' said one Hanoi-based foreign oil company manager. 'I'm living in a city which has 1930s facilities but I'm paying modern-day Hong Kong rents.' Property developers, led by Singaporean, Malaysian and Hong Kong-based companies, have moved in to take advantage of the dramatic upswing in the number of people seeking not only hotel accommodation but homes and offices for rent. According to official figures, 95 joint local/foreign hotel projects worth a total of nearly Dollars 2bn have been approved over the last two years. Piling machines are making their way down Hanoi's narrow streets. Cranes dot the Ho Chi Minh city skyline. But the developers are not having an easy time. One of the first problems any investor in Vietnam faces is the lack of a comprehensive system of commercial regulations and law. Developers find that under Vietnamese law all land belongs to the state and cannot be sold. Establishing title to land involves lengthy negotiations with numerous, often competing, authorities, including politically powerful local people's committees. Local estate agents may claim to have rights to the land they are selling but, in fact, they often have only doctored papers which one government department may accept and another reject. Nonetheless, local speculators have used gold stashed away during recent years or money from relatives overseas to gain control of property in the hope of a foreign rush for land and building space. Mr Huynh Buu Son, deputy director of the Saigon Bank for Industry and Trade, says that prices in parts of Ho Chi Minh City have peaked. 'Some local banks which have supported the speculators are going to get into trouble. Locals who bought at inflated prices now can't find buyers for their property.' With the absence of a proper land title system and no mortgage laws, foreign developers find that their banks are often unwilling to offer financing in such an uncertain market. Instead, companies have to rely on their own cash reserves. Having found a site to develop, the next problem is compensation and resettlement for those living there. Hanoi and Hon Chi Minh City are two of the most densely populated urban centres in Asia; the density in parts of Ho Chi Minh City is greater than in Hong Kong, while Hanoi's population has risen from 500,000 inhabitants in the 1950s to more than 3m today. Foreign developers, as well as diplomatic missions and company executives, have been keen to renovate and rent some of Hanoi's crumbling French colonial-style villas. The authorities give the go-ahead but say those inhabiting such properties must be compensated. That can be an expensive proposition. The authorities recently found that more than 1,000 families were living in 150 villas in the centre of Hanoi. Compensation claims are often grossly inflated. Several foreign-backed projects have either been abandoned or are still only in the planning stage. Work on a French/Vietnamese joint venture project to build a hotel near the site of the Hanoi Opera House has still not started, nearly two years after winning initial approval from the authorities. A Scandinavian/Vietnamese venture to build a hotel near the city's Lenin Park has apparently run into financing difficulties. The Dollars 63m New World in Ho Chi Minh City, described as the southern city's largest luxury hotel, finally opened in October after six years of squabbling over land agreements and compensation claims. Some Vietnamese are wary of the foreign property developers. Officials insist that they do not want Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City to fall into the same haphazard development cycle as cities like Bangkok. Some criticise the emphasis on luxury hotels and resorts, out of reach of all but a small minority of Vietnamese, while farmers have objected to precious agricultural land and water resources being used for golf courses. Mr Peter Purcell, an Australian property developer, is managing a project to build an exclusive recreation club on the shore of Hanoi's West Lake. Although building on the project has yet to start, companies are already advancing Dollars 15,000 membership fees. Several luxury hotel developments are planned nearby. 'Things take longer to do here,' says Mr Purcell. 'It's not like Singapore or Malaysia, where, if the authorities tell people to move off the land, that's it. Even the lowliest worker has a say. Small-scale projects are fine but I'd be wary of getting involved in any big property deal.'</p>

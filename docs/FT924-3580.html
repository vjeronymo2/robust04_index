			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Letter: Supervisor training crucial Sir, I agree wholeheartedly with your correspondent Peter Marsh ('Japanese find UK lacks supervision', November 26) on the subject of supervisor training. For a number of years now I have been beating the drum in Scotland to encourage companies to appreciate the benefits of training their first-line supervisors. And only recently, in the last 18 months or so, have companies really started to address the problem. It is unfortunate that it has taken a comparison with another country - Japan - to show just how important it is for a firm to develop its people. Not only for the firm to benefit, but also to give the workforce the necessary skills to compete in the world market. As your article points out, a supervisor is not only someone who is familiar with technology and machines, but is also skilled in human relations and creating team spirit. The role of the supervisor in industry is changing rapidly with the introduction of more flexible manufacturing systems and the development of 'flatter' organisational structures. This increases the importance of the improved selection of supervisor and the provision of training with greater breadth and depth. Government must recognise the need for a higher standard of supervisor training, and training and enterprise councils and local enterprise companies should encourage the provision of such training.

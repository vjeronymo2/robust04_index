			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Families 'bear the brunt of recession' THE EFFECTS of the recession have had the greatest impact on families with children, 79 per cent of which have been unable to carry out their spending plans compared with 60 per cent of those without children, according to research published yesterday by Mintel, the research group. The study ranged widely across socio-demographic changes in households, examining areas such as spending patterns, self-image, education and employment. The commonest reason for having to delay spending was the increased cost of day-to-day living, given by 43 per cent of the 1,036 adults surveyed, followed by 15 per cent who attributed spending delays to unemployment. Only 5 per cent said increased mortgage payments were responsible. In spite of the collapse of the housing market 77 per cent said they believed home ownership was a good financial investment. Households with children spend considerably more each week on almost all consumer goods and services than those without children: 84 per cent more on clothing and footwear (Pounds 22.90, against Pounds 12.46); 80 per cent more on tea, coffee and soft drinks (Pounds 3.46 against Pounds 1.92); 72 per cent more on cereals, bread and biscuits (Pounds 7.15 against Pounds 4.15); and 71 per cent more on milk, fats, cheese and eggs (Pounds 8.23 against Pounds 4.80). The survey also asked 1,069 adults where they did their food shopping. The retailer J Sainsbury came top for all types of household, with 20 per cent shopping there, compared with 15 per cent for Tesco, the next most popular choice. But 20 per cent of households with children favoured Tesco compared with 17 per cent using Sainsbury. The case for brand advertising in television and newspapers is weakened by the report. From a sample base of 954 households, 54 per cent said their preferred way of finding out about new food products was from on-pack information, with only 13 per cent naming advertising. Mail-order shopping is more popular with couples with children than those without, with six in 10 parents buying at least one item by mail order during the past year. Clothing and footwear were the most popular items. The survey asked 5,008 adults about the self-image they aspired to. The most popular was 'loyal/trustworthy' (71 per cent), followed by 'sensible/responsible' (61 per cent) and 'sensitive/caring' (52 per cent). 'Successful' was third from bottom (12 per cent), just above 'wild/ unpredictable' (6 per cent) and 'sophisticated/stylish' (4 per cent). Mintel said that 80 per cent of women with children over the age of 10 have paid work and the average number of children per household had shrunk from 2.4 to 1.8. The report suggests that the first areas to benefit from an economic upturn will be 'spending on the home, especially large-scale improvements such as extensions and double glazing', for households with families. Families put spending on leisure pursuits except holidays, and on clothing and other fashion-related items last on the list. Family Lifestyles 1993. Mintel, 18-19 Long Lane, London EC1A 9HE.

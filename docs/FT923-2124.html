			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / The Long View: From Madrid to Maastricht SELDOM CAN a British government's economic policies have collapsed so completely as happened this week. And seldom can the disaster have been so richly deserved. The approach was wrong from the beginning. Only if the British economy had been aligned with its Continental counterparts before joining would there have been any great hope of permanent integration. Margaret Thatcher understood that with her 'Madrid conditions', which were ultimately ignored. In the event the Treasury chose, in October 1990, a central exchange rate of DM2.95 which was intended to help depress UK inflation (then an alarming 10.9 per cent). As I put it that month in this column: 'We have entered the ERM as a refuge from the renewed burst of inflation and devaluation which would otherwise be inevitable.' The exit from the ERM threatens to bring about the kind of shock for savers which I warned about two weeks ago. Inflation over the next year could easily be 6 or 7 per cent, wiping out High Street deposit returns net of tax even if money market rates stay at 10 per cent. Gilts have become substantially higher in risk, without the shelter of ERM membership. The equity market predictably celebrated, and institutional fund managers will be relieved that they stuck to their heavy weightings of equities throughout the two years of ERM membership. During that period there was substantial outperformance by bonds, in sharp contrast to strong equity growth typical of much of the postwar period. There were, of course, always doubts about John Major's timing and staying power over ERM entry. Perhaps the government might have hoped for better luck with German interest rates, although in late 1990 it ought to have foreseen what might happen in the wake of unification. But in the end the huge burden of personal and corporate indebtedness would surely have brought sterling down. The economic impact of this debt mountain is essentially what has triggered this week's U-turn, even more than the French referendum on Maastricht. The markets finally decided that the high interest rate strategy was impossible to sustain. In those circumstances to try to defend sterling with 15 per cent rates showed extraordinary lack of judgment. Now we have to cope with the renewed burst of inflation and devaluation. It will not be at all pleasant. But a recession is the best time for a devaluation, and on balance we should be optimistic. A real disaster of economic decline and financial collapse was threatened by the strategy which Norman Lamont was pursuing until Wednesday this week. Now there is an opportunity for a different chancellor to strike off in a new direction. There is an obvious parallel with the 1930s, when after devaluing in 1931 the UK achieved quite reasonable economic growth (and the stock market doubled between 1932 and 1936). But the inflationary consequences will be significantly worse this time: there is no sterling area to shelter us. Within the ERM we were still running an underlying inflation rate of about 4 per cent. We can forget about John Major's zero inflation, and about the 2 to 3 per cent to which we might have aspired if the sterling-DM parity had held indefinitely. Will we go back to the 6.9 per cent average of the 1980s or to the 10.3 per cent which was the average over the whole period of floating from 1972 to 1990? We cannot begin to guess until a new, independent monetary policy emerges. There remains a danger that the debt burden that has forced the UK out of the ERM will force sterling much lower still. The quickest way to eliminate debt is by inflation. In 1975 nearly 20 per cent of the debt burden was got rid of in this way. As for 1992, the Americans have cut short-term interest rates to 3 per cent and the UK is in much the same economic and financial plight. With unemployment still racing ahead the political pressure to bring interest rates down will intensify. We shall not, however, be given any honest warning of an inflationary change of strategy: the official method of presentation is always that devaluation should be blamed on speculators (and possibly on malevolent foreign central bankers) but certainly not on the inflationary policies that caused it. Our problems date back to long before we entered the ERM. Between 1984 and 1988 the UK enjoyed a prodigious economic boom during which gross domestic product rose by 18 per cent in four years to a level which will not be reached in 1992. The boom was largely fuelled by a debt explosion which continued into 1989 (when the annual increase in M4 lending reached Pounds 90bn) and 1990; personal indebtedness in relation to income is still nearly twice as high as it was ten years ago. The government has never had a credible policy for dealing with this problem, although with more than 1m families now financially wiped out by their mortgages it has at least begun to take notice. A rapid rise in nominal personal incomes would be the most attractive solution to many politicians. However, although we have left the ERM this is not yet 1974 or 1980 revisited. The government has to sell a lot of gilt-edged to foreigners and will worry about the yield premium it has to concede over dollar or D-Mark debt. At home, depositors can easily switch into foreign currency accounts which might start to become very popular if sterling short-term rates are brought down a long way. Ironically the Footsie Index jumped more than 100 points on the UK's ERM entry, then did the same when we left. There is precious little logic in that except that shareholders may think that the more often we move in and out of the ERM the better.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Major hints at work-related unemployment benefits MR JOHN MAJOR last night held out the prospect of workfare-style schemes for the unemployed and hinted at a review of the benefits system as part of a re-examination of spending priorities. In a wide-ranging speech on his personal vision of Conservatism, the prime minister also warned of government action on road pricing and police reform. Mr Major said he was questioning whether paying unemployment benefit 'without offering or requiring any activity in return' served either society or the jobless well. Referring to the Restart training programme that removes benefits from non-attenders, he said: 'I believe we should explore ways of extending it further.' Mr Greville Janner, Labour chairman of the cross-party employment select committee, last night wrote to Mr Major asking if he was merely 'kite flying' ideas for a workfare-style programme and, if not, to give evidence to the committee on his proposals. Labour signalled its opposition to such a programme. Mr Donald Dewar, social security spokesman, said the unemployed should be given the incentive and opportunity to earn their keep, not punished for the misfortune of being unemployed. Mr Major promised a re-examination of long-term expenditure trends, and reaffirmed the goals of sound public finance, lower personal taxation, firm control of inflation and 'a rigorous approach to public expenditure'. In a reference interpreted as signalling a fresh look at benefits, he added: 'It is always dangerously easy for the state to settle into habits of spending which outlast their purpose and outrun their budgets.' He said it was the Conservatives' task in the 1990s to break down class barriers, raise the status of vocational qualifications and expand choice in schools. He also argued for respect for individual achievement and the gradual evolution of traditional political institutions from the monarchy and parliament to churches and voluntary organisations. As an example of this need for evolutionary change, the honours system should be reformed to stress merit. 'It is time to get rid of old, class-based distinctions,' he said. His words suggested that he plans to pre-empt the Labour party, which is engaged in a fundamental re-evaluation of its policies on tax and benefits, including those for the unemployed. Other policy developments signalled in the speech included reforms to teacher training, custodial sentences for persistent young offenders, further deregulation and government help for business by means of opening doors to markets. A party aide said the latter aim was to bolster trade initiatives through government-to-government contacts such as last week's prime ministerial tour in India and the Gulf. His speech, at the Carlton Club in London, was firmly placed in the context of updating party thinking to address issues of the 1990s. It attempted to yoke Disraeli's concept of 'one nation' Toryism with warnings of the dangers of big government to support Mr Major's goal of building a classless society of responsible individuals and 'a nation at ease with itself'. Mr Major said the paradox Conservative politicians had to face was that change was essential to preserve the best aspects of society. He stressed that the era of deference was 'out of date, damaging and divisive'. Agenda of change, Page 9</p>

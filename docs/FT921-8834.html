			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Japanese lose their aversion to western-style profligacy: Traditionally stern savers, people in Japan have discovered the credit card A RECENT box office hit in Japan depicts debtors beating debt collectors helped by a Robin Hood-like agency. In real life, such agencies do not exist, but the release of the film, Yonigeya-Honpo - which literally means Moonlight Flit Agency - comes as Japan's rising consumer debts are becoming an increasing problem. After the years of loose money and lavish spending of the late 1980s, the image of the Japanese being keen savers is in dire need of review. 'Consumer behaviour in Japan has changed from saving and spending to borrowing and spending,' says Mr Kunji Okue, economist at County NatWest, the UK brokerage firm. According to government figures, consumer debt per household totalled Y4.9m (Pounds 22,000) in 1990, a 67 per cent rise from 1985. In the film, Moonlight Flit Agency, a young man wearing an Italian suit deftly shuffles his deck of credit cards. 'I only want the best for myself, and I can get it,' he says. Many Japanese, especially the young generation, share the feeling. If they cannot afford it, they can always use credit. To them, the traditional sense of guilt associated with borrowing money is alien. Many older Japanese are appalled by the change in values, but on the other hand, many of the older generation too have been driven by materialism as frugal habits gave way to the stock and real estate market boom of the 1980s. The sinful image of 'debt' written out in kanji - Japanese characters - was eliminated by the use of the English 'rohn' (loan) or 'kurejitto' (credit). The current labour shortage also gave the younger generation a sense of job and wage security, and reduced the urgency to save. However, a lack of education about the dangers of credit and a rise in interest rates have pushed up the number of bad debts. According to Japan's supreme court, personal bankruptcies last year totalled 23,287, double that of five years ago, and the underlying rate of debt problems is increasing even more rapidly. Banks, which competed to lend to retail clients in the late 1980s also face problems. According to the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan, the number of defaults by consumers at banks rose a year-on-year 54 per cent in 1991 to 171,320. Credit cards, which have become popular over the past seven or eight years, are causing problems. Aggressive marketing by consumer credit companies pushed up the circulation of cards to 166m by last March, doubling the figure five years before. Eager to increase market share, credit card issuers, which range from retailers to leasing companies, are now regretting that they didn't bother with stringent credit checks on new cardholders. 'There has been no systematic introduction of credit cards in Japan, and credit information on the individual is virtually unavailable,' says Mr Greg Kaufman of Consumer Credit Clearance, a debt collection agency. Worried authorities have started to establish a centralised data base on borrowers, by accumulating existing information held by the credit companies. But calls by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to contribute client information, have been met with cool response by the credit card issuers. Authorities also have trouble regulating some consumer finance companies, which charge rates as high as 40 per cent a year on loans, and are known for their strongarm approach to delinquent debtors. Meanwhile, the rising consumer leverage may have adverse effects on the Japanese economy. Mr Okue at County NatWest says that as the amount of household debt rises, consumer spending will be directly affected by interest rate and wage movements, making fluctuations in the economy more volatile.</p>

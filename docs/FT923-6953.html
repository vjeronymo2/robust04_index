			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Rosebys tops Pounds 0.6m in opening period Rosebys, the specialist retailer of household textiles, curtains and accessories hived off by Cattle's, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 493,000 to Pounds 606,000 in the first half of 1992. Historically, the bulk of profits arise in the second half. Forecasts assume that no discernible increase in consumer spending will come this year, but 'we are continuing to improve gross margins and are exercising vigorous cost control,' said Mr Roy Waudby, chairman. In the 1991 year the group made Pounds 2.17m from turnover of Pounds 42.8m. In March, 55 per cent of the increased capital was placed at 115p per share. Cattle's retained the minority capital. Yesterday the share price fell 8p to 114p. Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 20.9m, but most of that stemmed from retail outlets opened in the previous 12 months. Earnings per share worked through unchanged at 1.9p on the higher capital. The interim dividend is 0.9p.</p>

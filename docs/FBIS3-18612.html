In a KURIER  interview, the Czech Prime Minister sharply criticized Austria  for lobbying against a United States loan to complete the  Temelin nuclear power plant located near the [Czech-Austrian]  border. "This intervention is impossible for me. It has  something to do with the elections," Klaus suspects. The  Austrians have other things on their minds rather than nuclear  power plants.    Chancellor Vranitzky categorically rejects this suggestion:  "There are clear reasons for our strict antinuclear policy: The  referendum on Zwentendorf [nuclear power plant], the  nuclear-free policy resulting from it, and the practical  experience of half of Europe had with Chernobyl," the Chancellor  said in an interview with KURIER. This is "ample justification"  for opposing Temelin. He has repeatedly pointed out this  problem, "which we do not want to hold back in spite of good  neighborly relations."    Klaus' accusation that the investment offered by Austria to  transform Temelin into a gas power plant was "state-organized  lobbying," is countered by Vranitzky dryly: "The free-of-charge  electricity supplies would have cost 3.5 billion Austrian  schillings per year -- this is not lobbying." Also, it is not  true -- as Klaus thinks -- that Austria lacks understanding for  the Czech Republic that is building up a free market economy  after 40 years of communism. But: "The answer to the effects of  communism cannot be a nuclear power plant built the communist  way." Vranitzky emphasized that the dispute over Temelin is  "not a crusade against the Czech Republic, but our offer to  cooperate."</p>

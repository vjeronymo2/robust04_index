			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Russians seek EC link RUSSIA'S national machine tool association is seeking to strengthen its ties with the west by joining Cecimo, the Brussels-based umbrella body for the twelve main producing countries of western Europe, reports Andrew Baxter. If Russia's application is accepted, it would be the first former communist country to join Cecimo and would help Russia's 300 machine tool factories develop co-operation agreements and joint ventures with western Europe. The campaign to join is being led by Mr Nikolai Panichev, a former Soviet minister for machine tools, who was recently chosen by the Russian producers to be president of their privately owned national association.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / People: Eadie tempted by fund management role Colin Day, chairman of Henderson Pension Fund Management (HPFM) is a very happy man, having secured the agreement of Dugald Eadie to join as managing director of HPFM. Eadie, 50 next month, is acknowledged as one of the leading international figures in measuring investment performance, having been with the Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie since 1968. He became a partner of the firm in 1973. Wood Mackenzie was acquired by Hill Samuel in 1984, whereupon the firm's computer services business became a separate entity, known as WM Company, with Eadie as its chairman. WM Company was in turn acquired by Bankers Trust in 1987 for Pounds 9.8m. In May this year it was reported that Eadie was standing down as chairman of WM, but would continue as a non-executive director and senior consultant. Eadie is a figure closely associated with the creation of the UK investment performance measurement industry, as well as one of its leading exponents - hence the jubilation of Colin Day at getting him to join HPFM from November 1. The European Federation of of Financial Analysts' Societies (EFFAS) recently appointed Eadie to establish a permanent commission on performance measurement. Eadie too is keen to start his new role, which will be much more of a business development function. Observer, page 21</p>

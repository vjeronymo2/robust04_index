			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESCUERS TO SPEND $8 BILLION ON S&amp;LS THIS MONTH  </P> <P> Federal regulators plan to spend about $8 billion by the end of September to  restructure or close insolvent thrift institutions, Federal Deposition  Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman said Thursday.  </P> <P> The figure is $3 billion higher than previous estimates, and an FDIC spokesman  said the increase is related to FDIC's work on the sale or merger of five  "relatively large" savings and loan firms with assets averaging between $700  million and $800 million. He said the actions are on a "fast track" because the  deals will not be structurally complex.  </P> <P> The $8 million is part of $20 billion that the Resolution Trust Corp. is  required by the new savings and loan bailout legislation to spend by the end of  the current fiscal year on resolving the cases of insolvent thrifts. The RTC is  the entity created by the bailout bill to deal with insolvent thrifts under  FDIC's management.  </P> <P> The other $12 billion will be used to replace sick thrifts' high-cost brokered  deposits as they mature with lower-cost government funds, Seidman said in a  talk at the annual meeting of the board of governors of the Mortgage Bankers  Assn.  </P></p>

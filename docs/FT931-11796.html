			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bidermann buys Pinault chain BIDERMANN, the French textile group, is buying the Armand Thiery chain of clothing stores from Pinault-Printemps, the heavily-indebted retail concern headed by Mr Francois Pinault. The deal, for an undisclosed sum, is part of the disposal programme started by Mr Pinault after his recent takeover of the Au Printemps department store chain. The takeover transformed Pinault-Printemps into one of France's leading retail groups but has left the company burdened by heavy debt. Armand Thiery is an established group of clothing stores, which includes six shops under the Brummel umbrella, as well as its signature 53-strong chain. The company, which Pinault-Printemps acquired in late 1991 as part of the Printemps deal, made sales of FFr658m (Dollars 122.76m) last year. Bidermann has extensive interests in the French clothing industry, including a minority 12.4 per cent stake in Armand Thiery.</p>

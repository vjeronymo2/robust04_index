			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Octavi Marti report: "Aznar Says That `All Bounds of What </F> Is Tolerable and Permissible' Have Been Overstepped"]    [Text] Paris -- People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar  stated in Paris yesterday that "all the bounds of what is  tolerable and permissible have been overstepped" in Spain,  referring to the scandals involving former prominent officials.  Aznar, who met in the French capital with Gaullist Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur, avoided centering his remarks on  specific individuals, but pointed to Felipe Gonzalez in saying  that the bounds have also been breached in "the evasion of  responsibilities by those people who hold the greatest  responsibility."    As he said later, the People's Party leader forecast to  Balladur an imminent political change in Spain: "As is natural,  I conveyed my impressions and thoughts," he said at the end of  the 20-minute meeting, because "we are approaching a stage when  one political period will end and a new one will begin."  <H5>  Own Initiative </H5>   That interpretation of the Spanish situation, he said, "was  not requested of me by Prime Minister Balladur; I gave it to him  on my own initiative." In addition to the Spanish political  situation, the exchange of views with the French prime minister  "was lively and interesting," according to Aznar, who was  accompanied by Abel Matutes, the People's Party list leader for  the European elections and commissioner for transport and energy  in Brussels.    "The European Union, the current political and economic  state  of Europe, the Maghreb, and bilateral relations between our two  countries," with particular reference to cooperation in the  antiterrorist struggle, were discussed during the conversation.  Aznar described the situation in this respect as "good right  now," but said that it is desirable "to deepen it in order to  make it increasingly effective."    For Balladur, the meeting with Aznar had a less ceremonial  and more practical aspect, embodied in the presence of European  Commissioner Matutes, who, it is hoped, will intervene in favor  of the Air France restructuring and recapitalization plan.    Proof of the French Government's interest in exchanging  views  with Matutes is the fact that, early in the afternoon, the  Spanish representative in Brussels met again with Balladur, with  the latter now accompanied by Transport Minister Bernard Bosson.    For his part, Jose Maria Aznar announced that he intended to  meet again with the French prime minister in the evening, in the  course of a "private wdding reception."</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Observer: Speak and be damned Small explosion on the international conference circuit. Euromoney has been forced to cancel a high-profile shindig in Athens today. The conference, 'Greece - an emerging market', was sponsored by Midland Bank, together with the Union of Greek Banks, Salomon Brothers and Lockheed Aircraft Service Corp. More than 500 had planned to attend. However, some of the participants suddenly got the jitters after a Greek daily, Imerisia, claimed that Euromoney had invited international businessmen to invest in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Despite frantic last-minute lobbying, the keynote speaker, Economy Minister Stefanos Manos, pulled out and so did Stelios Argyros, president of the Greek Industrialists' Federation, who was to chair the meeting. Euromoney has denied Imerisia's allegation, but stressed that it was its 'inalienable right and duty' to write about areas all round the world; it had planned to write about Macedonia in a forthcoming issue. Euromoney's timing was a trifle tactless, considering that the Greeks are fighting a diplomatic battle to prevent international recognition of Macedonia under that name. Feeling runs high in Athens; anyone who forgets to preface Macedonia with the words 'former Yugoslav republic of' is in for a long lecture, covering almost 2,000 years of Balkan history from Alexander the Great to Yugoslav communism under Tito.</p>

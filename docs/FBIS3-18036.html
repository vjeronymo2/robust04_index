The shelling of Sarajevo  has ceased, and all thanks to American diplomacy, NATO bombers  and British generals. Our television screens will no longer see  this nightly pollution. At last we have done something well in  Bosnia. Hurrah for intervention. Now let the peacemakers of the  air move on to Tuzla and Gorazde, to Maglaj and Bihac, to the  ratruns and sewers of Mostar.    As so often with Bosnia I must rub my eyes in disbelief. The  one truly significant event of the week has been the arrival of  Russians in the Bosnian stew. The Serbs were never going to  capture Sarajevo. Their guns were merely securing a status quo  partition of the city. Had NATO planes tried to bomb those  guns, they might or might not have pulled back. What is sure is  that a wider guerrilla war against aid convoys and foreign  troops would have ensued and the Russians would have ended any  UN consensus. This would have been disastrous for everyone -- a  point Douglas Hurd has pleaded in vain in Washington and Paris.    In the event, Boris Yeltsin has saved the West from its own  recklessness. The Serbs have been given cover for a tactical  withdrawal from Sarajevo -- to concentrate on fighting Muslims  elsewhere -- with a guarantee that the Serb positions would not  come under Muslim counterattack. Mr Yeltsin also warned NATO  not to try any bombing threats elsewhere in Bosnia. He marched  his troops into the cheering Bosnian Serb capital of Pale, and  with good reason declared a triumph for Slav solidarity.    Perhaps the Bosnian civil war can now end happily and soon.  Perhaps the coming of the Russians will dissuade the Muslims  from a spring counteroffensive: good news for desperate  civilians caught on the front lines. Perhaps Bill Clinton will  find some other outlet for America's periodic craving to bomb  foreigners. Perhaps Lord Owen will even persuade the Muslims  that they must sooner or later live under UN protection  surrounded by a new Croatia/Serbia, and may as well do so now.  Perhaps the internationalisation of this war will stop.  Perhaps pigs will fly.    Only the most deluded could see the events of the past week  as other than a victory for Russia and Serbia. Certainly the  Sarajevo government is not cheering. It said, with rare  realism, that NATO had entrenched Serbia's aggression and  pre-empted any new Muslim offensive. The siege guns may have  fallen silent; as at Srebrenica, the price is the silence of the  besieged. Sarajevo is now to become the playground of  international statesmen, another Berlin or Beirut. Lord Owen  said yesterday that the time had come for everyone, "both the  Americans and the Russians, to become more heavily involved."  God preserve the place. Into Sarajevo's green lines and  enclaves will pour superdiplomacy, supercharity, prestige and  unctuous concern. As Tweedledum remarked, let's fight until six  then have dinner...and then perhaps fight again.    In asking Russia to commit soldiers to Bosnia, NATO this  week  put a bullet in its revolver, spun the chamber and placed the  barrel at its head. Slav revanchism in Yugoslavia was the final  horror against which the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrey  Kozyrev, jokingly warned the West a year ago. With troops  committed to a Slav civil war -- forget their blue berets --  what Russian politician will dare withdraw them short of victory?    What then if some foolish European politician (such as  Malcolm Rifkind last week) goads America into sending troops to  help lift the Serbian sieges? If America believes the bombing  threat changed everything in Sarajevo last week, why not go  further? Why not see if the Russians are bluffing? Drop a few  bombs to test them. Send a few troops. After all, it was only  a handful of advisers that Lyndon Johnson sent to Da Nang in  1965, after 150 bombers failed to convince the Vietcong of  America's commitment.    What we are seeing in Bosnia is a crucial turning point in  the course of an intervention. The NATO/UN forces are no longer  obeying their original objective of escorting humanitarian aid.  They are plainly seeking a war aim, a shift in the military  balance of a civil conflict. This is the shift against which  every strategist warned two years ago. The magnetism of war  distorts rules of engagement. Escorting convoys becomes  returning fire in self-defence.    Mediating skirmishes becomes drawing maps and negotiating  ceasefires. Protecting enclaves becomes aiding combatants.  Delivering supplies becomes taking sides. And as you sink into  this mire, you beckon frantically for others to join you, even  Russians.    The media have invented a new tense in which to advocate  these risky adventures: the unfulfillable future conditional.  In Somalia American forces were encouraged ashore but only "if  they leave behind a new political and security framework." So  said a unanimous British and American press. There was no  chance of this condition being met, but the armchair strategist  was neatly off the hook. He could accuse the  non-interventionist of cowardice, yet blame the eventual fiasco  on "failures of implementation."    Similarly, Sunday's relief of Sarajevo is hailed as a  vindication of air power, but only if the Serbs can show  themselves magnanimous towards the Muslims and not simply shift  their guns and soldiers elsewhere. (In which case NATO will  have cynically abetted Serb aggression.) Again, the condition  will not be fulfilled and the media and opposition politicians  will heap scorn on governments for not "giving the UN the tools  for the job." A month ago, John Major was being asked in the  Commons when he was going to pull out of Bosnia. Yesterday MPs  demanded to know which city he would relieve next. Foreign  intervention is a whimsical affair.    I believe that for two years the outside world has  contrived,  however messily, to do the right thing in former Yugoslavia. It  has offered two services to a nation for whose factionalism it  is not remotely responsible: a conciliation forum in Geneva and  huge charitable relief. The UN's one mistake was to support  that relief with soldiers -- unlike in Ethiopia or other recent  civil wars. It thus gave each side the opportunity to plead  with the soldiers for help and taunt them for their impotence.    Both services lost their point at least a year ago. As Lord  Owen and others have recently admitted, intervention is almost  certainly prolonging the conflict. The Muslims are rearming and  recovering some lost ground. Mercenaries are everywhere. Rural  communities are looting food, money and presumably weapons meant  for the besieged. Each side can blame outsiders for their  misery, while denying their leaders any negotiating manoeuvre.    A month ago UN troops seemed on the brink of being withdrawn  from Bosnia. Barely a quarter of relief supplies were reaching  their intended destination. UN soldiers were dying. Yet it was  apparent to the Geneva negotiators that no side was exhausted  enough to sue for peace. The French were reluctant to pull out,  trapped by domestic politics, but Britain was ready to leave, as  were the Dutch. The Bosnians might at last have been left to  find their own path to peace, and the aid agencies left to do  the best they can unprotected.    The mortaring of Sarajevo market on February 5 -- by whom is  still unclear -- put paid to that. There is no more powerful  magnet to military escalation than foreign corpses on American  television and a talented (rather than a whining) general on the  ground, in the form of Britain's Sir Michael Rose. Withdrawal  suddenly became unthinkable. That fell phrase was heard,  "NATO's patience is exhausted." The gods of war put on the  clothes of peace and banged their drums. Convoy assistance was  no longer the objective. Ceasefires had to be enforced. Bosnia  now faces the Tolstoyan fate of being a land over which foreign  powers will test their strength.    We are back to square one. Satellite reconnaissance plots  new Serbian targets. Battalions go on standby. Those not yet  committed, the Americans and the Germans, are shown the white  feather. Behind the strident editorials can be heard the  strains of "Oh What a Lovely War." We have lifted the siege of  Sarajevo as we lifted that of Mafeking. Which siege next, Mr  Major? Are you a man or a mouse? So what if the Russians are  really on the other side. We have dealt with their like before.  Now is no time to cut and run. Come on in America. This is  where your president can find his glory. To war!    I wish we would all get out of Bosnia and leave it to finish  its own dreary business on its own. We are not helping. We  congratulate ourselves for Sarajevo. For what? For showing how  good we are at prolonging other peoples troubles.</p>

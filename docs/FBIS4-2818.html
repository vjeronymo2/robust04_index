			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 13 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton today told U.S. newspaper editors that he is doing his  best in handling the Whitewater affair.    Speaking today at the American Society of Newspaper Editors  who compared his explanations of the Whitewater affair to a girl  making excuses for skipping her homework, Clinton said that he  is doing his best to answer questions about the Whitewater  affair but he could not have perfect recall of events which  happened 15 years ago.    "I have done my best to answer the questions asked of me...  I'll continue to do that," Clinton said, heatedly defending his  handling of the Whitewater affair.    But he said he could not stay on top of the daily Whitewater  revelations in the media without letting the presidency suffer.    "Maybe you think I should have shut the whole federal  government down and done nothing but study these things for the  last two months," the U.S. president said.    "I have done everything I know to do but, can I answer every  question that anybody might ask me about something that happened  10, 15, 17 years ago on the spur of the moment and have total  recall of all of that while trying to be president? No sir, I  cannot," he stressed.    Clinton said he had agreed to the appointment of a special  prosecutor in the Whitewater case precisely to put the search  for information in capable hands and allow himself to focus on  the business of the presidency.    Special prosecutor Robert Fiske is investigating whether  money from a failed Arkansas savings and loan association was  funnelled to the Whitewater Development Co. in which the  Clintons had invested back in the late 1970s.    Reports said today that records released by the Clintons'  Whitewater business partner, James McDougall, showed Mrs.  Clinton had taken a more active role in the Whitewater company  than White House officials had acknowledged.    The records reportedly showed that her law firm in Little  Rock, Arkansas, was given as Whitewater's address on tax returns  and that some monthly payments from Whitewater lot buyers were  mailed to her there.    White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said today that  "we  stand by our description of her (Mrs. Clinton's) role." White  House officials have long described the Clintons as passive  investors in the Whitewater Development Company that was largely  run by the McDougalls.</p>

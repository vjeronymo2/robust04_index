			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Japan-US groups near chip pact ON THE eve of critical US-Japan semiconductor trade talks, Micron Technology, a US memory chip maker, and NEC, Japan's biggest semiconductor producer, have reached preliminary agreement to sell each other's memory chip products. Micron and NEC said they had signed a memorandum of understanding to allow each company to resell the other's memory products under their own brand names worldwide. The companies said they believed their accord would 'contribute to solving US-Japan semiconductor trade issues'. Amid rising tensions over chip trade, US and Japanese industry executives begin meetings in Tokyo today, with government-to-government talks due later this week. The US accuses Japan of failing to meet obligations under a 1991 trade pact to open its semiconductor market to foreign suppliers. Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, has announced a review of how the chip pact is being implemented. The 1991 agreement says Japan recognises US expectations that the foreign market share will rise to 'more than 20 per cent of the Japanese market by the end of 1992', and specifies 'particular attention should be given to market share' in gauging progress to an open market in Japan. But with the foreign share of the Japanese market standing at 14.4 per cent, there seems little chance Japan can reach the 20 per cent goal by the end of the year. The talks in Tokyo this week are aimed at averting an escalation of the trade row, which could lead to the US imposing retaliatory sanctions on Japan. US industry executives hope Japan will outline plans to open its market. Details of the NEC-Micron pact have to be worked out, but the companies said they intended to go beyond memory chip sales to 'other chip products and other possible co-operation'. Mr Joseph Parkinson, Micron chief executive, is chairman of the US Semiconductor Industry Association, the group leading the US industry's trade battle and jointly hosting this week's meeting with the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. Recently, he accused Japanese and Korean memory chip makers of dumping products in the US. Micron filed a suit against the Koreans, but has made no formal charges against the Japanese.</p>

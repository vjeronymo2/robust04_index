			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Division of labour day Out of 'votelessness', comes thoughtlessness. Unable to 'put people first' in Congress, President Clinton would like to see the Federal Reserve take on the mission instead. The lesson from this world recovery, however, is that the central bankers who seem all but indifferent to the employment of their fellow-citizens are best able to deliver the sustainable recovery which, in the long run at least, is the surest way of producing it. He ought to know better, but Mr Alan Blinder, the newest vice-president on the Fed, recently backed up Mr Clinton's demands for more personable monetary policy-making, by suggesting that the Fed should focus more on employment growth for the next couple of years. The attractions for the president are obvious. So far this year, the Fed has delivered on its mandate rather more effectively than the White House: why not broaden it to include more jobs, as well as stable prices? There are (at least) two reasons why not. One practical difficulty, which would face any central banker who adopted a more explicit employment target, would be deciding what such a target might be. Today's complex mix of labour market trends and broader economic conditions in the world's main industrial economies give little clue as to what the best objective might be. The second, more timeless, reason why an additional employment target should be ruled out is that a multiplicity of aims, even if they could all be applied in practice, has proved inconsistent with monetary policy success. Mr Blinder's comments conflict with remarks by his chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, who last week warned that addressing monetary policy to the task of reducing unemployment would bring only instability in financial markets. At first glance, however, the US economic data released last week do add weight to Mr Blinder's case. Sustainable pace The revised real growth rate in US gross domestic product in the second quarter, at 3.8 per cent, was only 0.1 percentage points higher than previously thought, a considerably smaller revision than many had expected. Coupled with other subdued data, this adds to the impression that the five interest rate increases since the beginning of the year may be slowing the economy to a more sustainable pace. Given yesterday's news of an unexpectedly small 179,000 increase in non-farm payrolls for August, less dour observers than Mr Greenspan might argue that further monetary tightening should be delayed. Yet even Mr Blinder would not argue that a US unemployment rate of 6.1 per cent provides much room for non-inflationary stimuli to job growth. The most optimistic estimates of a rate of unemployment consistent with stable prices would not be much lower than 5 1/2 per cent. This year's household survey and labour department statistics have been sending contradictory signals on employment. But the difficulties in deciphering the data merely suggest that the Federal Reserve should avoid adjusting its interest rate policy in light of short term employment trends. German unemployment The Bundesbank is certainly not one for doing so. This week's Council meeting once again decided against lowering interest rates, despite the fact that pan-German unemployment continues to rise. With official German unemployment set to peak at about 10 per cent, the Bundesbank's determination to maintain monetary restraint seems downright perverse to the Americans. Yet Germany's economic recovery, though considerably younger than that of the US, already seems rather more 'voteful' for Chancellor Kohl than it has been for Mr Clinton. The difference in the two leaders' positions can be traced to political factors as well as economic ones. But a part of the spring in Mr Kohl's step, as he enters the last stage of his campaign for re-election, can be traced to the way the Bundesbank's tough stance on inflation has already produced low long-term interest rates. These, in turn, have enabled the German recovery to proceed more quickly than many had expected after such a prolonged downturn. The signs are that GDP in the second quarter rose about 2.3 per cent from 1993, considerably higher than expected a few months ago. Monetary policy can never be as finely tuned as many politicians would like. Estimating the effect of a given change in direction, let alone the time lag with which it operates, will always be a matter of educated surmise. But the same uncertainty need not, and should not, apply to the declared goals of its practitioners. Presidents have to juggle conflicting objectives and satisfy multifarious constituencies. Central bankers, by contrast, are best employed in sticking to the overriding objective of monetary stability. To judge by his recent Congressional travails, Mr Clinton too would benefit from showing a bit of single-mindedness. He should certainly resist the temptation to pressure the Fed to imitate his own often excessive desire to please.</p>

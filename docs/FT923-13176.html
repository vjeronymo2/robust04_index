			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Kalon has acceptances for 6.3% of Manders KALON, the Yorkshire-based paints maker, had received valid acceptances by Monday's first closing date in respect of 2.32m ordinary shares in its Pounds 92m hostile 8-for-3 bid for Manders (Holdings). This represents about 6.3 per cent of Manders issued ordinary share capital. The bidder has also received acceptances in respect of 21,555 Manders preference shares (2.7 per cent). Mr Roy Amos, chairman of the target paint, inks and property group, said he was pleased 'the vast majority of Manders shareholders have taken our advice to ignore the Kalon offer', adding that it showed the 'fragility of Kalon's business and share price'. The value of the offer had continued to fall, he said, to a 'mere 6 per cent premium' to Manders' share price of 237p immediately before the offer announcement. Mr Mike Hennessy, Kalon group managing director, said that the level of acceptances was 'extremely encouraging', adding that Manders shareholders were already demonstrating their disenchantment with Manders' record of failure. Kalon's shares closed down 1p at 93 1/2 p; Manders' slipped 2p to 243p.</p>

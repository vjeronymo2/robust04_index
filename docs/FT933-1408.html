			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Tories accused of links to quangos LABOUR yesterday accused the government of setting up a new corporate state by transferring control over billions of pounds of public money to quangos staffed by central government 'placepeople'. Launching an analysis of appointees to 41 of these non-governmental public bodies, the party highlighted the number who had links to companies which donate money to the Conservative party. The situation gave 'serious cause for concern', the party said. 'It amounts to a new hegemony . . . in which the interests of the governing elite and big business interests are seen to merge.' Mr John Smith, Labour leader, said the analysis directed 'a penetrating shaft of light into the murky world of Tory government today'. He said: 'Having aggregated unprecedented central power in Whitehall, they now impose their will through the new magistracy of ministerially appointed quangos. The only qualification for membership is to be 'one of us'.' Among the bodies singled out by yesterday's report was the Bank of England's 18-strong court of directors, six of whom were said to be associated with corporate donors to the Tories. Four directors of British Coal were said to have links to companies which gave money to the Conservatives and the Centre for Policy Studies, the right-of-centre think-tank. Three members of the board of British Rail were said to have similar connections to Tory party donors. Mr George Howarth, the Labour MP who prepared the report, said it reflected 'the rot and decay in the British political system whereby this mentality of 'you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours' has permeated the very sinews of government'. Mr Gerry Malone, Conservative deputy chairman, rebuffed the attack. To suggest a link between public appointments and Tory donations was 'an outrageous attack on people who offer their services to the public, often for little reward,' he said.

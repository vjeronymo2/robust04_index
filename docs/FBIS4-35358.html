			<p>BFN     [Text] This is Aden. Masses of our Yemeni people, our  heroes in Tawr al-Bahah, our heroic Armed Forces: 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih has dug a new graveyard with his own hands for  what is left of his routed armies. Tawr al-Bahah is in flames  lit by the invaders. Tawr al-Bahah is a new graveyard and a  holocaust of death. The invaders are dying without being  conscious of death.    Now, at this very moment, a battle is going on in which the  enemy is registering losses every second and minute. The sons  of Tawr al-Bahah are steadfast and our Armed Forces, the forces  of the Democratic Republic of Yemen are, true to tradition,  inflicting blows against the hordes and the routed remnants of  the invaders from the land, the air, and the sea. The enemies  are perishing but they are dreaming that they are advancing. It  is madness and death. They have no other fate except death.    God is Great. God is Great. Victory to the Democratic  Republic of Yemen.</p>

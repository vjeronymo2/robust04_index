			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Fang Yang-chung (2455 0111 1813) in Taipei] </F>   [Text] An official for the Civil Aeronautics  Administration (CAA) pointed out in the morning of 26 March:  Regarding an incident in which Japanese fighter planes  scrambled to make an "identification check" on a CAA test plane  on the morning of 25 March, the whole incident is nothing but a  "misunderstanding," probably a result of improper coordination  between a Japanese air traffic control center and the Japanese  Air Force. The Japanese air traffic control unit involved has  made an oral apology to the CAA.    The official pointed out: Before the plane left for Taipei's  air traffic information zone, the CAA had notified its Japanese  counterpart and obtained its consent. The whole process, which  was conducted properly, can be certified by referring to  existing records.    The official said: The CAA plane was conducting its task  when two F-4 Phantom planes of Japan's Self-Defense Force  scrambled to make an "identification check." Our unit involved  in the incident was quite confused by the Japanese move, and  immediately cabled the Japanese side to find out more about the  situation.    The CAA official pointed out: The Japanese air traffic  control unit soon apologized to the two pilots in the test plane  through our air traffic control unit. The Japanese side said  that the mistake was a result of faulty coordination between a  Japanese air traffic control unit and a Self-Defense Force  control unit. The incident was only a "misunderstanding"  because the fighter planes were merely making an "identification  check."    The CAA official said his office is still negotiating with  the Japanese air traffic control unit to work out methods to  avoid the recurrence of similar incidents.</p>

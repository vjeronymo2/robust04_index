			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Bonds: EIB braves saturated sector with Dollars 500m offering Only the most prestigious borrowers were brave enough to launch offerings in the increasingly saturated Eurobond market yesterday. The European Investment Bank raised Dollars 500m through a widely-expected offering of 10-year Eurobonds, and the ambitious pricing of eight basis points over the yield on US Treasuries reflected the intense competition for the mandate. Bidding on the delayed-rate settlement, a mechanism favoured by the EIB to protect itself against changes in interest rates before it on-lends the proceeds of the issue, was also said to be fierce. An official at lead manager SG Warburg said demand for the bonds had been stronger in eastern Asia than in Europe, where investors were more sensitive to yield spreads. He said when the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened to nine basis points, though other dealers reported that the bonds were quoted at a yield spread of 10 basis points. The market will watch the performance of the EIB's deal in the secondary market: the spread on the bonds, which some believe could widen to between 12 and 15 basis points, is likely to influence the pricing of the forthcoming offerings of 10-year dollar-denominated global bonds. The continued recovery in the UK government bond market prompted Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), the triple-A-rated German government agency for redevelopment, to raise Pounds 200m through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds. Dealers said the yield spread at launch, of 10 basis points over gilts, was fair in the light of outstanding 10-year sterling-denominated Eurobonds by other top-quality issuers. KfW's bonds also offered investors an alternative to the recent supply of long-dated issues by financial institutions. Lead manager JP Morgan said the recent underperformance of gilts compared with German government bonds made KfW's bonds attractive to investors in eastern Asia and Europe. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened to around 11 basis points, according to JP Morgan. However, other dealers said that, considering the short first coupon, the spread was closer to 14 basis points. Elsewhere, the return of SE-Banken to the Yankee market - the US domestic market for foreign issuers - for the first time since May 1992 gave the market a clear signal that investors were comfortable once again with Nordic issuers, now that they had dealt with most of their financial woes. The fact that SE-Banken was able to raise Dollars 200m through an issue of 15-year subordinated bonds, at a yield spread of 108 basis points over US Treasuries, was taken as further evidence that the turnround was almost complete.</p>

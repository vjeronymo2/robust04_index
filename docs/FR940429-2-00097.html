			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, a member firm with three stock execution machines, executing 7,500 trades in a non-specialist account, would be entitled to a credit of $375.00. In this example, the charges for the stock execution machines would be $750 ($250 fee multiplied by the 3 machines) minus the credit of $375 (1/2 [$250 fee] multiplied by 3 machines. If, however, in the above example the member firm had operated only two stock execution machines, the credit given would be $250 because the credit per member would be capped at 50 percent of the member's total stock execution machine billing charges. Thus, in the latter case, the total charges would be $250, which equals the total fees ($500) minus the credit per each machine (2 multiplied by $125). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend the Phlx's current schedule of fees and charges and to also enhance the Exchange's equity floor as a highly attractive floor of execution for a member firm's business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act in that it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members and other persons using its facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No written comments were either solicited or received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The foregoing rule change establishes or changes a due, fee or other charge imposed by the Exchange and therefore has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

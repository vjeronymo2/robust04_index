[Zizka] The Partnership for Peace plan is being reproached  for not providing real guarantees to the Central European  countries. In a meeting with the U.S. President, the Czech  Republic did not join the criticizing voices that were raised by  Poland, for instance. Why?    [Zieleniec] The Czech Republic, as well as other countries  in  this region, is not under an immediate threat. Of course, there  is a possibility of negative developments in East Europe,  particularly in Russia. Of course, we would be happy if we were  admitted into NATO right now or if the Partnership for Peace  plan provided a clear deadline for our admission. Nevertheless,  we have accepted the plan with pleasure. The entire plan was  drafted gradually. It looked quite different when we learned  about it for the first time. It seemed that it was only a  proposal for joint exercises and intensifying professional  contacts between the Armies. The intensive dialogue that we held  with the NATO countries, particularly with the United States,  had an impact on the final shape of the Partnership for Peace  plan. The partnership is built on the civilization's common  values and on a responsibility toward these values. We feel that  we view the life and the importance of the freedom of  individuals in the same way as the West Europeans do, and we are  happy that the Alliance understands this attitude of ours. I am  convinced that a quick opening of the Alliance eastward without  setting clear criteria would not be in our best interests. I  believe that we should be able to understand the feelings of  members of the Alliance because we ourselves will certainly  become a member within several years. If we want this  organization to be efficient and able to secure its goals--that  is, the protection of our life-style--this organization cannot  admit a country that is not stable politically or whose  appreciation of the said values is not so patent.    [Zizka] In the past, the Alliance admitted countries such as  Greece and Turkey, which did not meet the criteria for admission  at that time.    [Zieleniec] In the past, the Alliance was an anticommunist  pact. The problem of common values was not so important. The  main task was to stop communism. Now, the Alliance wants to  assume a new face. It seeks to find a new raison d'etre for its  existence. Admitting a country that does not fully accept the  said values and that is not prepared to defend them without  hesitation could create an opportunity for establishing a fifth  column within the Alliance, which would then become more  vulnerable in view of outside pressures.    [Zizka] Are you then rejecting the opinion that injustice  has  been done to us? Some people in the Czech Republic believe that  this a new Munich or Yalta.    [Zieleniec] The politicians who used these words before the  summit have stopped using them. The fact that they agree with us  also demonstrates the stability and unequivocality of Czech  foreign policy. Since the elections in 1992, our efforts to  become a NATO member and assume responsibility for the Western  values have become the key pillar of our policy. Many people in  neighboring countries who vehemently speak about joining NATO  did not even think about joining it several months ago.    [Zizka] Did you ever see any danger in the fact that  admitting the Central European countries into NATO could, sooner  or later, lead to a new division of Europe and that Russia and  other countries could find themselves on the other side?    [Zieleniec] Europe's security system has always been based  on  a certain structure and division. Two blocs do not have to stand  against one another and pose a threat to one another. On the  other hand, I repeat, the Alliance is a defense alliance that  secures freedom and democracy. Let us be sincere. All countries  do not have the same life-style, and not everywhere is the state  based on the same values. Democracy is not in all countries.    [Zizka] Should we take into account the fact that NATO's  eastward expansion could strengthen the position of Russian  nationalists?    [Zieleniec] I believe that the West's reaction in the form  of  the Partnership for Peace plan is quite adequate. It allows a  flexible reaction to possible developments in Europe--in Russia,  in particular--and gives us the opportunity to either become a  member of democratic European countries that accept the values  on which Western civilization has been built or to go in the  opposite direction.    [Zizka] This is the viewpoint of the West. What is the  viewpoint of the Central European countries? Should we also try  to prevent Russian nationalists from gaining more power?    [Zieleniec] This is not only our problem or the West's.  Russia is a nuclear power. It is a pan-European and even a  worldwide problem. However, we should not forget that the Czech  Republic's membership in the Western key structures is not a  question of our immediate profit in the economic or security  spheres. To us, it is a question of demonstrating our historical  identity and our place within the civilization. All of our  history is the history of a Western civilization. The fact that  45 years ago the Iron Curtain was established on our borders and  we were separated from the countries that belong to our family  as regards civilization, culture, and history does not mean that  we should forget the thousand years of our history.    [Zizka] Is our NATO membership a necessary condition?  Switzerland is not a member of the Alliance; nevertheless, no  one doubts that Switzerland belongs to Western civilization.    [Zieleniec] I could cite more examples--Sweden, for  instance.  Switzerland is in a different place than the Czech Republic. It  is impossible to become another Switzerland. We must take a firm  position in this space; otherwise, we could end up somewhere we  do not belong or want to belong to. The geographic position--or,  better, the geopolitical situation--plays a key role here. Our  situation adds shape to our history. Switzerland is Switzerland  because of where it is.    [Zizka] Were you not afraid that Clinton's visit could be  adversely affected by reports that the Federal Security and  Information Service and some politicians had tried to support  former President Bush in the election campaign?    [Zieleniec] No. I believe that the United States is a  serious  partner who would not want to put unverified reports on the  agenda of such an important meeting. We have to wait for the  results. I know that the appropriate authorities are conducting  an investigation. I must say that I would be very sorry if the  reports proved to be true.    [Zizka] The Czech Republic was against coordinating the  Visegrad countries' stance before the meeting. Does that mean  that Prague wants to spread propaganda about its exclusiveness?    [Zieleniec] No. We did not want to coordinate our course of  action. Finally, however, everyone took the same stance. The  whole Partnership for Peace plan is conceived as bilateral  relations between NATO and other countries. I do not believe  that it would be proper to cooperate in our region in any way  other than by holding consultations. A more binding cooperation  would be a direct road toward establishing alternative security  structures. This contradicts our objectives--that is, our early  admission to NATO. I believe that this is also clear to our  partners. There is another problem: Our views are very  different. We have not adopted the all-or-nothing strategy with  respect to NATO. It is not because we are too cautious or that  we would be satisfied with the little we could get, but there  are reasons that I have already explained. I am afraid that,  because of this, it was not possible to formulate our common  stance.    [Zizka] If, in the future, there are similar differences in  our views and we are not able to coordinate our joint course of  action when holding talks with Western institutions, the  Visegrad Four's role of conducting political dialogue will  dwindle. A solitary Czech voice will become hardly audible then,  will it not?    [Zieleniec] I do not believe so. The Partnership for Peace  plan testifies to the fact that they have listened to us. It is  important to create a good atmosphere in regional cooperation.  We should cooperate in the economy, as well as in the spheres  that are closely related to the problem of the  regions--environment, infrastructure, transportation network,  and energy supply. Of course, it is also important to be able to  solve political problems in our region. When we have this, plus  bilateral relations, the feeling of togetherness should prevail  in the region. Yet, I would like to stress again that I do not  understand the all-or-nothing attitude, which we heard about in  connection with the Visegrad cooperation. Those who have adopted  this attitude are damaging a vast sphere in which cooperation is  possible and in which something has already been done. Everyone  knows about a situation in his own life where more people had to  jointly fight to push for a certain thing. In such a situation,  a man who wants to force his all-or-nothing attitude upon others  becomes a destructive element. One of the basic features of  Western civilization is its ability to fruitfully cooperate and  do constructive work. I spoke about it with my partners, and I  believe that, when they were leaving Prague, they changed their  opinion, which is also due to the influence of our U.S. friends.  I hope that the summit, despite what we heard during its  preparation, will become a very positive influence that will  help intensify and accelerate cooperation within the Visegrad  group.    [Zizka] You stressed the fact that the economic sphere and  specific projects are the most important things in regional  cooperation. It also depends on the political contacts, whether  trust or mistrust will be established between countries. Certain  actions of Czech diplomacy--be it the absence of the defense  minister at the consultative meeting or your statement at the  time of the preparation of the summit, when you said that the  summit would have mostly a bilateral character--met with a  negative reaction.    [Zieleniec] I only described how much time will be devoted  to  what. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the  summit was as I said: The first day was devoted to Czech-U.S.  bilateral relations, and the second also had mostly a bilateral  character inasmuch as the United States conducted talks with  individual countries of the Visegrad Four. The dinner in honor  of President Clinton was the first multilateral action. The  increased nervousness, particularly in Poland, caused other  people to think that we wanted to usurp the entire meeting. This  was not the case. We were not influenced by the nervousness that  prevailed during the preparation of the meeting, and we  continued to push for our objectives. The Visegrad partners  finally left Prague satisfied. Their words testify to it. Slovak  Prime Minister Meciar rejected opinions that the Czech Republic  is a partner that does not want to cooperate. President Walesa  also eased up on his critical statements.    [Zizka] You mentioned Meciar's statements. His words are a  significant reversal because, shortly before that, Ivan Mjartan,  Slovak ambassador to Prague, said that the Czech Republic's  attitude could destabilize the region. Does that mean that a new  Czech-Slovak partnership is in the offing?    [Zieleniec] Our bilateral relations with Slovakia are a very  important matter. I believe that the reason for this shift, not  only in Slovakia's opinion but also in Poland and Hungary's, has  been caused by our diplomacy's decent and calm attitude toward  the preparation of the summit. We explained to our partners now  and again what the essence of our policy was. We explained our  efforts to search for a more intensive cooperation without  having to compromise on our stance. I believe that U.S.  diplomacy also helped us achieve that goal. During a meeting  with foreign ministers, Secretary of State Warren Christopher  stressed several times that bilateral relations were important  for establishing the security system in our region.    [Zizka] How do you view the Hungarian proposal to jointly  sign a treaty applicable to the Partnership for Peace plan?    [Zieleniec] Again, this is a search for symbols and a matter  of stressing something that is not important at all.    [Zizka] Some people are saying that the organization of  Clinton's visit was in the hands of the Americans. Czech  correspondents did not have easy access to individual events.  The security measures taken by the Americans blocked traffic in  Prague. The Czechs should have been given more clout in that  matter, should they not have?    [Zieleniec] President Clinton is a man who has enormous  power  due to the Constitution of the United States and the role the  United States plays in the world. This power often represents  the existential issue for the entire humankind. Because of  Kennedy's assassination in 1963, no wonder the United States has  become very concerned with the security of its presidents. The  visible part of the security measures was only a tiny part of  the entire job the United States had to do on our territory. It  is true that it complicated the life of many Prague citizens. I  would like to thank them for having coped with the situation. On  the other hand, I would also like to say that our laws and  sovereignty have not been violated at all. Our correspondent had  a difficult time getting to various events. This is the negative  side of the fact that there were hundreds of foreign  correspondents who referred to this event and transmitted the  picture of Prague and its representatives to the world. Two  billion people all over the world watched the visit. This is no  small effect of the visit. It paid off to put up with  discomfort, if not for other reasons, then for this effect.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Political equilibrium in the country is such that  most people would favour prolonged presidential and  parliamentary powers, Vice-Premier Shakhray, leading the Duma's  PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction, has declared  in an exclusive interview with Interfax. In his opinion, such  prolongation could be welcomed even by the opposition "since  none of its leaders would stand a chance to win the 1996  presidential race."    Shakhray is convinced that such possible extension could be  objected only by the ex vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy and  that part of the political opposition which is not represented  in the Federal Assembly. He stressed that the key role in  persuading the public to accept such possibility could be played  by "regional political elite", which would support it, if the  powers of all authorities, from top to bottom, were prolonged to  contribute to stability.    He believes that the president would "keep a pause" on the  matter longer than anyone else.    "In a transitional period, elections makes it possible to  let  the steam off a politically explosive boiler and thereby prevent  what happened on October 3-4, 1993," Shakhray believes.    As a legal basis to make this idea work, Shakhray suggests  that a law be passed to introduce amendments into the  constitution for an interim period. However, he emphasized that  its passage would require no less than two thirds of votes in  the Duma and three fourths of votes in the Federation Council,  and its ratification would need support from two thirds of the  Federation members.</p>

He said that Mr. Perry's visit to Russia focused on  bilateral  relations in the military/political sphere. In particular, the  two sides discussed the implementation of the air-defense  treaty, ban on nuclear testing and non-proliferation of nuclear  arms.    "Russia and the U.S. are particularly responsible for  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, because they are two major  nuclear powers. We should not focus all of our attention on the  NATO program Partnership for Peace. It is just "an element" of  relations between Russia and the West. Partnership For Peace  should be understood in a broad sense," Kokoshin said.    In his opinion, "one should approach Russia's entry in this  program very seriously." "The interests of Russia and its allies  under the CIS treaty on collective security should be fully  taken into account," Kokoshin said.</p>

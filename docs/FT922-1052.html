			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Pache set to be confirmed as Bull chairman MR BERNARD Pache, head of Charbonnages de France, the French coal board, is today due to be confirmed as chairman of Bull, the state-owned computer maker, writes William Dawkins. He will succeed Mr Francis Lorentz Mr Pache, 57, has no computer industry qualifications, in contrast with Mr Lorentz, who had been managing director of Bull for seven years before becoming chairman in 1989. But officials argue that the appointment is no more unusual than the choice of Mr John Sculley, the former Pepsi-Cola president, who took the top job at Apple Computer nine years ago. The new Bull chairman has spent most of his life in state industry. He trained at the Ecole Polytechnique, the elite public-service college, and started his career as an adviser to the industry minister. He joined Pechiney, the aluminium group, in 1966 and became chairman of the state-owned company in 1985. He was removed a year later by the incoming Gaullist government to make way for Mr Jean Gandois, Pechiney's current chairman. Since then, Mr Pache has performed a low profile but demanding job in managing the run-down of the French coal industry, which has been unable to compete against cheap imports from North America, Australia and Germany. He has reduced the coal workforce by more than half from 48,000 to 20,000 over the past six years, setting up job-creation and retraining schemes to compensate. His ability to wield the axe without creating strife appears to have won the government's admiration and could be useful at Bull, which is in the middle of its own three-year restructuring programme.

CBS SMK 52677 GLENN GOULD, the most controversial and elusive pianist of the century, died ten years ago this month, just a few weeks past his 50th birthday. He continues to attract calumny and extravagant praise in equal measure. There has been a posthumous collection of his writings (The Glenn Gould Reader, edited by Tim Page) as well as numerous biographies and appreciations, the most useful of which is Otto Friedrich's Glenn Gould: A Life and Variations. But the recordings remain the core of Gould's musical legacy, as they were always at the very centre of his life. Now CBS has launched its 'Glenn Gould Edition'. Over the next two years the company will make available remastered versions of everything the pianist ever recorded - concerts as well as studio sessions. It is an ambitious, fascinating project, promising many revelations and opportunities to savour again unforgettable performances. Gould's career as a concert pianist lasted little more than a decade; he gave his last public recital in 1964. Thereafter work in the studio took pride of place, with radio and television documentaries for Canadian Broadcasting as well as an enormously wide-range of recording projects. Tales of his eccentricity prospered until the peerless quality of his piano playing seemed obscured not only by some of his more questionable interpretations but also by the mythology surrounding them - his solitary lifestyle, his refusal to shake hands for fear of damaging his fingers, his extraordinary crouching style at the keyboard, the constant crooning that accompanied all his performances. How exceptional much of that playing was, and how penetrating the intelligence reinforcing it emerges vividly in the first batch of re-releases. Of course Gould was a wayward and sometimes downright perverse genius - as unpredictable in his choice of repertory as in his interpretations. His range was enormous, from the Elizabethan virginalists right up to contemporary composers. Yet he ignored the 19th-century romantics almost entirely, omiting Schubert, Schumann, Chopin and Liszt, and preferring instead to explore the century's byways - hence his versions of Bizet's Variations, Grieg's Piano Sonata (heavily indebted, ironically, to Schumann) and Richard Strauss's early Sonata, coupled here with the rarely heard and distinctly oddball melodrama with piano, Enoch Arden. Whatever the diversions, the keyboard music of Bach was the lynchpin of his repertory. The case for playing it on a modern piano was never put more convincingly than in Gould's performances of the Goldberg Variations, the English and French Suites and the 48 Preludes and Fugues. The 1955 version of the Variations is included here, the record with which he first burst upon an unsuspecting musical world. It remains a vivid document, daring in its selection of tempi, rhapsodical in its phrasing, crystalline in its grasp of structure. As always one can argue with some of the details, the extremes of tempi, the self-conscious phrasing, but never with the conviction and certainty with which everything is presented. Listening again to Gould playing Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven his instinctive contrapuntalism comes ever sharper into focus; he thought of music as essentially a linear, multi-layered art, and his style of playing, with its lean, sharp focused tone and prodigious control of articulation and phrasing, was suited perfectly to delineating such strands. That might account for his distaste for the high romantics, in which harmonic colour is so important expressively , as well as for his fondness among 20th-century composers for Schoenberg and Hindemith. The recordings of the Second Viennese School will presumably re-emerge later, but Hindemith is represented already by a collection of the brass sonatas accompanied by Gould. It is hardly familiar fare, but Gould focuses immense concentration on to what would otherwise seem routine accompaniments, just as he almost succeeds in rescuing a pallid collection of pieces by his Canadian contemporaries by the sheer force of his personality. The acuity of the musical mind, as in all the performances on these discs, is never to be doubted.</p>

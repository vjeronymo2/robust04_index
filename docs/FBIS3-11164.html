			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 Mar (NA) -- UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali said today that the decision to send a  peacekeeping force to Bosnia "is the exclusive responsibility of  the Argentine Government." He also categorically denied that he  had "demanded financial support" from the Carlos Menem  administration.    In a news conference held at the UN office in the Recoleta  Cultural Center in this capital, Butrus Butrus-Ghali said that  the decision to send a unit of Blue Helmets to  Bosnia-Herzegovina "must be made by the Argentine Government."    The UN secretary general clarified this issue after the  Argentine Government decision to accept a UN request to  contribute 150 soldiers to the hottest spot in the former  Yugoslavia.    He said: "The United Nations requests the troops, and we  specify the mission to every state member, but each government  defines the type of aid it can provide. In some cases it can  contribute personnel, and in other cases weapons. The aid will  always be welcome."    In this regard he said the United Nations "can act as  mediator" among the states that intend to provide troops,  weapons, or transportation means. He made it clear that  "pressure will never be exerted on a government to make a  contribution" of this kind.    Butrus-Ghali also pointed out that "no request for money was  made to Argentina," thus rejecting a report indicating that the  United Nations had requested from the government a contribution  of $10 million for financing various peacekeeping missions  around the world."    He said: "Argentina has paid its UN dues. It is the United  Nations that owes money to Argentina. But the problem is that  the United Nations is going through a financial crisis in  carrying out missions of this type and with the characteristics  it considers necessary."    He also indicated that states "must be convinced" to pay  their dues "for the symbolic value, among other things, of  cooperating to preserve peace among members."    Butrus-Ghali said the United Nations "is an instrument at  the  service of the state members." He added: "No country finds  military intervention in another country acceptable, unless it  is coordinated by the United Nations."    Butrus-Ghali also said that it had been decided to increase  the number of Security Council members based on the hundreds of  letters sent by UN members.    He said: "The majority are in favor of reforming the  Security Council created in 1945, when there were only 50  members. We now have 184 countries, and it is therefore  necessary to have new members on the council."    He believes the number of countries making up the Security  Council "will be increased to 18 or 19 members," although he  explained that it would be impossible for the change to be made  next year, when the United Nations will celebrate its 50th  anniversary.    He said the main current problems are "the ethnic wars"  within states, which he labeled micronationalisms  [micronacionalismos]. He said the UN mission "is to reconcile  the different positions."    He added: "UN actions are no longer restricted to keeping  the peace. It has to demobilize armies that are not linked to a  peace negotiating process, and must also rebuild bridges, roads,  hospitals, and schools after the war is over."</p>

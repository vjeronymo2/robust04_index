			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> We propose to amend &sect;&sect;255.3(c) and 257.40(b) to give States the flexibility to specify the conditions and limitations under which the State will make in-home care available. Therefore, we propose to add State plan requirements at &sect;&sect;255.1(n) and 257.21(o) to ascertain any conditions and limitations the State has placed on in-home care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Establishing the Local Market Rate for In-Home Providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ACF proposes to amend &sect;255.4(a)(3) (i) and (v) to give States the flexibility to eliminate the local market survey, required by &sect;255.4(a)(2), as the basis for establishing local market rates for in-home care providers. The proposed amendment provides that the local market rate for in-home providers must be at a level no lower than the level required by Federal and State provisions which govern domestic service workers. The State may choose to establish the local market rate at such a level without conducting the survey specified under &sect;255.4(a)(2). As an alternative, the State has the option to conduct a local market rate survey for in-home care if the State believes that the local market rate for such care is higher than that required by the FLSA and other Federal and State statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> The Effects Test and CCDBG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 658E(c)(2)(A) of the Block Grant Act requires States to provide assurances that parents are given the option of (1) enrolling their children with a provider who has a grant or contract to provide services, or (2) receiving a child care certificate with which to pay the provider of their choice. The Act also requires that children who are to be enrolled in contracted slots must be placed with the provider of their parents' choice whenever possible. For the CCDBG program, Congress clearly expected that parents would be able to choose from a wide variety of child care arrangements, including care in private homes by relatives or family providers; in churches, synagogues or temples; in community centers and schools; and in employer-provided facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the expectation that parents would be offered child care options, Congress clearly intended that CCDBG grantees ensure the safety of children in care. Therefore, grantees are also required by statute to promulgate health and safety regulations which adequately protect children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that Congress intended grantees to balance these provisions. In issuing the CCDBG regulations, ACF attempted to regulate how grantees would implement this balance. In order to protect children, grantees were mandated to ensure that health and safety requirements were in effect for all providers receiving funds under the CCDBG. Simultaneously, ACF promulgated additional provisions, known as the ``effects test,'' which withheld CCDBG funds if the grantees adopted requirements or procedures which had the effect of significantly limiting parental access to a category of care or type of provider.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many grantees and advocates in the field of child care have pointed out the potential tension between these regulatory provisions. In addition, many questions have been raised regarding the practical implementation of the effects test and the criteria by which to judge that health and safety standards have actually limited parental choice. Most compelling among such arguments has been the noted absence of statutory references to the effects test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are now proposing to eliminate the effects test. We do not intend and do not believe this proposal will weaken parental choice. In subpart D of the CCDBG regulations, &sect;&sect;98.30&hyph;98.34 delineate parental rights and responsibilities. We are not proposing to change anything in these sections that would in any way minimize the importance of parental choice. Parental choice remains a requirement for CCDBG at &sect;98.30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on two years of experience in the implementation of these programs, we do not believe that the effects test is necessary to protect parental choice. We have substantial evidence that grantees are indeed offering parents a choice of eligible providers through the design and operation of their certificate programs. In addition to information gathered from administrative staff during 33 on-site program reviews, we heard from parents and providers in focus group settings. Parents as well as providers spoke favorably about the choices that parents exercise in making arrangements for their children. The findings of these program reviews, along with our ongoing review of child care plans, reveal that grantees are operating certificate programs which fulfill the statutory parental choice directives. However, based on the experience of grantees attempting to balance these provisions, we are seeking focused comments on the potential impact of this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose that the CCDBG rule be amended by removing &sect;98.30(g) which sets forth the effects test and by removing related references at &sect;&sect;98.40(b)(2) (State and local regulatory requirements), 98.41(b) (health and safety requirements), 98.43(c) (payment rates), and 98.45(d) (registration).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> The Effects Test and Title IV&hyph;A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Herbert Hupka, chairman of the Silesian </F> Expellees Union and president of the East German Culture Council  Foundation, by correspondent Anna Fastnacht-Stupnicka; place and  date not given]    [Text] [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Was the East German Culture  Council Foundation, of which you are president, established by  members of the Expellees Union?    [Hupka] Its first president was a native Pomeranian, the  second was a Sudeten German, and I, the third, am a Silesian.  The foundation is governed by Article 96 of the Expellees  Union, which states that the expellees' cultural heritage should  be documented, cultivated, and kept alive in an ongoing process.  It is often said that the year 1945 was "year zero" for the  Germans, that some new process began at that time. I do not  hold that view. The expellees carried with them invisible  baggage of their own culture. It is our task to keep that  culture alive. We are not interested in preserving it in  museums, and we do not deal exclusively with the past. Among  other things, the foundation organizes competitions for the best  short stories and academic dissertations that deal with the  present time and look into the future.    [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Apart from organizing lectures on the  architectural heritage in Poland, do you also envisage helping  financially to restore cultural heritage sites?    [Hupka] Of course, money is needed if we are to save such  places as, for instance, Lubiaz Castle from falling into ruin.  But first and foremost we are concerned about making everyone  aware of the importance of this cultural heritage site and  informing the public about its present condition. We could  mobilize financial assistance through well-planned joint action.    [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Many such sites in Poland suffered  neglect in the past decades, but we must not forget that the  most extensive damage to material and intellectual cultural  goods was done by and during the war. Is the concern that  Germans show over these goods now an attempt at atonement?    [Hupka] Perhaps we should formulate this problem  differently. For us, the originating force behind our action is  the Polish-German good-neighbor treaty, which, among other  things, obliges Poles and Germans to assume joint responsibility  for goods representing cultural heritage. Jan Jozef Lipski was  aware of this obligation when he wrote: "The principal duty is  to prevent deterioration and destruction of material objects of  cultural heritage. To tolerate and allow their deterioration,  to undervalue their cultural significance only because they do  not belong to `our' culture, or to attempt to `erase' their  German origin is to show Polish patriotism in a very unfavorable  light." So our concern for these goods is not some kind of  atonement on our part, as you suggested, but attests to our  determination to put into practice the provisions of the  Polish-German treaty.    [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Before the treaty was signed, the  Expellees Union protested against it very strongly. Have you by  now accepted its provisions on good-neighborly relations and  inviolability of the existing borders?    [Hupka] Once a treaty is signed by both sides, it must be  respected. It must be acknowledged, recognized, and accepted.  We are all opposed to the sort of thing that is currently  happening in Yugoslavia and to the ethnic cleansing taking place  there. In the same way, I am opposed to the idea of expelling  people from their homeland. Let me recall here the words  spoken by Vaclav Havel, who said that the expulsion of the  Germans was not an act of squaring accounts for the wrongs  suffered but one of revenge. It is my wish to see Poles and  Germans jointly condemn the expulsion of the Germans as a  criminal act.    [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] But was not the war that led to it  the ultimate crime?    [Hupka] Of course, the war was a crime perpetrated against  us all by Hitler and Stalin. Nevertheless, you must remember  that the invasion of France and Belgium was a crime, too, yet no  one was expelled from those territories. One crime should not  generate another.    [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Do the expellees want to return here?    [Hupka] The right to one's homeland and to  self-determination is a recognized right and, as such, should be  respected. Once Poland has become a member of the European  Union, everyone will be able to decide where they want to  settle. The problem will automatically cease to exist.    [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Is this why Germans are so eager to  see Poland join the European Union?    [Hupka] We are all Europeans. We cannot place Poles lower  than the Danes, or any other nation. Everyone in Europe should  belong to the Union, and there are no hidden agendas in what I  am saying. However, some people in Germany, just as in Poland,  are opposed to the idea of "accelerated" integration.    [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] People in Poland associate your name  unequivocally with revisionism. However, for some time now your  utterances have seemed to acquire a more conciliatory tone.  Does this mean that you are changing your views?    [Hupka] We have never been advocates of revanchism. I have  not changed, nor have I ever expressed anti-Polish sentiments.  It was just that my views were presented and interpreted by  others in that way for the past 40 years.    [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] How do you like what you see in Polish  Silesia nowadays? Have you noted any changes for the better in  recent years?    [Hupka] This is my fifth visit here since 1990. Of course,  many things have changed for the better. But I should say that  things are still not changing fast enough. It could be that  this assessment is colored by my temperament.    [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] What do you think of the recent  incident provoked by skinheads in Dziewkowice or the disruption  of the celebrations commemorating the 3 May Constitution and the  Silesian uprisings, which happened recently at St. Anna's Mount?    [Hupka] We are, of course, very critical of these incidents.  We call such phenomena nationalism and chauvinism, but we do not  generalize their occurrence and claim that they represent a  specifically Polish trait. Those people are simply extremists.  We are equally opposed to similar things happening in Germany  now, such as attacks against the Turks, and we would not like  these phenomena to be generalized and held against all Germans,  either. We want to bring down barriers, not erect new ones.    [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Thank you for talking with us.</p>

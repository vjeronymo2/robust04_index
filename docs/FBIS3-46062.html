The  conference put forward demands on party schools at all levels,  urging them to serve as an important front for rotationally  training and cultivating party-member leading cadres, training  the party's theoretical cadres and studying, upholding and  developing Marxist- Leninist-Mao Zedong Thought, and to become a  furnace for enhancing the party spirit of cadres and for  cultivating and tempering cadres.    Before the convocation of this conference, Jiang Chunyun,  secretary of the provincial party committee and president of the  Party School of the provincial party committee, put forward  specific demands on the work of party schools. He said: During  the past year, the whole province achieved noticeable  improvements in both the work of party schools and reform.  Party committees at all levels and all party schools should  further intensify their consciousness on reform, regard the  deepening of reform as the basic motivation for promoting the  work of party schools and grasp it firmly and well until good  results are achieved. We should carry out reform measures and  methods that help the enhancement of teaching quality and the  level of scientific research and the mobilization of enthusiasm  and creativity in teaching and administrative staff according to  our capability, and do our best.    The conference felt that under the new historical  conditions,  the tasks of party schools should not be lightened, but  strengthened; the status of party schools have not been lowered,  but become more important; and party school education should  only be strengthened, but not weakened. Party committees at all  levels should further strengthen leadership over the work of  party schools and actively help them solve practical problems in  the course of development. Financial departments at all levels  should actively support party school education and construction  with financial input. Party schools at all levels should vie to  be the first-grade party schools with the spirit of reform and  blazing new trials.    Dong Fengji, member of the standing committee of the  provincial party committee and director of the Propaganda  Department of the provincial party committee, attended and  addressed the conference.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "High-Speed Sorter for Plastic </F> Parts"]    [Text] A consortium of European companies and research  organisations has won a research contract worth nearly Ecu 1.5m  from the Commission of the European Communities (CEC) to develop  a system for the identification and separation of plastics in  mixed waste. The consortium's proposal -- submitted under the  CEC's Brite-Euram Industrial and Materials Technologies  Programme -- was awarded an A1 (outstanding) assessment in  competition with over 1,250 proposals.    The proposed system has major implications for the  efficiency  and cost effectiveness of recycling plastics by detecting  specially developed 'tracers' added in minute quantities to the  various plastics used by the packaging, automotive and other  industries. The tracers will be detected by an advanced device  using the latest fluorosensor technology.    One benefit of the system is that it is able not only to  detect different generic plastics but also to segregate  different grades of the same material. The potential for  identifying and separating a wide range of different plastics  types and grades is virtually unlimited.    The system is unique in being able to identify plastics  containing black and other strongly absorbing colours. It is  also able to operate with materials which are surface  contaminated, the system will also be able to identify and  reject specific unwanted materials.    A product of the contract will be a pilot sorting machine;  this will be capable of making at least 100 identifications and  of sorting plastics at speeds of at least 10 articles/s.  Proving trials will take place at a waste management site.    The consortium comprises: Pira International, UK -- lead  contractor and project co-ordinator; Bayer AG, Germany -- will  develop fluorescent tracers under its own patent; Cranfield  University (RMCS), UK -- will develop a sensitive detection  system using fluorosensor technology; Newell Engineering, UK --  will create handling systems for high speed segregation of  plastics articles and construct a pilot sorting machine; APME,  Technical and Environment Centre (formerly PWMI), Belgium --  responsible for proving the processability of the tracers and  the conversion of plastic containing them into three dimensional  articles; and Laboratoire National d'Essais France --  responsible for checking the stability of the tracer/polymer  systems.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House in the black but gloomy The Pounds 13.4m interim pre-tax profit reported by Trafalgar House yesterday represented the group's first since 1990. Over-shadowing the results were warnings from both Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, and Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive. Mr Gormly in particular cautioned that the recovery would be 'slow and steady, rather than spectacular'. Operating profits in the six months were Pounds 25.3m, against Pounds 80.8m losses when the property operations showed a deficit of Pounds 102.8m. The engineering business reported lower profits. Mr Gormly said the recession had particularly affected the group's business in Europe and the downturn in North Sea work had been rather deeper than expected. The division managed to maintain its order book at Pounds 2.2bn. Mr Gormly said further job cuts would be necessary. Operating profits in the construction division were ahead at Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 1.1m) on flat turnover of Pounds 378.3m. The overall order book was maintained at Pounds 1.2bn. The property division showed operating profits of Pounds 4.2m compared with a profit of Pounds 200,000 excluding exceptionals in the year-ago period. COMMENT Although yesterday's results were lower than most analysts had expected, what really concerned them was the fact that there seems little prospect of real improvement for some time. The interim dividend was passed, but this was for administrative reasons. Similarly, although the group sustained a cash outflow of Pounds 46m during the first half, this included the on-balance sheet refinancing of some Pounds 20m of associates' borrowings. Despite these reassurances analysts were marking down their full year pre-tax profit forecasts yesterday to about Pounds 50m or Pounds 55m. That might generate earnings of about 2.2p. Despite yesterday's decline the shares are still trading on an unjustifiably high multiple close to 40.</p>

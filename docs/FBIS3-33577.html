The agreements reached between the rebels and the  government,  through the mediation of the Catholic Church and the CIAV  [International Commission of Support and Verification]-OAS,  establish the following main points: progressive disarmament of  the 3-80 troops between 2 March and 8 April, demilitarization of  the area, and former recontras joining the command posts of  police headquarters in the municipalities of Jinotega and Nueva  Segovia.    Likewise, the document signed between the government and the  rearmed rebels establishes various social and economic  development programs in the area. The agreements were signed  after nearly 6 hours of intense negotiations and several foiled  attempts in recent days.</p>

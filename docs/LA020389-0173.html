			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAINTS TO TRAIN IN WISCONSIN AGAIN  </P> <P> The New Orleans Saints will return to the University of Wisconsin, LaCrosse, to  train for the 1989 season, president and general manager Jim Finks announced  today.  </P> <P> The Saints moved their training camp from Hammond, La., to LaCrosse last year,  in part to escape the heat and humidity of a south Louisiana summer.  </P> <P> "Our reasons for returning to LaCrosse are the same as 1988," Finks said. "The  university has fine facilities, plenty of field space and an overall good  atmosphere for a training camp."  </P> <P> The Saints camp will run from July 21-Aug. 25, he said.  </P> <P> The Saints will host the Chicago Bears for three days of workouts during  training camp, Finks said. It will be the second training season the Saints and  the Bears have worked out together. New Orleans left its camp in Hammond to  drill with the Bears in Platteville, Wis., in 1987. No times have been set for  the 1989 workouts, Finks said.  </P></p>

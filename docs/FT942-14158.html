			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Diversification undermines picture of health - Maggie Urry considers what the future holds for London International as it tries to rebuild its finances The real surprise about London International Group, where losses in the year to March are now expected almost to eliminate net assets of Pounds 120m, must be that a company with an apparently decent branded business and strong market positions could find itself in such a parlous state. The past management, notably Mr Alan Woltz who became chief executive in 1979, adding the chairmanship in 1985, before splitting the roles in 1991, cannot escape blame. Many of the problems stem from an ambitious diversification programme in the early 1980s, which was an attempt to compensate for an expected long-term decline in the basic condom business. In 1982 a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report said that LIG's 95 per cent share of the UK condom market operated against the public interest and the company was forced to submit to price controls. Among other ideas, LIG had a flirtation with the fine china industry in the mid-1980s, but was luckily prevented from going too far. It was photoprocessing, however, which proved LIG's doom. In 1982 it started on a trail of acquisitions and rationalisation which cost between Pounds 60m and Pounds 70m in total resulting in a 30 per cent share of a now sharply declining market. The legacy of that diversification is sizeable trading losses, and an even worse drain on cash, to the extent that if a sale is not tied up soon LIG may be forced to close the business at even more expense. No doubt any buyer will be aware of that in negotiating a price for taking the business away. While chasing these diversifications, LIG suddenly found that the onset of the Aids epidemic in the mid-1980s gave new life to its condom and surgical gloves businesses. But although sales of condoms surged in 1987, growth in the world market for condoms is now only about 2 or 3 per cent a year. And LIG does not appear to have managed its UK condom business as well as it might. Margins are good, but despite price controls effectively deterring competition, its market share has fallen to 75 per cent. The controls have just been lifted and LIG aims to increase prices but may find margins weaken as higher advertising costs will be needed to keep rivals at bay. In addition, costly rationalisation of the activity has been needed. A Pounds 10m charge was taken in 1989 with a Pounds 13.4m charge against surgeon's gloves in 1991. A Pounds 61.6m rights issue in 1991 was required to repay a convertible bond, issued to finance the purchase of condom businesses in Italy and Spain. Group profits in 1992 bore yet more exceptional charges totalling Pounds 22.5m. Despite rationalisation and raising new equity, the balance sheet deteriorated. By March 1993 debt of Pounds 127.7m exceeded net assets. With cash pouring out of the business, borrowings rose to Pounds 154m by September last year. The question now is whether the business which will be left after yet more cuts and disposals has sufficient potential to persuade shareholders to provide enough new equity to give it a chance of independent survival. New management must convince investors that with a restructured balance sheet, and a reshaped business, the company's core activity of condoms and gloves has the potential to service its remaining debt and give a good return. Profits in the division which LIG plans to keep have been under pressure. LIG is the leader in the worldwide branded condom sector, holding 22 per cent of that market, but this accounts for less than half the total market. And with the price of condoms low, LIG's sales of Pounds 105m in 1992-93 do not make Durex a substantial global brand. Surgeon's gloves are an even smaller market, with LIG's sales in 1993 at Pounds 39.3m. While the group is widely regarded as a technical leader in its field, it is not a very large field. With chunks of its sales going to various health services, LIG could be vulnerable to penny-pinching and supplier reductions. With industrial gloves, domestic rubber gloves and a rump of the health and beauty products business, LIG might have on-going sales of Pounds 250m which could produce profits of Pounds 35m before interest charges, one analyst estimates. LIG then gets into the problem of how much debt it can support. A smaller equity issue, of say Pounds 50m, would leave more debt, but result in lower pre-tax profits and earnings per share. Reducing debt further, through a larger equity issue, perhaps up to Pounds 100m, would mean greater dilution to earnings per share. One analyst reckons the shares, which closed yesterday at 114p, down 7p after an 8p fall on Tuesday, are still overvalued. Without a bid, he thinks the shares are worth between 40p and 50p, while a predator might be prepared to pay about 75p. Another calculates that it would take a Pounds 100m rights issue to reduce gearing to 50 per cent by 1996. That would probably take a 2-for-3 issue, substantially cutting earnings per share. Whether the rights issue is Pounds 50m or Pounds 100m, shareholders will have to think hard before throwing good money after bad.</p>

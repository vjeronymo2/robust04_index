			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / BAT bid for American Tobacco facing US court block The US Federal Trade Commission said yesterday it would seek to block BAT Industry's Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) takeover bid for American Tobacco because the deal could lead to reduced competition and 'co-ordinated' pricing among US cigarette makers. The FTC said it would ask a federal court in New York on Monday to halt the takeover until a full 'administrative trial and any appeals' had been heard. A trial could start within a few weeks with a verdict before the year-end. BAT, the UK tobacco and financial services group, and American Brands, the US consumer products group selling American Tobacco, said they would jointly fight the FTC. 'We think the creation of a stronger number three manufacturer will be beneficial to consumers,' BAT said. 'It's a setback but we have had them before with American takeovers.' It took BAT a year to win approval to buy Farmers, a California insurer, in 1988 in the face of hostility from state regulators. BAT's Brown and Williamson subsidiary, the maker of Kool and other brands, is the number three cigarette manufacturer in the US. However, buying fourth-placed American Tobacco, maker of Carlton and Lucky Strike, would lift its market share from 11 per cent to 18 per cent. Number one is Marlborough-selling Philip Morris with more than 40 per cent and second is the Reynolds subsidiary of RJR-Nabisco with about 30 per cent. The deal would also have the effect of reuniting the Lucky Strike brand, which is owned by American Tobacco in the US but by BAT outside the US. The trade commissioners, acting on their staff's recommendation, said the deal would remove one of the six manufacturers left in the US, a market 'highly concentrated and largely shielded from new entrants'. In the past, American Tobaccohas not followed other manufacturers' price increases so its takeover would 'remove an aggressive competitor', the FTC said, 'and increase the chances of co-ordinated actions among the remaining manufacturers'. 'This is not a picture of the market we'd recognise,' BAT said. It and American Tobacco had each delivered some one million pages of documents to the FTC and held meetings with its staff since the deal was announced in April. In recent weeks BAT began to realise the staff were hostile to the takeover but it hoped the commissioners would overrule them.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>   [Text] China has vowed to prevent hazardous waste  materials from being allowed into the country. China Radio's  Song Danqi recently interviewed the deputy director of the State  Bureau of Environmental Protection. Wu Jia has the report:    The Chinese Government is taking measures to prevent  hazardous waste materials from being shipped from overseas into  its territory. Wang Yangzu, deputy director of the State Bureau  of Environmental Protection, delivered a stern warning in  Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province, last Sunday [12 June].    [Wang speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation]  He explained: On 25 September 1993, two Chinese corporations  and a group of companies from the Republic of Korea [ROK]  shipped 1,288 tons of harmful chemical waste to Nanjing Port  under the label of fuel oil. The illegal shipment of chemical  waste from South Korea was uncovered by the Nanjing Port  authorities and caught the attention of the State Council.  Through the joint efforts of the departments involved, on 5  March this year, the waste was returned to the port of  departure. Wang Yangzu further expressed the Chinese  Government's stance against importing of waste from abroad.    [Wang speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation]  He said: In recent years the cases of transnational  transferring of harmful waste and rubbish were on the increase.  He cited another example where Germany had shipped a large  number of waste plastic bags to China. He said although a small  number of items of harmful waste can be used as recycling  materials, the importing must be under strict control. In  general, almost all dangerous wastes are prevented from entering  China's territory. The State Bureau of Environmental Protection  and the General Administration of Customs are now closely  cooperating to prevent pollutants from being shipped into China.  Meanwhile, China is now formulating a law to prevent solid  waste pollution. Wang Yangzu said China will take some legal  and economic actions against the violations of the law and  regulations. He revealed a number of people from domestic  transportation department have been punished in the case of the  ROK shipping chemical wastes to Nanjing port. He suggested that  environmental protection must be based on legislative  administration. All individuals and companies should take  responsibility for the sustainable development of the global  environment.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Kazuo Ogura </F> by AERA staffer Toshiaki Miura; place and date not given]    [Text] [Miura] You have been advocating "restoration of  Asia" by insisting that we should reconsider Asia as a symbol  with positive value. Why are you so particular about Asia?    [Ogura] Speaking of Asian diplomacy, there is a serious  misunderstanding in Japanese society: To say "no" to the United  States means nationalism, and nationalism leads to militarism.  Such an outdated syllogism goes unchallenged. The reason is  that the development of Asian diplomacy had been possible only  within a harsh international situation called a showdown between  the East and the West.    However, the framework of the Cold War has definitely  collapsed and there is a need for building a new coordinated  axis. My idea is that there is no need for Japan to follow the  Asian policies of Europe and the United States; there is no need  for Japan to assume that its Asian policies should be identical  to those of Europe and the United States from the very  beginning, even if its resultant policies happen to be identical  to theirs.    [Miura] There is a view in Europe and the United States that  Asia is a threat.    [Ogura] The view that Asia is a threat has existed for a  long  time. That view was politically meaningless when Asia was  powerless. Now, however, it is whispered about that the economic  development of Asia is a political threat. The view that Asia  is a threat is a self-centered way of thinking in Europe and the  United States that the center of the world exists outside Asia.    Europe and the United States should, instead, ask the  question: Asia occupies an important part in the world; what is  the problem in Asia in the world context? Moreover, Asia tends  to be silent about itself, which in a way inflames an  Asia-threat theory.    Japan is said to be faceless, but Asia is more faceless than  Japan. The international community should take Asia as a  positive entity and both should work hand in hand, and Asia also  should be aware of its responsibility commensurate to its power.    [Miura] What is the significance of Vietnam in relation to  Asian diplomacy?    [Ogura] Vietnam is typical of Asia. The annual national  income is extremely low, averaging $200 to $300 per person.  Vietnam embodies a poor Asia. But its literacy is 85 to 90  percent. Vietnam also has an aspect of an industrious East  Asia, as shown by an old woman street vendor reading a communist  party paper.    Moreover, Vietnam fell victim to the invasion of foreign  countries in its history. At the same time, it was an invader  of its neighboring counties. The promotion of Japan's diplomacy  with Vietnam having such various aspects can be a touchstone of  Japan's new Asian diplomacy.    [Miura] If Japan tries to pursue a diplomacy of its own,  does it not lead to a collision with the United States?    [Ogura] Vietnam regards its diplomacy with the United States  pragmatically, and it will not take a hard line toward the  United States. Its relationship with the United States will  rather be determined by U.S. domestic politics and its Asian  diplomacy. Although it may take time, the relationship between  the United States and Vietnam will improve. Even if the  relationship between the United States and Vietnam goes wrong,  the relationship between Japan and Vietnam will not become  difficult.    [Miura] Will there be Japan-U.S. friction concerning the  Vietnamese market in the future?    [Ogura] I would have preferred that Japan and the United  States strike at each other violently in a trade war. The thing  is, although there is a Vietnamese boom in Japan, it has not  made any investment in Vietnam actually. Japanese businesses  are cautious; they consider Vietnam's infrastructure and  legislation to still be inadequate.    Furthermore, Japanese businesses have already established  their world strategy, and even if a new element called Vietnam  is proposed, it does not fit into their strategy. It will take  some time before Japanese enterprises go into business in  Vietnam.    Meanwhile, the United States will move briskly once it sets  its mind on business, because the United States has past  business experience in the former South Vietnam era. I am  worried that Vietnam may express its dissatisfaction at Japan's  inactivity despite its professed Vietnamese boom.    [Miura] What kind of role can Japan play in Vietnam?    [Ogura] Japan's cooperation with third countries is  promising. Although it has money, taking Japanese products there  will be costly due to the stronger yen. It will work better if  Japan provides funds and leave them to the care of third  countries. Concerning Vietnam, the United States and France  have plenty of know-how historically.    [Miura] What is your view on the future possibility of  Vietnam?    [Ogura] Human resources are said to be Vietnam's strong  point. Speaking of human resources, Vietnam's neighbor, China,  has human resources of more than 1 billion. From the standpoint  of a business strategy, the question is which human resources  are superior in quality.    After all, the important point is stability and union within  Vietnam. It depends whether reform policy can be promoted in a  manner not contradictory to stability and union within Vietnam.</p>

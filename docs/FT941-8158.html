			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Rhone-Poulenc bids for French drug distributor Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday launched a FFr3bn (Pounds 340m) bid for Cooperation Pharmaceutique Francaise (Cooper), a private company which is one of France's biggest distributors of drugs and healthcare products to retail chemists. The offer was described as 'attractive' by Cooper. It requires the approval of shareholders, including 3,000 pharmacists who control about 40 per cent of the equity. The friendly bid is the first significant strategic move by Rhone-Poulenc since its privatisation in November last year. It comprises a cash offer of FFr2,400 per share in Cooper, or an exchange of each Cooper share for 18 Rhone-Poulenc shares. The proposed deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions by pharmaceuticals companies seeking to strengthen their presence in distribution. Last year in the US, Merck bought Medco, a drugs mail order company, and Gehe of Germany gained control of OCP, Cooper's principal French rival. Rhone-Poulenc said the acquisition would strengthen its position in France's network of pharmacies. 'Cooper has very close links with pharmacies as supplier and adviser and does business with 90 per cent of the 22,000 pharmacy outlets in France.' Rhone-Poulenc and Cooper already have commercial ties. Cooper distributes Doliprane, the paracetamol tablet which is Rhone-Poulenc's biggest selling drug in France, and the Vaxigrip flu vaccine produced by the company's Institut Merieux unit. The offer price of FFr2,400 per share is equivalent to 17.7 times the earnings per share achieved by Cooper in 1992 and twice the net asset value of the shares. Cooper, founded in 1907, achieved sales of FFr1.8bn in 1992, and an estimated FFr2bn last year. Rhone-Poulenc said it had structured the offer to minimise the impact on its balance sheet. Last year, the group's net debt was reduced by more than FFr9bn, from FFr33.7bn to FFr24.1bn. Rhone-Poulenc said it anticipated about half of the value of the offer would be represented by the share exchange and there would be no significant impact on earnings per share. The company's shares slipped yesterday, however, falling FFr4.7 to FFr140.5.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE AIRPORT NOISE-ABATEMENT ISSUE  </P> <P> Reference is made to Rebella's letter "John Wayne Airport Noise Abatement" (May  14): Even if he has established one of the most comprehensive noise-abatement  programs in the country, it still has a long way to go before it becomes as  effective as he apparently thinks it is.  </P> <P> An excellent illustration of conditions and effectiveness can be witnessed  almost every morning at very shortly after 7 o'clock. Usually there are two or  three Douglas types following one after the other, then a two-engine job like  AirCal used to fly and lastly one of the English-made AirBus four-engine types.  It has been my experience to note that all of the Douglas birds, seemingly all  of the same model, vary significantly in noise emission and all are louder than  either of the following different types, and, of course, the British-made plane  is the least loud of any. My conclusion is that not only is there a difference  in performance by make and model but also in the way the pilots comply.  </P> <P> Of course, striking an average over each quarter gives a false sense of  security. One plane traveling very quietly can pull the average down  significantly while, if evaluated separately, it would indeed show that the  violations are blatant and quite injurious.  </P> <P> I am reliably informed that noise of this type is insidious and compounds upon  itself, which makes it essential that Rebella evaluate the commercial carriers  on the same basis as general aviation, i.e., on a single basis, and certainly  should not only exercise the prerogative of expulsion of the violaters, but  also publicize his dedication to have the standards observed.  </P> <P> ALAN L.

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Irish union opposed to C&amp;W telecom bid The bid by Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, to form an alliance with Telecom Eireann, the Irish state operator, faces stiff opposition from Ireland's communications workers' union. But pressure on Telecom Eireann to conclude a deal with C&amp;W appears set to increase as its domestic monopoly comes under further assault from new operators targeting the lucrative Dublin business market. Mr David Begg, general secretary of the CWU, said yesterday that his union would fight the creation of any joint venture between TE and C&amp;W. 'All the information we have about C&amp;W is very negative: they are very anti-union; their commercial focus is to develop the Asia-Pacific market, and this does not suggest a level of commitment to Telecom Eireann,' he said. C&amp;W's bid, believed to be worth up to IPounds 500m (Pounds 480m), is for a joint venture with TE, the core of which would be TE's existing international traffic. The government insisted yesterday it would not be party to the privatisation of TE. A spokesman for Mr Dick Spring, the deputy prime minister and Labour party leader, said 'The government . . . is considering strategic alliances but no decision will be made until there is full consultation with the unions'. Mr Begg said that the CWU was 'not opposed in principle' to strategic alliances being formed with other telecommunications companies, but was 'deeply concerned' if this involved the 'siphoning off' of the most profitable parts of TE's business. However, TE already faces acute pressure on its international business from companies - including Cable and Wireless - offering large Dublin businesses leased lines for international traffic priced below TE's international tariffs. The latest entrant to the market is E-Sat, a private Irish company, which last month launched an international leased-line business in alliance with Sprint, the US long-distance carrier. E-Sat, which already has 10 customers, is pitching at companies spending more than Pounds 3,000 a month on international telecoms. It claims its charges are between 10 and 30 per cent cheaper than those charged by TE. The EU's telecommunications services directive obliges state companies to make leased lines available to companies wishing to re-sell them, providing they are not used to carry traffic originating on the public network. Mr Douglas Goldschmidt, E-Sat's chief executive, said: 'TE already faces stiff competition in its home market: it cannot shield behind its monopoly for much longer.' In a bid to stem the loss of international traffic, TE sharply reduced its international tariffs last September, increasing local charges. But it is still struggling with a high cost base. According to a recent survey by Lehman Brothers, TE has lower labour productivity than any other national telecoms company in the EU, with more than twice as many employees per line as the Netherlands and France.</p>

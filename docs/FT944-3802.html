			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / European consumers gloomy Business confidence is rising fast in Europe on the back of the broader economic recovery, but many consumers do not appear to be seeing the benefits, the European Commission says. The preliminary results of its business and consumer confidence survey for November showed that consumer confidence remained unchanged between October and November, after rising rapidly since the start of the year. Industrial confidence, by contrast, rose for the 16th successive month, almost reaching record levels. The lowest level of consumer confidence was recorded in Portugal, where consumers remain deeply gloomy about their country's economic prospects over the next 12 months. Consumers in Italy were the second most pessimistic, although this largely reflected concern about their household finances, rather than the country's economic prospects as a whole. The country with the strongest consumer confidence was Denmark, where consumers were very upbeat both about their country's economic prospects over the next year and about their own finances. Consumers in Ireland were also relatively upbeat.</p>

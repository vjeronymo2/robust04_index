			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Books: Romantic in exile - The life and work of Russian poet Joseph Brodsky WATERMARK by Joseph Brodsky Hamish Hamilton Pounds 12.99, 135 pages THE CITY of Leningrad in 1940, when Iosif Brodskii was born there into a Jewish family, was not an environment hospitable to poets. Even so, in spite of the hostility of the authorities, poets lived and worked there, notably the great Anna Akhmatova. At the end of the war in 1945 she was preparing a major collection of work and establishing links with the West when suddenly the authorities clamped down on her. Her poetry was described as 'ideologically harmful'; the print-run of a book she was about to publish was destroyed and Akhmatova was expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union. After Stalin's death in 1953, and the beginning of de-Stalinisation in 1956 under Khrushchev, she began to publish again. By the end of the decade Akhmatova had become literary godmother to a group of free-minded young poets based in Leningrad. One of them was Anatoly Nayman, who became Akhmatova's secretary and whose interesting book Remembering Anna Akhmatova was published in the UK last year by Peter Halban (Pounds 18). Another was Joseph Brodsky, as he is now universally known, who wrote the introduction to that book. After the fall of Khrushchev in 1964, the climate for poets worsened again and this time the backlash of repression struck at the 24-year-old Brodsky. As a poet who did not belong to the Writers' Union, Brodsky was a non-person and he found himself facing trial. The charge was parasitism or vagrancy (tuneyadstvo in Russian). At his trial Brodsky showed a similar resilience to that of Oscar Wilde when affirming from the criminal dock the right of an artist to practise his art in whatever circumstances. Judge: 'Who recognised you as a poet? Who gave you the authority to call yourself a poet?' Brodsky: 'No one. Who gave me the authority to enter the human race?' Judge: 'Have you studied for it?' Brodsky: 'For what?' Judge: 'To become a poet. Why didn't you take secondary education at school where they prepare you, where you can learn?' Brodsky: 'I didn't think poetry was a matter of learning.' Judge: 'What is it then? Brodsky: 'I think it is . . . (in confusion) . . . a gift from God.' And as in the case of Wilde, Brodsky's brilliance of response did not do him much good. The female judge passed a sentence of exile in a remote locality for a period of five years hard labour. The young Brodsky was sent to serve it at a state farm near Archangel. Akhmatova and others did what they could for him. Eventually after two years Brodsky, in poor health through suffering the intense cold of the Russian north, was pardoned and released. He recovered, continued to write poetry, and found a job in a publishing-house in Moscow. Nicholas Bethell, who translated the above transcript, went to see him, and made versions in English for the first collection of Brodsky's poems to appear in the UK - Elegy to John Donne (1967). In 1972 Brodsky became 'an involuntary exile' from the Soviet Union and after brief periods in Vienna and London he went to live in the US, turning down two invitations to emigrate to Israel. In 1980 A Part of Speech, poems translated into English verse by various poet-translators, was published; and most recently in 1988 To Urania: Selected Poems 1965-1985, some of which are translated by Brodsky himself. In 1987 Brodsky was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and currently he is poet laureate of the US. The intellectual intensity of his poetry - no wonder he wrote a poem in praise of Donne - shines powerfully through these translations, especially when he is writing about women he loves. A fine poem entitled 'The Butterfly', in which he ponders the fate of a gorgeous creature whose entire life-span lasts for less than a day, strikes a typical note of thoughtful lyricism. Brodsky's poetry stimulates the reader and challenges his assumptions, like Auden at his best. And he has written a remarkable essay about Auden, in a collection of prose, Less Than One (1987, to be reissued in August by Penguin); and now, just published, we have a long prose-essay by Brodsky about visiting Venice, written in English in 1989. It is a charmingly wayward and evocative rumination. We are dealing here with a major writer who, like Nabokov, has successfully managed the transition from his native Russian to an English prose style of so great an ornateness that it might be modelled on that of Sir Thomas Browne ('Eyesight is the instrument of adjustment to an environment which remains hostile no matter how well you have adjusted to it'). Brodsky has been adjusting to the environment of Venice, both hostile and friendly, in a series of sojourns in that city ever since he first visited it in 1972 at the age of 32. He captures its impact upon a sensitive traveller - exile, poet, lover, acute observer - with the same obliquity and insinuating use of non-sequitur that is typical of his poetry. The habit of hinting at a truth, of presenting it with calculated ambiguity, a technique cultivated by many Russian writers to outwit the censor, dies hard. The most recent example of Brodsky's way of conducting an argument by taking two steps forward and one step back may be seen in A Philby Fantasy published in the American weekly The New Republic (April 20 1992). This piece is a speculation on the probable effect of Philby on the formulation of Soviet policy towards the Arab world. It was inspired by Brodsky's shock at seeing a blow-up of the traitor's face, taken from the Russian postage-stamp commemorating Philby, on the cover of the London Review of Books in a bookshop in Hampstead. Nowadays Brodsky gets around.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: WH Smith to change share structure WH Smith, one of the last big UK quoted companies to have a two-tier share structure, yesterday announced proposals to introduce a single class of ordinary shares. The company said the move would give it greater flexibility in gaining access to capital markets and would increase liquidity for the shares. Sir Malcolm Field, managing director, said: 'A number of institutions do not like two classes of shares and have not bought ours as a result.' However, he stressed that the reason for the change was the general principle now favoured by investors that shareholders bearing the same risks and rewards should hold the same voting rights. Smith's share structure has been in place since the company was incorporated in 1949 when it gave the Smith family members effective control of the company. They held mainly the B shares, which have a nominal value of 10p and a single vote, while the A shares, with a nominal value of 50p, have one vote but enjoy five times the B share dividend. Current B shareholders have 36.1 per cent of the votes but only 10.1 per cent of the dividends. The company announced last October that it intended to create one class of shares. At that stage the B shares were standing at a small discount to the A, a quirk explained by their poor marketability, but since then they have traded at an average premium of about 15 per cent, adjusting for the difference in nominal value. The proposed compensation for B shareholders has been pitched at that level via a proposed capitalisation issue of 15 B shares for every 100 held. This is followed by a 5-for-1 consolidation into A shares, all of which are then redesignated ordinary shares. The B shares slipped 1p to 119 1/2 p while the A shares added 2p to 512p. Following similar moves by Great Universal Stores and Whitbread, Smith's proposal leaves only a handful of large companies with two-tier share structures. These include Daily Mail and General Trust, Securicor and Savoy Hotel.</p>

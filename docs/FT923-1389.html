			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Costings are tight in an ageing market - Maggie Urry considers the opportunities in the nursing home sector as the government changes the rules A LARGE and expanding market serviced by a fragmented industry would seem the ideal combination for companies within it to grow. The nursing home sector appears to offer just such an opportunity. There has to be a catch, though. Next April the entire system of government provision of care for the elderly will change when the National Health Service and Care in the Community Act comes into force. The industry is apprehensive about the changes, if only because few of the details have been worked out yet. The cost of long-term care for the elderly and chronically ill is estimated at more than Pounds 6.5bn a year. Yet the top ten companies have only 4 per cent of the market. Operators of nursing homes, which mainly cater for elderly people needing nursing care and are distinct from residential homes, foresee more customers as people live longer. Mr Ron Reid, finance director of Takare, the leading quoted company in the sector, said: 'You cannot fundamentally change the demographics. There is a surplus of patients which is set to rise.' As well as rising demand, there is some reduction in supply. Mr Pat Carter, chief executive of Westminster Health Care, a large nursing home operator which is planning a flotation, said that the NHS had been closing expensive long-stay hospital wards. As more hospitals gained trust status, the pressure to save money by closing more would increase. He added that a number of local authority-run homes, which had been exempt from registration under the old system,would now have to conform to standards which some would not meet. More than a quarter of people aged 85 and over live in some form of institution. Within 10 years, demographers estimate, there will be an increase of 400,000 people over 85. needing another 100,000 places if the same percentage applies. At the same time the number of informal carers, often the daughters of the elderly, is falling as more go out to work, increasing demand further. The market currently offers about 550,000 places, according to Laing &amp; Buisson, a consultancy firm which specialises in private healthcare. From April 1 next year patients who cannot afford to pay for themselves will be assessed by local authority social services departments rather than receiving income support from central government. There is some fear that local authorities will try to care for more people at home, rather than putting them into a nursing home. However, the nursing home companies believe the cost of caring for ill people in their own homes is greater than in a nursing home. There is also concern that local authorities will try to cut the rates which have applied. The Department of Social Security at present pays income support of Pounds 270 or Pounds 280 per week, depending on how ill the patient is, which goes to the home operator. Patient's also receive some pocket money. The low cost companies, such as Takare, WHC and Quality Care Homes, can make a profit at these levels, and could survive at lower rates which would drive higher-cost homes out of business. They have concentrated on new homes where efficiencies can be built in rather than on converting rambling Victorian houses which are expensive to run. Another concern of the operators is that patients, and their relatives, should still be given choice over which home they go to. Mr Duncan Bannatyne, managing director of QCH, believes this is a vital issue. QCH's homes run at an occupancy rate of 99.3 per cent, and have waiting lists. High occupancy is essential if a home is to make a profit at the social security rates. If people can choose which home they go to they will pick the one they perceive as best. There is the cushion that existing patients will still be entitled to income support until they die. In homes catering for the elderly, this may give operators two years over which the changes will come into full effect. The quoted nursing home groups expect to survive these changes and look ahead to the growth expected over the next few years. Mr Reid said: 'We expect, whatever the outcome of the reforms, to emerge at least as strong as before.' From an investors point of view the fast growth in the market is tempered by the demand of the companies within it for capital. Yet companies which have attempted to combine nursing homes with other unrelated activities have generally diluted the growth or even failed to make headway in the sector and pulled out. Takare has made a number of equity issues and raised money through debentures to fund its fast rate of expansion. However, since it came to the stock market in 1988 earnings per share have also risen sharply, from 2.85p to 10.1p in 1991. As the companies grow it should become easier to fund expansion from cashflow. Mr Carter of WHC believed that as the industry becomes more established the long term debt market would develop financial instruments tailored to nursing homes, reducing the need for equity issues. Despite the uncertainty likely in the run up to next April's changes, the longer-term outlook for efficient nursing home operators would appear bright.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> THE STRIKE AS SEEN BY 6TH-GRADERS  </P> <P> In the chaos of the Los Angeles school strike, some replacement teachers have  taken to screening Daffy Duck cartoons and others have handed out dominoes.  </P> <P> But Beverly Williams, a teacher's assistant at the 92nd Street Elementary  School, is focusing her sixth-grade class on the strike itself.  </P> <P> Says Williams: "The students had so many questions and feelings and they were  really concerned. So I said, 'Why don't you write them down in a letter?' "  </P> <P> Those missives, addressed to The Times, reveal a wide range of opinions toward  the job action.  </P> <P> "I hope the owner decides to pay the teachers enough money so the strike can  come to an end," declared Cecy Argueta.  </P> <P> Lakesha Stewart, to the contrary, groused that teachers "are acting like  immature kids."  </P> <P> Christine Newman said she dislikes the strike because substitute teachers "make  me sick."  </P> <P> Maria Fajardo, on the other hand, harbors mixed emotions about the regular  teachers. "I wish they would all come back," she wrote. "But sometimes they get  on my nerves."  </P> <P> One youngster signed his (or her) one-paragraph letter, "Talking for the  teachers."  </P> <P> While ungrammatical, it was certainly touching.  </P> <P> "I feel so sad because I don't have a teacher," the child wrote. "Without  teachers their are no education for us the kids. I think they should pay them  more money to the teachers to educate us. When I grow up I want to be a  astronaut, but without teachers a can't reach my dreams. My mother wants me to  be somebody in Life and I will be! They don't pay teachers enough and they give  us something more important education."  </P> <P> One sure-fire method for charting the strike's ebbs and flows is by dialing the  prerecorded message on school board President Roberta Weintraub's home phone.  </P> <P> On Monday, hours after a bitter break-off in negotiations, Weintraub informed  her callers that the day would be highly stressful.  </P> <P> The next morning, shortly before she left for Sacramento to meet with state  legislators, Weintraub ebulliently declared, "This is Roberta and I feel  great."  </P> <P> After a seemingly successful day in Sacramento, her Wednesday message might  have best been characterized as guardedly optimistic.  </P> <P> "It's Wednesday morning and I don't know what's going to happen but it looks a  little better than it did yesterday. If you want to talk to me please leave  your name."  </P> <P> United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson, for his part, hasn't  changed his phone message in months.  </P> <P> "This is (district Supt.) Dr. Leonard Britton," the union chief says. "I find  it hard to make ends meet on my $141,000 a year so I moonlight here at UT-LA  while Wayne is not here taking his messages."  </P> <P> When Weintraub and four other district officials arrived at Los Angeles Airport  on Tuesday morning for their flight to the state capital, the board president  took one look at her ticket and hit the roof. At $378 per person round-trip --  the standard business fare -- the party might as well be flying to Honolulu,  not Sacramento, she reasoned.  </P> <P> With minutes to spare until takeoff, Robert Booker, chief financial officer for  the district, raced back to the counter with the tickets. Flashing a credit  card, Booker managed to switch fares to a special government class rate of $76  round-trip. PAUL FELDMAN  </P></p>

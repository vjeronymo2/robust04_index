			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Unlikely coalition weakens Serrano hold on power SUPPORT for President Jorge Serrano of Guatemala appeared to be dwindling yesterday as he failed to clamp down on growing public opposition after snatching authoritarian powers last week. The president's action has brought together an unlikely coalition aimed at forcing him to stand down. Some opposition groups have begun positioning themselves for events after his departure. Mr Serrano has been dealt a severe blow by the president of the supreme electoral tribunal, Mr Arturo Herbruger, who rejected his request to call elections for a constituent assembly. 'Any electoral consultations must be realised under full guarantees. While the constitution is entirely or partially suspended, there cannot be elections,' Mr Herbruger said. He is being talked of as a possible interim president, as is Mr Edmund Mulet, ambassador to Washington and a former chairman of Congress who was first among a number of ambassadors to resign in protest at Mr Serrano's move. The influential private sector umbrella group Cacis, which has supported coups in Guatemala in the past, issued a statement calling on Mr Serrano to back down. The business community has become jittery about the possibility of losing trading benefits under the generalised system of preferences - a possibility raised by the US State Department - which could affect Dollars 200m (Pounds 129.8m) of exports. A delegation from the Organisation of American States led by Mr Joao Baena Soares, secretary-general, met Mr Serrano on Sunday to urge him to reinstate the constitution. OAS foreign ministers are to meet in Washington tomorrow to discuss action against the government. General Jose Domingo Garca Samayoa, minister of defence, who initially supported the move, failed to give explicit backing to Mr Serrano after senior military officers had met the president on Sunday. He said the army was concerned by the international condemnation of Guatemala. On Monday, the afternoon daily newspaper La Hora circulated on the streets uncensored after the police had withdrawn their cordon around its offices. The morning daily Siglo XXI blackened its front page and left its national pages blank as a protest against government censorship. A bomb went off at the newspaper's office yesterday, while another exploded at the offices of the weekly Cronico.</p>

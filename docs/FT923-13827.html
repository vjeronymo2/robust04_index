			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Variety of stimuli lift Dow in heavy trading Wall Street NEWS of a fall in unemployment claims, improved store sales and sporadic computer buy programs combined to lift share prices across the board in heavy trading yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 30.80 at 3,324.08. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also firmer, up 3.95 at 414.23, as were the Amex composite, 1.98 higher at 381.84, and the Nasdaq composite, up 7.13 at 564.70. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 209m shares, and rises outpaced declines by a ratio of more than two to one. After falling more than 60 points in the last four trading days, the market was due for a rebound yesterday, and early news of a 4,000 decline in weekly jobless claims and of solid increases in department and chain store sales provided the necessary spark. Institutional buyers were spotted in the market early, and computer programs buying a wide range of stocks added to the gains. Among the blue-chips believed to have benefited from the programs and renewed institutional interest were Caterpillar, up Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 52 3/8 , Philip Morris, up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 79 1/2 , Ford, up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 44 3/8 and McDonald's, Dollars 1 5/8 higher at Dollars 45 5/8 .

Lower sales, however, hit the Limited, down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 19 7/8 . Union Corp dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 14 3/4 after the company warned that net income in the year ended last month would be between Dollars 1 a share and Dollars 1.05 a share, well down on the Dollars 1.20 it earned in the previous year. Dow Jones edged Dollars  1/8 higher to Dollars 33 after the company reported second quarter operating earnings of Dollars 89.3m, up 25 per cent on a year ago. Digital Equipment rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 35 7/8 after winning an estimated Dollars 750m 10-year contract to develop the world's first fully digital telecommunications network for Optus Communications of Australia. North American Mortgage made an impressive debut, with the stock finishing at Dollars 12 1/8 in turnover of 1.8m shares after the company's 5.5m shares were issued at a price of Dollars 11.50 each. On the Nasdaq market, St Paul Bancorp rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 20 5/8 after posting second quarter earnings of 78 cents a share, up from 53 cents a share a year ago. Canada TORONTO stocks posted a solid gain in active trading. According to preliminary figures, the TSE 300 composite index rose 21.37 points, or 0.63per cent, to close at 3,439.75.

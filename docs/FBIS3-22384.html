The researchers, led by Yutaka Kondo, professor at the  university's solar-terrestrial environmental laboratory, used  data from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA) survey of chemical substances in the atmosphere.    The pollutants are carried from the Asian mainland to the  Pacific by prevailing westerly winds, the researchers said.    Low-altitude ozone results from a chemical change in  atmospheric oxygen, with nitrogen oxides from automobile  exhausts and coal-fired power stations serving as catalysts.    Unlike stratospheric ozone, such low-altitude ozone can  damage the respiratory system when in high densities.    The density of ozone in clean air is normally about 20 parts  per billion (PPB) and that of nitrogen oxide is around 0.1 PPB.    But at altitudes of 2,000 to 3000 meters off the coasts near  Taiwan and Hong Kong, ozone densities were more than 100 PPB,  and off Japan, nitrogen oxide densities were 1 PPB.    A member of the research team, Hideaki Nakajima, said the  pollutants detected are responsible for acid rain and could  eventually cause forests near the Pacific to die off unless  countries in the region quickly produce a preventive strategy.    China and Russia, with their relatively low environmental  standards, have previously been identified as responsible for  much of the pollution in the region, but this is the first  empirical evidence to back up the claims.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], said in Maringue yesterday the process of  confinement of his soldiers is running smoothly. Dhlakama said  the Renamo soldiers are already in assembly points awaiting to  enter the venues corresponding to the second stage. Dhlakama  was speaking at a news conference granted to Mozambican and  foreign journalists, and said that his troops are facing a  situation of misery. He spoke once again about the alleged  mismanagement by the UN Operations in Mozambique -- for carrying  water in helicopters from the city of Beira to the Chiramba  assembly point, for the blue helmets stationed in the area.  Dhlakama said he has spoken with UN Special Representative Aldo  Ajello, and added that the issue has already been reported in  New York. In another development, Afonso Dhlakama said the  issue of the Malawi Young Pioneers is Mozambique Liberation  Front propaganda to denigrate Renamo.</p>

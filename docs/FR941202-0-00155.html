			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. RSPA Should Clarify That Operators Are Only Responsible for Preventing Employees From Driving Company Vehicles <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Petitioners state that the ``Background Material'' accompanying the 49 CFR part 40 final regulations states that employees testing positive for alcohol ``should not drive.'' (59 FR 7340, 7346). Petitioners contend that enforcing a broad prohibition on driving raises serious legal questions. The Petitioners request that DOT clarify that the employer's responsibility extends only to limiting employees from driving company vehicles or for company purposes, and that employers should not be responsible for policing the actions of an employee after he or she has tested positive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> RSPA Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RSPA is granting the Petitioners' request to clarify this issue. The preamble to the 49 CFR part 40 regulations states that the DOT alcohol testing form includes a statement, to be signed by the employee, that persons who test positive should not drive or perform other safety-sensitive functions. (59 FR 7346). The requirement to sign the statement applies to the employee, not to the employer. The statement in the preamble that employers have a responsibility, as part of their alcohol education for employees, to emphasize that employees must cease performing safety-sensitive functions if they test positive does not mean that employers must police the private conduct of employees who test positive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The employer's specific responsibility is set forth in 49 CFR 199.215 and 199.237, which provide that an operator may not permit a covered employee who has an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater to perform or continue to perform covered functions until certain requirements are met. An operator may not permit such an employee, for example, to drive a CMV or perform a pipeline safety function. The rules do not require an operator to prohibit an employee from driving his or her own vehicle after having tested positive. However, under 49 CFR 199.239, an operator has an obligation to promulgate a policy on the misuse of alcohol, including providing educational materials to employees concerning the effects of alcohol misuse on an individual's health, work, and personal life. Such materials frequently include information advising on the dangers of driving while under the influence of alcohol. Therefore, no change to the rule is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. RSPA Should Clarify That Operators Are Not Responsible for the Storage of EBT Devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Petitioners state that the DOT regulations in 49 CFR 40.55(c) require that employers store EBTs in a secure space. The Petitioners contend that it will often be the case that EBTs will not be in the control of the employer, but will be maintained by hospitals, contractors, and consortiums. Where testing devices are in the possession of others, the Petitioners contend, employers will have limited ability to control maintenance and operation of the devices. The Petitioners maintain that all that reasonably can be required of employers is that they contractually require third parties to abide by the regulations. The Petitioners contend that, as for emergency personnel and hospitals, employers obviously cannot be required to monitor their operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> RSPA Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 40.55(c) stipulates that when the employer is not using the EBT at an alcohol testing site, the employer shall store the EBT in a secure space. This provision plainly is directed to those situations when the employer is conducting the testing, either directly or through a contract with a third party provider. If the employer is conducting the testing, then the employer must secure the EBT when it is not in use. If the employer is conducting testing through a contractor, then the contract must provide that the contractor will secure the EBT when it is not in use. Therefore, no change to the rule is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. RSPA Should Clarify That Operators May Combine Drug and Alcohol Training Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Petitioners state that the Common Preamble indicates that employers may combine their alcohol and drug training programs for supervisors, for a total time of two hours. The Petitioners contend that much of the information pertaining to detecting alcohol and drug abuse will overlap, and it is not necessary to require a two-hour training session. The Petitioners urge DOT to clarify that employers need only provide combined training on drugs and alcohol for one hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

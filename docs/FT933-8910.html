			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / C&amp;G will stop endowment mortgage sales CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester, the UK's sixth largest building society, is to stop selling endowment mortgages. The move follows criticism of mortgage lenders because of the high charges, including commissions, on endowment policies and their uncertain final returns. Yesterday C&amp;G said it would stop sales of life assurance after its five-year exclusive distribution agreement with Legal &amp; General ended in November. It would concentrate instead on the sale of interest-only and repayment mortgages. Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G's chief executive, said the society preferred to let customers choose their own method of repayment. C&amp;G decided in 1990 to stop urging its customers to take endowment mortgages. Currently one in 12 of C&amp;G's new borrowers is sold one, compared with an industry average of 69 per cent. Customers who wish to have an insurance product will be referred to local independent financial advisers who are responsible for referring roughly 60 per cent of C&amp;G's existing mortgage clients. Mr Longhurst said C&amp;G's low cost base meant it did not need the extra income from the sale of insurance products to remain profitable. 'We've come to the point where we don't want to play that game any more,' he said of the society's role as a 'tied agent' of Legal &amp; General. In recent years, life insurers have competed intensely to sign up building society outlets to sell their products exclusively and have rewarded them with handsome commissions. Bancassurance, the sale of financial services products through bank-type outlets, is regarded as the cheapest form of distribution. Building societies, however, have been criticised for urging unnecessary insurance products, particularly endowment mortgages, on borrowers. Discounted mortgages often require the borrower to sign up for an insurance product. Mr Longhurst said C&amp;G would still offer discounted products. Legal &amp; General said it was sorry to see the end of the relationship with C&amp;G, but noted that 'the changing nature of C&amp;G's business spread makes it no longer appropriate nor cost effective for a tied relationship'.

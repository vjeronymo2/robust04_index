			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> THE RYE PUPPETEERS;  </P> <P> STAGE: PROTEST AND BREAD BAKING ARE THE STAFF OF LIFE FOR VERMONT'S BREAD AND  PUPPET THEATER. THE DURABLE, '60S-ERA TROUPE OPENS HERE FRIDAY.  </P> <P> In this pastoral corner of the Northeast Kingdom, it seems like ancient history  to think of the Bread and Puppet Theater as a vital product of New York City.  That was back in the '60s, when America was swirling in anti-war sentiment.  </P> <P> Most theaters of turmoil bit the dust when the Vietnam War and the flower  children faded. Bread and Puppet moved north. And with the depth of conviction  of its founder, Peter Schumann, remained ideologically intact.  </P> <P> In its new dwelling place -- the old Dopp Farm on a winding, two-lane road  lined with burdock and chokeberries a few miles south of here -- Bread and  Puppet redefined itself and endured.  </P> <P> The 19th-Century farmhouse and its groaning barn, which is now the Bread and  Puppet Museum, have become a backcountry tourist stop. The barn leaks when it  rains. It is filled with what Schumann calls Cheap Art: the banners, masks,  prints, posters and puppets that chronicle the company's history -- or "The Art  of Impermanence."  </P> <P> And yet the Bread and Puppet Theater (the name derives from the company's  ritual of passing out home-baked bread dipped in oil and garlic to its  audiences, and from its use of puppets of all shapes and sizes) has been  anything but impermanent. What's amazing is that it is not a relic. It is  ageless -- paradoxically childlike and primitive in spirit, yet addressing  itself, with a metaphysical edge, to complex contemporary issues.  </P> <P> Schumann (a musician, sculptor and painter as well as theater artist)  attributes this style to his influences: folklore, medieval art, Dadaism and  German Expressionism. The result is a company whose epic collective works  combine a theater of protest with the pageantry of the Middle Ages.  </P> <P> Some of it comes our way for the first time this week, as part of the L.A.  Festival. "Metropolitan Indian Report," a piece about the plight of the  American underclasses will be presented in UCLA's Little Theatre Friday through  Monday.  </P> <P> "Uprising of the Beast," which has a 40-foot puppet, angels, animals, skeletons  and evil dwarfs, will be staged in a hangar at Santa Monica Airport Sept. 14  and 15. As Schumann explains it, "It tries to dislodge the curious  Judeo-Christian notion that the world was created to be dominated by human  beings."  </P> <P> The Teatro Mundi pageant will be part of Chinatown's Moon Festival Sunday at  Union Station and performed again in other venues.  </P> <P> The company subsists mainly by doing what it will do here: touring and  participating in parades.  </P> <P> The sight the old brightly decorated Bread and Puppet school buses lumbering  down the road, like painted dinosaurs, is familiar in Vermont. But the company  has traveled the nation and the world. And rather than shrink its performance  style to make it more portable it relies, wherever it goes, on small armies of  volunteers, many of them children.  </P> <P> The Bread and Puppet farm functions as a revolving door. Between four and eight  people are with it full time, a bigger number come and go, and a still bigger  number help out in the summer with the company's annual Domestic Resurrection  Circus.  </P> <P> Schumann places responsibility for his bread baking on "the bad conscience of  an artist." He bakes daily, "Silesian sourdough rye," he says, "ground freshly  on a hand grinder. As good as good can be." It's been 29 years since he left  Germany, but the accent lingers.  </P> <P> "A lot of our artmaking obviously doesn't make sense," he continued. "It serves  a culture that, in itself, doesn't make sense and doesn't doesn't need the  services of art, because it has organized what it calls entertainment or  relaxation exercises in a manipulative way. It's made them part of the market  system. The artist feels like the son of the village idiot. A bread baker can  get away from all this."  </P> <P> One of five children, Schumann was born in Silesia 56 years ago, learning to  bake at his mother's knee. As a young man, he traveled Europe studying design,  music, sculpture and dance, hoping to find a way to combine them.  </P> <P> In 1959, he married Elka Scott, an American student he met in Munich, and,  after attending a concert by John Cage and Merce Cunningham, began to think  that the United States might welcome his ideas. So in 1961, he moved his  growing family to New York where, after struggling as a sculptor, he began  working with masks and dance at the Judson Church. When Elka took a teaching  post at a Vermont boarding school, Peter joined her and taught puppetry.  </P> <P> So it began. By 1963 the Schumanns and their five children were back in New  York where Bread and Puppet evolved, becoming known as much for its unique  anti-war pageants, voter-registration and rent-strike parades, as for  Schumann's custom of baking and breaking bread with the crowd.  </P> <P> Between 1970 and '74, Bread and Puppet made its way north, first as resident  theater at Vermont's Goddard College, then by settling into the old Dopp Farm.  Elka's parents had bought it a few years earlier and offered to rent -- later  donate -- some buildings to the theater.  </P> <P> The end of the Vietnam conflict and the move out of the city were big changes  for the company. "We had to learn to live in the countryside, to use it to make  these landscape architecture puppetry pieces. We also find it not so  interesting any more to go inside theaters," Schumann said, lapsing into German  sentence structure. "The expense of tickets is so forbidding. Also the  atmosphere -- the feeling that you play for a specialized clientele and not for  everybody. We concluded it was better to go into a community and invite its  members into our show."  </P> <P> The free, two-day Domestic Resurrection Circus held in August is part of that  wish "to make more all-encompassing theater and to do that by choosing big  scenes that are meaningful for big, non-elite audiences, in the tradition of  Asiatic or Greek cyclic theater."  </P> <P> A touring version was started in 1969 and refined at Goddard. The nearby  30-acre field they perform in now includes a big clay oven Schumann built where  he and a helper bake 1,500 loaves a day. It features up to 20 sideshows and  involves some 200 people.  </P> <P> Dressed in white shirt and trousers under a straw hat, shaping loaves on the  bread-house counter, Schumann is a man engaged in a sacrament. The graying  beard and mustache that cover much of his face, leave an unobstructed view of  his transcendent blue eyes that seem to look inward, as if in a communion of  thought and action. Yet his handshake, extended on another occasion, is pure  steel.  </P> <P> Fifteen thousand to 20,000 people attend the circus each year. The relationship  with the community has had its ups and downs, but neighbors make a bit of  change by charging to park and camp. This buys the theater some good will.  "This is conservative country. People mind our politics. Expressing our views  publicly is not only not wanted, but makes for hostility. Sometimes we don't  get invited back," Schumann said.  </P> <P> "Or they call and say in a concerned voice, that they don't want any  controversy," added Michael Romanyshyn, a puppeteer who's been with the company  off and on since 1975.  </P> <P> "Vermont is a conservative state, but its Republican politics are independent,"  said John Bell, a now-and-then member since '73. "The focus is on doing  whatever you want but respecting the right of your neighbors to do the same.  That fits in with what we do."  </P> <P> Schumann does not consider himself a sculptor who wandered into theater. "Even  in high school I was more into mask-making," he said. The puppets are created  by what he calls "Stone Age methods." The clay is local, mostly dug out with  buckets from the riverbed and used and reused for the basic building. The paper  for making puppets is donated by a friend and comes from an industrial garbage  bin in New Jersey. So the bulk of the materials is cheap or free.  </P> <P> Is Bread and Puppet then a one-man band with a lot of unpaid help? Romanyshyn  says no.  </P> <P> "That's too one-dimensional. There's something in it for people on every level  that makes them want to do it. People who participate on the musical level.  People who invent individual dances, text, dialogue. Peter directs the show,  180 people perform it."  </P> <P> He and Bell prefer to think of Schumann as a philosophical ringmaster whose  work is very different from, say, that of Robert Wilson. Schumann's is looser  and less predetermined. Says Bell: "It needs somebody to invent a movement for  a puppet or propose a piece of music or propose a text or a story. It's always  drawing you in. A lot of the rehearsal process is improvisation, but (the  finished product) is not improvised at all."  </P> <P> Adds Romanyshyn: "I think the end result is very precise."  </P></p>

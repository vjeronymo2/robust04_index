			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and </F> foreign minister, to the Chamber of Deputies in Zagreb on 2  February -- recorded]    [Text] I wish to thank this esteemed chamber for giving me  the opportunity to reply to many important questions and  dilemmas -- including moral ones. However, I refuse to take  part in any ideological debates or folkloric manifestations. I  will focus on certain issues of major importance, and I believe  I will disclose some new information, because it happens that  people sometimes jump to wrong conclusions due to a lack of  accurate information.    Conducting foreign policy is governed by highly complex and  multifaceted rules imposed by moral and ethical values and  dilemmas, as well as by the necessity of reaching short- and  long-term objectives with precisely defined and limited means,  by outside rules, and the imperative of the times.    What is the basic objective of Croatia's foreign policy, its  state policy? A modern, European, democratic Croatian state  with respect for human rights, minority rights, and the rights  of ethnic communities; a state that guarantees the highest  European standards. A state ready to accept international  supervision by the Council of Europe or the CSCE.    What are its strategic guidelines? First and foremost, the  reintegration of the UNPA [UN Protected Areas] into the state  and legal system of Croatia -- this is the first strategic  guideline. Then comes the resolution of the crisis, the war in  Bosnia- Herzegovina, and the establishment of a just peace.  There is the regulation of all disputed issues with our  neighbors and joining European integrational processes -- an  agreement on associate membership in the European Union [EU],  the joining of all European projects -- and, last but certainly  not least, global and regional security mechanisms. This  includes regional security mechanisms that we have already  proposed to the CSCE and, of course, Partnership for Peace --  NATO's latest proposal; an extremely important proposal,  especially for the future.    Most dilemmas and questions, a joint declaration -- yes or  no  [as received] -- concerned this first strategic guideline. The  only real difference in fact lies in expectation. There are no  other differences. I have not heard that anyone is satisfied  with the present situation. We all agree about this. Of  295,000 Croats and non-Serb people in UNPAs and Pink Zones,  almost all have been expelled. Except a few thousand elderly  people. Ethnic cleansing is almost complete. There are still  7,800 people either missing or forcibly taken away. Respect for  human rights is zero and practically beyond the control of the  Croatian authorities. We have an excellent resolution of the UN  Security Council -- 871 -- but it is certain that no fundamental  and definite progress can be expected from the present UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Force] mandate.    I have also not heard many people say they were in favor of  war. There are some deputies, however, who have taken this stand  consistently. This is, of course, their right. I need to warn  at this moment that this option would not only cause victims --  and the generals are much better placed to speak about this --  but also total and immediate isolation. Not just sanctions, but  also total isolation. This is not guesswork, we were told this  directly.    What is the third option? Only this, brave and full of  challenge [as heard]. The last thing that can be said of us is  that we are naive.    It is naive to expect that Milosevic will come to Zagreb and  say that he is abandoning his policy. However, both the  internal and external situation has made him willing to talk.  The joint statement means only the first step, but the step  that crosses the Rubicon. How far-reaching it is -- time and  results will tell.    We are not compromising our fundamental objectives: to  reintegrate the UNPA zones, enable the return of refugees, and,  prior to that, achieve an overall cease-fire and establish  traffic links, all this in a consistent process. This will, of  course, be our guiding light in the process of normalizing  relations.    At the first meeting we agreed to form a joint commission  for  missing persons. I believe this is a step forward. Opening  missions means, in any case, establishing good communication  channels without drawing any premature conclusions on any other  issues.    Questions have been raised, I think by Mr. Kovacevic, about  why Croatia was not immediately referred to in its borders, as  in Security Council Resolution 871. Of course, this is exactly  what we demanded. But, since Milosevic was not willing to agree  to that, we did not establish relations on the level of  ambassadors but on the level of representative offices,  refraining from making any premature judgement.    The other question was the resolution of the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the establishment of peace. The second  strategic objective of Croatian foreign policy is to reach a  lasting resolution of Croatian-Muslim relations -- for  political, economic, and strategic reasons. All our friends are  giving us advice to this effect.    Obviously, the first short-term objective is to halt all  confrontation. It is neccessary to say something about the  dynamism here. I will not go too far back into the past, only  to the beginning of the war or the Serb aggression against  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We proposed two things, and they were even agreed on during  the talks before the referendum [on the independence of  Bosnia-Herzegovina]: We proposed a united but decentralized  Bosnia-Herzegovina and a military alliance. This was not  accepted. On 12 July [1992] only the possibility of cooperation  in border areas was accepted and it was on the basis of this  agreement that certain, very limited, forces [of the Republic of  Croatia] were brought to defend the Dubrovnik hinterland.    The Vance-Owen plan was accepted in the same spirit. But  after six weeks of procrastination by the Bosnian-Muslim side it  was rejected by the Serb side. Everything else is well known.    This was at the time when the United States was ready for  military intervention. They did not get the support of the  European Community and the Russian Federation. After that, the  European Community proposal was discussed. The basic proposal  was a union of three republics. What happened then? A joint  declaration was signed by Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic on  14 September, as well as an additional agreement which envisaged  a lasting solution for Croatian-Muslim relations. This  agreement was not implemented, but certainly not through the  fault of Croatia's state policy.    President Tudjman's proposal tabled at Petersberg in Bonn  was  primarily designed to halt the war and establish a lasting  peace. It offered options for achieving this. The first option  was a union of the three republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In the talks that we have held, and I have witnessed all the  events in the last two months, the main contentious issues were  central Bosnia, Mostar, access to the sea, and, of course, the  hydroelectric system. Little was achieved with the first  contentious issue, central Bosnia, for what was being proposed  was practically for the Croat Defence Council [HVO] to withdraw  from Vitez and Busovaca.    And that is where things remained. Some progress had been  achieved on the issue of the outlet to the sea and on the  primarily industrial Mostar and the hydro-energetic system.  Proposals were made for an immediate ceasefire and separation,  military separation. It was proposed that forces of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croat Defence Council should  exclusively face Serb positions. This proposal was not  accepted. What happened then? As you can see, the rejection of  the European Union's concept -- which had previously been  accepted -- accusations about the Croatian Army's presence in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are grave. 30,000 troops and 20,000 to be  deployed additionally.    We informed the UN Security Council in our letter that there  were 1,500 to 2,000 volunteers -- some of them former Croatian  Army officers and soldiers demobilized in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  That is a realistic number. The chief of the Croatian Army  General Staff, General Bobetko, is the best person to ask.  However, it is certain that the number is much higher --  figures vary from 3,000 to 6,000 and even 8,000. It is hard to  tell -- but there are definitely more volunteers from the  Islamic countries.    There are curently at least five different approaches to the  Bosnia-Herzegovina problem: The European Union continues to  stick to its proposal and wishes to exert pressure on all three  sides; the United States differs in the sense that it does not  wish to apply too much pressure on the Muslim side, they have  said so publicly; the Russian Federation opposes any kind of  military intervention; the Islamic countries advocating a single  Bosnia-Herzegovina; and of course we must take into account what  the other moral authorities in the world are saying, that the  most important thing at this moment is to bring an end to the  conflict and the suffering.    Our offer to the Muslim side is still open and we are  prepared to talk immediately and anywhere about any rational  proposal. The first thing is the end of these clashes, but  without any preconditions. As far as Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are concerned, it is well-known that about  200,000 to 210,000 have been expelled as a result of a Serb  offensive and about 100,000 to 110,000 in central Bosnia as a  result of a Muslim offensive -- this means about 320,000.    One has to be sensitive to disquiet, and the interests in  certain regions must be different. One must not put special  emphasis on the differences but instead insist on unity.    As far as strategy, final strategy is concerned, in any case  a cease-fire and the resumption of talks... [pauses] We have  not moved forward from the EU proposal, no one from among the  other international factors has any other concrete proposals.  Talks are being conducted in Washington at present between the  United States, France, Germany, and England. Russians are  included in the talks. We shall see whether any concrete  proposals will emerge. But as far as the cease-fire is  concerned, there must be no dilemma -- it is most important that  agreement on the cease-fire be reached immediately.    As for the regulation of relations with our neighbors --  Slovenia -- most problems have stemmed from the break-up of  former Yugoslavia. We hope that almost seven agreements,  including a solution in principle for Krsko [nuclear plant],  will be achieved by Monday, that we shall continue to work on  the property and legal solutions and on a solution to the  Ljubljana bank and resolve all these problems in a month or so.  We also hope that intensive work will be carried out with the  aim of defining the borders. A joint commission will meet for  the first time on 15th February in Bled.    We also discussed Piran Bay. Our proposal for the  demaraction line is well-known, but there were a number of very  (?useful) suggestions regarding joint use which were welcome.    As far as Italy is concerned, I will go there tomorrow to  meet Italian Foreign Minister Andretta, and I expect to be  received by the Holy Father and Cardinal [name indistinct]. I  will have an opportunity to convey President Tudjman's personal  message to the Holy Father.    It is certain that the situation regarding the deaths of the  three journalists in Mostar has made my visit more difficult,  especially as far as the Italian public is concerned, because in  the past two months Minister Andreatta had adopted very  constructive stands during the last meetings in Geneva and  Brussels.    Our aim is, naturally, to discuss all open questions and  there is no doubt that Italy is not just one of the most  important economic partners, but also an economic power. Italy  has considerable influence within the EU and the settlement of  all questions with Italy is one of our priority goals.    President Tudjman will visit Romania this month and Albania  at the end of this month. As for European integration  processes, the Council of Europe [word indistinct] with the EU  are above all blocked because of the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is the main reason.    We are cooperating closely. Over 70 different missions of  the Council of Europe visited Croatia and our parliamentary  delegation was very active and successful in the work [of  Council of Europe] for which it was comended. I was present.  However, the present situation -- not to pursue the next step,  which means the arrival of reporters in Croatia -- is linked  exclusively with the situation in and the settlement of the  crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina [as heard]. Of course there are  other objections, which is natural for a country developing its  democratic system, but they are no longer that important.    As far as regional and global security mechanisms are  concerned our proposal was accepted and it will be further  discussed within the framework of the CSCE. All countries  expected to become part of this should adhere to this regional  security mechanism. This would be of great advantage for the  Republic of Croatia because -- if Serbia and Montenegro, the FRY  [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], would like to be part of this  system -- they would have to reduce their military troops and  equipment to the level determined by the regional security  mechanism and additionally meet all other conditions in line  with the democratic institutions of the system.    Croatia welcomed the Partnership for Peace initiative. We  are preparing a report we shall send to NATO. But this is, of  course, a long-term project and the issue of borders should be  resolved beforehand.    We must also answer a number of other questions raised by  Mr.  Pejnovic. Legitimate Serbs were elected to the Croatian  Assembly and Resolution 871 envisages that we should have talks  with the local Serbs. As for the benefit of the talks with all  international factors I agree with you that it is necessary to  [word indistinct].    I will answer Paraga's question with a few words, it will be  exclusively facts, nothing else. There are 261 persons in all  of our diplomatic and consular offices. There are 36 embassies,  five missions, and eight general consulates or consulates with  an average of 5.3 percent of employed [as heard].    I can also tell you that Hungary has 90, Slovakia 79,  Denmark  800 employed. Austria 800, Switzerland 2,000. [previous two  sentences as heard] In no way have we exaggerated. The average  income is 2,000, or in the case of a vice-consul 2,500 deutsche  marks [DM]. A German consul earns about 9,000 DM. An ambassador  earns about 5,100 DM. Anyone can get all the information if  they want to.    As far as quality is concerned, we have some fortunate  solutions, some less fortunate and few unfortunate solutions but  as far as expert financial control it is total and this refers  to all embassies.    It is necessary to say a few words about the present  situation in conclusion.    The pressure over Bosnia-Herzegovina in the past 48 hours  has  been immense. This concerns the presence of the Croatian Army  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course, this is part of the strategic  plan of applying pressure on the Republic of Croatia. Things  might become even worse -- the Security Council will be in  session on Friday [4th February], there might be a presidential  statement to this effect, as well as a statement issued by the  Council of Europe whose meeting on 7 and 8 February will be  devoted to the same subject. This is the agreed form of  pressure -- everybody agrees in this respect.    It is certain at this moment that we all have to persevere  in  our adherence to some basic guidelines. I believe that we all  agree that a ceasefire and the search for a lasting solution  with the Muslims is the first of the strategic objectives, while  the other strategic objective is to find a peaceful resolution,  through negotiations -- but bearing in mind our fundamental  national interests -- with the Serb side. Thank you.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Struggle to keep the lid on: As the temperature rises over Spain's corruption scandal, David White asks how many lives Gonzalez has left A former central bank governor and a former head of the stock exchange are remanded in a common jail. The ex-chief of paramilitary police is on the run. Two ministers and the ruling party's parliamentary leader have felt obliged to resign, joined yesterday by the head of the country's anti-drug programme. This week the whole of Spain has been gripped by the spectacle of a political crisis spinning vertiginously out of control. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, returned last night to his home town of Seville to try to stir up his alarmed Socialist troops to face European and regional elections just five weeks away. The day before, in a televised press conference, he made a belated effort to put a lid on the crisis, doing his best to project the customary confidence and serenity, talking frankly of 'mistakes' and 'difficult days', saying he had no intention of quitting or dissolving parliament. But his nervous smile betrayed the traumatic experience he and his government have been going through in the past few days. Mr Gonzalez is not to be easily written off. He has come back and fought his way out of tight situations before. Eight years ago he came close to being unsaddled in a referendum on Nato membership. He won it against the odds after a debilitating campaign in which he was accused of being a turncoat. Last year, facing a likely general election defeat and widespread disillusion, he managed to rally more votes than the Socialists had obtained since their first landslide win in 1982. But how many lives does Mr Gonzalez have? His government's credibility was already low before the scandals surfaced, having presided over Spain's worst economic slump for 30 years and an official unemployment rate now nearing one in four. The party which gave stability to Spain's post-Franco democracy by securing an absolute majority in parliament is now a minority government. The only solid backing for Mr Gonzalez now comes mainly from pensioners, women and countryfolk. He has lost support among the young and in the cities and industrial centres. Even before this week's resignations, which have brought a distinct whiff of governmental decomposition, there was an aura of fin de regime. The Socialists probably expected to be beaten in last summer's general election. Their surprise win now looks increasingly likely to be a limited extension, like a football match playing into extra time. This does not mean the government has been inactive. A new economic team is pressing ahead with deregulation. A cautious reform of the country's notoriously inflexible labour laws - long talked about as a necessary prerequisite for job creation, but never acted on until now - is in its final stages of parliamentary approval, overriding objections from the once-powerful trade unions. A rescue for Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), one of the traditional pillars of the banking system, has been carried out with conspicuous success. The fruits of what is now a tentative economic recovery should become apparent next year, when most observers expect the employment figures to start improving. But few would bet on the current administration lasting long enough to benefit from it. The political discussion in Spain is not about whether the Gonzalez era is coming an end, but about when and how. Will Mr Gonzalez - who less than three months ago was turning down approaches to be put forward as the next president of the European Commission - end up like Mr Bettino Craxi, the disgraced former socialist prime minister of Italy, who was caught up in bribery scandals? Will the Spanish Socialists, the oldest political party in the country, cave in like their Italian partners or collapse electorally like the French Socialists on whose campaign they modelled their own when they came to power? Could they just implode, following the example of Spain's previous governing party, the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) in 1982? For now, Mr Gonzalez has shored up his position by securing pledges of support from Catalan and Basque nationalists who lead governments in their respective regions and form minority groups in the national parliament. The Catalan party Convergencia i Unio alone has enough seats - 17 - to provide a narrow combined majority with the Socialists. Its leader, the Catalan president Mr Jordi Pujol, has come to the conclusion that no other government is possible in the current parliament. The conservative Popular Party (PP) has 141 seats, not far behind the Socialists' 159 but not enough to create an absolute majority even if both the Catalans and Basques switched camp. Mr Pujol, who broadly supports the government's policies, is therefore considering only two options: stick with Mr Gonzalez or force new elections. In the coming months he will be able to call the shots. He flew to Madrid on Thursday morning to make it clear to Mr Gonzalez that his support depended on the government's performance in economic policy and dealing with corruption. This understanding still leaves Mr Gonzalez in a far from safe position. If more cases of serious financial wrongdoing involving senior figures emerge, the Catalans could take fright, not wanting to be seen in the eyes of their own electorate to be propping up a disreputable government in Madrid. Equally, the alliance with the Socialists could well come under strain later this year when the Catalans press for concessions in next year's budget. Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the PP leader, is reckoning on a general election between the autumn and next spring and would be the favourite to win it. For all Mr Gonzalez's assurances, therefore, the climate of uncertainty is sure to remain. Economic planners and business leaders are worried about the possible impact on investment, which would be serious if the political crisis reached a peak before enactment of the labour market reform. What is puzzling is the lateness of Mr Gonzalez's response to the growing evidence of corrupt practices and illicit gains. The past three years have seen a succession of embarrassing affairs. The brother of Mr Alfonso Guerra, then deputy prime minister, was accused of using his connections as well as a government office to further his business interests. The next year, after Mr Guerra resigned from the government, a scandal broke over clandestine funds being paid to the Socialist party by banks and companies through a bogus consultancy. In 1992 Mr Mariano Rubio, then still Bank of Spain governor, was already involved in controversy over his links with a failed bank run by his stockbroker friend Mr Manuel de la Concha - a prelude to the present case involving charges of tax fraud and falsification. The lack of firm action then, and seemingly slow reaction to the implications of the latest allegations have done no good to Mr Gonzalez's image. Increasingly reclusive, shielded by an inner circle of courtiers, he has appeared paralysed, trying to play for time, resisting the pressure for heads to roll, wanting to wait for the European election. But the heads have rolled anyway. More emblematic figures than those at the centre of the latest scandals would be hard to imagine. Mr Mariano Rubio served as vice-governor, then from 1984-92 as governor of the Bank of Spain, the ultimate guarantor of financial probity. The Pta2,000 (Pounds 10) banknotes that bear Mr Rubio's signature are now subjects for mockery. The case is all the more poignant because Mr Rubio was a highly effective and respected governor. When he was reappointed in 1988, a column in the independent newspaper Diario 16 spoke effusively of Mr Rubio as being 'endowed with an innate sense of rectitude, oblivious to any petty political ambition, impermeable to the siren-songs of the private sector'. He was 'a great public servant in the best sense of such a bastardised word'. Trusting him was one thing Mr Gonzalez had done well. How ironic that the author was Pedro J Ramirez, now editor of El Mundo, the paper that led the latest allegations about Mr Rubio's undeclared investments. And then there is Mr Luis Roldan, first civilian chief of the Civil Guard, the ultimate symbol of authority in Spain, renowned for its acute sense of honour, in the front-line of the fight against Basque terrorism and extortion. This is not the first time the force has made headlines in an unfortunate way. In the attempted military coup of 1981, the image of a handle-bar moustached lieutenant-colonel in a tricorn hat brandishing a gun in parliament reflected a comic-opera version of Spain. The preposterous saga of Mr Roldan and his property purchases, the allegations about bundles of cash being carried in and out of his office, his extravagant gifts to a woman friend, and his unimpeded getaway have provided a mix of farce and melodrama. Corruption is nothing new in Spain, however. Although Mr Gonzalez elegantly focused on present and future cases rather than digging up the past, it was definitely widespread in the Franco regime. But corruption certainly also flourished in the boom period of the late 1980s, when Socialist politicians had become entrenched in positions of power at local, regional and national levels. The recent disclosures have provoked a flood of public venom. At a time of continuing economic hardship, the jokes are mixed with fierce resentment, in which sheer envy of wealth is a strong element. Spaniards are not bothered about sexual peccadilloes like the British, but they are bothered about other people's money. Reaction to the Rubio affair has come close to that of a lynch-mob. When the 62-year-old former governor turned up to answer questions at a prosecutor's office, he was greeted by shouts of 'cad'. However, he may have done nothing that was not common practice a few years ago, and the rules at the time did not stop a Bank of Spain governor from investing in stocks. Mr Rubio believes he is being made a scapegoat. The most positive construction that can be put on these tumultuous events in Spain is that they may help to instil more morality into public life. They could have a cathartic effect. But whether there is any salvation in this for Mr Gonzalez is more doubtful.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UAP takes full control of Colonia in DM1.2bn deal Union des Assurances de Paris yesterday announced it was mounting a DM1.2bn (Dollars 780m) deal to pay Oppenheim, the private German group, for its minority stake in a holding company in order to give the French insurance group 100 per cent control of Colonia, its German insurance subsidiary. In a complex financial deal, UAP has been able to reduce the amount of cash paid to Oppenheim by exploiting Westdeutsche Landesbank's desire to raise its stake in the French insurance company. UAP will finance the deal 45 per cent in 'quasi-own funds' or bonds convertible into shares, 33 per cent in ordinary bonds and the remaining 22 per cent in cash. Last October UAP and Suez, the French financial group, swapped their insurance holdings. Suez gained Victoire's French insurance subsidiaries, and UAP took Victoire's 78.8 per cent stake in Vinci, a specialist holding company controlling various European insurances companies notably Colonia, the third largest German insurer with DM8.8bn worth of business a year. The remaining stake in Vinci was held by the Oppenheim family, who had earlier sold out control to Victoire. 'With the Oppenheims having a 'put' or option to sell their stake, it was always clear that if they exercised it we would try to buy the stake,' said UAP, adding that 'the only question for us was how to minimise our cash outlay'. UAP's opportunity arose when it was privatised earlier this year. Westdeutsche Landesbank joined the 'noyau dur', or core of institutional investors organised by the French government. Like other core investors its stake was scaled back to 2.2 per cent by the French government, but the regional German bank wanted a higher stake. By putting up FFr482m (Dollars 92m) to buy bonds convertible into UAP shares  -thereby providing the French group with cash to pass on to the Oppenheim group - the German bank will now see its stake in UAP rise to 3 per cent. One third of the Oppenheim group's DM1.2bn stake will be paid for in bonds convertible into shares in the year 2000, one third in ordinary four-year bonds redeemable in cash, and one third in cash. This will leave the Oppenheim group with a 2.5 per cent stake in UAP.</p>

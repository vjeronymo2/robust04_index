			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As for the current distance standard (1500 linear feet or four spoil ridges, depending on the type of mining) in its regulations, Wyoming argued that it is arbitrary, unfairly affecting operations using large mining equipment. Wyoming asserted that operations using large equipment need a more relaxed standard in order to operate safely. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, Wyoming argued that its proposed regulation, although containing no statewide standards, is workable and inspectable because each operator must include time and/or distance standards in his or her permit application in accordance with the approved State program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM recognizes that, in addition to permit-specific time and distance standards, the requirement in the Wyoming program to provide an analysis that supports the dollar amount of an operators performance bond will encourage operators to reclaim in a timely fashion. Operators must include, in the permit application, a detailed operation plan, a reclamation plan, and a resource protection plan, including a plan for minimizing erosion and the extent of the disturbed area. The supporting analysis for the dollar amount of the performance bond is based upon these other plans. If these plans allow for an unusually large area of unreclaimed land to exist for an unusually long period of time, the dollar amount of the performance bond will be correspondingly large, to account for the increased chance of environmental degradation. Therefore, to keep the dollar amount of the performance bond from being so large that it is financially impractical, an operator will be constrained to reclaiming in a timely fashion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the proposed rule change to LQD Rules Chapter IV, Section 2(b)(i) is no less stringent than section 515(b)(16) of SMCRA and no less effective than 30 CFR 816.100 and is approving the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment. A public hearing was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Written comments were received from the Wyoming Outdoor Council (WOC) (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;24). The WOC expressed concern that the proposed rule changes are inconsistent with and less effective than the Federal laws and regulations as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The WOC questioned why the permanent State rules included the revised language upon which the Director deferred approval in 1986. In response, OSM notes that those rules, while incorporated into the State program by Wyoming, were never approved by OSM as part of the approved State program. As discussed previously in this notice, OSM deferred action on the proposed change in November of 1986. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) specifically provide that no changes proposed by the State to laws or regulations that make up an approved State program shall take effect for purposes of a State program until approved as a program amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The WOC asserted that the variables and factors described in Wyoming's November 30, 1993, letter of explanation should be specifically incorporated into the rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM does not agree with WOC. The State's rationale supporting its decision to repeal specific program-wide time and distance standards for backfilling and grading and its explanation of why local conditions and mining situations support non-specific program-wide standards, while helpful, is not critical to OSM's decision to approve these proposed changes. Wyoming's proposed changes to its contemporaneous reclamation regulations, without the inclusion of the explanation contained in the November 30, 1993, letter, are no less effective than the corresponding provisions of SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Therefore, OSM cannot require Wyoming to include the explanation of the November 30, 1993, letter in the actual language of the amended State regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

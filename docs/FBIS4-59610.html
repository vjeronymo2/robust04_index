			<p>BFN     [Text] The Jordanian-Palestinian Economic Committee, which  began its work last Tuesday [10 May], ended its meetings at the  Prime Ministry today. The Jordanian side was led by Dr. Jawad  al-'Anani, minister of state for cabinet affairs and information  minister, and the Palestinian side was led by Ahmad Quray', head  of the PLO Economic Department. Details are in the following  report:    [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] In a statement  to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY following the end of these  meetings, Dr. al-'Anani said the meetings were obviously aimed  at focusing on the substance of issues and finding detailed,  practical solutions in order to be able to provide the required  practical climate for starting a new stage of economic  cooperation on clear-cut bases and bolstering the Jordanian and  Palestinian economies.    He said: We have agreed on many basic points in several  areas of cooperation. But, he added, there are still two points  which the Palestinian brothers feel they should study further  and that they might clarify with the Palestinian leadership. He  said the two points revolve around ways of coordination to  license new banks, dealing with the Jordanian dinar, and  settling payments between the two sides. Dr. al-'Anani  explained that these points are not a subject of dispute, but  that they remained outstanding, pending a settlement. He  expressed hope that this will take place in the near future, and  said that if these two issues are settled, we will have  accomplished something extremely important to prepare for the  comprehensive concept of economic cooperation.    He added: We have agreed that after settling issues  pertaining to trade, customs tariff, transit, tourism, issues  related to the monetary and banking sector, and arrangements to  encourage the private sectors on both sides to cooperate, we  should move to another stage soon to discuss other issues, like  agriculture, industry, transportation, and the contract sector  in a detailed manner. He also explained that it has been agreed  in principle that the private sector's activities should occupy  a leading and clear position in cooperation and promoting  economic exchange.    Dr. al-'Anani expressed his thanks to and appreciation for  the Palestinian side for its seriousness and its sincere desire  to reach cooperation and joint concepts about various issues  under discussion.    For his part, Quray' told the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY: Over  the past days, we have held brotherly, sincere, and serious  talks on various issues of interest to us during the next stage  in order to support and assist the Palestinian authority to deal  with its burdens. Quray' also said: The most important  agreement we reached during these meetings is that we decided  that trade between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Palestine  should be free and should be exempted from all fees and taxes,  except every side's practices regarding its national product.    He added that it was also agreed that a free zone will be  established in the Jordan Valley to assist both sides' farmers  to store and process the agricultural products' surpluses and to  contribute to other projects.    Regarding banks and currency, he said: We have fully agreed  on licensing all the Jordanian banks in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip. It was also agreed that the Jordanian dinar would be the  main currency to be used, not just one of the currencies, and  would be the tool of registering and paying to the Palestinian  authority. He added: We also agreed to form subcommittees on  trade, currency, banks, and tourism, which we hope will begin  meetings as soon as possible. He added: There are still some  points that need more clarification from the Palestinian  leadership, and we will work for that purpose during the next  two days and will return to resume our meetings. He said: The  session was adjourned and will be resumed very soon. Quray'  said that what is left is a discussion of the details and  translating the approved working program into facts, as well as  monitoring our ability to implement, develop, and expand it in  the future.

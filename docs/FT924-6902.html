			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Indian brokers end strike INDIAN stockbrokers yesterday called off a boycott and resumed trading on the Bombay bourse after a call from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the market watchdog, to restore normal trading before it would discuss their grievances. The brokers were protesting at the introduction of hefty registration fees. Mr G. V. Ramakrishna, chairman of the Sebi, told a Bombay stock exchange delegation that wildcat strikes on stock exchanges would not be tolerated. But Mr Ramakrishna held out an olive branch offering to give immediate attention to genuine problems brokers might have. Presidents of all the big stock exchanges will meet in Bombay on November 23 to discuss the brokers' complaints. The brokers are claiming that the registration fee is a form of turnover tax.</p>

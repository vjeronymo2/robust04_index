			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 2,506 propellers of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 1,150 propellers installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1.5 work hours per propeller to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, and on the average utilization rate of 2,000 hours TIS per year equating to 4 inspections, the total cost impact of the current AD per year on U.S. operators is estimated to be $379,500. However, based on an average utilization rate of 2,000 hours TIS per year, this superseding AD will eliminate 2.7 inspections per year per propeller, resulting in an approximate yearly cost savings to U.S. operators of $256,163.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.

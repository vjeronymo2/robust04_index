			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Katharina Frank: "Money Laundering by Mail; </F> Turkish Dealers Are Bringing Their Assets Abroad, Disguising  Them as the Earnings of Guest Workers"]    [Text] Hamburg, Lindenstrasse Post Office: a sinister  individual with a plastic bag goes up to the window and empties  a pile of crumpled bank notes into the opening.    "That is drug money!" protests a courageous postal customer  waiting in line.    Caught. The man with the plastic bag loses his  nerve, flees the room, and leaves behind 20,000 marks [DM].    A little later, accomplices of the hindered depositor  surround the post office on Lindenstrasse and one of them forces  the branch chief to give back the money.    An untypical failure. Normally the money laundering on the  Alster works very smoothly. What street dealers of the Turkish  mafia deliver today is in the accounts of the drug clan beyond  the Bosporus tomorrow. The police are powerless.    Sigmund Zwirn from the Hamburg Customs explains the money  laundering system: "The drug money is paid into general accounts  of Turkish banks agents at different post offices. These  financial institutions themselves are not allowed to accept any  cash. They just handle the clearance system and have nothing to  do with drugs."    Advantage for the mafia: Whereas normal financial  institutions check the identity of depositors with every foreign  transaction, Turkish bank agents do not require this in the case  of the so-called "guest worker money."    In this way, about DM240 million flows to Turkey every year  from Hamburg alone and some DM50 million from Bremen. Sigmund  Zwirn cannot say how much dirty money is involved there. He  does, however, register an increase in the suspicious  transactions.    "Formerly adolescents and asylum-seekers took sums as large  as DM100,000 to the postal windows. Now, because of the new law  on money laundering, the money couriers come only with amounts  under DM20,000 but they come more often and accompanied by  bodyguards. Or they hire Germans who handle the formalities for  them."    Postal bankers do regret that the Yellow Giant is being  misused by the Turkish drug mafia as a money laundering machine  but they do not feel responsible. Postal bank spokeswoman  Marianne Bork: "The legislators must give thought to these  abuses, not us."    Other banks, other customs: When, for example, the  Bremen Savings Bank learned two years ago from the customs  search that drug money was being deposited at their windows as  well, it immediately ended its relations with the Turkish bank  agents.    The money laundering of the postal service is not the only  way in which about a million a day in drug money reaches Turkey  from Hamburg alone.    In Hamburg-Fuhlsbuettel, policewomen pulled a total of  DM45,000 from the underwear of two Kurdish women in a check  before their departing flight. Spicy is the fact that the women  were flown in at the expense of the Justice Department to  testify in the trial of a drug dealer.</p>

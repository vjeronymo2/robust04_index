			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENCY CALLED UNFIT TO REGULATE STOCK-INDEX FUTURES;  </P> <P> COMMODITIES: EX-SEN. THOMAS EAGLETON TELLS A SENATE PANEL THE CFTC IS A LAP DOG  OF THE CHICAGO-BASED FUTURES INDUSTRY.  </P> <P> A former U.S. senator who served three years on the board of a Chicago  commodities exchange told a divided Senate panel Wednesday that the Commodity  Futures Trading Commission is inept and ill-equipped to regulate stock-index  futures markets.  </P> <P> Thomas Eagleton, who resigned from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange board of  governors in a bitter dispute last year, told the Committee on Banking, Housing  and Urban Affairs that the CFTC is a lap dog to the futures industry centered  in Chicago.  </P> <P> "The CFTC trembles at the sight of Chicago," Eagleton said at a hearing on a  Bush Administration bill that would end the CFTC's exclusive authority over  futures markets and would move stock-index futures regulation to the Securities  and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> The proposal has produced a pitched battle between the two agencies and between  the futures and securities industries.  </P> <P> Eagleton, a former senator from Missouri, and several securities industries  spokesmen said regulation of financial products derived from stock markets,  including stock-index futures, should come under the SEC for uniform policing  to try to prevent repeats of the stock market plunges of October, 1987 and  1989.  </P> <P> Representatives of two Chicago exchanges, which virulently oppose the  Administration's bill, had been slated to testify Wednesday, but instead will  testify in two weeks.  </P> <P> Committee members also took opposing stands on the bill, and several  acknowledged its chances of Senate approval are slim.  </P> <P> "I have the very strong suspicion that there are not the votes to accomplish"  the power shift between the two agencies, said Christopher Bond, a Missouri  Republican.  </P> <P> He suggested that one compromise would be giving the Federal Reserve authority  over stock-index futures margins -- which some consider a key element in  strengthening futures market regulation.  </P> <P> Exchanges currently set margins -- the amount of cash that the exchanges  require to trade contracts -- subject to CFTC oversight.  </P> <P> Critics of the futures industry and of the CFTC argue that stock-index futures  margins are too low, allowing speculators to hold under-leveraged positions and  increasing market volatility.  </P> <P> Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, said  the fact that traders and institutions can control "such a large amount of  stock with so little money" could result in "a major market disruption."  </P> <P> Hardiman and others from the securities industry also told the committee that  the 1989 stock market plunges were made worse by computer program and arbitrage  trading in stock market futures. They said CFTC regulation of those futures  markets was inadequate.  </P> <P> Eagleton called the CFTC a "pygmy" as a regulator. He said it is a "political  dumping ground," has been under-funded and under-staffed and is "the play-toy  of Chicago," partly because the agency must be reauthorized every three years,  requiring political support.  </P> <P> But Alan Dixon, an Illinois Democrat, said a bill that has been held up by the  current power struggle would have increased CFTC funding and regulatory powers.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments through 21 May:    A factory producing yogurt made of soybean milk has begun  operations in the city of Holguin. This plant is the first of  its kind in the country with Cuban technology. The factory  reportedly has a daily production capacity of 10,000 liters, but  is currently producing approximately 6,000 liters of yogurt,  which are distributed every four days to children of between 7  and 13 years of age in the environs of the city of Holguin.  Soybean milk has the same nutritional properties as cow's milk  but with the advantage that it can cause no hoof-and- mouth  disease or high cholesterol. The report adds that 10 tons of  yogurt can be obtained from one ton of soybeans.

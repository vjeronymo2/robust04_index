			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A QUINTET OF YOUNG PLAYERS FOR THE '90S;  </P> <P> IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A DEFINITE REJUVENATION IN ACOUSTIC JAZZ  -- PARTICULARLY OF THE MAINSTREAM PERSUASION, WHERE THE MUSIC'S TRUE ROOTS  RESIDE, BUT ALSO IN THE AVANT-GARDE. SOME ARTISTS HAVE MANAGED TO CONCOCT  STYLES THAT INVIGORATINGLY AND INVENTIVELY BLEND THE TWO STYLES. CALENDAR'S  JAZZ WRITERS HAVE SELECTED THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS AS THOSE MOST LIKELY TO  HAVE AN IMPACT IN THIS REVITALIZED AREA IN THE COMING DECADE.;  </P> <P> MARCUS ROBERTS  </P> <P> A great believer in the jazz tradition, Marcus Roberts may be one of the best  bets for its survival through the next decade. His work as pianist and  orchestrator for Wynton Marsalis has revealed a deep commitment to the  mainstream values of harmonic improvisation, melodic creativity and rhythmic  swing.  </P> <P> As an improviser, Roberts finds inspiration in the musical conceptualizing of  Duke Ellington, the disjunct rhythms and off-beat harmonies of Thelonious Monk  and the spirituality of John Coltrane -- not a bad combination of influences.  </P> <P> His soloing -- best typified on his Novus recording "The Truth Is Spoken Here"  -- flows easily from the familiarity of the blues to the eccentricities of the  avant-garde. And it is part of Roberts' considerable skill that he manages to  do so in completely seamless fashion, connecting the past to the present  without the trace of a misstep. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

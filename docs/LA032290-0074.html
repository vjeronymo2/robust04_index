			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: TROLLEY HELPS TO PUT DESIGN ON RIGHT TRACK DOWNTOWN  </P> <P> As the city's downtown grows up, new combinations of uses are giving architects  fresh design challenges. The results are some of the most interesting buildings  in years.  </P> <P> Take transportation systems, for example. Developers now realize that by  integrating their projects with bus and trolley lines, they can make city  planners happy while delivering office workers and retail consumers to their  doorsteps.  </P> <P> As the San Diego Trolley expands downtown, architects are getting a chance to  do lively projects along its tracks. Chicago architect Helmut Jahn's new  headquarters for Great American Bank, now being built on Broadway, will  straddle the trolley line. The movement of trolley cars and people through  these spaces should give the project the same kind of energy Jahn captured in  his widely publicized Chicago terminal for United Airlines.  </P> <P> Across downtown, at 12th and Imperial avenues, the James R. Mills Building -- a  mixed-use project incorporating a trolley station, government offices and  ground-level shops -- shows how exciting the confluence of people, cars and  trolleys can be.  </P> <P> The building, which opened early last year, has received several awards for its  design. Last June, the local American Institute of Architects chapter selected  it to receive an Honor Award, its highest recognition.  </P> <P> Instead of being just another government office complex, the building is a  people machine. Walking toward it from any direction, you find yourself drawn  by its graceful 220-foot-high clock tower ground-level activity.  </P> <P> Trolleys roll through, stopping to pick up passengers. People come and go. Some  leave their cars in the parking structure and take the trolley into downtown.  Others observe and are observed as they sit outdoors at a large circular plaza  in front, at tables outside a deli and at a smaller outdoor area behind the  main building. This last area will serve the trolley's bayside line, scheduled  to open this summer.  </P> <P> Inside the station's convenience mart-snack shop, people relax with a  newspaper, a deli sandwich or a soft drink from stools behind large panes of  glass.  </P> <P> Such vibrant urban transportation hubs are common in the east, but are all too  rare in California.  </P> <P> Deceptively simple in appearance, the complex marks a sophisticated departure  from what's been done downtown. The building's strong, clean exterior  geometries grew from its structural system, instead of being lifted from this  year's trendy design book or designed as an imitation of history.  </P> <P> Starboard Development was hired by the Metropolitan Transit Development Board  to build the project on time and on budget. As part of its team, Starboard  brought in the San Diego architectural firm of Delawie Bretton Wilkes  Associates.  </P> <P> What a difference a client can make. The architects had also collaborated with  Starboard on the city of San Diego's downtown police station, completed in  1985, but with a much less impressive result. Michael Wilkes, a partner in the  firm, defended the police station as a decent building on a limited budget.  After additional prodding, though, he indirectly acknowledged the transit  building's more sophisticated design.  </P> <P> "Why the chemistry was better, I can't tell you," he said. One reason, perhaps,  is that transit officials seemed to have an intuitive sense of what makes good  architecture. MTDB General Manager Tom Larwin insisted that his company's new  office building incorporate the trolley station, instead of making it separate.  </P> <P> The architects' initial design shows where the project might have gone without  input from Larwin and others, such as City Architect Mike Stepner, Centre City  Development Corp. urban design expert Max Schmidt and San Diego city planners  Paul Curcio and Marianne Munsell.  </P> <P> A downtown train station designed early this century by San Diego architect  Irving Gill served as a stylistic point of departure (it was torn down a few  years later when the tracks were moved).  </P> <P> The early version of the MTDB complex was a weird combination of free-standing  walls resembling mission ruins, in front of a low glass box. The trolley tracks  passed behind the building.  </P> <P> Pressed by Larwin &amp; Co. to provide a new building incorporating additional  office space that could be leased to other users, the architects designed a  clean-lined building with trolley trains running through its base and a clock  tower as a focal point.  </P> <P> Eventually, MTDB decided to maximize development of its site. Starboard signed  up the county of San Diego to take 75% of the space, and MTDB asked for a  10-story building with a six-story parking structure.  </P> <P> In response, the architects pulled the clock tower away as a separate feature.  It serves as the project's visual anchor, while giving downtown San Diego a  significant landmark in an area mostly occupied by run-down industrial  buildings.  </P> <P> Instead of completely covering the building's steel frame, the architects made  it a key feature. Painted red to pick up the color of the trolleys, the steel  members form striking giant X's at the building's base. A single size of  window, repeated many times, cut costs and generated eye-catching visual  rhythms.  </P> <P> Between windows, the building is covered with a light, Styrofoam-like material  called Sto. It had never been used in San Diego, according to the architects,  and it gives the building a rich, solid appearance.  </P> <P> City planner Munsell gets credit for suggesting landscaping the top of the  parking structure. Planters atop tall pillars contain creeping vines that will  eventually spread along the structure's perimeter, following a network of  wires.  </P> <P> Despite its many successes, the Mills building has shortcomings.  </P> <P> For one thing, the clock tower should be more than a giant piece of art. At  30-by-30-feet square, couldn't it have housed some uses? MTDB General Counsel  Jack Limber, who departed from his usual legal and management duties to oversee  this project, said the construction budget didn't allow anything inside the  tower.  </P> <P> But a 30-by-30 space could have become a 900-square-foot artist's loft on each  of several floors. It would have been interesting to see proposals for  developing the tower's interior.  </P> <P> Even without a useful purpose within, the tower needs something to animate its  base. A ground-floor snack shop, sandwich counter, news stand or some other use  would give people a reason to use the adjacent plaza more often. It's not too  late to consider this.  </P> <P> A final drawback is the shady central plaza, where the sun's rays are blocked  by the office building most of the day. That's not a problem during the warmer  months, but, on a breezy March morning, the plaza was deserted. People  clustered in one splotch of sunlight at its outer edge.  </P> <P> DESIGN NOTES: Michael Graves, designer of the Aventine, the new La Jolla  office-hotel complex that is not well-liked by many San Diego architects, gets  heavy coverage in the March issue of Progressive Architecture. If San Diegans  think the Aventine is wild, they should see Graves' cartoonish Florida hotels  for Disney, topped with giant swans.  </P></p>

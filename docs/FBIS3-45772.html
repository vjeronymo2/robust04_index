Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the  Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference and member of the  Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese  Communist Party's Central Committee, made the remarks at a  gathering of more than 400 Chinese scientific and technological  workers.    He attributed this to the correct leadship of Deng Xiaoping,  who determined the guideline of making economic construction the  center of the party's work and voiced the thesis that  "intellectuals are a part of the working class" and "science and  technology are the primary productive forces".    Li noted that the situation in the intellectual, scientific  and technological circles is generally good, though there are  some problems.    He encouraged scientific and technological workers to  combine  science and technology more closely with the development of  production, with reference to foreign experience.    State Councillor Song Jian greeted the Chinese scientific  and  technological workers on behalf of the State Council.    Song Jian said that more investment should be put into the  development of science and technology and governments at all  levels should further improve the working and living conditions  for the scientific and technological workers.</p>

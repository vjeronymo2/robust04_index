			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. AFRICA-ISRAEL MILITARY TIES  </P> <P> In response to Fairchild's column:  </P> <P> Finally someone has written the truth about what Louis Farrakhan and the Nation  of Islam represent. They represent a positive black role model for the African  American.  </P> <P> Although many may be skeptical about the religious practices, the African  American community praises Minister Farrakhan for providing hope and  encouragement for a productive and prosperous community.  </P> <P> The reason Minister Farrakhan is feared by Americans is because he exposes the  racial prejudice and white supremacist attitude that this country was built on.  This attitude is rooted deep in the American ideology. Fairchild used the  murder of Oliver Beasley, a member of the Nation of Islam, at the hands of a  Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy as an example of the racist attitudes that  are prevalent today. This must change.  </P> <P> Fairchild's analysis of the Nation of Islam clarifies the negative  misconceptions expressed by the media. Fairchild recognizes the need for  Farrakhan to find less antagonistic means in expressing his concerns regarding  the Jewish community. However, Fairchild points out that more attention is  focused on Minister Farrakhan's so-called verbal attacks on the Jewish  community than on the Israel-South Africa connection. It is obvious that the  Israel-South Africa connection has greater ramifications throughout the world.  </P> <P> I agree with Fairchild in regards to the fact that Farrakhan is much harder,  verbally, on the African American community in comparison to the Jewish  community. More media attention should be focused on the positive influence  that Minister Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam bring to the African American  community.  </P> <P> FRANCOIS VERIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- The Russian president stands  for preserving the defence budget at the last year's level in  comparable prices, without precluding its possible moderate  growth, presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told a  briefing on Thursday in reply to an ITAR-TASS question.    However, Boris Yeltsin does not intend to yield to lobbying  and to permit its sharp rise: such a disbalance is fraught with  an increase in social tension.    The press secretary called attention to the fact that  "communist-Zhirinovskiy opposition", speaking in words about  their loyalty to the army, voted at the Russian parliament lower  house for a minimum defence budget for tactical reasons.    According to Kostikov, it wants to give hand-outs to the  army, causing dissatisfaction there, and to put it at  loggerheads with the president.    Kostikov also expressed the president's concern over the  continued campaign in some media against Russian Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev.    "The president does not see clearly reasons behind it. There  are no real grounds to say that there is misunderstanding  between the president and the defence minister," he stressed.    "The president declares his full political and moral support  for Pavel Grachev. But at the same time, he does not want to  show that he has no serious claims to the minister," Kostikov  continued, adding that Yeltsin is not satisfied with progress of  the military reform.</p>

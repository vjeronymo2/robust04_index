			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Observer: Leading from the rear Why has Britain's Labour party shied away from pushing one of its 45 MEPs to run for the forthcoming vacancy as president of the European Parliament, when Germany's Egon Klepsch steps down? It's a much more important job than it used to be, especially now that the European parliament has the power to vet new commissioners. Labour MEPs are the single biggest contingent in the socialist group, in turn the biggest group in the European parliament. The number of Labour MEPs could easily swell to more than 50 in the forthcoming elections, giving them even more clout. If they wanted one of their own heading the parliament, David Martin, a 39-year-old Scotsman who has been a MEP for a decade, would be the obvious choice. He's been described as the Tony Blair of the European parliament. However, the Labour party has decided that instead of shooting for the presidency, its MEPs should try for second best - chairing the socialist group. And instead of pushing Martin for the job, they are also fielding Pauline Green, 45, whom some regard as a second best candidate. It might make tactical sense. Britain's Labour MEPs are never going to get both jobs and probably stand more of a chance of securing the socialist group leadership. Nevertheless the decision to push Green is another sign that John Smith, leader of Britain's Labour party, wants to keep his MEPs on a short lead in the run-up to Britain's own elections. The last thing Labour wants is to have an articulate proponent of the socialist super-state - in a position where he could highlight the cracks in Labour's own European policy.</p>

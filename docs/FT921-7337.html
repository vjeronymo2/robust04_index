			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / White House lifts missile sale sanctions on Beijing The US said yesterday it was lifting sanctions on China imposed last summer after evidence Beijing was supplying missiles to Syria and Pakistan, agencies report from Washington. The sanctions were announced last June and prevented US companies going ahead with plans to provide China with Dollars 30m (Pounds 17.1m) worth of high-speed computers and work stations. They also banned transfer of missile technology between the two countries and the export of US satellites. The State Department said the sanctions were being lifted because China had promised to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime, which aims to restrict the spread of advanced missile technology and weaponry. The White House action came just days before a scheduled Senate vote on whether to impose conditions on renewal of most-favoured-nation trade status for China when current certification expires in June. The vote is set for Tuesday.</p>

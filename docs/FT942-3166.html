			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Brazilian currency tensions increase Tensions are rising in the Brazilian government ahead of the July 1 launch of the country's new currency, the real. President Itamar Franco, a populist who has often opposed the orthodox economics of the finance ministry, is thought to support lower interest rates and improved wage levels, at least for some public sector employees. However, the finance ministry believes relaxing policy on either front would threaten the government's anti-inflation plan, of which the new currency is the final step. Mr Romildo Canhim, a minister with links to the military, is pushing to unify public-sector pay at a single, higher rate and for an extra 29 per cent army pay rise. Both measures would benefit the armed services, but could cost between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 7bn a year. Such an increase would immediately send the government budget into deficit and undermine the credibility of the real. In the past, some of President Franco's more wayward demands have been blocked by his advisers or the former finance minister, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso. But Mr Cardoso's successor, Mr Rubens Ricupero, has so far seemed less prepared to stand up to the president. For example, President Franco decided last week that private-sector school fees would be cut sharply when the new currency is introduced, even though such measures are unsustainable for more than a few months. For the finance ministry, which is finalising details of introduction of the real, disagreement within the government and threats to the budget are very worrying. The real, which will initially be pegged at parity to the US dollar, is to be backed by a portion of Brazil's Dollars 35bn foreign reserves.</p>

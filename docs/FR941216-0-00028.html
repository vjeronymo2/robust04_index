The authority citation for 48 CFR Parts 525 and 552 continues to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 40 U.S.C. 486(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 525_FOREIGN ACQUISITION <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 525.203 is revised to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 525.203  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation of offers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The HCA or a designee may authorize the use of a particular foreign construction material when the use of a comparable domestic construction material would unreasonably increase the cost of the contract. The cost of a particular domestic construction material shall be determined to be unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 6 percent. The cost of construction material includes all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The evaluation process described in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Excepted materials listed in the solicitation; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) European Community (EC) and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) country construction materials offered in response to solicitations for construction contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Offerors proposing to use foreign construction materials (other than EC or NAFTA country construction materials on contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more) are required to provide adequate information for Government evaluation under paragraph (a) of this section. Offerors may submit alternate offers for comparable domestic construction materials at stated prices. When foreign construction material (other than EC or NAFTA country construction materials on contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more) is not authorized under paragraph (a), evaluation of the offer must be based on the stated price, if any, for comparable domestic material. If an offeror proposing to use foreign construction materials (other than EC or NAFTA country construction materials on contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more) does not furnish data on the cost of comparable domestic construction material, and the use of foreign construction material is not authorized, such offer must be rejected, unless the contracting officer is able to obtain prices on comparable domestic material which verifies that domestic prices are unreasonable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The contracting officer shall add 6 percent to the cost of foreign construction materials (other than EC or NAFTA country construction materials on contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more) authorized for use in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, to the prices offered, if applicable, for evaluation purposes only. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

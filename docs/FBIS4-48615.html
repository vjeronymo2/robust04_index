			<p>BFN     [Text] Striking police in Lesotho abducted Information  Minister Mpho Malie from his car at gunpoint today and took him  away for interrogation. Diplomats said Mr. Malie, who is also  the acting finance minister, was [word indistinct] after he made  a hardline statement on state radio on Sunday critical of the  strike by police and prison guards now in its third week. A  Western diplomat quoted the police mutineers as saying that the  minister had been taken for interrogation. His whereabouts were  not immediately known.    Some 2,500 of the country's 3,000 police have been on strike  for 60-percent wage increases and other benefits since May 9th.  They were joined by many of the country's prison guards, with  senior officers keeping the jails operating.    Another cabinet minister, Mines Minister Monyane Moleleki  fled to South Africa last Thursday, apparently in fear for his  life. He vanished a day before he was due to host the annual  meeting of mine ministers of SADC [Southern African Development  Community] attended by South Africa for the first time. The  meeting went ahed without him.    Diplomats said Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle called a meeting  of the Defense Council after Mr. Malie's abduction, but there  was no word on what he had decided.</p>

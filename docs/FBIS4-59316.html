			<p>BFN     [Text] In a treacherous and cowardly act that can be  committed only by hysterical people who sense that their demise  is inevitable and who face the gloomy fate that awaits every  murderer, the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] Command has fired its destructive  long-range Scud missiles against civilian installations and  residential quarters in Sanaa and other Yemeni cities in the  northern and western governorates. A missile fell on a  residential quarter in Sanaa at dawn today, martyring more than  23 citizens, completely demolishing four houses, and damaging  others. The bodies of a newly-wed couple, still in the first  week of their marriage, were removed from under the rubble.    The masses that arrived on the scene condemned this criminal  act that targets the lives of citizens -- women, children, and  the elderly -- and denounced these vindictive actions carried  out by the seccessionist clique in the YSP. These show the  rancor this clique harbors toward the sons of our people.    Another missile fell on al-Rahidah Hospital the day before  yesterday, killing many patients.    All these criminal acts are part of the attempt to undermine  our people. However, these acts will only make our people more  committed to unity and more insistent on defending it and  protecting Constitutional legitimacy, and more determined to rid  themselves of killers and murderers who have no qualms.</p>

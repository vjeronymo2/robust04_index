			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Economy: Clarke cool on ERM prospects MR Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, said last night that the government was unlikely to consider rejoining the European exchange rate mechanism 'for some considerable time'. He said on BBC's Newsnight programme that 'recent events put off rather than bring forward the prospects of our going into the ERM. 'Right now, obviously, I think everybody can see that not only have we left the ERM but there is no immediately foreseeable prospect of our going back in, because the ERM itself is in a very uncertain state. 'Britain rejoining the ERM is not an option we are looking at at the moment,' he continued. 'It does not seem to me very likely we will be looking at it for quite some considerable time. There would have to be some reform before we went back into anything like the ERM.' The home secretary added: 'Actually, I think we are doing rather well outside the ERM. The turmoil which is affecting some of these markets is having a less adverse effect on Britain so far, and by and large we have successfully managed a reduction of our interest rates to the lowest in western Europe.' Mr Clarke also played down any rift between the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer. 'Whenever I meet them, they seem to be working very closely together and to be on extremely good terms, and have a very clear idea of what they are doing,' he said. In the Commons earlier, Tory and Labour backbenchers attempted unsuccessfully to halt the debate on the measure giving legal effect to the Maastricht treaty on the grounds that after the devaluation of the Irish punt the exchange rate mechanism was in effect dead.</p>

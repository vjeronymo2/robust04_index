			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Bosnians urged to agree map RUSSIA yesterday stepped up pressure on Bosnia's warring parties to accept the international peace plan, dividing their land into 10 semi-autonomous provinces mainly along ethnic lines, agencies report. The Russian statement was issued as Bosnia's Moslem-led government and the Bosnian Serbs considered their response to the peace plan drawn up by international mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. 'The current round of talks in New York confirmed the absence of a real alternative to the Vance-Owen plan as the basis for a settlement in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' Russian President Boris Yeltsin said. The peace talks in New York were interrupted on Saturday to give the Bosnian Moslem government and its Serb adversaries time to decide whether they accept the mediators' map.</p>

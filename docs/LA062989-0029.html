			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET'S EAT OUT: PAPAGAYO OFFERS A TASTE OF MEXICO IN LAKE ARROWHEAD  </P> <P> "If we get to Lake Arrowhead before you, we'll just head for the Mexican  restaurant in Blue Jay and have a cerveza. Meet us there," said a friend.  </P> <P> I couldn't think of any Mexican restaurant in Blue Jay and told her so.  </P> <P> "It's just as you're heading into town. Maybe it's not Blue Jay -- what's the  name of that other place? Agua Fria? It's right next to the gas station."  </P> <P> As it turned out, we arrived first and waited for our friends to drive us to La  Cantina de Papagayo. It was Friday night and the place was jammed, but we  managed to grab a tiny table on the half-completed outdoor patio while we  waited for a larger one in the dining room.  </P> <P> A basket of warm tortilla chips, some spicy salsa and a liter of Margaritas  kept us very content until our table became available. Their chips are light  and crispy, obviously fried in fresh vegetable shortening. They make the chunky  salsa daily, and we discovered the consistency and flavor varies slightly not  only from night to night but from dish to dish. All of it, however, has plenty  of bite.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frothy Margaritas  </P> <P> The Margaritas are nice and frothy and not too sweet. We overheard another  customer telling his friends they were "the best around." We also tried the  strawberry variation, which tasted like it had been made with fresh berries.  They come flavored with peach, melon and coconut too.  </P> <P> Eight hot appetizers are available on the patio and in the tiny bar area. Nic's  taquito bits are terrific -- two flour tortillas rolled up with shredded beef,  deep fried, then cut into bite size pieces, topped with ranchera sauce and  cheese and garnished with sour cream.  </P> <P> If you prefer a little less sauce, try the nachos supremas. Tortilla chips are  topped with Jack and Cheddar cheeses, ground beef, tomatoes, onions, black  olives, green chiles and dabs of guacamole and sour cream.  </P> <P> The pizza Mexicana is similar but uses one large crispy flour tortilla as the  base and adds beans and enchilada sauce to the aforementioned toppings.  Papagayo wings, a take-off on Buffalo chicken wings, was the spiciest of the  appetizer selections we tried.  </P> <P> You could easily make a meal of the appetizers at Papagayo's, but there are  also plenty of worthwhile entrees. The carnitas are served as a build-your-own  burrito, with a choice of three flour or corn tortillas to wrap the lean  shredded pork, refried beans, green salsa and salad of shredded lettuce, sliced  black olives and chopped tomatoes, jalapenos and cilantro.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Generous Portions  </P> <P> Portions, in general, are generous, so it wasn't surprising the el gordo  burrito lived up to its name. The large flour tortilla was bulging with chunk  and ground beef, rice, cheese, refried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, black olives  and verde sauce. It is only outdone by the el puerco grande, which is made with  two large tortillas and billed as "a burrito that will stuff one, fill two or  satisfy three."  </P> <P> There are also dessert burritos, filled with apple or peach filling, deep fried  and topped with whipped cream. Our waitress suggested them over the sopaipillas  "because they were lighter." When we showed obvious doubt, she brought the can  of light whipped cream to our table to prove her point.  </P> <P> That's typical of the restaurant's service. Even when business is brisk, the  service people are friendly and attentive.  </P> <P> The atmosphere is also warm and very casual. The menu says Papagayo is home of  the wild parrot, so a couple portraits of the bird hang on the imitation walnut  paneling that covers most of the walls and ceiling. Where it doesn't, there is  fern wallpaper behind the black plastic upholstered booths. An assortment of  wrought iron lamps provide lighting and plastic flowers add a note of color.  </P> <P> I had just been commenting that the carpet needed vacuuming when someone came  past with one of those hand carpet sweepers. My friends just laughed. "This is  a mountain kind of place. What do you expect?"  </P> <P>  La Cantina de Papagayo, junction of Daley Canyon Road and State Highway 189,  Agua Fria, (714) 337-9529. Open Sunday through Thursday, from 11 a.m. to 9  p.m.; Friday and Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. No reservations. Mastercard  and Visa accepted. Parking on both sides of the highway.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In a telephone call to Qol  Yisra'el's Arabic-language Department, the Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam terrorist squad  claimed responsibility for this morning's attack near Hebron.  The callers gave details about the way the attack was  perpetrated. Army forces, headed by Major General Sha'ul Mufaz,  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] commander in Judaea and Samaria,  were rushed to the scene of the attack. Our correspondent Moti  Amir reports that the vehicle in which the terrorists were  traveling was found totally burned a short time ago in Hebron.    Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur said that extremists  in  the Palestinian camp want to torpedo the peace process but will  have no choice but to enter into negotiations with us. Gur sent  condolences to the families of the dead and wished the wounded  woman a speedy recovery. The deputy minister is touring Israeli  settlements in the Jericho area today. He passed through  Jericho but did not stop there.    Reactions in the Knesset to the attack: The National  Religious Party said this is merely the opening shot in a joint  offensive by the PLO and the other terrorist organizations.  Tzomet said it is additional proof that the actions of the  Palestinians will force us into a bloody war. Our correspondent  Hayim Hecht reports that Moledet said today's deaths are more on  the list of Yitzhaq Rabin's war casualties.</p>

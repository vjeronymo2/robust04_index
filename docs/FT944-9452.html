			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (15): Smart card meets ingenious terminal - The humble automated teller is set to grow into an all-purpose multimedia kiosk Enfield, in north London, can perhaps lay claim to being the oldest junction on the financial world's information superhighway. It was here, at a branch of Barclays, that the world's first 'hole-in-the-wall' cash dispenser went live, in June 1965. Now there are 300,000 of the ubiquitous automated teller machines (ATMs). Gallup Organisation, the market researcher, says that six out of 10 adults in the industrialised countries of the west now carry an ATM card. And, according to Tony Knight, who researches telecommunications and computing technology at Henley Management College, the ATM is developing into a much more capable terminal - 'with the advent of smart cards, the user will be able to transact much of their financial business through such a terminal,' he says. Paul Rogers, marketing manager for AT&amp;T self-service products, which makes a third of the world's ATMs, says future sales of the ATM will evolve from a low level cash dispenser into a multimedia kiosk capable of automating many service functions - 'any retailer wanting to sell services and products or provide information will use the multimedia kiosks, which have opened up a whole new delivery channel . . . thus, we'll see a big growth of multimedia kiosks by the end of the century.' He also predicts that new entrants could threaten the financial institutions' monopoly of ATMs - 'new multi-functional terminals could be operated by telecom companies,' he says, 'These will replace telephone boxes and will contain video and computer devices. They will be able to link users by telephone, fax, or computer. Services be paid for by smart cards. 'These terminals, linked to any bank, will be able to credit or debit cards, so that all kinds of financial transactions can be carried out at one terminal, to any bank or financial institution,' he says. 'The question is: 'Will the banks get into communications before the communications people get into banking?'' Whoever is first to operate the new wave of machines, the ultimate winners will be the ATM manufacturers. NCR, Digital, IBM, Diebold, Fujitsu, Nixdorf and Olivetti are gearing up to design machines that will allow banks to give better service to customers. The Huntington National Bank in the US has already introduced its Personal Touch system which has an interactive video conferencing service. It allows ATM-users to see and talk with a bank staff member, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Although a video link was demonstrated by the American Bankers' Association in 1965, until recently the equipment has been too expensive. Cheaper data storage and communication lines have now made it viable - 'customers are demanding more personal banking convenience,' says Richard Stage, executive vice-president at Huntington. 'Personal Touch is not the final solution for personal interactive banking but rather a transitional solution on the way to home banking services.' Manufacturers emphasise that for ATM systems to succeed, they must enhance the feeling that a bank cares for its customers. Gunnar Enroth, in charge of market development at Digital's Business Centre for Financial Industries in Stockholm, believes that installations of multi-functional ATMs may not be the way to achieve greater customer satisfaction. 'Most bank customers use ATMs only to withdraw cash,' says Mr Enroth. 'Nobody likes waiting in a queue. Even a cash withdrawal, particularly from a hole-in-the-wall machine where the cash has to be transported from inside the building to the outside, can take up to two minutes. If other, more lengthy services are offered on the same machine, the customers waiting in line will soon become disaffected.' He believes that there will be growing number of fast machines, dedicated to individual tasks, just as larger branches of banks have specific counters for different transactions. Digital has designed terminals which allow customers to make credit applications, using touch-screen technology. Under law, forms still need to be printed out and signed before the banks can process the applications but, with all details captured electronically, the acceptance period is speeded up. Bank customers, however, share a natural distrust of new technology. This could slow down the introduction of new self-service banking terminals - 'the banks must provide real incentives to persuade customers to use the new terminals,' says Mr Enroth. 'After all, electronic transactions will reduce bank costs and the benefits should be shared therefore with the customer.' AT&amp;T has tried to break down techno-fear by making the user's experience more stimulating. It is supporting the new Galleria 21 shopping concept now being piloted at Heathrow's passenger terminals. Travellers can explore the 'shopless shop' at 24 shopping kiosks, each of which contains a touch-screen offering the opportunity to browse through catalogues and make purchases by inserting credit cards. Half a dozen British bookmakers are using similar technology to accept bets on a variety of sporting events. The more that terminals are used in other spheres of life, the easier it is believed it will be for financial institutions to automate their outlets. But what about security? Customers accept ATM cards with magnetic stripes and are about to experience smart cards with embedded chips. They are also prepared to memorise Pin numbers. But, if more facilities are to be offered through ATMs, will the established system give adequate protection to both the customer and the financial institution? 'We have tested the various other methods being suggested to replace Pin codes but they are not sufficiently accurate,' says Mr Enroth. 'Face-recognition, palm prints, voice recognition, eye iris matching - so far, none of these methods have the high accuracy rates which the banks need so that customers are not wrongly refused service.' Thus, the familiar plastic 86mm x 54mm card will provide access an ever-wider range of services. Some observers suggest that even general elections could one day be held via ATMs. Given that most people are more secretive about their financial affairs than about their politics, this development may also be 'on the cards.'</p>

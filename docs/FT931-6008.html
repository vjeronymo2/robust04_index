			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Russell Hobbs recovery helps Pifco A RETURN to the black at Russell Hobbs Tower helped Pifco, the electrical appliances group, report a 79 per cent increase in profits for the half year to October 31. Profits rose from Pounds 577,000 to Pounds 1.03m pre-tax on sales down from Pounds 21.8m to Pounds 20.4m. Mr Michael Webber, chairman, said the fall in turnover reflected the group's drive for profitability over market share. Extensive surgery had returned RHT to profitability for the first time since the company was bought from the administrators of Polly Peck International in April 1991. In the 28 months before the acquisition it incurred losses of Pounds 31m. Mr Webber said: 'There is still more to be done in changing the culture of the company. There is no quick fix.' Export sales to some 40 countries accounted for almost a quarter of revenue. Within five years the group hopes that half of turnover will be generated by exports. Tight control over working capital and overhead costs resulted in nil gearing. Earnings per share rose to 11.8p (6.9p). The interim dividend is maintained at 3.5p.</p>

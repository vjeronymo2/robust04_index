			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHAPES, SIZES AND PRICES OF THE ONCE-LOWLY SPIGOT HAVE CHANGED  </P> <P> Once the most utilitarian of household hardwares, the lowly faucet, has become  a real turn-on.  </P> <P> It's no longer enough that the water runs hot and cold. Discriminating  homeowners want spigots that make statements. As a result, faucets have gone  from functional to fancy -- and even funky.  </P> <P> Many people favor the sleek, streamlined models that look like they're going to  take off from the sink and wing around the bathroom. Some contemporary faucets  resemble abstract sculptures.  </P> <P> Orange County hardware stores such as West End West in Laguna Beach and Amco  Builders Supply in Costa Mesa carry faucets to suit every fancy.  </P> <P> "I like the contemporary ones. They're very elaborate but understated," says  Sandy Kedhar, sounding much like a faucet connoisseur as she shopped at Amco  for faucets to fit her new home in Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> "It's a custom home and I want to have something unusual," she explained.  </P> <P> How about a jet-black faucet shaped like a crowbar? An elegant, gold,  crescent-shaped spout with malachite handles? A gold-plated swan that spills  water out of its beak, or an elaborate brass dolphin that pours water from its  mouth?  </P> <P> Those who favor contemporary decors can find futuristic faucets in assorted  geometric shapes.  </P> <P> Modern spigots by Eurotect Ltd. feature pyramids, cylinders, blocks and ovals  that fit together like building blocks in split finishes of brass and chrome.  One faucet has two triangular levers and a pyramid-shaped head.  </P> <P> Decorators with old-fashioned tastes can choose the Georgian faucets with  traditional brass spouts and white porcelain cross handles. For a more elegant  look, they can substitute crystal handles or S-shaped levers with intricate  scrollwork.  </P> <P> Spigots, like people, come in all shapes -- tall and slender, short and squat,  angular and round. Bar faucets, which have found their way into the kitchen and  bath, have skinny goose necks. Dramatic "C Spouts" by Altmans form a sweeping  "C" out of faux malachite, lapis or black granite.  </P> <P> Semi-precious stones and metals adorn the fancier faucets. The brass plumbing  comes plated in chrome, nickel, brass finish or even 24-karat gold. Amco  carries a copper faucet, shiny as a new penny, with pink quartz handles.  </P> <P> Decorators can choose cylinder-shaped handles that have interchangeable rings  of amethyst, malachite, crystal, onyx, ivory, lapis and other semi-precious  stones. The cobra ring by Altmans has a coiled-up snake with ruby or emerald  eyes.  </P> <P> Water does not merely dribble out of such fantastic faucets. It flows in  rivulets down a triple aqueduct, or spews out in a thin ribbon from a flat,  razor-thin opening. It slides down a curved sheet of metal or rolls down  several tiers into the bathtub.  </P> <P> Turning the water on can also be an adventure. Contemporary levers, with their  abstract domes, cylinders and blocks, offer no hints as to whether one pulls,  pushes or twists.  </P> <P> Electronic faucets have no levers at all. They're activated by an infrared  switch that turns on and off when the user puts his hands underneath the spout.  </P> <P> "They're used a lot in commercial buildings, but now we're finding people want  them in their homes, too," says Steven Goldstein, an owner of West End West.  </P> <P> Thanks to new technology, homeowners have never enjoyed greater selection in  faucets.  </P> <P> Decorators can now buy faucets in any color, thanks to the development of  powder coats of paint that are baked onto the brass fixtures.  </P> <P> "White powder coats are the hottest thing right now," says David Schuck,  co-owner of West End West.  </P> <P> With their clean lines, the white faucets look great in contemporary kitchens.  Black and vivid red faucets have also upstaged the traditional chrome spigots.  </P> <P> Contemporary faucets owe their bulky geometric shapes to an engineering  technique in which each piece is cut from bars of solid brass instead of cast  from a mold, then milled and machined for a glossy look.  </P> <P> Homeowners willingly splurge on such innovations.  </P> <P> Most designer faucets cost $400 to $600, with the traditional ones starting at  $200 and the contemporary ones at $300.  </P> <P> "Then the prices go up -- and up and up," Goldstein says.  </P> <P> Prices fluctuate depending on the faucet's design and materials. At West End  West, a gold-plated swan sells for $560, a modern waterfall faucet for $800 and  the Wedgewood china faucet for $1,000.  </P> <P> Some pay as much as $2,000 for custom-made, gold-plated faucets with  semi-precious stones.  </P> <P> People will pay more for fancy faucets because "the home is becoming vitally  important," Goldstein says.  </P> <P> "They're spending a lot of money on and in the home, so they're willing to  spend a little extra to get the finishing touches.  </P> <P> "Before, they'd spend all this money on furniture and wallpaper for the living  room and bedrooms, but they'd neglect the bath and kitchen. Now they're looking  at the faucets." And faucets have never looked better.  </P></p>

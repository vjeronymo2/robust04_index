			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;960.20(c) provides that by January 31 of each year,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Board will notify the Banks of the total amount of funds, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any, available in the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.12(d) of the Board's existing regulation governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how any Reserve Funds would be made available to the Banks, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deleted in the proposed rule. See 12 CFR 960.12(d). The Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states that such provisions would be determined pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations issued by the Board. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(7). Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there currently are no Reserve Funds and it is not anticipated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that there will be any Reserve Funds in the near future, it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary at this time to include provisions in the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dealing with this issue. The Board can issue regulations on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue at a future date if such eventuality should arise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> P. Advisory Councils  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.21 of the proposed rule sets forth provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governing the appointment, operation, and responsibilities of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Councils to the Banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.21(a)(1) of the proposed rule carries forward the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that each Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall appoint an Advisory Council of seven to 15 persons who shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reside in the Bank's District and shall be drawn from community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and nonprofit organizations actively involved in providing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promoting low- or moderate-income housing in the Bank's District.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See 12 CFR 960.14(a). In addition, &sect;960.21(a)(1) of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule provides that the size of the Advisory Council shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated in the Bank's AHP implementation plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.21(a)(2) of the proposed rule carries forward the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that the Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must actively solicit nominations from Bank members and community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and nonprofit organizations and shall allow sufficient time for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response, so that the nomination and appointment process is as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broad and as participatory as possible. See 12 CFR 960.14(b),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d). The Bank also should solicit nominations from any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested parties. In addition, &sect;960.21(a)(3) of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule provides that Advisory Council members shall be appointed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Banks giving consideration to the size of the District and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diversity of low-income housing needs within the District.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board's existing AHP regulation provides that officials of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state and local housing finance agencies may serve as members of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an Advisory Council, provided that such officials do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute an undue proportion of the membership of the Advisory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council. See 12 CFR 960.14(c). It has been suggested that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials should only be able to serve as non-voting members of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Council, unless the officials also are employed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with a private community or nonprofit organization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actively involved in providing or promoting low- or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate-income housing in the Bank's District. This suggestion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is based on the view that the Advisory Councils are intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve as vehicles for private sector community and nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations, not public agencies, to advise the Banks on low-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and moderate-income housing programs and needs in the District and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the utilization of Bank advances for such purposes. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(11). While acknowledging that officials of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state and local housing finance agencies make valuable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributions to the Advisory Councils, the supporters of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viewpoint argue that these agencies have opportunities to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influence the allocation of housing finance credit through means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than by voting representation on the Advisory Councils.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board specifically requests comments on whether or not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials of state and local housing finance agencies should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to vote on the Advisory Councils and whether their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representation should be limited so that it does not constitute an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undue proportion of the Advisory Council membership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.21(a)(4) of the proposed rule provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Council members shall serve for terms of two or three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years, as determined by the Bank and set forth in its AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation plan. The Board is proposing to give the Banks the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option of appointing Advisory Council members for three-year terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to allow the Banks to benefit from the experience and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> familiarity with the AHP that Advisory Council members develop the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer they serve on an Advisory Council. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.21(a)(4) of the proposed rule carries forward the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Council members shall be staggered to provide continuity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and experience in service. See 12 CFR 960.14(f). The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule requires the Banks to explain in their AHP implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans how Advisory Council member terms will be staggered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.21(a)(4) of the proposed rule contains a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision limiting an Advisory Council member to six years of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consecutive service. The Bank may set its own limits on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consecutive terms within the six-year limit. This provision is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to ensure that the membership of the Advisory Councils  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflects the diverse and changing viewpoints of private sector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community and nonprofit organizations on the low-income housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs and needs of the Bank Districts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

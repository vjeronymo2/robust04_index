			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["The Command of the Black Sea Fleet has issued a protest to </F> Ukraine's Military Department (Ministry of Defense) in  connection with the Seizure of a Fleet Division in Odessa" --  POSTFACTUM headline]    [Text] The press centre of the Black Sea Fleet has today  circulated a statement concerning the events in Odessa. The  statement says:    "Ukrainian servicemen have committed yet another illegal act  in relation to the Black Sea Fleet. From 2100 to 2300 on 10th  April, the anniversary of the city's liberation from the German  fascist aggressors, around 120 members of Ukraine's armed  forces, acting in the best traditions of the SS divisions,  attacked a division of mothball ships of the Black Sea Fleet in  Odessa.    "The Ukrainian raiders handcuffed the division's commander,  Captain 1st Rank Oleg Feoktistov, the division's chief of staff,  Captain 2nd Rank Aleksandr Zelenko, and the commander of the  base support unit, Captain 2nd Rank Dmitriiy Starikov. The  other officers and warrant officers, with their families, are on  the unit's territory, under the guard of Ukrainian  special-purpose troops. Windows were broken in offices, and  people were wounded, some of them children. The unit's civilian  staff were beaten up and removed to the village of Chabanka,  near Odessa.    It is also important to observe that the Commander of the  Ukrainian Navy, Vice Admiral Vladimir Beskorovaynyy was then in  the port of Odessa, on board the "Slavutich" ship belonging to  the Ukrainian Navy administration.    The Black Sea Fleet command is voicing its resolute protest  to the Ukrainian military department in connection with the  capture of the fleet division, and regards actions such as this  to be a bandit attack which has gone beyond the control of  military formations.    Besides, two vehicles with commandos are reported to have  been sent to Odessa to the location of hydrographic units of the  Black Sea Fleet. These units are also being blockaded by up to  40 commandos".</p>

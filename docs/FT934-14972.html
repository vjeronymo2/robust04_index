			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UN renews Haiti sanctions THE UN Security Council last night ordered a renewal of sanctions against Haiti unless the military junta complies with its agreement to permit the deployment of a UN peace mission leading to the return to office of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. An oil embargo and freeze of Haiti's assets abroad will go into effect on Monday if General Raul Cedras, the military chief, fails to step down tomorrow in accordance with the agreement, which also provides for UN troops to land. A shipload of US and Canadian soldiers assigned to retrain the military and police was prevented from disembarking on Monday by unruly Haitian demonstrators believed to be acting with the military's encouragement. The Security Council's mandatory resolution, adopted unanimously, responded to a request by the US and a written recommendation by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general. He reported 'serious and consistent non-compliance' with the agreement brokered by his special envoy, Mr Dante Caputo, a former Argentine foreign minister, and a repeated 'lack of will' by the military to facilitate UN operations.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA MUST SELL U.S. AIRCRAFT PARTS MAKER, BUSH SAYS;  </P> <P> TRADE: THE ORDER IS THE FIRST TIME THE TAKEOVER OF AN AMERICAN FIRM BY A  FOREIGN BUYER HAS BEEN BLOCKED SINCE NEW LAWS TOOK EFFECT. THE PRESIDENT CITED  NATIONAL SECURITY.  </P> <P> President Bush, using new emergency powers, moved Friday to nullify the recent  sale of a Seattle-based civilian aircraft parts-manufacturing firm to an arm of  the Chinese government for fear that it might jeopardize U.S. national  security.  </P> <P> While on a visit to Knoxville, Tenn., to highlight high-technology issues, Bush  ordered the China National Aero-Technology Import &amp; Export Corp. -- known  as CATIC -- to divest itself of Mamco Manufacturing Co., which it had acquired  in November.  </P> <P> The White House said CATIC would have until May 1 to sell Mamco to an  acceptable buyer, or face a court order and possible penalties later. In the  meantime, the Administration's high-level Committee on Foreign Investment in  the United States, which had urged Friday's action, will monitor the divestment  process.  </P> <P> The action, which followed a unanimous recommendation by the eight-member  interagency panel, marked the first time that the U.S. government has blocked  the takeover of an American firm by a foreign buyer under provisions of the  1988 Omnibus Trade Act.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a written statement that Bush's  decision was based on "credible confidential information" that continued  control of the American firm by China "might threaten to impair the national  security."  </P> <P> He said Bush's action was tied directly to the circumstances of the case and  did not signal any change in America's traditional openness to foreign  investment or in U.S. policies affecting other investments by China.  </P> <P> "The United States welcomes foreign direct investment in this country," he  said.  </P> <P> In a briefing for reporters, Administration officials repeatedly declined to  spell out precisely what it was about the sale that so concerned the foreign  investment committee, contending that to do so would involve disclosing  classified information.  </P> <P> Mamco manufactures brackets and other components used in the manufacture of  civilian aircraft. Its major customers are Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas  Co., which already export airliners to China.  </P> <P> However, U.S. officials said the government had been "very concerned about the  past activities" of CATIC, which is the military procurement arm of the Chinese  aerospace ministry.  </P> <P> The implication was that U.S. intelligence agencies had compiled evidence that  CATIC had previously sought to buy into U.S. firms to gain access to military  technology. Officials apparently were afraid that it might use Mamco's  technology for military purposes as well.  </P> <P> The officials said there is no indication that Mamco had done anything to  endanger the national security.  </P> <P> Analysts said the decision was expected to have relatively little impact on  U.S.-China relations. Had Bush overridden his advisers' recommendations and  approved the sale, it would have heightened tensions with Congress, which wants  him to take a harder line.  </P> <P> Officials also took pains to point out that the Administration had explored  ways to save at least part of the sale, perhaps by having CATIC divest itself  of particular parts of the Mamco operation, as has been done in similar cases  before. "We've looked at every possible avenue," one official said.  </P> <P> But the decision provided a dramatic demonstration that the Administration is  prepared to block foreign takeovers when it believes that genuine national  security issues are at stake -- an issue that had remained unresolved until  now.  </P> <P> Neither Mamco officials nor spokesmen for the Chinese government were available  for comment Friday. A Mamco spokesman said Kenneth A. Keller, the company's  president, was not taking calls.  </P> <P> But the decision received mixed reviews from lawyers involved in representing  U.S. and foreign clients in such takeovers.  </P> <P> The case is the first in which the foreign investment committee has recommended  that a sale be rolled back. During the 15 months since enactment of the new  law, the panel has reviewed 243 foreign takeovers. It has investigated six of  these and sent four to Bush for a decision.  </P></p>

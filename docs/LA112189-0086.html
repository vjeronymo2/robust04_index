			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TO LEVY 'DUMPING' DUTIES ON PHONES;  </P> <P> TRADE: THE DECISION MEANS DUTIES OF MORE THAN 100% WILL BE CHARGED ON SOME  SMALL-BUSINESS PHONE SYSTEMS IMPORTED FROM JAPAN AND TAIWAN. THE RESULT MAY BE  HIGHER CUSTOMER PRICES OR FEWER IMPORTS OR BOTH.  </P> <P> The U.S. International Trade Commission in a split decision ruled Monday that  small business telephone systems imported from Japan and Taiwan cause harm to  American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and smaller domestic U.S. manufacturers.  </P> <P> The decision opened the way for U.S. Customs starting next month to start  collecting "dumping" duties of more than 100% from importers of one Taiwan  maker and several Japanese makers.  </P> <P> That is expected to result in either higher U.S. customer prices or fewer  imports, or a combination of both.  </P> <P> The six-member commission voted 3-3 on an anti-dumping petition filed by two  U.S. makers, AT&amp;T and Comdial Corp. of Charlottesville, Va. The tie vote  means acceptance of their claims.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department, which earlier ruled that office phone systems with  from two to 256 lines were being "dumped" in this country, will instruct U.S.  Customs in the first part of December to start depositing higher duties,  officials said.  </P> <P> The decision in a similar case involving imported South Korean telephone  equipment was postponed for 60 days at the request of the Korean manufacturers,  they reported.  </P> <P> The "dumping margin" on Japanese imports, to be reflected in higher duties, was  fixed by Commerce at 179% for products of Matsushita Electric, 137% for those  of Toshiba Electric and 158% for all others.  </P> <P> The margin on Nitsukoi products from Taiwan was set for 130%, while the  Commerce Department found no "dumping margin" for other Taiwanese brands.  </P> <P> U.S. small business telephone systems are made mostly in the states of  Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Mississippi and Colorado, the ITC said.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T welcomed the commission decision, declaring in a statement that "we  are confident that all U.S. manufacturers can be very successful in this market  once unlawful pricing ends."  </P> <P> It added that the decision will enable AT&amp;T to "continue to be able to  bring its innovative strength to this marketplace and bring new, even more  innovative solutions to small business customer needs."  </P></p>

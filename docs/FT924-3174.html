			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Sturge Holdings considers Lloyd's plan STURGE HOLDINGS is planning an new insurance venture to take advantage of the possible move towards corporate capital at the Lloyd's of London insurance market. News of the development emerged yesterday when Sturge, the biggest group of agencies at Lloyd's, reported a 12.5 per cent cut in pre-tax profits to Pounds 7.75m for the year to September 30. The dividend was reduced by 50 per cent to 8.25p. The venture, which would initially have between Pounds 25m and Pounds 50m in capital, could either be a fully-fledged insurance company regulated by the Department of Trade and Industry or a new form of insurance organisation operating under the Lloyd's umbrella. In either case the venture, backed by outside capital, could reinsure the 24 Lloyd's syndicates managed by Sturge. Mr Peter Davis, deputy chairman and finance director, said that Sturge had discussed the idea with the DTI and Lloyd's although no final decision had been taken. 'It is still some way off,' he added. Sturge was particularly interested in persuading pension fund and other institutional investors to back its venture, said Mr Davis. Lloyd's is still investigating the practicality of attracting corporate capital to the market in the wake of the recommendations of the Rowland task force earlier this year. The group's fall in profits was largely due to a cut in profit commission (paid by syndicates to the agency), reflecting a poor performance in the 1989 underwriting year at Lloyd's, where results are reported three years in arrears. Profit commissions fell from Pounds 14.08m to Pounds 5.91m and agency fees fell to Pounds 14.58m from Pounds 16.31m. The decline in income was only partially offset by a rise in fees and commissions from other sources to Pounds 3.03m, from Pounds 242,000, and increased turnover at the group's Wise Speke stockbroking subsidiary to Pounds 9.64m from Pounds 8.49m. Overall turnover of Pounds 33.16m (against Pounds 39.12m) exceeded expenses of Pounds 29.02m (down from Pounds 35.23m) by Pounds 4.14m. Net interest and other income receivable fell to Pounds 3.61m from Pounds 4.99m. Mr David Coleridge, the outgoing chairman of Lloyd's who is also chairman of Sturge, said reduced profit commission from the 1990 and 1991 underwriting years, which are also likely to produce losses, would affect future profitability. New charges at Lloyd's, including contributions to the market's hardship fund, would mean that shareholders and Names - the individuals whose assets support the market - must wait until 1992 underwriting account 'before a significant profit recovery can be expected', added Mr Coleridge.</p>

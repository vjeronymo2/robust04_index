			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been determined to be significant and has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total federally inspected broiler and turkey meat production in the U.S. in 1993 was about 27 billion pounds on a ready to cook basis. (Broiler represents the majority of chickens grown and slaughtered in the U.S.) Broiler production was 22.2 billion pounds and turkey 4.8 billion pounds. Continued growth in poultry production has resulted in large increases in the volume of poultry meat going into further processed products, many of which use MS(K).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS has estimated that 1 billion pounds of poultry product is processed annually into MS(K), with a yield of 70%, or 700 million pounds of MS(K) product for human use. (Industry sources suggest that a larger amount of MS(K) product is produced annually.) FSIS estimated that 400 million pounds is used in sausage products and 300 million pounds in patties and nuggets. The estimated size of the market does not directly affect the cost estimates below because these depend on the number of label changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Broiler Council estimates that broiler meat is produced in around 200 establishments, of which 50 are further processing establishments. MS(K) is produced in around 108 establishments. About 25&hyph;30 of these establishments with MS(K) equipment produce hot dogs. The product from the other 75&hyph;80 establishments is sold to poultry further processors or to red meat processors. Industry sources indicate that some small firms specialize in MS(K) production, buying carcasses from poultry slaughter establishments for further processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on inspection task records, FSIS estimates that 108 establishments produced (or are capable of producing) poultry MS(K). MS(K) production by establishment size is not available from FSIS. However,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> total <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  further processed product production by size of establishments shows 7 establishments with production less than 10,000 pounds of MS(K) annually. The average production of the 108 establishments is 51 million pounds of all further processed products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, products containing mechanically separated poultry would require that it be labeled as ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' in the list of ingredients. There is no precise information on the total number of products that contain MS(K). FSIS indicated there are 602,000 approved labels for poultry and meat, not all of which are necessarily in use. These include 529 labels for specific MS(K). There is also an unknown number of labels for products containing MS(K) such as frankfurters, chili, bologna, poultry baby foods, chicken nuggets or patties. FSIS estimates that in a total about 5,000 products would require relabeling. There is no currently available data on the size breakdown of the establishments producing products containing MS(K).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Possible Economic Impacts From Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Possible sources of costs associated with the proposed rule:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Labeling   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed rule, final products containing mechanically separated poultry would require ingredient statement labeling of the mechanically separated poultry as ``Mechanically Separated (Kind).'' Estimates range from $200 to $3,000 per product for a simple product ingredient label change depending on the type of label. Comments in response to the March 1994 ANPR indicate that most labels would fall in the lower end of this range (about $600). Assuming an average cost of $1,000 per product, the cost of relabeling would be $5 million ($1,000 times 5,000 products). Doubling the average cost per product to $2,000 increases the labeling cost to $10 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Labeling costs could be reduced to the extent mandated MS(K) label changes can be coordinated with other label changes planned or required during the period of promulgation of the MS(K) rule and its enforcement. Many firms routinely make label changes for existing products. For example, about 50% of the 180,000 labels submitted to FSIS each year for approval are for label changes on existing products. Also, a FSIS policy directive effective July 25, 1994 requires widespread changes in meat and poultry ingredient statement labeling by August 8, 1995. To the extent MS(K) label changes could be worked in with these changes, less additional cost would be incurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

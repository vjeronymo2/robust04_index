			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Builders count cost of public-sector cuts - Construction Construction companies were last night calculating how much public-sector work they could have lost as a result of yesterday's cuts in planned expenditure. In addition to a reduction in proposed spending on motorway and trunk roads for 1994-95 of about Pounds 145m, there were also cuts in planned expenditure on housing. The Institute of Housing calculated that cuts in capital and revenue spending meant that allocations to housing associations for 1994-95 would be almost Pounds 300m. This meant that associations would be able to acquire 13,000 fewer homes than would have been the case. The institute also questioned the chancellor's assertion that associations, by taking advantage of lower construction prices, would be able to meet their target of 53,000 homes next year. It said this target could only be achieved by 'slippage' by carrying forward homes acquired in the current year into next year. 'The cuts in the social housing and roads programmes will reduce the industry's public-sector workload before recovery in private-sector demand is re-established,' Sir Brian Hill, chairman elect of the Construction Employers Council said last night. The institute also calculated that local authority spending plans for housing, mainly on renovation, had been reduced by about Pounds 150m in 1994-95.</p>

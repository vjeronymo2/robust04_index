			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY SPRAYING PLANS PROMPT CALLS FROM CONCERNED RESIDENTS  </P> <P> Los Angeles County agriculture officials fielded about 30 calls Sunday from  northeast San Fernando Valley residents concerned about plans to spray a  17-square-mile area with insecticide tonight. The spraying is intended to  eradicate a recent infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies.  </P> <P> The insecticide malathion, which will be sprayed in very low concentrations,  poses no health threat to humans, officials said. But they cautioned that  automobile paint and outdoor fish ponds should be protected from the aerial  spraying.  </P> <P> Helicopters are to begin spraying at 9 p.m., and will cover San Fernando,  Sylmar and parts of Mission Hills, Granada Hills and Pacoima. The spraying is  expected to end at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. Tuesday.  </P> <P> Three of the mature Medflies, which lay their eggs in more than 260 varieties  of vegetables and fruit, have been found within a few blocks of one another in  Sylmar since Oct. 25.  </P> <P> The California Conservation Corps will distribute leaflets about the spraying  to residents of the area beginning at 6 a.m. today.  </P></p>

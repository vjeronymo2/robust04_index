			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses reduced in brisk trading NERVES flinched on the UK stock market yesterday afternoon when Wall Street fell heavily in early trading. London quickly recovered its poise, but its loss of 12.9 points left the FT-SE 100 Index once again below the 2,550 mark. Traders sounded unperturbed, however, pointing out that UK equities had stood up well to a mixed bag of trading results from some of the market's big guns. Shares were easier at first, but then turned higher as optimism for a base rate cut flickered off and then on again. Traders also tried to read the implications for sterling of yesterday's reduction in repo rates by the Bank of Spain. However, with Budget Day now less than a fortnight away, most UK analysts doubt whether there will be a move in domestic rates until then. The conflicting range of uncertainties ensured an erratic session for share prices. The Footsie gained 13.1 in early trading only to plunge to a net decline of 15.6 after Wall Street opened. With the Dow reducing its early setback from 40 to 22 points by the time London closed, the UK market trimmed its losses. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,546.8 for a fall on the day of 12.9. 'Not a bad performance in view of the uncertainty in the US market,' commented the leading trader at a London investment bank. Seaq volume increased to 511m shares from the 440.5m that were traded in the previous session. Yesterday's total took in heavy trading in the group of blue chip stocks which dominated the market after disclosing their respective trading statements. In one of its heaviest trading sessions, National Westminster Bank closed firmly, although an initial advance which reflected satisfaction with the trading results and dividend payment was trimmed before the end of the session. The Footsie was pulled down by a sharp fall in Unilever, as investors showed disappointment with very modest profits growth for the year, and by a smaller decline in SmithKline Beecham, in spite of meeting market forecasts by moving above the Pounds 1bn profits mark. The lesson appeared to be that the stock market will accept bad corporate news, provided that it is no worse than expected. Midland Bank, whose dividend announcement tomorrow could be the litmus test for the sector, held steady yesterday. Wall Street's reaction to the fall in the US consumer confidence index to its lowest level for 17 years clearly upset London, but did not produce the setback predicted until recent-ly by those analysts convinced that Wall Street is overvalued. Across the full range of the market, falls in share prices were modest. Retail issues eased as hopes of an immediate cut in base rates faded again, but losses among such sector leaders as Marks and Spencer and Kingfisher were slight. The property sector, also sensitive to interest rate moods, gave ground but losses here were blamed on more immediate reports of bearish developments in London's office rental market, which has already borne down heavily on the shares of property companies. A more positive factor was the relatively steady performance from the blue chip oil companies, which fell heavily last week following profits statements from BP and Shell Transport but resisted transatlantic influences yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The last round of the Russian-Estonian talks ended  practically without result, according to Reinart, head of the  Estonian delegation. Russia has taken the date for completing  troops withdrawal -- 31 August 1994 -- out of the draft  agreement, but has not proposed any other date for discussion.  According to Svirin, head of the Russian delegation, in  discussions on the sea borders during the talks, disagreements  were revealed concerning the point where they should be linked  up with the border on land. Estonia insisted on the 1920  borders, whereas Russia is for setting the border line from the  place where the present land border comes down to the Baltic Sea.    According to INTERFAX, the next round of talks will be held  in Tallinn tomorrow.</p>

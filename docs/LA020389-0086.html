			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> TOM SELLECK AND COMPANY COULD USE A STRONGER 'ALIBI'  </P> <P> Mysteries are supposed to lull before they startle; it's part of the plan.  Certainly the credits of "Her Alibi" (citywide) lull us into thinking that,  like them, the movie will be witty, sophisticated and elegant. It is certainly  elegant looking, but 15 minutes into the action the thrill is gone and director  Bruce Beresford seems to have no clue as to how to find it.  </P> <P> Those nifty credits are the jacket illustrations of prolific mystery writer  Philip Blackwood (Tom Selleck), who has hit a writing block and can't churn out  any more steamy adventures for his hero, Peter Swift. In desperation, he hits a  few real courtrooms, looking for inspiration. For a while it seems as though  the film's screenwriter, Charlie Peters, is on a charming tack, bringing on a  quartet of old courtroom regulars who greet Selleck as one of them, cluing him  in to the juicier cases in the building. However, the four remain  underdeveloped, like so many other nice touches in the story.  </P> <P> The courtroom is just a ploy to let Selleck meet Nina Ionescu (Czech-born  actress-model Paulina Porizkova), a "Romanian" mystery woman. Before you can  say "jurisprudence" Selleck has lied gracefully, providing Porizkova with an  alibi at her murder trial, and detective James Farentino has swallowed the  obvious lie, allowing this ludicrous plot to inch its way forward. You'd expect  more from students in Screenwriting 1A classes.  </P> <P> It's all to get our two stars under one roof, Selleck's country house, probably  one of the most ruggedly seductive retreats around. It should be: The  production designer is Henry Bumstead, who's done everything from "Vertigo" to  "To Kill a Mockingbird" and from "The Sting" to "The Little Drummer Girl." But  then producer Keith Barish has assembled a world-class technical slate:  England's great Freddie Francis ("The French Lieutenant's Woman," "Dune") was  the cinematographer; France's Anne Goursaud ("One From the Heart," "Ironweed")  was the editor; Wayne Fitzgerald designed the titles; the music is by Georges  Delerue ("Jules and Jim," "Silkwood"), and the splendid Ann Roth ("Klute," "Day  of the Locust," "Working Girl") did the costumes.  </P> <P> And all this loving talent is in the service of this loosely crocheted  screenplay, studded with tired little ribaldries and action that finds shooting  a man in the hip with an arrow hilarious. The waste is enough to make you keen  piercingly in the aisles.  </P> <P> The film's fun is supposed to come from the contrast between Selleck's macho  Peter Swift dialogue and his own klutzy behavior. He's twitterpated by the very  sight of Porizkova who may or may not be a real murderess. Do audiences really  want to see Tom Selleck -- the closest thing we have to Clark Gable -- lurching  about like Chevy Chase; hurled onto his car with his face smooshed up against  the windshield and the wipers on? Nice that he can take himself so lightly;  pity that he has to.  </P> <P> Porizkova, who was delicately ingenuous in "Anna," gives exactly the same  reading here. To many it may not even matter. She can also be found riding  bareback, bounding on a trampoline or slipping into a bath towel -- simply  watching her in motion is a jaw-dropping sight. Her lifelong complicity with  cameras has relaxed her utterly; put her in front of one and she moves her  long, long legs and arms with a floppy doll languor that's enchanting. But  after quite a lot of this, even the most undemanding fan may want a bit more: a  characterization perhaps.  </P> <P> It's as useless to hope for as the possibility that director Beresford will  rouse himself from his torpor and get this movie going somewhere. From the way  characters pop onscreen unexpectedly, especially Selleck's family and friends  in the last third of the film, there's a hint that crucial scenes may have  vanished, but it takes a faith stronger than mine to think they would have  helped much.  </P> <P> 'HER ALIBI'  </P> <P> A Warner Bros. release.

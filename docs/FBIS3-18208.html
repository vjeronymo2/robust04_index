I believe  too, that it is time for all the parties involved to understand  that their common interest is the return to peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and more generally in the whole of the former  Yugoslavia. This is the policy advocated by France. We are one  of the foreign countries with the largest number of soldiers on  the ground and we hope that reason will eventually prevail.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Gardening: Late Treacle, the last perry - Clive Fewins meets Charles Martell who collects the largest of fruit trees There's a cowslip,' the old man said. 'Where?' said Charles Martell, looking at the ground. 'No, you fool, the tree]' the old man said. Six weeks later the old man died, but he had helped Martell save yet another rare variety of perry pear tree. The incident happened two years ago. Cowslip is one of 50 varieties of perry pear identified in the mid-1950s. Martell has found specimens of 49, all of which he has recorded in full and propagated. Martell, a farmer and cheesemaker, is a champion of Gloucestershire's agricultural history - in particular perry, which is to pears what cider is to apples. At his 55-acre farm near the Gloucestershire village of Dymock he has investigated the 50 additional varieties of perry pear known by name, and thinks he has also discovered a handful more. At this time of year as the apple and pear harvest gets into full swing, Martell keeps a keen eye open for the 'missing' variety: Late Treacle. 'Friends pull my leg and say the clue lies in the long-lost Dymock treacle mines. Wherever it is I shall find it eventually,' said Martell, 48. He found the other 49 varieties by walking, cycling and driving round the three counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire for seven years. Every time he finds a new specimen he takes a cutting, then grafts it on to a root stock before planting either in one of his orchards or at a plot he has been given at the Three Counties Showground at Malvern. There, Martell's efforts will remain for posterity: the grandly-named infant National Collection of Perry Pears. They are there for all to see as a result of the pioneering identification work nearly 40 years ago of Ray Williams, formerly of the long Ashton Research Station near Bristol. They are infant trees because perry pears are 'the giants of the forest' among fruit trees. Stinking Bishop - one of the largest varieties of perry pear - will reach a height of 70ft and take 25 years to mature, before producing more than a ton of fruit each in a good season. At nearby Much Marcle, home of Westons, the region's biggest manufacturer of perry, there are some perry pears still cropping that were planted to commemorate the accession of Queen Anne in 1702. Other varieties bear such colourful names as Merrylegs, Painted Lady, Hedgehog, Hendry Huffcap, Bloody Bastard, Steel yer Balls, Ramscod, Clipper Dick and Dead Boy. 'Perry pears really are monsters compared to other fruit trees, which is why it is quite easy to identify them,' Martell said. 'Many of the small farms in the three counties have a handful of perry pears that would produce perry for the family and the farm workers for a whole season.' Once he has managed to plant all 50 varieties identified by Williams, who travels up from his retirement home near Bristol whenever Martell thinks he has a found a lost variety, the next stage is to encourage more local farmers to make perry again. 'You will find stone cider and perry mills - round troughs in which the apples were crushed by a stone wheel powered by a horse or ox walking round treadmill-style - abandoned in old orchards on most farms round here,' he said. He recently paid Pounds 600 for the stone mill that he is sure once made perry and cider on his own farm: 'Bess, my old carthorse will probably be dead by the time I get going, but I have four oxen and I will train them to do the job. Perry is wonderful: smooth, full bodied and more sophisticated than cider and much neglected. Fortunately a group of small producers* is re-emerging round here and eventually I hope to be among them.' First, however, Martell is perfecting the soft French-style cheese he started making a year ago. It is made from his herd of Old Gloucester cattle and washed in perry to form the red mould. It is aptly named Stinking Bishop. And the treacle mines? 'Nobody has managed to find them yet, though some people swear they exist, just like the famous Oxford treacle well,' Martell said. 'Perhaps it might all be something to do with the Dymock Trickle - a coal seam that ran near here and was once mined near Oxenhall, three miles away.' * The Three Counties Cider and Perry Assoc, Glebe Farm, Aylton, Ledbury HR8 2RQ.

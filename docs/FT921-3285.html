			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: GPA float goes ahead with SEC filing GUINNESS PEAT Aviation, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, is to go public in June after yesterday it prepared to make a preliminary filing with the Securities Exchange Commission in Washington, the US regulator. The flotation, which could value the group at more than Dollars 3bn, (Pounds 1.7bn) will be one of the most ambitious attempts to market shares in the big share markets of the world. GPA will obtain listings simultaneously in New York and London. The Japanese share sale will be a public offering without listing, a technique pioneered in the sale of the UK water industry. The sale, aimed primarily at investment institutions, will raise hundreds of millions of dollars in new money for the company, needed to finance its ambitious programme of aircraft purchases. The total value of shares on offer, likely to be no more than Dollars 1.5bn, will depend on how many of its existing shareholders wish to sell. GPA's executives will become multi-millionaires out of the offering. The shareholding of Mr Tony Ryan, the group's chairman and founder, is likely to be worth more than Dollars 200m at the flotation price, which has yet to be agreed. The company and its advisers disagreed over the share price, the advisers arguing for a price closer to Dollars 20 compared with GPA's preferred price of about Dollars 30. The advisers are now understood to be arguing for a price between Dollars 20 to Dollars 25. The lead managers are Nomura in Japan, which is also global co-ordinator, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, which raised Dollars 500m for the group by way of a public bond issue, in the US and Schroders in the UK. Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Davy Stockbrokers are brokers to the sale. The aircraft leasing group based in the Irish Republic made after-tax profits of Dollars 73m (Pounds 40.1m) for the three months to December 31, compared with Dollars 55.5m. Net profits for the nine months were Dollars 196.5m, only just ahead of the corresponding 1990 figure of Dollars 195.8m, but the group is confident of record profits in excess of Dollars 261m for the 12 months when it publishes its year-end results in June.</p>

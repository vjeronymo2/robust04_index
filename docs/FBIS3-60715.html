			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by O. Novak: ``Chernobyl Threatens With New </F> Punishments'']    [Text] I remember warnings voiced in 1986, following the  accident on the fourth block of the Chernobyl nuclear power  plant. Scientists predicted that its consequences will be felt  long after the catastrophe. However, these opinions were  withheld from the press by censors, and any forecasts that did  not match the official standpoint were deemed as a provocation  and panicking. Further events proved that official declarations  were a pack of lies that caused suffering to many innocent  people. This is why today, everything that concerns the  Chernobyl accident is not being rejected without looking into it  with maximum attention. This is not being done for the sake of  scaring anybody, but for the sake of protecting the health and  lives of the living and future generations.    These opinions belong to Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, Ukrainian  Supreme Soviet Chernobyl Committee chairman and were expressed  at a news conference devoted to the revelation by Russian Doctor  of Geology V. Kopeykin. The latter spent seven years conducting  tests at the contaminated zone around Chernobyl. Speaking at  the news conference, Professor Kopeykin, in particular pointed  out that enhanced activity of certain radionuclides have been  observed since the accident. In his opinion, previous forecasts  regarding the dissolution of the radioactive fallout were  erroneous. Thus, it was believed that plutonium would be  discovered there within 10 to 14 years after the accident, but  it appeared in 1987, in subterranean waters in the vicinity of  the ``red forest'' where nuclear waste was buried. By the way,  even then, official sources did not reveal the whole truth, and  there were claims that only 3 percent of the plutonium had been  emitted into the environment. According to V. Kopeykin, the  content of the hazardous component was no less than 30 percent.  Professor Kopeykin believes that those forecasts did not take  into account the laws of the geochemical migration of  radionuclides. According to his calculations, the area  contaminated with plutonium is about 100 square kilometers.  Other hazardous elements, including americium-241 and  icyrium-241 [as published], whose period of disintegration  reaches hundreds of years, were found in the area too. These  elements are particularly dangerous to the human liver. The  mentioned radionuclides were discovered not only in subterranean  waters, but also in cuts of pines, birches, and apple-trees  growing in the zone.    It is surprising that the scientist's research has received  no attention from the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. The  Academy disregarded the official invitation and did not send its  representatives to the news conference.    Concluding the conference, Volodymyr Yavorivskyy emphasized  that problems connected with overcoming the aftermath of the  Chernobyl accident must be resolved jointly by Ukraine, Russia,  Belarus, and the entire European community.</p>

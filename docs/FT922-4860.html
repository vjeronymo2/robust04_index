			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Arms deal for Saudi Arabia THE Bush administration said yesterday it planned to sell Dollars 1.88bn (Pounds 1.04bn) in weapons and military support to Saudi Arabia, Reuter reports from Washington. The Defence Department said Congress had been notified of the package, which ranges from the sale of helicopter-borne missiles to medical evacuation helicopters and maintenance of F-15 fighter jets. Congress has 30 days to raise objections or allow completion of the sale. Some congressmen have criticised US arms sales in the volatile region while President George Bush presses for a slowdown of the Middle East arms race.</p>

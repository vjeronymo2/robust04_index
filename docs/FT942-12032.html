			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Shoppers show there is life after the Budget At Conroys Furniture Centre, set in a retail park by a dual-carriageway near Sunderland, Securicor delivery man Mr Steven Mee and his wife Teresa are admiring Shangrila. The Mees look pleased; after months of searching they have found their chosen three-piece suite at a price they can afford - Pounds 1,000, less 10 per cent, with three years' interest-free credit. A new suite was a necessity; their old one had broken. But the long repayment term - reducing the monthly cost to Pounds 27 - was vital. Mr Mee's take-home wage - between Pounds 170 and Pounds 200 a week depending on overtime - has to support the couple, both aged 37, and their two children, aged six and 10, and bear the burden of Budget increases. Mr Mee reckons the tax and National Insurance rises will make them Pounds 10 a week worse off but the couple are stoical. 'You still have to carry on eating and buying the kids clothes,' says Mrs Mee, who is on invalidity benefit. Her husband adds: 'We don't go to the limit on our spending.' He was surprised the chancellor imposed so many increases. 'I don't think people realised how much he changed everything.' The Mees voted Conservative in the last general election and will next time, too. 'When we first married Labour was in; inflation was 18 per cent,' says Mrs Mee. 'It was just one big struggle,' says her husband. Another big purchase looms. 'We've got to get a new car. We'll have to wait six months and try to sort something out.' Conroys, a family-owned business, has three north-east stores. Mr Dave Darragh, manager of this branch, says business is good. 'I put it down to aggressive advertising. It's all about deals.' Conroys' May Day special offer is 10 per cent off everything. Mr Darragh earns a basic salary plus commission and has a company car. He knows the Budget will affect him but has not studied his pay slip. 'I can't do anything about it. I just have to sell more furniture.' Mr Peter Wallace, from Jarrow, a Pounds 22,000-a-year comprehensive school science teacher, is waiting while his mother looks for new dining chairs. A 1.5 per cent pay rise this month masked the Budget's full effects, he says. Mr Wallace is now awaiting his fuel bills. The total rises will determine whether he and his wife have a touring holi-day in Denmark this summer. Across the car park at Peter Barratt's Garden Centre, another locally owned business with three north-east stores, social worker Mrs Kim Delaney, 36, is looking at plants. She says the increases were partly hidden by an increment on her salary in April, and the transfer of the married person's allowance from her husband Kevin, 47, who is retired because of work injuries. Mrs Delaney's monthly take-home pay rose Pounds 40 in April to Pounds 1,311  -less than she expected. 'This is the first year for a number of years we've said we need to save towards a holiday,' says Mr Delaney. Mrs Delaney fears the effect of value added tax on fuel for poor families she works with. 'It means people getting into more debt, borrowing off loan sharks.' For Pounds 15,000-a-year quantity surveyor Mr Lawrence Inkster, 27, the Budget increases coincide with his wife's imminent departure from her Pounds 60-a-week part-time job as she is expecting their second child. Mr Inkster's solution is more overtime. 'I'm lucky to have that chance.' Mr Peter Bennett, garden centre duty manager, doubts the Budget increases will prevent customers spending. 'They say 'to hell with it'.' Conroys' managing director Mr Michael Conroy said it had been a very good weekend, his stores achieving a turnover 17 per cent up on the same period last year. Profit was up by a smaller percentage. Turnover at Conroys, Pounds 8.5m in the year to the end of March, has risen 14 per cent since January. Mr Peter Barratt, the garden centres' founder and managing director, said the weekend weather, a crucial factor, had been favourable - neither wet nor hot. Turnover, he said, was 7 per cent to 8 per cent up on the same holiday weekend last year. The increase in profits would be greater, due to tighter controls on expenses. Both men believe the recession is over, boosting customers' confidence and willingness to shrug off tax increases. Mr Conroy, though still apprehensive about the effects of VAT on fuel, says 'people are determined to make the most of today. The north-east is that type of area; if they've got money, they'll spend it.'</p>

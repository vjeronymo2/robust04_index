			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marcin Krol, Warsaw University Professor, </F> historian of ideas, editor in chief of NOWA RESPUBLICA, and  columnist for TYGODNIK POWSZECHNY: "Coalition of Fear -- True  End of Worker-Peasant Alliance"]    [Text] In Great Britain a speaker's accent attracts  considerable attention. Persons from lower social classes who  have attained high social advancement try to speak with an  Oxford accent proper for the higher classes. But when such a  politician or businessman gets tense, he tends to speak with his  childhood accent, such as a Liverpool one. Well, it is a similar  thing with the Polish politicians who belong to the governing  coalition. They try mightily to obliterate their PRL [Polish  People's Republic] origin and sometimes they succeed, but when  they become nervous the Liverpool in them emerges.    During the recent strikes, Deputy Prime Minister Cimoszewicz  said that there will be no negotiations so long as the strikes  continue, that is, under the strike gun, while Prime Minister  Pawlak said that on the day of the great strike a lot of good  happened because many people kept on working. Such comments are  ludicrous, because, of course, the negotiations did go on during  the strike and even succeeded. The fact that a person works is  something normal rather than good. But such reversion to  Liverpool language is typical; it demonstrates not so much the  difficulty of getting rid of the burden of the past (which is  hardly surprising) as that the more difficult it is to get rid  of that burden the less substantive a comment can be and hence  also the less can be accomplished. And it is my belief that the  new-old coalition has nothing to say and can accomplish nothing.    It began its governance with empty rhetoric and lies. For  such were the elements of the prime minister's opening address  to the Sejm, which focused a lot on the evil doings of his  predecessors and on making many promises, in particular to the  world of science, education, culture, and health. It is not  enough that since then nothing has been accomplished in those  domains; on the contrary, they even regressed in terms of both  budgetary allocations and restructuring. More even, at the  Ministry for National Education for the time being only numerous  personnel changes have been made, and at the Ministry of Culture  "Liverpool" reached its apogee, as best exemplified by the  affair of the letter of Krzysztof Teodor Toeplitz. We also were  lied to when they promised us a mysterious budget extending the  social safety net; afterward Deputy Prime Minister Borowski was  fired and the budget remained unchanged. Mendacity and blather  are, besides, triumphant in practically every domain of public  life and at every post. This is best exemplified by the  unbelievably tangled affair of the "popiwek" [tax on wage  increases], in which mendacity became an instrument employed not  so much owing to lack of an opinion of one's own but  deliberately and purposely.  <H5>  The Unsuccessful Return </H5>   I am no Cato and know well that politicians lie all over the  world, but there exist varieties of the political lie and turgid  rhetoric is not so horrible when it substitutes for real  political action and merely serves to satisfy the public demand  for high-sounding phrases. But the politicians of the governing  coalition lie, prattle, and do nothing. It is interesting that  some of them, whether presumably or certainly more prominent,  have lately clammed up. It appears they already know so much  that they are not certain about anything.    How did it happen? Why did the "worker-peasant alliance"  [Alliance of the Democratic Left and the Polish Peasant Party]  so soon reveal its hopeless fecklessness? Why is it even now  clear that the return is a resounding failure, that presumably  this governing coalition will remain in power for some time yet  but it will doubtless be its swan song?    It already common knowledge that this coalition won the  elections by making promises it could not keep. But it is not as  clear why it could not afterward, after taking power, formulate  a clear program of action that would at least to some extent  envisage fulfillment of pre-electoral promises. Well, I think  that by now it is obvious why it did not happen. That coalition  is a coalition of fear. From the very outset the factor keeping  it together and determining its conduct was fear, and fear in  several forms at that.    First, there is the fear of repeating the past. Thus, it  prevented taking any explicitly socialist decisions, for which  the representatives of the Labor Union and the OPZZ [National  Alliance of Trade Unions] are, justly from their point of view,  reproaching that coalition.    Second, there is the fear of interfering with the rather  gratifying performance of the market economy, meaning the fear  of forfeiting the accomplishments of the previous  administrations, that is, the fear of deviating from the liberal  course of the economy. Despite numerous attempts, that fear  could not be covered up by clever social-democratic or  peasant-populist speechifying, and it has become widely obvious.    Third, there is the fear of the presumed ideological  electorate of that coalition, which directly led to strikes at  the end of April. Thus, the first decisions of the Pawlak  administration, made last November, were to make every  concession to the demands of the striking miners, and it became  obvious that with the approach of the spring there would be more  such strikes.    Fourth, there is the fear of the coalition's own image, as  clearly demonstrated by Prime Minister Pawlak when, on the very  first occasion when something went wrong, he fired the concerned  deputy minister (Kawalec) and recently also Deputy Minister  Morawski, who is said to be the leading energy expert in Poland.    Fifth, there is the fear of the mass media, initially less  evident within the SLD [Alliance of the Democratic Left] but by  now obvious there too. That fear is that they have nothing to  say and do not understand the role of the mass media and,  basically, show no interest in winning over public opinion,  which wears no blinkers and is not deceived.    Sixth, there is the fear of the president, who to be sure  cannot, under the Constitution, wreak any real harm on the  coalition but who serves as its only vehicle for credibility  with the public, as could be seen from the enraptured faces of  the SLD activists when they recently met with Walesa.    Seventh and last, there is the fear of the people who get  nothing out of the coalition government, a fear that has  prompted it to distribute more or less 20 million zlotys apiece  to each farmer, allegedly as a loan for fertilizers, and to keep  that decision secret so that the remaining public would not know  what its taxes are being spent on.    Another factor accounting for the existence of the coalition  is opportunism. To be sure, I do not think opportunism in public  life to be something entirely negative. After all, opportunism  as adaptation to circumstances which may not always be  foreseeable is often proof of common sense. Provided, however,  that such opportunism is accompanied by strong political  convictions for whose sake compromises, often hardly palatable,  are made. But the governing coalition has no such convictions,  just as it has no program of action, and hence in its case  opportunism is a totally negative attitude, a way of remaining  afloat in spite of all undertows and eddies.    This opportunism is, to cite just a few instances, clearly  reflected in the nearly total turnabout in the governing  coalition's views on Poland's membership in NATO. Prior to the  elections the SLD was in many ways critical of that idea, but  after the elections, when it realized that the Polish public is  remarkably united on this issue, it jettisoned all of its  criticisms. Another example of opportunist conduct is the budget  voted by the coalition, which basically does not embody any of  its campaign promises. That also applies to its attitude toward  privatization, restitution of nationalized property, and other  economic issues. But most characteristic from that standpoint is  the avoidance of taking a stand on any issue that might provoke  a serious political dispute. A coalition that won the elections  upon proclaiming its desire to combat corruption, organized  crime, and smuggling, has done nothing at all about the issues  and has not dared to organize any major trial.    Finally, the coalition's opportunism is reflected in its  attitude toward other political parties and views. In that  domain the governing coalition remains passive, does not try to  prove anything, and does not show the will to demonstrate the  justness of its (nonexistent) decisions. It simply evades any  dispute. It also avoids, at any price, internal disputes. This  is clearly demonstrated not only by its treatment of Deputy  Prime Minister Borowski but also by the tacit consent of the SLD  to the dangerous protectionist aspirations of the PSL [Polish  Peasant Party]. The position of Prime Minister Pawlak is so  strong for the very reason that the SLD's decision on such a  precise structure of the government ensued from a rotten  compromise or opportunism for which there is no longer any  remedy. The PSL, as a supposedly Catholic party (something which  it has never before advertised), serves as a liaison between the  coalition and the Roman Catholic Church and thus takes care of  the opinions of the peasants, which are anachronistic by virtue  of their social and economic situation. But it is precisely this  alliance with the PSL that prevents the SLD from pursuing any  explicit policy and condemns it to failure in the struggle for a  new shape of Polish domestic policy or, in other words, turns  the SLD into an antimodernist force.  <H5>  A Weak Root </H5>   Fear and opportunism are subjective factors, which depend  more on the leaders and members of the coalition parties than on  the external situation. But we also are dealing with objective  factors owing to which there is not, and shall not be, any  longer any future for that coalition. The most important of  those factors is deracination.    The unexpectedly big electoral win of the SLD and the PSL  imbued the two parties with the belief that they have social  support. But that belief is as illusory as were the social  expectations that brought victory to the parties. We are  perfectly aware that there will be no free lunch and no  guaranteed procurement prices, and practically everybody had  known it from the outset, but there was hope that in some  mysterious way the new-old parties would alleviate the pain of  the economic reforms. That did not happen because it could not  happen. In Poland nowadays there is no social class that can  fight for its privileges effectively and sensibly. The SLD and  the PSL came to power with about the same attitude as that of  the socialists of the late 19th century, that is, of an era when  the working class had really been exploited and had something to  fight for. Nowadays there are no such class and no justified  partisan goals.    The SLD and the PSL lack a past of their own, and as for the  communist past ascribed to them, they want to forget it at any  price. But no kowtowing references to Witos [Wincenty Witos, the  prewar peasant-party leader] can obscure the fact that most of  the PSL's current leaders used to belong to the ZSL [United  Peasant Party], just as the leaders of the SLD used to belong to  the PZPR. However, as that past is so burdensome, with what  origin should these parties identify themselves and what  identity should they clothe themselves with? Without a  principled program, without support from a nonexistent class  society--let us bear in mind that it was precisely workers who  did not at all vote for the SLD--without a history and language  of its own, a party is condemned to nonexistence. That is a  problem that has also been encountered by parties of Solidarity  origin. So how are parties of PRL origin to build their own  image for internal and external consumption?    But is that so important after all? Yes, because in the  absence of roots surface existence is not possible. For a  political movement, roots are what keeps it together and a means  of internal communication and rapport with the outside world.  Aleksander Kwasniewski lost headway after several brilliant  speeches, because his party lacks a language whereby he could  speak constructively about anything, and as for the linguistic  utterances of Prime Minister Pawlak, they demonstrate that the  PSL lacks any original concepts and approaches of its own.  Standing on the brink of the abyss, and work ethic, and  consider recently also that recent amazingly feckless Sejm  speech, whose culmination was the following passage: "...I was  raised under other circumstances and in another system of  values. That is why accord, cooperation, mutual goodwill, and  working together are closer to me than conflict...." The prime  minister was probably thinking of his native rural community and  he simply forgot that in the 1980's he used to be a member of  the youth wing of the ZSL and that those times were hardly times  of accord and goodwill. His desperate search for arguments led  him to point to such roots at the expense of drastically  deviating from the truth. It thus can be seen that the PSL under  its present leaders can be, objectively speaking, only a peasant  party, that this is its sole root, but it is not a root that  qualifies it to govern the country.    Lastly, deracination leads to a reaction that is literally  reactionary, meaning that it prompts searching for people from  one's old former world and shutting oneself up in that world.  The suspicion that the SLD and the PSL will come to rely on men  who had played the second fiddle in the former PRL has by now  been proven on a large scale, and that is not surprising because  these parties can form a world of their own jointly only with  such people, a world that is not a world of ideas, programs, or  politics, but merely a world of sentiments and resentments.  <H5>  Presumed Leftism </H5>   Another objective factor ruining the chances of that  coalition for the future is its--also objective--inability to  build a constructive vision of itself and, as a consequence, a  constructive vision of its own policy and of Poland. In that  case, too, the SLD and the PSL suffer an ailment that is also  shared by post-Solidarity groupings. But for the governing  coalition the problem is much more difficult to resolve, because  developing a constructive vision is difficult in the absence of  roots, a program, social support, and internal human and  ideological cohesiveness. That is precisely why, rather than  owing to some special indolence, the government acts with such  an improbable sluggishness that it can be only compared with the  government of Jan Olszewski (with which it has many features in  common anyhow). That also is why we so often perceive the  absence of mutual loyalty binding members of the government,  deputy prime ministers, and the prime minister.    Still, even a constructive program is not what matters most  if current problems can be effectively and rapidly resolved. But  the absence of either leads to a paralysis of the political  scene, in which the president now and then quite unexpectedly  intervenes so as to either add to the general confusion or lead  to some unexpected decisions. From the beginning it was known  that this government can endure on two conditions: That it shall  fairly consistently continue the economic policy established by  former Prime Minister Balcerowicz and that it will somehow reach  an understanding with President Walesa. For the time being the  governing coalition is meeting both those conditions, but that  does not mean that it has succeeded in making a contribution of  its own to the new reality. If anybody thinks differently, how  about giving me just one example of a constructive action by the  new coalition. I am not aware of any.    Besides, it is worth noting that this coalition came to  power  with the byword of "leftism." Even very serious people such as  Stanislaw Stomma have acknowledged that the times are ripe for  the Left, because in times of change the Left is more suitable  than the Right, whose purpose is rather to correct excessively  radical actions of the Left. We all for awhile let ourselves be  bamboozled by that supposed leftism of the SLD and the PSL,  whereas it now turns out that power was taken by an ideological  zero.    What will happen next? Why do I believe that the end has  come? For awhile we can still expect this administration to  continue, but it does not seem likely that the present governing  coalition will endure until the next elections. What is still  more important, it does not seem likely that this coalition or  its components will develop into a clear and sensible opposition  in Poland. If some members of the former Solidarity opposition  went rather far in flirting with the representatives of the  current coalition, that was because they had thought that a new  partner in political life has appeared on the scene, a partner  with whom they would have to cohabit long and therefore it was  better to maintain sensible contacts with the Communists rather  than to point a finger at their past. This approach has proven  mistaken, not only because it has caused the society to accept  its recent enemy, but also because for awhile it afforded some  legitimacy to the old-new coalition. But even now it can be seen  that there is nobody to talk with (not in the sense of any  absence of reasonable and witty individuals in the government),  because there is nothing to talk about. If that is so while this  coalition is in power, then it will simply evaporate once it  becomes the opposition after losing the elections, that being  the fate that awaits it sooner or later. Essentially, everything  depends on whether the present-day opposition learns to create a  workable party organization and electoral machinery and on when  that will come true.    The expectation that the worker-peasant alliance will become  a thing of the past hardly saddens me. But in the end we should  consider the present and future consequences of this era of  coalition government to the present and future of Poland. To the  present, as can be seen, the consequences will be fatal, because  the pace of the reforms will slow down, markedly, solely, and  exclusively through the fault of the present government. As for  the future, the consequences will depend on whether such  political motivations as fear, opportunism, and negation as a  principle of action, and such objective conditions as  deracination and inability to build a constructive vision of  Poland will become a permanent feature of Polish life. For it  may happen that the coalition not only will itself become a  loser, but also will drag down with it the entire Polish  political scene. It may thus happen that a rebirth can be  expected only after yet another revolution and that only then  will virtue and courage resume their proper place in public  life. I do not know whether this is an expression of hope or  horror, but I know for certain that those who, though aware of  the burden of the past resting on them, have nevertheless taken  power, now find themselves in a much worse situation than  formerly. Formerly they could argue that they had been unable to  accomplish much under the PRL, but now they can only acknowledge  that they can do nothing. As for us, we unfortunately have to  endure all this somehow.</p>

What our cosmonauts in orbit felt at  this moment only they know. The Soyuz TM-17 spaceship at an  altitude 300 km had collided with the Mir orbital complex. Such  accidents, before this described only in science fiction and not  happening except in one's dreams, are extremely dangerous  because a ship, experiencing rupture, very rapidly loses its  air, which results in the inevitable death of the crew. It goes  without saying that the air does not instantaneously escape into  space and the crew for their salvation is left a safety window  from 1-2 seconds to several minutes, depending on the size of  the rupture and the air volume in the cabin.    The cosmonauts, who, as is well known, are characterized by  excellent reflexes, at the time of the collision already were in  spacesuits and so it was that they only had to lift up an arm,  make the helmet tight and make their airtight gloves secure. The  variant of a landing in a depressurized ship had already been  repeatedly practiced (the death of a crew of three men in 1971  due to the depressurization of the Soyuz 11 descent module had  been able to teach us something), but no one could guarantee  that the descent module would not itself be damaged during a  collision. Incidentally, the principal impact on the Soyuz  occurred precisely on the thick heat insulation of the skin of  this compartment. And, happily, after this no one heard the  ominous whistling of air. The walls of both vehicles withstood  the impact...    As the specialists at the Flight Control Center informed us,  for several minutes the Soyuz landing was in question. Then when  it became clear that the heat insulation had not been damaged  (which would have threatened ship burnup during descent) and  that the impact did not extend through to the cover of the  parachute compartment (otherwise it could have jammed) it was  decided to land the Soyuz TM-17. This also was done beautifully.    "Information on what occurred will be analyzed by a special  technical commission, which also will draw the necessary  conclusions concerning the possible consequences of a  collision," declared Aleksandr Serebrov, the expedition's  engineer, immediately upon return. In the opinion of the  cosmonauts who had been in orbit, the station, leaving aside a  brief shutdown of the gyrodynes, also did not suffer, and as was  planned, will be able to exist right up to the putting of the  first functional units of the Alpha station into orbit.  According to preliminary information, the reason for the  collision was the untimely switching from automatic to manual  control at a time when the Soyuz began to rotate slowly near the  Kristall module. The crew intended to fly around the station for  an inspection, but feeling the jolt fired the orientation  engines and moved away.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / MPs evade bribe charge JAPANESE prosecutors have decided not to charge60 ruling party MPs who received shares in an illegal Y500m (Pounds 2.65m) donation from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a scandal-tainted trucking company. The prosecutors' decision appears to close the case book on the Tokyo Sagawa scandal, which has already seen the resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the Liberal Democratic party godfather, and highlighted the links between leading politicians and gangsters. Mr Kanemaru admitted receiving the Y500m from Tokyo Sagawa, which had sought to cultivate political contacts, but the 60 MPs refused to identify themselves as having received funds, fearing they would be charged with violating the Political Funds Control Law.</p>

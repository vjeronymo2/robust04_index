			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi Claims Merits in Starting </F> Economy on New Path"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 6 -- Italian Prime Minister Carlo  Azeglio Ciampi, who moved from his job as governor of the Bank  of Italy to take over the country's helm just under a year ago,  voiced his "pride" here this evening for having made a  successful and not just economic contribution to putting the  country to rights.    In an interview with RAI-Uno, the public broadcasting  corporation's flagship channel, to be broadcast tomorrow  evening, he recalled that, when he came to power, he had  promised to manage a situation "of great dangers" including a  "giant public debt" using only ordinary means.    According to Ciampi, people were dubious about trying to  manage the crisis through market means, but the results were  falling interest rates and the re-conquered confidence of the  international markets. He also said the key was the incomes  policy agreement achieved with the unions last July 23.    Another major factor was the lira's devaluation, which had  turned a balance-of-payments deficit of 30 trillion lire into a  surplus of 15 trillion.    According to Ciampi, all this may mean that Italy may be the  first European nation to plunge into a "real economic recovery."    He also cited his government's continuation of the battle  against organised crime, its moves to uproot corruption and  other forms of malfeasance from public and business life, and  the measures laying the foundations for giving jobs to the young  people.    In other points, he looked back fifty years to the  Liberation  in 1944.    "Anyone who saw Italy with their own eyes then can only say  that the country has made enormous progress," he said.  "Particularly in the early years, there was an ability for  translating political ideals of liberty and justice into  reality. There was an ability for conjugating the Catholic with  the nonconfessional matrix."</p>

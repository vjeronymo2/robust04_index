			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Robert Casensky: "I am Selling a Tank; Reply </F> Box No. `Cheaply'"]    [Text] At the beginning of this week, reports started to  circulate again about Czech arms exports to the world's  high-risk regions. An article published in the most recent issue  of the weekly RESPEKT, which describes the talks between Skoda  Plzen Director General Lubomir Soudek and Iranian military  representatives on modernizing the Soviet T-72 tank and  supplying other weapons, provided the impetus for this  discussion. Skoda Plzen is part of the RDP Group, a Czech arms  consortium.    The actual aim of the RDP Group, as put forward by its  director general, Jan Vlcek, is very positive: to contribute by  efficient organization to improving the ability to compete of  our foremost heavy-industrial enterprises, which are affiliated  in the RDP Group, and to make money to convert arms production.  According to Vlcek, the production of weapons in the enterprises  affiliated in the RDP Group should amount to only 20 percent of  their production program.    The hitch, however, lies elsewhere. It is not that Czech  arms  production should be abolished, as President Havel suggested  after his election. It is impossible, of course, to abolish arms  production immediately. The other side of the coin, however, is  the offer to modernize tanks right on the spot in countries  against which a UN arms embargo has been imposed. Even Director  Soudek himself is not denying the talks on modernizing tanks and  other arms supplies.    Most startling, however, is the fact that these talks are  taking place with the knowledge of our government. According to  Vlcek, the appropriate deputy ministers regularly attend  meetings of the RDP Group's board. It would perhaps be worth  pointing out that the export of Czech and Slovak arms to  high-risk countries has on more than one occasion been the cause  of consternation in Western countries. If Iranian tanks ever  really are modernized, this could be another major international  faux pas by our country. Exporting arms or, rather, their spare  parts to a country such as Iran is not much in keeping with our  endeavor to attain the position of an exemplary candidate for  entry into NATO.    Let us hope that our government does not think that the  process for converting the arms industry would be set in motion  with the debut of the first modernized tank on Iran's borders.  We can expect, therefore, that the government and, first and  foremost, Minister Dlouhy, who is responsible for arms exports,  will adopt as soon as possible a decisive stance on Director  Soudek's Iranian activities and will, at the same time, consider  not only the economic aspect but also our reputation in the  civilized world.</p>

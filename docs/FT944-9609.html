			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Eligibility for EU funding Sir, I refer to the article 'Grants are the remedy for the region's needs' (November 7). This stated that, concerning eligibility for European Regional Development Fund, 'Telford and Stoke-on-Trent were not deemed to be in need any longer'. This is not correct. The position is that Telford was previously eligible and continues to be so, and that North Staffordshire conurbation, including part of Stoke-on-Trent, has obtained eligibility for the first time. Esther Knight, European policy officer, Staffordshire County Council, County Building, Martin Street, Stafford ST16 2LE</p>

Speaking at a rally in southeastern Turkey, Turkes said that  the PKK was receiving foreign support in its terror actions.    "The PKK says that it will make Turkey a bloodbath on the  March 21 Nevruz haliday. It will not be able to do so.    ``All of us are brothers, come from the same ancestors. The  terrorists are trying to force our citizens in east and  southeastern Turkey to flee to other regions, so as to realize  their dreams of greater Armenia,'' he said.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Ten more judges for High Court LORD Mackay, the lord chancellor, is to recommend the appointment of 10 new High Court judges 'as soon as possible' to tackle a growing backlog of cases. In a written answer in the Commons, Mr John Taylor, junior minister at the Lord Chancellor's Department, said Lord Mackay's decision followed a report by a group of judges and officials headed by Lord Justice Kennedy, on the work, deployment and numbers of High Court judges. Lord Taylor, lord chief justice, appointed last year with a mandate to modernise the judiciary, said recently he could not do the job without a big rise in the number of Appeal Court and High Court judges. The government's announcement follows warnings from the legal profession that a shortage of judges in the Commercial Court threatens London's future as a centre for handling international business disputes. The lord chancellor will have to seek parliamentary and Privy Council approval for an increase in the statutory maximum number of judges before any appointments can be made. The present limit of 85 was set in 1987. The number of High Court judges on March 1 this year was 83. The salary for a High Court judge is Pounds 87,620. Mr Taylor said the judges would be deployed 'to reduce delays and backlogs' in the Chancery Division, the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, the Employment Appeal Tribunal and the Commercial Court.</p>

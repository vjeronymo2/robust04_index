			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elena L. Aben] </F>   [Text] The Department of Environment and Natural Resources  (DENR), and the Metro Manila Authority (MMA) yesterday launched  a program aimed at rehabilitating the diminishing marine  resources of the Manila Bay, once considered among the richest  fishing grounds in the world.    DENR Secretary Angel Alcala, Quezon City Mayor and MMA  Chairman Ismael Mathay Jr., and Las Pinas Mayor Gabriel Casimiro  led national and local officials in signing a covenant to  support the Coastal Environment Program (CEP).    The project, which cover the 24-kilometer coast from Las  Pinas to Navotas was launched at the Santo Nino [Holy Child]  Island off the Coastal Road.    The covenant noted the degradation of the natural resources  at the Manila Bay, covering an area of about 180,000 hectares  bounded by several coastal towns.    The area was also covered with lush vegetation of mangrove  species, including the "nilad," where the City of Manila derived  its name.    The covenant, however, stated that all major rivers leading  to the Manila Bay, as well as its tributaries, are now heavily  polluted and considered biologically dead.    Among the major rivers leading to the bay are the Pasig  River, Tullahan-Tenejeros River, and Paranaque-Zapote River.    It also noted that garbage and refuse dumped by residents  along these waterways and careless disposal of industrial  wastes; and poor sewage treatment of industries contribute to  water pollution in the area.    The covenant likewise stated that the water pollution is  aggravated by oil spills from gas stations, oil depots, barges,  tankers, and several ships which also discharge their wastes  into the bay.    The DENR-National Capital Region (NCR), in an effort to put  a  stop to the further degradation of the bay, will extend  assistance and other resources needed to the effective carrying  out of activities that will protect and enhance the coastal  environment of the Manila Bay.    Alcala said that talisay, dapdap, agoho [local plant  species], coconut and other trees will be planted to add to the  biodiversity of the area surrounding the Manila Bay.    "We will ring the coastline with mangroves," Alcala, an  environmentalist and marine biologist, said.    Mathay, for his part, said that the program has to be  sustained because of the rapid development not only in Metro  Manila but also in nearby regions that bound Manila Bay.    Carlos C. Tomboc, DENR-NCR executive director said the  program will aim to plant trees that will attract wildlife  resources like bats, birds, and butterflies.    Several Metro Manila residents, according to Mathay, do not  recognize or have not yet seen the species of trees that they  will plant.    He said the long term goal of the program will be to  establish a mangrove seashore park where wildlife species can  survive and which will be called the "bio-diversity center" of  Metro Manila.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The death yesterday of the Rwandan president  continues to be used as a pretext for (?his guards) to  perpetrate extreme violence. Immediately following the crash of  the aircraft taking President Habyarimana back to Kanombe  Airport, sections of the Presidential Guard have perpetrated  unbridled killings, particularly of an ethnic and political  nature. Members of the Tutsi ethnic group are being massacred  indiscriminately, along with senior officials from political  parties known for their opposition to the despotic ideals of  [words indistinct].    According to reports reaching us, it is in this context that  Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana has been assassinated,  along with her family. This is reportedly the same in the case  of Joseph Kavaruganda, the chairman of the Constitutional Court;  Landouald Ndasingwa, the minister of labor and social affairs  and vice chairman of the Liberal Party [PL]; and Information  Minister Rucogoza.    Cases of kidnapping by these same Presidential Guards have  also been noted, notably that of Frederic Nzamurambaho, chairman  of the Social Democratic Party [PSD], and (Felicien Ngango),  first vice chairman of the PSD, to mention only a couple of  people.    Massacres are continuing [word indistinct]. Apparently, the  perpetrators do not intend to stop soon, especially because they  have been (?aided) by the defense minister's communique, which  urges the people to remain in their houses, thus making them  very vulnerable to the killers who, under these conditions, can  finish off the victims in their homes.</p>

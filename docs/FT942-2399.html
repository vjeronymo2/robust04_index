			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / University borrowing scheme complete Most universities will be able to raise private capital from the bond markets, possibly by the end of this year, under a financial blueprint commissioned by university vice-chancellors and the government. Formal government guarantees would not be needed under the scheme, which marks the first extension to the higher-education sector of the government's private finance initiative. The initiative was launched two years ago by Mr Norman Lamont when he was chancellor. Primary legislation is also unnecessary, according to the blueprint, which was completed last week. Universities will not be forced to borrow money this way, but most are thought likely to find the long-term fixed interest rates on offer in the bond markets very attractive. European Capital, the merchant banking advisory group, and the solicitors Trowers &amp; Hamlins, which were commissioned by universities to draw up the blueprint earlier this year, estimate that a bond issue of Pounds 75m is possible by the end of this year, depending on how quickly universities can fix their budgets after the beginning of the academic year in September. They would do so in a syndicate, using a vehicle company with a small permanent staff, similar to The Housing Finance Corporation, which has raised Pounds 770m for housing associations in bond issues since 1990. European Capital is now confident that there is sufficient demand in the City for universities to be able to borrow at rates significantly better than they could obtain from banks. Not all universities and other higher-education institutions will be able to raise funds this way, as the City will not be convinced about their credit-worthiness. However, European Capital is certain that the majority will be able to do so, and it will work over the next few months to decide what percentage of universities will be able to raise finance in this way. The first issue is likely to involve a range of institutions including both the more highly regarded universities such as Oxford and Cambridge, and newer institutions. Universities need the finance for capital projects such as libraries and laboratories. Many say they are under-resourced after the sharp expansion in student numbers over the past 15 years, which has seen the proportion of 18-year-olds going into higher education more than doubling from 13 per cent in 1980-81 to 31 per cent this year. However, they also recognise the reluctance of the government to pay for building which could be funded elsewhere. This year, for the first time, the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals made no request for student accommodation funding in its submission for Treasury funding. Alternative plans to raise finance only for the financially strongest universities, or to attempt to put together bond issues for all higher education institutions, were considered but rejected. Copies of the blueprint are being sent to university vice-chancellors, the Department for Education, and the higher education funding councils. Some universities are alarmed by the prospect that by joining a syndicate with other lower-ranked institutions they will in effect be providing them with a subsidy. However, European Capital's research shows that all the institutions involved in the syndicate would gain from the preferential rates on offer for larger-scale syndicated borrowing.

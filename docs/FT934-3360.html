			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / National one-day stoppage in public services proposed A one-day strike in the public sector, probably on April 11, has been proposed by the NUCPS civil service union, David Goodhart writes. The move may win support from the Trades Union Congress's public services committee early next month. The executive of Unison, the 1.5m-strong public service union, is this weekend expected to back the strike call. In spite of reservations from some other unions, such as the GMB general union, Unison's backing could be enough to swing TUC support behind the day. The strike would be a quasi-political protest against government policy on pay, jobs, market testing and privatisation throughout the public sector. It might therefore be ruled unlawful even if proper strike ballots were conducted. Opponents of strike action such as Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB, say the government would relish a legal and industrial conflict with the unions in the run-up to the local elections in May, and would seek to associate Labour authorities with the disruption. Opponents of action also say that if the day of action succeeded, it would present the wrong image of trade unionism at a time when unions are trying to persuade their members to retain 'check-off' - the automatic deduction of union dues by employers. 'I fear the movement is about to sleep-walk into a disaster,' said one official. Supporters of strike action say there is no other way to effectively express the anger of members. They point to the relative success of the day of action against market testing by civil servants on November 5. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, is unlikely to be enthusiastic about action but will lead it if this is what unions want. Unions will try to minimise inconvenience to the public, although the rail unions are likely to join in. Emergency services will be excluded.</p>

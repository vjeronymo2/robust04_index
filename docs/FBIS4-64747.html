			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Peter Schmalz report: "The New Eurofighter Is Flying in </F> the Shadow of the Tiger"]    [Text] Munich -- Europe's new combat helicopter, whose  first prototypes have been tested in southern France in the past  few months, is called the "Tiger" and attracts public attention.  However, in the shadow of the beast of prey, a civilian cat, for  whom experts predict a splendid future, was developed by the  Tiger producer Eurocopter, a young Franco-German helicopter  enterprise. The seven-seat aircraft, whose proper technical name  is EC 135, is to replace the legendary Boelkow hit Bo 105, which  has been in constant use as a police, rescue, and supply  helicopter since its maiden flight on 16 February 1967. The  first civilian helicopter jointly developed by the Germans and  the French incorporates proven features of its predecessor: The  four rotor blades are fed by two engines (which is not common in  the class of light helicopters, but which offers additional  safety); two rear flaps allow quick loading at the rear (this  made the Bo 105 the optimum vehicle for rescue operations).    "In addition, like the Bo 105, the new aircraft is fitted  with all possible technical innovations," Elmar Compans, project  manager of the EC 135 at the German Eurocopter headquarters in  Ottenbrunn near Munich, stressed. The most important features  are: Main rotor without bearings whose four 10-meter-long  blades seem to be firmly connected with the motor shaft where  other aircraft have complicated oscillation gears. The trick  that makes possible the rotor inclinations required for the  flight is the material. The blades are made of compound fiber  materials that are self-oscillating. Thus, the material never  fatigues or breaks. For this reason, there was no need for  bearings or oil at the rotor, and the number of the required  parts was reduced from 70 to nine. "We are flying with a dry  head," the test pilot Helmut Rueckert stated.    Fewer parts also mean less wear and maintenance. Project  manager Compans is convinced that the EC 135 will be the most  easy-to-service aircraft worldwide. "It has been common  practice so far to replace certain parts even when they are  still in perfect order. We have succeeded in constructing the  aircraft in such a way that the parts will only be replaced if  this is really necessary."    Two types of engines are being offered (PW 206 B by Pratt  and  Whitney and Turbomeca Arrius-2B). Because a lower machine  weight allows a higher payload, sheet steel and steel have been  replaced by light compound fiber materials wherever possible.  No other civilian helicopter contains more of this extremely  strong future-oriented material.    The two Eurocopter bosses Jean-Francois Bigay and Siegfried  Sobotta, who gave invitations for the world premier in Bavaria  today, are convinced that the EC 135, which will first be  delivered in series in 1996, is not only the most modern product  of its kind but, according to the current state of knowledge, it  will also be clearly cheaper in its daily use than the MD 900,  the U.S. eight- seat aircraft offered by the competitor McDonnel  Douglas, which has been undergoing tests for one year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 21 Jun (MTI) -- As reported earlier, the  nearly two week-long, six-party talks preparing for the founding  session of the new Parliament ended in Budapest on Tuesday. At  a press conference after the talks, representatives stressed the  consensus-forming nature of the discussions, and also that the  opposition parties received greater participation in the various  committees than they were entitled to by election percentages.    During the May elections, six parties won seats in the  386-member Parliament: the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP;  54.15 percent -- 209 MPs [members of parliament]), the Alliance  of Free Democrats (SZDSZ; 17.87 -- 69 MPs), the Hungarian  Democratic Forum (MDF; 9.84 -- 38 MPs), the Independent  Smallholders' Party (FKGP; 6.74 -- 26 MPs), the Christian  Democratic People's Party (KDNP; 5.7 -- 22 MPs), and the  Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz: 5.18 -- 20 MPs). The  Hungarian Socialist Party and the Alliance of Free Democrats are  expected to form a governing coalition.    The speaker of Parliament will be an MSZP politician, and  the  three deputy speaker posts will be filled by SZDSZ, MDF and FKGP  politicians respectively, based on election results. The SZDSZ,  MDF and the FKGP will be able to nominate one notary each, with  the KDNP and FIDESZ receiving two notary posts each.    The negotiating delegations also agreed that the new  parliament would have 17 committees. Six particularly important  committees will have 27 members: the Constitutional, the  Budget, the Local Government, the Foreign Affairs, the Economic,  and the Agricultural Committees. The Defence, the Welfare, the  Environmental Protection, the Cultural, the Human Rights, and  the Educational Committees will have 19 members each, with 15  MPs in the European Integration Committee, and 13 MPs each in  the Auditing, Employment, and Labour Committees. The National  Security Committee will have 9 members. The Immunity and  Mandate Committee will have 8 MPs.    Under the new parliamentary committee system, there will be  a  total of 334 committee members. An agreement was also reached  regarding the distribution of committee chairmen and deputy  chairmen. Accordingly, the MSZP will chair 9 committees; the  SZDSZ, three; and the opposition parties, five.    The opposition parties will control 12 deputy committee  chairman posts instead of the 9 due to them according to the  numeric proportion of votes which they received.    The MSZP will chair the Economic, the Welfare, the  Environmental Protection, the Cultural and Press, the Human  Rights, the Educational, the Agricultural, the Audit, and the  Immunity and Mandate Committees.    The SZDSZ will chair the Constitutional, the Foreign  Affairs,  and the Defence Committees.    The MDF will provide the chairman for the Budget and  Financial, and the National Security Committees.    The FKGP has received the chairmanship of the Local  Government Committee, a KDNP MP will chair the Employment and  Labour Committee, and an Fidesz MP will preside over the  European Integration Committee.</p>

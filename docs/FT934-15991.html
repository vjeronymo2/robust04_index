			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: MR-Data expands 6% to Pounds 8.8m - Three acquisitions bolster full-year profits and turnover ACQUISITIONS helped MR-Data Management, the data transcription and document image processing group, report a 6 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits yesterday. The surplus in the year to June 30 increased from Pounds 8.23m to Pounds 8.76m on turnover up 21 per cent to Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 33.7m). Earnings per share were unchanged at 10.6p but the final dividend is increased to 3.46p, making a total up 20 per cent at 5.19p (4.32p). At the operating level the group, which changed its name from Microfilm Reprographics earlier this year, reported profits of Pounds 8.09m (Pounds 7.3m), bolstered by Pounds 900,000 from three acquisitions which also added Pounds 4m to turnover. The three acquisitions were Atlanta-based Fort Knox Secured Data which provides high security storage for paper and magnetic media and was acquired in July last year; the UK COM Service Bureau of NCR which was acquired in September last year, and Taywood Data Graphics which was acquired from Taylor Woodrow in January. Mr Michael Elliott, who took over as chief executive in July, said trading conditions had continued to be difficult and that it was only recently that the group had begun to see more promising signs of an upturn in the level of orders. Mr Elliott said that a new divisional structure had been introduced to provide a more focused approach to business development. He added that all the businesses traded profitably during the year. Despite the acquisitions and capital expenditure totalling Pounds 6.7m the group ended the year with Pounds 6.88m in net cash, down from Pounds 8.5m a year earlier. COMMENT Despite a relatively lacklustre performance MR-Data's performance is still underpinned by long term contracts which are still highly profitable and should benefit from the recovery in the US and UK. Some of the acquisitions, and developments in the software division, will take the group into new and potentially fast growing businesses like Geographic Information Systems. The management team is a little thin following recent resignations including that of the finance director, although no sinister implications need be drawn and the issue is being addressed. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 10m look possible this year producing earnings of 12.8p and a prospective p/e of 17.</p>

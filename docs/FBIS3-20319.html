Mr. Claes, after meeting with Turkish President Suleyman  Demirel, stated: "As long as the Kurdish organizations respect  the rules of democracy in Belgium, we will not ban them."    Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin had implicitly  criticized Belgium for allowing groups close to the PKK to  operate on its territory while they are banned in France and  Germany.    Mr. Claes further explained: "We doubt considerably the  effectiveness of a ban insofar as when you ban one organization  this immediately leads to the creation of another sister  organization going under a different name or even drives the  organization underground."

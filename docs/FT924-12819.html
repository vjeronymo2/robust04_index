			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Construction Contracts: Wimpey wins Pounds 32m order for Edinburgh retail development WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION SCOTLAND has been appointed management contractor on Edinburgh's largest retail development, a Pounds 32.5m scheme to build the Gyle shopping centre on the South Gyle Broadway in the city centre. The contract has been awarded to Wimpey by a consortium of clients comprising the high street retailers Marks and Spencer and Asda, and McLagan Investments. Wimpey will complete the complex in six phases, with retailers moving in by October of next year. Along with 120,000 sq ft of multi-occupancy units, the key elements of the phased scheme include a 70,000 sq ft store for Asda and a 110,000 sq ft retail outlet for Marks and Spencer. The steel-frame building will be enveloped in cavity blockwork walls at the lower levels with flat metal cladding to the ceiling. The entrance elevation will be glazed, as will the 920ft-long mall, bringing natural light to the heart of the shopping complex. The Gyle will be topped with a combination of pitched and flat roofs. Wimpey will also complete the fit-out, including the mechanical and electrical installation to all the common and shared areas. Aside from a network of security installations which includes CCTV, the shopping centre will be fully equipped with up-to-date fire detection devices, such as a sprinkler and alarm system. Pre-construction groundwork requires importing material for upfill so that appropriate site levels can be achieved. the ground will be strengthened with 2,000 driven cast in-situ piled foundations and a reinforced concrete ground slab. Wimpey's parners on the project are MJSR as architect, Greeds as quantity surveyor, Montague Evans as letting agents and Bovis Construction as project manager. The concept architect was Edinburgh-based Comprehensive Design, the landscape architect was I. White and McIlroy Coates was the graphic designer.</p>

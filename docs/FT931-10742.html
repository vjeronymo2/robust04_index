			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: On high ground Investment gurus who never expected the FT-SE index to rise much above 2,900 this year must have had a twinge of anxiety this week. The index briefly rose above that level on Thursday and, though it has since fallen back, the market is still within spitting distance of many year-end targets. There is a difference, of course, between the background now and the way it was when the forecasts were made. Both interest rates and the exchange rate have fallen much faster than was generally assumed. After such a monetary relaxation, equity valuations do not look stretched, even with an historic market multiple approaching 18. But further advance does depend on companies actually delivering higher earnings. Trading statements will be scrutinised particularly closely during the coming reporting season. A few nasty surprises on earnings or on dividends could set the market back. So could opportunistic rights issues, though the market may be over-doing worries on that score. Banks, the latest sector to be marked down on the prospect of large cash calls, are most unlikely candidates. The biggest imponderable remains the impact of government borrowing when heavy PSBR funding gets under way. Assuming it is followed through, the Bundesbank's rate cut may have changed the equation slightly by allowing sterling to stabilise, limiting the inflationary threat from lower short-term rates. Gilt investors might thus not require such high yields. But easier German money is also boosting continental equity markets, which could lessen the relative attraction of UK shares.</p>

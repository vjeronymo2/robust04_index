			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>   [Text] The attacks by chetnik howitzers, tanks, and mortars  of all calibers on the lines of defenders in the part of the  front around Bihac and on Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau have  continued throughout the night and up to this moment. Fierce  battles were fought on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau early this  morning, where, after ferocious artillery preparation, the  chetniks considerably intensified attacks on all lines.    The defenders -- members of the 5th Corps of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army -- responded adamantly, defending every  inch of territory. Following the established scenario, the  Serbian aggressor also intensified artillery attacks on Bihac  and Cazin and their outskirts.    There have been many injured and killed civilians in this  savage artillery attack on Bihac; however, due to current  hellish situation in this town and throughout the entire Bihac  district, we do not have definitive reports about this. At the  time of reporting, fierce shelling of the settlements on the  right bank of Una River and of the two aforementioned towns is  underway.</p>

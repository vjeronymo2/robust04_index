			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] At his news conference today  Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri replied to a correspondent's question  about remarks made recently by a U.S. official on talks with  Iran. Nateq-Nuri stressed: America's performance has always  been in contradiction with such remarks, and thus far this  performance has not been in a manner to demonstrate that  country's good intention, and which can be trusted. He  stressed: As long as America maintains its hegemonistic and  aggressive nature, we will continue our struggle.    On biased western propaganda alleging that Iran is striving  to build nuclear weapons, the head of the legislative branch  said: All international organizations and forums, particularly  the International Atomic Energy Agency which has inspected our  country's installations, have declared that there is no evidence  to show that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. We use  our installations to generate power.    About the main obstacles along the path of improving ties  with Egypt, Nateq-Nuri replied to the correspondent's question  by describing the Egyptian Government as the biggest obstacle  along the path of upgrading these relations. Referring to the  Egyptian Government's opposition to the Islam-seeking and  Islam-supporting wave in that country, the Majles speaker added:  The Egyptian Government cannot see the people's Islam-seeking  mentality and blames Iran for provocation.    On Iran's relations with other Asian countries, particularly  China and India, the Majles speaker emphasized: We wish to  establish ties and unity with all other countries, except Israel  and the United States, and we believe this unity will serve the  interests of us all.</p>

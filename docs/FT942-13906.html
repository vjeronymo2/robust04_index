			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: A Fisher plans Pounds 59m Danish buy Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, has agreed to buy a Danish-based seafood company in a deal worth Pounds 59m. Shares in the group fell 6p to 57p after it announced a 1-for-6 rights issue at 52p per new ordinary share to raise Pounds 51.2m. The group also plans to cut its interest bill by redeeming preference shares worth Pounds 46.9m. The Rahbek Group, a producer of chilled and frozen fish recipe dishes, is to be bought for Pounds 40m in cash plus the assumption of about Pounds 19.1m of debt. Rahbek's factories in the UK and Denmark supply valued-added products to leading European retailers such as Marks and Spencer. Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher, said the acquisition was 'a further significant step towards creating a group with strong positions in markets with good growth opportunities, while further reducing exposure to pure commodity distribution and trading businesses.' Rahbek's operating income for 1993 amounted to Pounds 3.6m on sales of Pounds 119.1m, although profits were adversely affected by a strike by Danish fishermen. Albert Fisher yesterday also reported increased pre-tax profits of Pounds 30.6m (Pounds 22.8m) for the six months to February 28, on sales of Pounds 606m (Pounds 550m). Under FRS 3, earnings rose to 3.52p (2.66p), but stripping out a Pounds 10.5m exceptional gain on disposals, they fell to 2.23p (2.5p). The interim dividend is held at 1.85p. The group said cost reduction continued to be a priority, but the benefits from action already taken continued to be offset by poor trading conditions. The recession in continental Europe, the effects on margins of the retail price wars and produce price deflation in North America all had a negative impact. In general it remained difficult to predict any real improvement in the second half in its key markets. COMMENT The market did not like this deal - mainly because analysts hate to see an acquisition being funded by paper with a prospective yield of 8 per cent. They did, however, understand its strategic logic: Albert Fisher simply must get away from the commodity end of the market, which continues to spring unpleasant surprises, particularly in the US. The group is certainly paying a full price for an acquisition which it says will be earnings neutral in the first year, but promises future benefits. A prospective multiple of 11 fully reflects the market's disgruntlement with this so-far unfulfilled tale of jam tomorrow. Only real profits performance will dispel the doubts which have kept the shares under a cloud.</p>

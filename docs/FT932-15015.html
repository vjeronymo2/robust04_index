			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investment climate in PNG 'still favourable' PAPUA NEW Guinea was yesterday given a much-needed endorsement by MIM Holdings, the Australian mining group, in spite of the government's interventionist approach to foreign investment in resource projects. Mr Norm Fussell, the MIM chief executive, said the government's recent insistence on renegotiating major projects had provided 'ammunition to those who believe the risk of doing business in PNG is too great'. But investment in PNG remained attractive, especially for major projects, for which the government had introduced a favourable economic and regulatory climate. Mr Fussell said overseas companies' anxieties about the risks of investing in PNG had been increased by disputes over the Porgera and Mount Kare gold mines, secessionist fighting on Bougainville island, and law and order problems on the mainland. Highlands Gold, a PNG-registered subsidiary of MIM, was one of three Australian companies forced to reduce their shareholdings in the Porgera project last month after the government insisted on renegotiating its joint venture contract. Mr Fussell said the three companies involved in the Porgera venture 'were reluctant to cede a significant part of a profitable investment after having carried the risk, the exploration, and the workload'. But MIM was not reconsidering its attitude to investment in PNG, which also includes a commitment to oil exploration and development in the South East Gobe oilfield. 'Once the political reality of the sale was accepted, the final negotiations with the government resulted in a reasonable commercial outcome. And the government itself, now with a substantial stake in the operation, is committed to making it work well,' he said. Mr Fussell also said that PNG's natural resources, part of the so-called Pacific Rim of Fire, had been barely explored, in spite of the large number of major minerals projects under way in the country. 'The geology is highly prospective, and the gold, copper, and oil which have been revealed to date are indicative of much more to follow,' he said. The MIM chief executive's comments will be welcomed by the coalition government, headed by Mr Paiais Wingti, which has adopted an aggressive approach to PNG participation in major projects.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Ukraine's currency plummets The Ukrainian currency yesterday plunged in value against the dollar, plummeting to less than one-third of its previous value, writes Oleh Mamaiev in Kiev. Officials attributed the devaluation at the central bank's hard currency auction as a reaction to new regulations which oblige Ukrainian exporters to sell 50 per cent of their hard currency earnings to the government at the fixed rate of 5,970 coupons to the dollar. Western economists believe the Ukrainian economy moved into hyper-inflation in June. In yesterday's trading the Ukrainian coupon fell to 19,050 against the dollar, from last week's level of 5,970.</p>

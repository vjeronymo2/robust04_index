			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 13 (BTA) -- At an extraordinary meeting  today the National Coordinating Council of the opposition Union  of Democratic Forces (SDS) decided to continue the boycott of  parliament, the coalition's leader Filip Dimitrov said after the  meeting. The National Coordinating Council believes that SDS's  participation in parliament's work would be imperative only in  case it discusses the future of Lyuben Berov's cabinet, the  Electoral Act, the Judiciary Organization Act, or the state  emblem. Under the decisions of the latest national conference  of the coalition in May, the decisions concerning its strategy  and tactics lie with the National Coordinating Council and the  parliamentary SDS should conform. The latter has not been  attending the plenary sittings for two weeks now, with the only  exception of last week's debate on the Judiciary Organization  Bill.    Mr. Dimitrov said that at today's meeting the National  Coordinating Council found the boycott had yielded results:  "The parliamentary majority is quite confused and decisions are  being made without the constitutionally required quorum." The  latter fact Mr. Dimitrov described as "disgraceful" and  "arbitrary."    The National Coordinating Council also decided to develop "a  detailed scheme to make the presence of the National  Coordinating Council, MP's and leaders of the SDS felt  throughout the country."</p>

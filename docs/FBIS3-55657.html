			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1728 GMT on 10 January in a new, live program of news  and analysis entitled "Details" [Podrobnosti], journalist  Nikolay Svanidze interviewed Gennadiy Eduardovich Burbulis, of  Russia's Choice. Svanidze opened the program by looking briefly  at the immediate accommodation problems facing the new Federal  Assembly over video of building work in progress. The interview  was interspersed with brief voice excerpts over video of  Chernomyrdin speaking on 5 January and of Yegor Gaydar speaking  at today's press conference.    Svanidze began by asking Burbulis why the Russia's Choice  faction left the talks over election of a parliamentary speaker.    Burbulis replied: "We realized that these talks had very  little to do with the final results of electing a chairman.  They were cunningly demonstrative and, moreover, the Russia's  Choice bloc risked losing its political face which is something  we cannot allow. We are very worried about the possible  domination of parliament by two extremist political forces,  namely the communist and national- fascist ones and we cannot be  linked with decisions worked out hand- in-hand with them."    Svanidze then said: "I have learned that a split is  developing in the Russia's Choice bloc, or rather has already  developed. Incidentally, you were not there next to Gaydar today  at the press conference, nor have you formally become one of the  bloc's leaders and I have even learned from the lobbies that  Andrey Makarov has sharply criticized Yegor Gaydar." Burbulis  replied: "I think those observations are rather surface,  superficial ones. We criticized not only Gaydar but also each  other. Most importantly this partial assessment was needed to  evaluate honestly the causes of the relative defeat that we  suffered in the elections." Svanidze pressed him further: "If  the criticism of Gaydar is connected with a search for reasons  for the election defeat, then it would be logical to assume that  you link this defeat with the name Gaydar?" Burbulis replied:  "No it is not so simple, not so straightforward."    Asked whether the Russia's Choice faction should now lobby  the present government, Burbulis said; "No I don't believe so  and I think that it would be useful both for the government and  for the country if our tactics were to draw a precise and clear  distinction between those government actions and decisions which  correspond to our notion of reform of the country's economy and  those which do not correspond to it at all but which manifest  contrary interests and aims."    Svanidze inquired: "So you do not like being associated with  the government?" to which Burbulis responded: "We do not like  this and we made a serious mistake in the election campaign when  we took on full responsibility for the actions of the government  and our opponents readily exploited this."    Burbulis added that Russia's Choice would very much like to  be able to coordinate its actions with the president, actively  and constructively and asserted that "the country needs a new  political culture, a culture of coalitional activity. This is  required of the president, it is required of the government and  it is required of all of us."    Asked whether now he personally regarded himself as  Yeltsin's  political supporter, Burbulis said: "To the extent that the  president adopts decisions and acts while preserving the  country's reformist, democratic future, yes I am Yeltsin's  supporter. Where his actions do not correspond to that future  and where they give rise to considerable problems and  difficulties in the system of government, I cannot support him  and I will not support him."    On Russia's Choice's attitude toward Zhirinovskiy, Burbulis  had this to say: "Any political or ideological contacts with  Zhirinovskiy and his grouping are totally unacceptable until an  assessment, including a legal one, has been made of the  obscurantism which he has offered the country today." He added:  "Any compromises with the national-fascist ideology which  threatens to appear and find a mouth-piece in parliament are  totally unacceptable," but he accepted that his faction would  have to find a way of working with other factions in parliament.</p>

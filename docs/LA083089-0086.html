			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot, "Roots" author Alex Haley and Albert Shanker,  the president of the American Federation of Teachers, have been named to the  advisory panel of Channel One, the controversial classroom TV news show. In a  prepared statement, Shanker said he felt it important for his organization --  one of America's major teacher unions with more than 700,000 members -- to be  involved in shaping the program. He added, however, that "I am not on this  council as a promoter or endorser. I continue to have strong reservations."  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

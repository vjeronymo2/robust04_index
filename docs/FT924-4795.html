			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Canadians seek to water their Ukraine roots - The hoped-for trade benefits of family ties A MILLION Canadians, more than 3 per cent of the country's population, are immigrants, or descendants of immigrants, from Ukraine. The ranks of Ukrainian-Canadians include the present governor-general, the finance minister, the premier of the prairie province of Saskatchewan and a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada. With such numbers and political clout, it is not surprising that the community not only celebrated Ukraine's independence with gusto last December, but was confident of being in pole position to take advantage of trade and investment opportunities there. Under pressure from the Ukrainian-Canadian political lobby, Ottawa was the first western government to recognise Ukraine's independence and was quick to extend trade credits and technical assistance. The expatriate community has financed and organised construction of Ukraine's new consulate-general in Toronto. At the same time, however, Ukrainian-Canadians find it hard to hide their disappointment that the effort they have put into helping their ancestral homeland has yet to be matched by hard business opportunities. There has been no shortage of traffic between the two countries since Ukraine's independence. Canada's governor-general, Mr Ramon Hnatyshyn, was greeted by thousands of rapt Ukrainians when he visited his ancestral village last month. Toronto's Ukrainian community has organised a 12-member 'Peace Corps' to work in various ministries in Kiev. One member helped prepare Ukraine's submission for loans from the International Monetary Fund. A political scientist from the University of Alberta has spearheaded the formation of a public administration school in Ukraine. Another Canadian is chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Numerous Ukrainian groups have been to Canada to hone such varied skills as grain farming and securities trading. Despite this high profile, business deals have been slow to materialise. The Canadian Bank Note Company scored an early victory by winning the contract to print Ukraine's new currency and stamps against tough competition from the more established Swiss company Due La Rue Giori. Teleglobe Canada, a long-distance phone company, has installed an earth satellite station in Lviv. Last March, a consortium of Canadian companies formed a pig breeding and farming venture with a collective farm near Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine. The Canadian partners will ship breeding stock to Ukraine and build a weaning facility on the farm. But the Canadians appear to have less of a competitive edge than they had hoped. Mr Brian Monaghan, a Toronto business consultant who organised the pig-farming venture, points to the irony that Ukraine seems to be less interested in doing business with its friends in Canada than with Germany, which invaded it in the second world war. As Mr Monaghan notes: 'The Germans can fly there and back in the same day.' More than geographical distance handicaps Canadian businessmen in Ukraine. Canadians complain that, unlike their European competitors, they are unfamiliar with the sleazier side of business, which is often the key to deals in the nascent Ukrainian market. 'It's the Wild West there,' says Mr Borys Wrzesnewskyj, owner of a Toronto bakery chain who also heads the local branch of the Canadian Friends of Rukh (the mass movement which initiated Ukraine's drive for independence). Mr Wrzesnewskyj says that, for the moment, he is not even trying to do business in Ukraine because 'I don't want to tarnish my name'. Mr Wrzesnewskyj and other emigres used a conference of the Ukrainian diaspora this summer to point out shortcomings in the political and economic programme of Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the president. Stung by these attacks, a few days later Mr Kravchuk warned a group of Canadian emigres that foreigners who criticised the government could be expelled. Economics rather than politics has been behind delayed plans for a North American issue of interest-bearing Ukraine bonds, modelled on State of Israel bonds. The first Dollars 30m tranche was due to be issued next month. But Mr Dan Bilak, a Toronto lawyer spearheading the project, says the process is taking longer than expected. Mr Bilak notes that conversations with Ukrainian officials on the subject tend to start with an explanation of what a bond is. These setbacks are clearly sorting out the men from the boys in the Ukrainian-Canadian business community. Nonetheless, McGill University's faculty of management in Montreal recently identified Ukraine as one of a handful of countries where Canadian business should enjoy a competitive edge. The McGill study advised Canadian companies to focus their efforts on participating in selected privatisations; forming export consortiums in such areas as telecommunications and energy distribution; and financing small business start-ups in Ukraine. It concluded however, that while Ukraine may offer potentially high returns, it remains a high risk. That clearly applies even to those Canadians who were confident that they had a head start in sewing up business deals there.</p>

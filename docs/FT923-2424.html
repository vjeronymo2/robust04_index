			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Benetton outcasts step back into the limelight Benetton, the Italian clothing group, chose Moscow to trumpet its latest marketing thoughts this week. The company was responsible for uproar in the UK in January with an advertising campaign featuring, among others, a picture of a dying Aids sufferer. This time, Oliviero Toscani, Benetton's advertising guru, selected seven photographs for poster and magazine advertising. Each carries a tiny Benetton logo. The photographs include: an empty electric chair in a New York jail; an oil-covered bird from the Gulf; an albino African girl among black South African girls; a grime-smeared child carrying a white doll, photographed in El Salvador; pigs snuffling in a trash heap in Peru; a photo of children building a brick wall in an unspecified developing country; and finally, a group of KGB plain-clothes agents arresting a suspect (above). Like its previous campaign, Benetton has again focused on the downbeat and unhappy, this time selecting a set of apparent outcasts to sell its colourful jumpers. Toscani says he 'leafed through newspapers and magazines from all over the world' to find the photographs. Critics of the previous Benetton campaign - and there were many, from the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to gay activists - accused it of arrogant insensitivity. Toscani brushed that criticism aside, saying his intention was to move from 'using advertising to promote a product, to the promotion of greater social awareness'. Some of the latest campaign photographs may also cause offence, though three of the six due to run in the UK have already been seen and cleared by the ASA. Benetton's ambition to be seen as a global company means that the latest campaign is being unveiled in Tokyo, Beijing, New Delhi, Cairo and Johannesburg. The ASA argues that previous Benetton ads featuring black and white people ran into the problem of compounding negative racial stereotypes, but that the latest South African picture does not, prima facie, fall into that trap. Benetton has reason to believe that its Dollars 80m (Pounds 40.6m) global advertising budget is working: in 1991 it raised net group profits by 23.6 per cent to L164.8bn (Pounds 77.48m) due to higher sales and improved financial management. Group turnover rose by almost 12 per cent to L2,303bn, and the company sold 83m items through a chain of more than 6,500 shops in 100 countries. But there are contrary indications. The US trade magazine Adweek has claimed Benetton is losing market share, with its number of US stores likely to drop to about 300 by the end of 1992, against a peak of 700 in the 1980s.</p>

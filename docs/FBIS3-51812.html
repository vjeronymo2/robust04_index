			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Artibonite, especially in the area of Gervais,  hunger is spreading. Our correspondent [Leonor Exantus] tells us  that children are dying of malnutrition.    [Begin recording, in Creole] One or two children die of  malnutrition every two weeks in Gervais. Located at about 30 km  on National Road Number One, Gervais is in the fifth section of  Saint-Marc, which has about 3,000 inhabitants. The population in  Gervais is suffering from malnutrition, whooping cough,  tuberculosis, malaria, thyphoid, et cetera, which every two  weeks kill one or two children. Two years ago, the sanitary  department of Saint-Marc held a vaccination campaign which did  not seem to have reached the Gervais population.    Furthermore, there is no water in Gervais, not to cultivate  the gardens, nor for drinking. It is only when it is raining and  the river is high that the people in the area can cultivate  rice. According to several peasants, they approached  institutions including the Red Cross and the City Hall in  Saint-Marc, which advised that they themselves are facing  difficulties due to the embargo, and cannot help the people in  Gervais. The population of Gervais is sending a call to the  natives of Gervais living abroad, to Haitians of good faith who  might help them. The people ask for urgent action because the  children of Gervais are only skin and bones. If no solution or  aid is given to the population of Gervais, fifth section of  Saint-Marc, the number of children dying everyday will increase.    It should be recalled that in July 1990, a slaughter took  place there, killing 12 persons, [word indistinct] houses  burned, many missing animals. In addition to all of that, the  embargo has created a miserable situation for the people of  Gervais.    From Saint Marc in Lower Artibonite, this has been Leonor  Exantus for Radio Metropole.

The latest example was  Wednesday's 3-2 win over Valley Encino-Tarzana at Taft High.  </P> <P> Catcher Glen Nahmias provided the key blow, a two-run home run in the bottom of  the seventh, to make a winner of pitcher Chris Brown (7-3) and preserve East's  half-game lead over Woodland Hills West.  </P> <P> Nahmias' home run proved especially pleasing for East (17-4) after it was held  scoreless despite loading the bases with none out in the sixth inning.  </P> <P> Nahmias drove in all three of East's runs with three hits. Jason Mansfield took  the loss for Valley ET (9-11).  </P> <P> In other District 20 games:  </P> <P> Woodland Hills West 7, Eagle Rock 4 -- Bobby Kim struck a two-run double to  highlight a four-run seventh inning as West (16-4) came from behind to win at  Occidental College and remain a half-game behind East.  </P> <P> Pat Treend pitched the seventh inning to earn his second save and preserve the  win for starter Sean Boldt (5-1).  </P> <P> Kim, Del Marine and Jeff Marks had two hits each for West, which has won 13 in  a row and 15 of its last 16. Eagle Rock fell to 9-11.  </P> <P> Quartz Hill 8, North Hollywood 4 -- Kendial Armstrong went two for four with a  triple and a single to lead Quartz Hill (16-5) to victory at North Hollywood  High.  </P> <P> Armstrong drove in two runs and scored twice to support the pitching of Dan  Bennett (2-0), who threw the final two innings to earn the decision. Jason  Haner also scored two runs.  </P> <P> For North Hollywood (1-21), Mike Salas had three hits, while Duane Braxton and  Sammy Ciaramilaro had two hits apiece.  </P> <P> Encino-Crespi 7, Verdugo Hills 3 -- Jeff Suppan allowed just two earned runs  and scattered seven hits in a game at Valley College.  </P> <P> Suppan (3-4) walked two and struck out six for Encino-Crespi (5-14).

Joey Medaglia  had three hits for the winners. Dave Bildner had three hits for Newhall-Saugus  (13-9).  </P> <P> Sun Valley 9, Chatsworth 8 -- Sun Valley, the leader in the Eastern Division,  took a 6-1 lead in the third inning, then held on in a game at Poly High.  </P> <P> Raul Torres relieved in the sixth inning and pitched shutout ball for his first  save, preserving starter Robert Flores' win.  </P> <P> Sun Valley (18-2) was helped by multiple-hit days from Wil Molina (two hits,  two runs, two RBIs); Marlon McKinney (two hits, two runs, one RBI); Roy Lozano  (two hits, one run, two RBIs) and Torres (two hits).  </P> <P> Chatsworth fell to 9-11.  </P> <P> Las Virgenes 7, Studio City 6 -- Las Virgenes (11-10) rallied from a 5-2  deficit after two innings at Calabasas High.  </P> <P> Right-hander Harold Turk (3-1) allowed two earned runs through 5 1/3 innings,  striking out one and walking three. Paul Johnson pitched the final 1 1/3  innings to earn his second save.  </P> <P> Trailing, 5-2, Las Virgenes scored three runs in the fifth to take the lead for  good.  </P> <P> Brett Resnick walked with one out and Geordie Wimmer reached base on an error.  Paul Shaffer drove home Resnick with a sacrifice fly and Sam Voita doubled in  Wimmer.  </P> <P> Voita then scored when Tom Hoover reached base on a throwing error.  </P> <P> Alex Alvarenga was two for three and Tony Gonzales was three for four for  Studio City.

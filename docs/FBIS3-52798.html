			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Catastrophe of the Vatican's Recognition of </F> Israel"]    [Text] The Vatican's recognition of Israel and  normalization of relations with it after 200 years of hostility  and disagreement was a new shock for all the Arabs, particularly  as that recognition was at the expense of the Arabs, their  territory, and their sanctities and in the interest of Israel,  its racism, and its control of the Arab territories.    As the papal envoy visits the occupied Arab territories in  Palestine, the Israeli Army continues to kill innocent people  with live ammunition and continues to throw more detainees in  its prisons which now have 11,000 prisoners, some of them  children.    We find it difficult to understand the Vatican's haste in  normalizing relations with Israel and signing an agreement with  it condoning its occupation of Arab territories and Judaiazation  of Jerusalem. The Vatican, which refrained from taking such a  step for 2,000 years, could have waited a few more years to see  the outcome of the current peace efforts in the region.    We do not believe that the Christian spiritual leadership  accepts the injustice, the occupation, the coercion, the  confiscation of land, the building of settlement, and the  prevention of family reunions.    That is why we are surprised by this eagerness to establish  full diplomatic relations with an entity that commits all these  excesses and violations of human rights and international laws  and charters.    We could understand a Third World state establishing  relations with Israel because it needed so-called aid and  expertise or because it believed that Israel was the most  effective channel for reaching the heart of the White House and  its financial and economic aid, but we cannot understand the  Vatican taking such a step. It is not a state and it does not  need a mediator to reach Washington. Quite the contrary,  Washington is the one that needs the pope's blessing and  satisfaction. Furthermore, the Vatican is not a state seeking  to expand its commercial relations and seek new markets for its  products and exports.    The Vatican would not have taken such a step had the Arab  situation not been at its worst and had the Palestinian people,  Muslims and Christians, not been besieged by brothers before  being besieged by enemies.    It is regrettable that the current state of Arab division  does not encourage anyone to respect the Arabs and their causes  or to take them and their interests into consideration. The  picture was different when the Arabs were strong and united and  when there was Arab solidarity. Others would have had to think  a thousand times before taking a step that would anger any Arab  state.    We hope that this fatal Vatican blow will serve as a lesson  to those who are placing obstacles in the way of Arab  reconciliation and restoration of Arab solidarity, because the  danger of these divisions which have weakened the Arabs and  shaken their world image is getting closer to their own  doorsteps. The coming days will prove that they are not safe no  matter how much money, arms, and Western support they have.    If the loss of Jerusalem, its Judaiaization, and the  building  of a belt of settlements around it to obliterate its Arab  identity has not moved them, we do not believe that their state  of health is sound nor that their political situation is normal  to enable them to face any danger that threatens them.    The Vatican's recognition of Israel on Israeli terms is an  insult to all the Arabs and Muslims without exception because  the consequences of that recognition will be a catastrophe for  all, without exception.    The Zionist movement, after Arab failure caused the label of  racism to be lifted from it at the United Nations, is, after  this major recognition of the state of Israel and its occupation  of Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied territories, now ready  to surge forward, expand, gain new legitimacy for its ideology,  and build even larger and more dangerous alliances in the region  at the expense of Arabism and all the human, cultural, and  civilized values and ethics it represents.</p>

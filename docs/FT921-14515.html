			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Fisons chief quits on health grounds MR JOHN KERRIDGE resigned yesterday as chairman and chief executive of Fisons, the UK drugs and scientific equipment company that has been the subject of mounting criticism from its institutional shareholders in recent months. The company said his departure was due to ill-health after doctors diagnosed a heart condition. Mr Patrick Egan, a non-executive director of the company since 1985, takes over as executive chairman. Fisons intends to appoint a new chief executive and make Mr Egan non-executive chairman. It is looking for suitable candidates both within and outside the company. Mr Egan said that Mr Kerridge 'always knew' of the possibility of heart trouble, 'and the events of the past few months cannot have helped'. Those events include a 31 per cent fall in the company's share price from a record high of 515p to 354p at Monday's close. Yesterday, the shares rose 11p to 365p. The decline in the share price came despite Mr Kerridge saying at the company's interim results in September that he was more optimistic over business prospects than for several years. He forecast that two of Fisons' products, Opticrom, an eye drug, and Imferon, a blood-iron treatment, which had been suspended from the US market by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), should be back on sale quickly. This did not happen and the shares fell steadily through the autumn. Investor confidence was shaken on December 11 by the news that not only would the ban remain in force but it had cost Fisons Pounds 65m in lost profits. City stockbroker James Capel is forecasting a profit of Pounds 185m for 1991, compared with Pounds 230m in 1990. It blames the fall on Opticrom's and Imferon's problems. Fisons then became embroiled in a public row with a Washington publication called The Pink Sheet, which follows the FDA closely. The company accused the publication of distortions in reporting FDA criticisms of its manufacturing practice. The Pink Sheet responded that it had directly quoted FDA officials. Mr Egan denied there was bad feeling between the company and the FDA. The matter will be tested at the next visit of FDA officials to Fisons due before the end of March. He acknowledged that institutional investors had been pressing for the roles of chairman and chief executive to be separated at Fisons. He said that, apart from this request, shareholders had no influence on the departure of Mr Kerridge. Fund managers yesterday expressed surprise that Mr Kerridge was leaving the company: 'It's been fairly obvious that something would happen but we are surprised that he has gone altogether. We thought his role would split,' said one. Fisons was criticised in 1989 for over-confidence in expecting the FDA to approve its version of Pentamidine, a pneumonia drug. The FDA chose a rival. Mr Egan acknowledged that the company had 'not paid sufficient attention to relationships with the City. We were naive, and perhaps there was wishful thinking, over the FDA'.

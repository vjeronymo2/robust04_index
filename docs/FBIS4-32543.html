			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Since early April, newspapers in The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) have featured  articles on a package of three draft laws involving the election  of the country's president, proposed changes to the law on  parliamentary elections, and on the distribution of electoral  districts. Of these, only the law on presidential elections has  been passed.    Reviewing the government's performance on the electoral law  in an article published in NOVA MAKEDONIJA on 12 and 13 April,  Lazar Lubacevski commented that the current draft is almost  identical to the one the same government introduced in July 1993  with the same injunction: This needs to be adopted immediately!  When the government encountered opposition to its draft,  Lubacevski observed, it withdrew the bill from the agenda and  remained silent for eight months. According to Lubacevski, the  government should have opened The discussion with the  participation of citizens' forums and the extraparliamentary  parties, and then scheduled a debate on the law in September.  However, one part of the governing coalition, Lubacevski said  without elaborating, did not like "the expansion of the system  because it would interfere with the existing monopolistic  situation."    In order to leave the existing 120 majority-vote districts  intact, Lubacevski continued, the government decided not to  change the constitutionally mandated 20 seats chosen by  proportional representation. The government should have  proposed, according to Lubacevski, a combination of 40-percent  proportional representation seats and 60-percent majority vote.  This would have led to the creation of 100 new districts and  solved the problem of very uneven distribution of registered  voters in each district. According to Lubacevski, this figure  varies from 6,000 to 17,000 and is one of the chief problems  among the coalition partners.    Skopje weekly PULS commentator Aleksandar Comovski, in a  feature published on 29 April, noted that the party of the  Albanian population, the Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP),  wants a 50-50 split between proportional represention and  majority-vote seats. Comovski calculated that, even with the  additional proportional representation seats, the PDP would  probably not get more than one-third of the 140 seats. Further,  he advised, the PDP should consider carefully whether  proportional representation might have negative consequences for  the PDP, such as heightening the danger of ethnic confrontation.</p>

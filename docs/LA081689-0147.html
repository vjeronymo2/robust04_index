			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ROSE FACES PROBE FOR SHOVING UMP  </P> <P> National League President Bill White is reviewing a shoving incident involving  Cincinnati Reds second baseman Ron Oester, manager Pete Rose and umpire Joe  West, a spokeswoman for White said today.  </P> <P> League spokeswoman Katy Feeney said White is gathering reports from the umpires  and will review any available videotapes of the incident, which occurred at the  end of the Reds' 12-inning 5-2 loss Tuesday night to the Chicago Cubs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decision May Take Time  </P> <P> White may not make a decision for a day or two and would only announce  suspensions, not fines, Feeney said.  </P> <P> She said White will review the incident as a separate matter and will not take  into account a probe by baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti of allegations that  Rose may have bet on baseball, including games involving the Reds.  </P> <P> If found guilty of betting on the Reds, Rose could be suspended from baseball  for life.  </P> <P> That issue is tied up in federal court, where Rose has obtained temporary  protection against discipline by Giamatti while a court considers the manager's  lawsuit challenging the commissioner's authority to judge him.  </P> <P> "Each incident is judged on its own merits. Each incident is judged  individually," Feeney said.  </P> <P> Asked when White will issue his decision, Feeney said, "There's no specific  timetable. . . . Mr. White is just getting the report from the umpires."  </P> <P> Rose's involvement in the shoving incident came 16 months after his 30-day  suspension and $10,000 fine for shoving umpire Dave Pallone.  </P> <P> The Cincinnati manager and West shoved each other Tuesday night after Rose went  to the defense of Oester, who also exchanged bumps with West. (Story in Sports  section.)  </P> <P> "You saw what they did when I pushed Pallone last year," Rose said, referring  to his punishment. "Let's see what happens now."  </P> <P> West was involved in a similar incident in 1983. The umpire was suspended for  three days and fined $300 for pushing Atlanta Braves manager Joe Torre.  </P></p>

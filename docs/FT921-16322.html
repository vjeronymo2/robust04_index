			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Market remains addicted to Wellcome magic - The Bottom Line THERE SEEMS to be something magical about the Wellcome share price. It was the best Footsie performer in 1991, has had four record highs since Christmas and is the highest rated stock among the big pharmaceutical companies. If you had invested Pounds 1,000 at the company's flotation in 1986, your holding would now be worth more than Pounds 9,000, even after the share price weakness yesterday. The sharpest gain has come since Christmas. It was triggered by evidence from research scientists that the company's Aids drug Retrovir was even more effective when used in combination with other drugs. To put icing on the cake, one of those other drugs, Zovirax, is made by Wellcome. Wellcome has been keen to play down the significance of the research findings. While the shares leapt in recent days, Wellcome described the results of the research simply as 'interesting'. Yesterday's fall in the shares was partly the result of the company's own cautious comments. Such conservatism only reinforces the City's admiration for the company. 'Wellcome does everything by the rulebook', says Jonathan de Pass of broker BZW. 'The standard of disclosure has been tremendously high. You just smell quality.' Wellcome's reputation has also been built upon bold but measured management and two strong products. The latest generation of top management is still new to the job. John Robb, the chief executive who joined in 1990 from SmithKline Beecham, is 'a strong marketing man', according to Martin Hall of securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. John Precious, the finance director, joined at the same time from Tioxide, the chemicals company owned by ICI. His presence has seen tighter money management: 'Disposals of non-core business have freed working capital and management time,' says de Pass. The two star drugs are AZT and acyclovir, better known by their trade names of Retrovir and Zovirax. One advantage they have is that they are effective against viruses. This is significant because antiviral drugs are rare. Since the discovery of penicillin, the pharmacologists have seen their greatest successes in defeating bacteria, rather than viruses. Even in 1992, dealing with everyday viral infections such as influenza is a hit and miss affair. Of the two drugs, Retrovir is the more famous. Until a few months ago, it was the only approved treatment for Aids in US. Even now that US doctors can consider another drug, DDI from US company Bristol Myers Squibb, Retrovir remains the first line of defence against the disease. Since the launch of Retrovir in 1987, share buyers have been inspired by the prospect of millions of chronic users of an expensive drug. This is what has moved the shares since Christmas. By the same token, fears that rival treatments would take Retrovir's market away have occasionally caused sharp falls in the share price. Out of the limelight Zovirax has been a much bigger contributor to Wellcome's success. While political lobbying over Aids in the US cut the price of a year's supply of Retrovir from Dollars 8,234 at launch to Dollars 2,200 (Pounds 1,208.70) now, Zovirax has faced no such pressures. The bottom line shows what this means. In the year to August 1991, Zovirax sales rose 26 per cent to Pounds 471m while Retrovir's improved only 4 per cent to Pounds 177m. Zovirax has no serious rivals and Wellcome estimates that it has more than 80 per cent of the herpes treatment market. So the rising share price trick is no sleight of hand. And it needed no flamboyant chief executive with a penchant for adventurous accounting. That said, the statistics for 1991 are slightly flattering. The shares fell in 1990 as profits failed to come up to expectations. 'So the 1991 share price performance was a recovery from a low base,' says Hall. There are also doubts over the importance of the research data released this week. 'These results are pretty inconclusive and the trials need to be followed a lot longer,' says Hall. The news received wide publicity at a quiet time of year, exaggerating the effect on the shares. 'The market has always tended to over-react to news on Wellcome,' says de Pass. The domination of the herpes and Aids niches have nevertheless taken Wellcome shares to extraordinary levels. The price/earnings ratio is 38, compared with a market average of around 14. At these dizzy heights, analysts are considering taking profits. Robin Gilbert of James Capel has been a buyer of the stock since October 1990 and is now 'inclined simply to recommend a hold'. Hall says 'it will be very difficult for Wellcome to outperform the market over the next 12 months.' The City has not lost confidence in Wellcome, but it might take some real magic to keep the share price growing quickly for another year.</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / TUC urges rise in disabled quota The Trades Union Congress yesterday urged the government to increase the minimum proportion of disabled people that companies have to employ, which is at present 3 per cent of a workforce. It said the actual average figure was 0.8 per cent for public-sector employers and 0.7 per cent for private companies, but that legal action was rarely taken to enforce the quota. It said Britain had one of the lowest percentages of disabled workers in Europe and called for laws to combat discrimination against disabled people trying to find work.</p>

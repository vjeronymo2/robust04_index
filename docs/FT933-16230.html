			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Euro retreat THE RECENT decision to put the European Community's liberalising directive on pension fund investment into bureaucratic limbo may not be the most significant retreat to date from the European ideal. But it is still important since it perpetuates a series of distortions in the EC capital markets arising from artificial restrictions on investment in different classes of assets and currencies. Coming after the turmoil in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, it appears in effect to put an end to the prospect of a single EC capital market for the foreseeable future. There is no economic logic in the decision to shunt the matter back to a working party. Portfolio theory has established beyond reasonable doubt the benefits of diversification. These are more than sufficient to off-set exchange rate risk. The political logic, in contrast, is clear. The chief beneficiary of the status quo is big government, which will retain the right, in certain countries, to finance growing budget deficits from captive institutional money at artificially low interest rates. As the practice of funding occupational pensions catches on in continental Europe to help reduce the strain on public finances of ageing populations, less of the management will find its way to efficient hands in London or Zurich. The losers are Europe's pensioners, who will receive lower returns for any given degree of risk. While rich investors exploit the freedom to invest globally that comes from the abolition of exchange controls around the Single Market, poor to middle-income people whose savings are managed by institutions will suffer relative disadvantage. Companies in countries with restrictions that push investors towards government bonds may suffer from a higher cost of capital than otherwise. Everyone loses, in the sense that the benefits to the European economy of an efficient, integrated EC capital market are being thrown away. Though the arguments appear technical, there is a wider symbolism. If the EC opts for protectionism in an area where the political cost of liberalisation is so paltry, how will it avoid a retreat into economic nationalism on larger issues? The prognosis is poor.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned that Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae  and U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry used a hotline for  about 30 minutes on the morning of 4 June to discuss  preparations to strengthen ROK-U.S. joint military rapport in  connection with the tense situation surrounding the Korean  peninsula due to the North Korean nuclear issue.    A high-ranking Defense Ministry official revealed: "It is  known that they discussed the issue from various angles on ways  to make preparations to strengthen the military rapport between  the two countries for possible provocations by North Korea if  economic sanctions are imposed." This is the first time that  the two ministers talked over the hotline, with the exception of  the test conducted when it was installed last month.</p>

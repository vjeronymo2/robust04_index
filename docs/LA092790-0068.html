			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY: ABBY'S ANSWER SHORT, SWEET AT HOSPICE TRIBUTE  </P> <P> Abigail Van Buren -- or Dear Abby, if you prefer -- is one of the few  recognized authorities who can offer precise, step-by-step instructions on how  to respond when wife-to-be No. 3 announces that your first two wives have  agreed to be her co-matrons of honor.  </P> <P> No wicket is too sticky for Dear Abby, no situation too outlandish to inspire  even a modicum of written reticence on her part -- which made it all the more  surprising that at the Saturday fund-raiser at which San Diego Hospice  presented Van Buren its 1990 Humanitarian of the Year award, Abby was nearly  speechless.  </P> <P> The hospice annually provides health care and counseling services to about  1,000 patients facing life-threating illnesses. The patient's families are also  aided. At the dinner, it was announced that the 24-bed San Diego Hospice Center  on Vauclain Point will open Feb. 14, 1991.  </P> <P> Van Buren, who attended the dinner-dance at the La Jolla Marriott with her  husband, Morton Phillips, and hospice primary benefactor Joan Kroc, may have  concluded that brevity is the soul of wit after joining the attendance of 750  in listening to a roster of speakers who took the term testimonial dinner at  full face value.  </P> <P> Testimonials flew about the ballroom until the air seemed ready to rain them on  the heads of Van Buren, Kroc, the committee, the several dozen table sponsors  and dinner chairmen Jenny and Sid Craig, who were widely credited for the  evening's record net proceeds of more than $200,000.  </P> <P> During breaks between the bouts of speechifying, guests found time to wave  forks at the chicken dinner, shake legs to the Wayne Foster Orchestra and watch  a videotaped tribute to Van Buren that included remarks by her sister and  fellow advice columnist, Ann Landers.  </P> <P> Recognized by San Diego Hospice President Holly Lorentson as a quiet but  longstanding and notably generous benefactor, Van Buren approached the podium  to accept the humanitarian award after listening to Kroc's description of her  as one who "helps those who are hurting."  </P> <P> "Abby holds America's hands, and sometimes she slaps us across the wrist when  we need it," said Kroc. "She makes us think, she makes us hope."  </P> <P> Van Buren evidently discarded whatever acceptance speech she may have written  because her impromptu remarks were freshly inspired by table mate Mercedes  McCambridge, San Diego's Academy Award-winning actress.  </P> <P> "Mercedes McCambridge said to me, 'You have been canonized tonight. So has been  Joan Kroc -- she is Joan of Arc and you are Westminster 'Abby,' "' Van Buren  reported, adding: "You are truly beautiful people. Thank you."  </P> <P> And that was that.  </P> <P> The evening started at 6 p.m. with a VIP reception at which Van Buren, wearing  a wide collar of pearls and diamonds and a simple but chic black sheath, spent  the first half-hour obliging a corps of tireless photographers. The attendance  was rich in notables, including author and hospice foundation board member  Norman Cousins and his wife, Ellen, and Palm Springs society decorator Steve  Chase, whose client list includes Kroc.  </P> <P> Sid and Jenny Craig formally received the guests and said they became involved  with San Diego Hospice after attending the 1989 testimonial dinner, at which  retired U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was granted the humanitarian  award.  </P> <P> "We were so impressed by the event and by the people honored that we had to  become involved," said Jenny Craig. "Once we saw the level of commitment at  which these people at hospice work to get things done, we became emotionally  involved."  </P> <P> Kroc, whose multimillion-dollar gift underwrote the construction of the hospice  center, also shared in the evening's lavish distribution of praise.  </P> <P> "The formal opening ceremonies for the center appropriately will be on  Valentine's Day, and Joan Kroc made it all possible," Jenny Craig said to  fervent applause. "As a woman, I am extremely proud of Joan Kroc because she  has risen to the role she plays in business today without a lot of role models  to guide her. The young women of San Diego today are fortunate to have Joan as  their role model."  </P> <P> Banker and dinner treasurer Bob Adelizzi and his wife, Tommi, headed a guest  list that included Linda Smith, Freddie and Robert Driver, Sue and Charles  Edwards, Sally and John Thornton, Julie and Mark LeDoux, Luba Johnston, Cecil  Green, Karen and Jonathan McIntyre, Charles Feurzeig, Marge and Paul Palmer,  Audrey Geisel, Emily Peagler and Mike O'Hara, Betsy and Doug Manchester, Junko  and Larry Cushman, Marie and Dean Dunphy, Katy and Mike Dessent and Penny and  Mike Wilkes.  </P> <P> RANCHO SANTA FE -- In this bucolic community, the arrival of Labor Day  announces not only autumn's approach but the imminent re-enactment of a one-day  siege that for 36 years has seen 2,000 women and a few men descend upon the  lawns of the Inn at Rancho Santa Fe for an afternoon of energetic box-lunching  and fashion-watching.  </P> <P> This year, the annual "Appearance of Autumn" event -- sponsored by the  countywide The Country Friends philanthropic organization and consistently the  largest outdoor fashion show staged in the United States -- washed over Rancho  Santa Fe on Sept. 18. In its wake, it left 10 proud couples and net earnings of  more than $50,000. The proceeds will be combined with other Country Friends  funds and divided among numerous social service agencies, including the  Alzheimer Family Center, the Home of Guiding Hands, Vista Community Center and  Lifeline Community Services of North San Diego County.  </P> <P> Nordstrom department store presented a show titled "Fall by Design," which  included fashions by such top designers as Missoni, Louis Feraud, Donna Karan  and Giorgio Armani.  </P> <P> Country Friends President Jean Newman called it "just dumb luck" that the day  followed the breezy pattern nature normally grants the event, but the tradition  continued, and as always the eucalyptus leaves cast paisley patterns over the  women seated on each side of the lengthy runway.  </P> <P> An opening segment traditionally honors noted volunteers and philanthropists;  chairman Bess Lambron amended that tradition to honor couples instead. By  chance, most of the men wore blue suits, while Nordstrom outfitted their wives.  Betty and Alex DeBakcsy were first down the ramp, followed by Martha and George  Gafford, Alison and George Gildred, Alyson and George Goudy, Ingrid and Joe  Hibben, Virginia and Jack Monday, Rita and Josiah Neeper, Shirley (who died the  next Sunday after a 14-year battle against cancer) and David Rubel, Elsie and  Frank Weston and Betty and Burnet F. Wohlford.  </P> <P> Key members among the sizable committee were Mili Atchison, Laurie Peters,  Marilyn Dailey, Lynn Adkison, Flo Bible, La Verne Briggs, Nan Werner, Jeanne  McMullin, Pat Irvine, Peggy Matthews, Mary Ann Fitch, Valerie Weaver and Pat  Wood.  </P></p>

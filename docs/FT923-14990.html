			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: Braniff decides to call it a day BRANIFF International Airlines, a small US airline that last year filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law, said yesterday it had ceased all operations, including all regularly scheduled flight service. The privately held Texas-based airline, which did not reveal any of its operating figures, assets or liabilities, attributed the shutdown to the US fare wars that resulted in ticket prices which undercut Braniff's fares and caused substantially lower yields. Braniff also said 'a substantial amount' of summer airline traffic, normally a high volume period, was diverted to the major carriers. Braniff said it was unable to meet its current obligations because the reduced prices available at the bigger airlines, together with the loss of passenger traffic, had negatively affected its cash flow. The company added it was considering legal action over the pricing practices which led to its halt in trading. Passengers holding Braniff tickets were advised to contact other airlines to see if the tickets would be accepted. The present incarnation of Braniff was formed in 1989 when the original Braniff Inc went bankrupt and two property developers - Mr Jeffrey Chodorow and Mr Arthur Cohen - paid Dollars 313,000 for the Braniff name and operating manuals. The investors then bought Emerald Air, another bankrupt airline, and changed its name to Braniff.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Tunnel prompts Stena to simplify ferry fares Competition on cross-Channel ferry routes will intensify today when Stena Sealink announces a simplified fare structure modelled on the format adopted by Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, which is due to open in May. Stena, which on Monday said it would wait until the official announcement of Eurotunnel's tariffs next week, will today unveil its 1994 fare structure. A standard return for a car and five passengers on the Dover-Calais route will start at Pounds 126 rising to Pounds 220 in the peak season. 'The company is scrapping the traditional industry system of price bands linked to sailing times in favour of a new simplified fares structure,' it will tell travel agents at a presentation in London today. 'The old system was a way of fine-tuning our prices which had its merits but it required a degree in statistical analysis to understand,' Stena says. In future there is to be one price per day within four seasonal bands and supplements for peak weekend travel. Ending the complicated tariffs will make it easier for travel agents to sell tickets, the company says. The standard return fare on the Dover-Calais route will be Pounds 126 between January and March, Pounds 188 from March to July, Pounds 220 from July to September and Pounds 188 between September and December. This represents an increase of 'a couple of per cent overall' on the 1993 fares, it says. Similar increases will be made on all of its seven routes to the Continent and Ireland. Stena says it does not intend to enter into a price war with Eurotunnel or the other ferry operators. Eurotunnel might be able to charge a premium for speed but it could not match ferry operators such as Stena with Pounds 60m vessels offering a choice of restaurants and other facilities. Eurotunnel is due to announce tariffs next Tuesday. It is expected to offer return tickets of between Pounds 160 and Pounds 220 to Pounds 260 in the summer, with premiums for busy weekends. P&amp;O European Ferries said it would wait until Eurotunnel's formal announcement before revealing its 1994 tariffs. Eurotunnel funding, Page 16</p>

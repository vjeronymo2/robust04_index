			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Cook's tour keeps to tight industrial schedule: Michael Cassell joins the shadow trade and industry secretary as he considers how Labour might rebuild the manufacturing base 'GET SOME breakfast while you can,' Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry spokesman, warns his personal assistant as he spoons out the grapefruit. It is 7.45am and breakfast is in the 700-year-old Maid's Head Hotel in Norwich. To prepare for the 15-hour day ahead, Mr Cook has already ingested endless facts and figures, but the outlook for food is very uncertain. Labour's man - accompanied by Mrs Gaynor Reagan, his discreet Westminster assistant, and Mr Daniel Zeichner, the chatty driver of a politically incorrect, but immensely comfortable, BMW luxury saloon - is on the latest leg of his mission. The objective is to take national soundings on the party's efforts to build a consensus between a future Labour government and industry which can rebuild Britain's manufacturing base. But hasn't Labour missed the boat? Everyone knows manufacturing industry is again high on the political agenda. 'It's our bloody boat,' Mr Cook insists. 'We've been banging away since 1979, saying manufacturing matters.' Mr Cook gives some credit to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, for recent changes at a department marginalised and demotivated during the 1980s, but adds that the DTI budget ranks alongside that of national heritage. 'I could inherit the DTI budget at precisely the point it completely disappears,' he chuckles. On this day, the Robin Cook roadshow is in Norwich and Cambridge. Behind him lie Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Plymouth; ahead are Newcastle upon Tyne and Sheffield. Labour trade and industry spokesmen traditionally enjoy a miserable life, lured into the boardrooms of British industry to be politely entertained and peremptorily dismissed. When Mr Gordon Brown did the job, one wholly unimpressed host later put his guest's picture through the office shredder. This time, the party has not waited for invitations. Mr Cook has arranged his own meetings. He has also set his own agenda for discussion in the shape of a consultative paper launched in April. The emerging industrial strategy will go to next year's Labour conference. The document painstakingly resists the urge to claim the government knows best, but hints heavily that it is perfectly entitled to tilt the tiller. It includes a shake-up of corporate governance involving two-tier boards with worker directors. There are also carrot-and-stick fiscal policies to replace decades of footloose corporate ownership with a commitment to longer-term equity ownership. Labour, tiptoeing into a minefield, also envisages a role for building societies and pension funds in mobilising savings to help industry. Mr Cook accepts that finding an acceptable way is 'a tough one'; he doesn't sound as though he is anywhere near the answer. There are plans for a network of regional development agencies - possibly raising investment funds through bond issues - to devolve decision-making. Labour also expects the financial community to decentralise in the same way. Mr Cook's breakfast guests, drawn from the Norfolk and Waveney chamber of commerce and industry, have read the document. The meeting starts well; there is no dispute over the need to revive manufacturing. Mr Phil Scott, a Norwich Union general manager, says short-termism among funding institutions is the biggest headache for small companies. Labour must help them. Mr Cook concedes that politicians, too, are short-term creatures. Mr Richard Holroyd, managing director of Colmans, the mustard maker, says the real problem is not finance, but poor manufacturing performance. 'Our plant is not as efficient and our education and skills are poor. You underestimate the problem.' Mr Cook mentions a levy to persuade reluctant companies to invest in training. No one dissents. Old sores are exposed when Mr Geoffrey Copeman, chairman of Eastern Counties Newspapers, warns Labour not to undo trade union reforms: 'Life is different; life is better. Europe may lean on the hands of the clock to turn it back.' Mr Cook is deeply conciliatory: 'The best way ahead is to build co-operation.' Mr Scott chips in again: 'As for two-tier boards, they simply mean more democracy. Sorry, I mean more bureaucracy.' Everyone enjoys the Freudian slip but Mr Cook appears to abandon a highly controversial proposal: 'I don't think you will see a supervisory board policy adopted.' But, he adds: 'There's no point in electing more non-executives if they just enjoy the patronage of the executive directors.' His remarks go down like lumpy porridge. Breakfast over, next stop is the old Start-Rite shoe factory in the city, spiced with the smell of German cow hide and occupied by lines of women seated at ancient Singer sowing machines. The tannoy plays Madonna where once it would have been Vera Lynn. In the boardroom, the directors complain of unfair tariff barriers and call for a level playing field as Mr Cook tucks into the oatmeal biscuits. Mrs Reagan, his personal assistant, hungrily eyes the plate. More capital allowances would also be welcome, though Mr Cook doubts their value. How can he be sure the investment would not have taken place anyway? Later, on the journey to the officers' mess at RAF Duxford, near Cambridge, he says he favours a better-targeted grant system to encourage capital investment. There has been no time for lunch. To a backdrop of painted second world war battle scenes, Mr Cook begins the afternoon with the Confederation of British Industry's eastern region. Mrs Reagan has by now secured a Belgian biscuit. Mr Bruce Warman, regional chairman, warns Mr Cook not to model his manufacturing strategy on the Germans: 'They are overpaid, underworked and weighed down by social costs. I wouldn't swap our problems for Germany's' Mr Harry Faure Walker, Barclays Bank regional director, tells Mr Cook that the financial community is best placed to decide how to lend money. Outside direction might lead to heavy losses. Mr Cook grins and suggests Barclays may, indeed, need little outside help in that direction. The CBI team, he reflects afterwards, is a mite too complacent. By now squeezed into a small Ford, the group moves on to St John's Innovation Centre, a nursery for fledgling high-tech companies in Cambridge. There is a good debate with 40 entrepreneurs on the small-business sector. Newcastle next stop. The following day will begin at breakfast with the local CBI and a trip to Nissan. Mrs Reagan hopes there will be a dining car on the night train.</p>

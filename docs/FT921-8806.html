			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / International Company News: Toyota profits plunge 30% in first half PRE-TAX profits at Toyota Motor, Japan's biggest vehicle manufacturer, plunged by 30 per cent to Y208.9bn (Dollars 1.6bn) in the first half to the end of December. The poor results for one of Japan's strongest manufacturing companies is a reflection of difficult conditions facing a broad range of companies. Sluggish domestic demand has led to increased competition, rising marketing costs and slimmer profits, while the rise in the value of the yen against foreign currencies has bitten deeply into the value of exports. Toyota said that the stronger yen cost the company Y50bn during the period, while increased wages accounted for another Y20bn of increased expenses. The company was also hit by rising depreciation, accounting for Y40bn and increased marketing and administrative costs. Sales during the period rose by 1.6 per cent to Y4,434.6bn on an unconsolidated basis in spite of a 1.2 per cent decline in unit vehicle sales to 2.06m. At the operating level, profits plummeted by 61.6 per cent to Y77bn, with increased non-operating financial income and extraordinary items lifting profits at the pre-tax level. Japan was plainly Toyota's most difficult market during the period, with sales off by 4.6 per cent to 1.2m units. Exports none the less rose from 825,229 vehicles to 857,538. The buoyancy of exports was accounted for by strong demand from South America and the Middle East, while sales to the US declined. Sales of industrial vehicles fell by 6.9 per cent to 29,683 units. Toyota said that the recent declines in interest rates, which it expected to continue, were likely to lead to a recovery of demand in Japan in the second half of the year, although it was pessimistic about the global market. Exchange rate movements would continue to cost the company money. Earnings after tax came to Y103.6bn, a decline of 33.7 per cent. Toyota said it expected net earnings for the full fiscal year to reach Y200bn, compared with Y329.6 last year. Capital spending in the current fiscal year, including plant construction in Hokkaido and Kyushu, was budgeted at Y565bn, compared with Y641.9bn last year. The company said this level of capital spending would not be maintained as plants under construction were nearing completion.</p>

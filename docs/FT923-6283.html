			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Turkish municipality given BBB debt rating THE Greater Ankara Municipality has been assigned an implied long-term debt rating of BBB by Standard &amp; Poor's, opening the way for the Turkish municipality to borrow in the international capital markets. Ankara has previously issued private placements in the German and Japanese markets, but has not yet launched public bonds. The move is part of a broader trend for the decentralisation of funding, which is likely to lead other municipalities, in Turkey and elsewhere, to seek ratings in order to gain access to international markets. For example, S&amp;P, the US rating agency, is in discussions with several Spanish municipalities over potential debt ratings. In the last few months, both Barcelona and Madrid have issued debt in the Japanese market, and Seville is expected to follow suit. 'Ankara's investment grade rating will clearly enhance its access to international markets,' said Mr Charles Hulac, a manager in the corporate credits department of Nomura International. The implied rating is the same as for the Republic of Turkey, based on support provided to the city by the central government, the state's active involvement in monitoring Ankara's borrowing and investment programmes, the health and stability of the city's economy and its solid financial performance over the past several years. In the past, Turkish municipalities have been funded largely by transfers from central government. However, the large costs of much-needed improvements to infrastructure in cities such as Ankara has encouraged a diversification of financing sources. 'An ambitious infrastructure development programme, including a subway and light rail system and various urban renewal projects, will increase the city's debt burden during the next few years,' S&amp;P said.</p>

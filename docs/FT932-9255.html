			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / GrandMet helped by devaluation A BOOST of Pounds 29m from sterling's devaluation helped lift first-half pre-tax profits of Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, from Pounds 394m to Pounds 416m, a rise of 5.6 per cent. At level exchange rates, profits would have declined 1.8 per cent. GrandMet's shares lost 11p to close at 422p. Currency translation of dollar-denominated debt also added Pounds 676m to the group's net borrowings which rose to Pounds 3.16m, increasing gearing from 70 per cent to 82 per cent. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive, said trading had remained challenging and the pace of recovery in key markets remained difficult to predict. 'We expect the US and UK to continue to improve gradually; but we believe the continental European markets will increasingly be affected by recession throughout 1993.' Earnings per share for the six months to March 31 improved 3 per cent to 13.4p; the interim dividend is up 5.4 per cent to 4.85p. The North American food business reported profits of Pounds 126m, 5 per cent ahead in sterling but 10 per cent lower in local currency. Dollar profits of the US Green Giant vegetable business were halved as the industry continued to work through the surplus produced last summer and the market remained 'extremely soft and competitive'. The group is expanding into the fresh produce market with sales of Green Giant vegetables of more than Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m). Operating profit from European food operations, affected by marketing investments in Haagen-Dazs ice-cream and Pillsbury dough, as well as deteriorating market conditions, fell from Pounds 4m to Pounds 1m. IDV, the drinks division, contributed profits of Pounds 268m, 4 per cent ahead in local currency. The group strengthened its market share in North America where profits rose from Pounds 77m to Pounds 92m. On the retailing side, Burger King moved profits 13 per cent up to Pounds 63m. In the UK, the Chef &amp; Brewer managed pubs and GrandMet Estates, the property division, raised profits 8 per cent to Pounds 28m though pub volumes were lower. GrandMet, which included a Pounds 6m trading loss from the Inntrepreneur pubs joint venture with Courage in its accounts, announced that, subject to revaluation, it will have to inject a further Pounds 65m into the company in October to comply with banking covenants.

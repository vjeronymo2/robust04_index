			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Bonn has reacted with satisfaction to  the intention of Brazil and Argentina to have their nuclear  facilities regularly inspected by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna in the future. On Wednesday [30  March], well-informed circles referred to Germany's immediate  interest, in view of scientific-technical cooperation with both  countries in the field of the peaceful use of nuclear energy.    Peter Kurt Wuerzbach, disarmament policy spokesman of the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]  Bundestag Group, talked of a further important step to  strengthen nuclear nonproliferation. Moreover, according to his  information, Argentina, which, like Brazil, has not acceded to  the Nonproliferation Treaty so far, announced that it wants to  accede to the treaty.    Precisely against the background of the topical discussion  on  access to the nuclear facilities in North Korea, the CDU/CSU  Bundestag Group regards this development as significant progress  and an important contribution to stabilization and  confidence-building in the region, the politician stressed.  IAEA spokesman David Kyd had announced in HANNOVERSCHE  ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG that the control agreement with Brazil and  Argentina will come into force in late spring and the first  inspections can take place in the middle of the year.    Above all German-Brazilian cooperation in the nuclear  sector,  which was initiated in the seventies, continues to be  controversial. The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  repeatedly called for its abandonment because it feared that  Brazil might work on the military use of nuclear power. This  was repeatedly denied by the Federal Government. Originally,  the German power plant builder Siemens-KWU [Kraftwerksunion] was  supposed to build eight nuclear plants in the country. So far,  the first plant "Angra II," whose construction was started as  early as in 1976, has not yet been completed because of domestic  policy problems. The enterprise supplied the power plant  "Atucha" to Argentina.</p>

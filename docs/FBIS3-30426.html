			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] In an article titled "Saber Rattling  While Talking Peace," published on page 10 of the 23 January  1994 issue of Zagreb NEDJELJNI VJESNIK, the paper's military  analyst, Fran Visnar, writes that Serbia has recently delivered  new arms and equipment to the "Krajinas" to replace materiel  "Serb rebels" lost during the war in Croatia in 1992-93 and in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serbs did not even bother to camouflage  tanks, guns, vehicles, and containers of ammunition loaded on  trucks and railway cars sent to the Bosnian Serb Army, Visnar  reports. All convoys for Baranja in eastern Croatia were  escorted by military and police personnel of the so-called  republic of Serbian Krajina, while transports bound for Bosnia  were handled by military and police personnel of the so-called  Srpska republic. Visnar believes that with the establishment of  political relations with Herceg-Bosna and its army the Serbs  have relieved the major burden on their forces, which will now  probably feel free to "step up their attacks against the Muslim  enclaves in eastern and central Bosnia." They might, he writes,  launch their biggest military operations: "a combined  motorized-infantry and airborne assault on Tuzla" and "a  prolonged artillery and missile at tack" on the Muslim  stronghold of Zenica. As evidence of Serbian military  objectives, Visnar cites data on "huge supplies" of  sophisticated weapons sent to Serb-controlled Bosnia before the  latest round of peace talks in Geneva on 18 January as well as  the injection of Serb "elite units" to finish off the  Bosnian-Herzegovina Army. Units of the 72d and 63d airborne  brigades from Pancevo (Serbia) and the 63d airborne brigade from  Nis (Serbia) -- components of the Special Forces Corps within  the 3d Serbian Army -- were relocated to Bijeljina in Bosnia-  Herzegovina, ostensibly for "maneuvers." Both brigades, Visnar  points out, consist of professional personnel, 95 percent of  whom are veterans of combat in Slovenia, Croatia, and  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Their objective, Visnar states, is to take  the Dubrava airfield near Tuzla to prevent UNPROFOR from  reopening it and to "cleanse" the area of Muslims. He is  convinced that to succeed the Serbs are prepared to endure even  "a limited NATO air raid or air bombardment for a period of  time." Visnar sees Belgrade as counting on Croatian support,  since Croatia fears that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, supplied  through the Tuzla airport, would turn against the Croats in  central Bosnia.    Despite a professed desire for normalization of relations  between Serbia and Croatia, the VJESNIK article warns, the  "Krajinas" are not defeated, and Milosevic's satellite state in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has a strong army ready to protect its  "weaker" brothers in Croatia and to fight the Bosnian Muslims.  The article includes photographs of what it identifies as  Serbian arms and equipment: 90- and 120-mm bazookas, SA-341  Gazelle attack helicopters, and T-54, T-55, and M-84A tanks, as  well as a detailed description of the Dubrava airfield.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Popov report: "The Federal Counterintelligence </F> Service Changes Premises"]    [Text] As your correspondent has learned from an informed  source, the nation's pride -- the Federal Counterintelligence  Service [FCS] -- is changing its "haunts." Its Material and  Technical Department, hitherto located at the metropolitan Pekin  Hotel, seems to have been plagued by...cockroaches, mice, and  other rodents which have proliferated in great numbers. The FCS  is no less concerned about the deplorable physical condition of  the "guest house:" In many places the peeling plaster threatens  to fall right onto one's head. Aware of their responsibility  for the Motherland, the management of the famous hotel decided  to close down for a major renovation and sanitation cleaning.  Therefore the FCS had to look for a new place.    This time the intelligence people took a liking to the Mir  hotel [across from the U.S. Embassy] where not an extra speck of  dust can be found, let alone cockroaches! The conclusion of a  secret 10-year leasing agreement is in the final stages, whereby  the FCS Material and Technical Department will have eight floors  in the Mir -- from the fourth to the 11th.</p>

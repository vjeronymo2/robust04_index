			<p>CSO     [Text] Jakarta, KOMPAS--President Suharto explained that  there are four issues that must get greater attention now at the  beginning of PJP II [Second Long-Term Development], namely the  effective use of civilian government employees, regional  autonomy of second-level regions, public services, and  application of modern management.    "Only in this way will the wheels of government turn more  smoothly and development move more quickly," the chief of state  said Wednesday, 20 April, as he opened the 1994 National  Coordination Conference (RAKORNAS) on Effectiveness of the State  Apparatus at the State Palace in Jakarta.    Yesterday's program was also attended by Coordinating  Minister of Public Welfare Azwar Anas, Minister of  Administrative Reform T.B. Silalahi, Minister of State for the  Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, Minister of Justice Oetojo  Oesman, Minister of State for Agrarian Affairs/Chief of the BPN  [National Agriculture Board] Soni Harsono, and Minister of State  for Women's Affairs Mien Sugandhi. The RAKORNAS, which is to  last three days, is being attended by 250 people. They consist  of secretary generals, secretaries to coordinating ministers,  secretaries to ministers of state, secretaries of regional  office affairs, deputies for administration, and chief of  bureaus for organization, administration, and personnel.    In that connection, President Suharto also underlined the  coordination conference theme, which relates to the  strengthening of discipline in the apparatus and improvement of  service to the public. According to the chief of state, public  services and discipline in the apparatus are two very important  elements in the administration of government and development. A  high level of discipline in the apparatus will raise the quality  of management of governmental administration, and good quality  of service will expand development opportunities for the people.    Therefore, the president said he hoped that this meeting on  effectiveness of the state apparatus will formulate operational  actions for improving discipline in the state apparatus and  improving the quality of service to the public.    He also explained that the autonomy of second-level regions  is an important part of efforts to expand public creativity and  initiative, which are the key to the success of development  during this takeoff era. "Therefore, all the issues related to  the implementation of granting more extensive autonomy to  second-level regions must receive maximum attention," the  president said.    Since 1974, he said, the government has made preparations  for  emphasizing the autonomy of second-level regions. On many  occasions, the president has also asked that all echelons of the  apparatus make preparations to create in second-level regions a  regional autonomy that is tangible, dynamic, harmonious, and  responsible.    "Government regulations on government in the regions have  also been prepared. In this coordination conference, I ask that  all issues related to this implementation of autonomy receive  maximum attention," the president said.    As for modern management, the chief of state also pointed  out  that when he formed the Sixth Development Cabinet he stressed  the need for modern management to support the implementation of  PJP II. Such modern management, the president said, needs to be  applied at the planning, implementation, and supervision stages.  "This modern management needs to be detailed, analyzed, taught,  and applied according to its principles in all government work  units and offices," the president said.  <H5>  Civilian Employee Education and Training </H5>   President Suharto also said that in the implementation of  development up to now, the government has constantly tried to  promote the career development of civilian government employees.  The chief of state said he still sees some aspects of career  development that need to be improved, however, particularly in  the areas of employee education and training.    The career of a civilian employee begins when the employee  is  accepted as a candidate employee. Because candidate employees  come from a variety of sources, the process of teaching them and  introducing them to the administration of government and  development is intensive, he said.    "What we have been doing, namely using the apprentice  method,  appears not to produce optimal results. Therefore, as a part of  the selection process, candidate employees in the future must  also receive mental and disciplinary preparation in their prejob  training," the president said.    The president also added that subjects taught, promotion  procedures, and the quality of lecturers must also be improved  so that civilian government employees will be truly ready to  take up their increasingly heavy and complex duties.    The president also instructed that other aspects of career  development be studied very thoroughly. These include employee  performance appraisal forms, selections for appointments, and  transfers. Why? The president said, "Future duties require  better quality government employees who possess professional  capabilities, are full of enthusiasm to serve, and have high  levels of discipline."</p>

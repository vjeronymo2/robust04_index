			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Dutch equities hope for year-end recovery - But this is dependent on a further easing in interest rates After getting off to a healthy start early this year, the Amsterdam stock exchange is limping into the summer with little prospect of short-term recovery and every expectation that things will probably get worse before they get better. Amsterdam's recent loss of steam is a sharp contrast to the first four months of this year, when the market gained 12 per cent under the combined influence of the lower trend in interest rates, the higher value of the dollar and the hesitant emergence of recovery in the US economy. The gains were concentrated mainly in traditional defensive sectors such as the publishing and food industries, as well as in banks and insurers. 'The rally was fed entirely by a stronger than expected recovery in the US economy and a sharp drop in interest rates,' says Mr Jacques Potuijt, director of research at Deutsche Bank-de Bary in Amsterdam. 'What we need now are better fundamentals such as improved profit expectations.' However, the profit outlook is not expected to brighten until later this year, ahead of a predicted economic upturn in 1994, meaning that the bourse is likely to remain lacklustre until September. To make matters worse, the outlook for the economy is deteriorating, although a deep recession like Germany's does not seem a likely prospect for the moment. All in all, most analysts predict that the bourse will face a difficult summer at best before seeing an improvement around the fourth quarter. Mr Potuijt believes that, by the year-end, the CBS General index will stand at around 235, a further improvement compared with the all-time high of 223.5 reached on April 19. The index ended yesterday at 219.4, while the CBS Tendency index closed at 105.7, up 10.6 per cent on the year to date. Mr Thibaud de Guerre, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Amsterdam, believes that the timing of the bourse's next rise is heavily dependent on further cuts in interest rates. 'The problem for the next three months is that the bourse has already discounted the interest rate decline, and companies across Europe are issuing negative and alarming reports, especially in cyclical businesses,' he says. Unfortunately, the cut in interest rates already discounted hardly looks imminent if the Bundesbank's recent cautionary statements are to be believed, he adds. The decline in interest rates, when it comes, should release liquidity from bond funds and from investors' saving deposits, providing an impetus for the stock market later this year. Overall, Mr de Guerre believes that the EOE index of the 25 most actively traded shares could fall to between 290 to 295 from yesterday's 309, before returning to 320 to 325 by the year-end. The release of half-year figures in August is unlikely to provide an immediate spur for share prices, and the figures are expected to underline the difficult trading conditions faced by many companies. Last week, for example, KLM reported a Fl 562m loss in 1992/93, highlighting the malaise in cyclical sectors such as aviation. The airline's shares rose briefly on relief that the losses were not worse, but they have since fallen back, closing yesterday at Fl 26.10, barely higher than the level before the release of the figures. The uncertainty about economic prospects means that it is still too early to expect a recovery in the prices of strongly cyclical companies such as KLM, the transport group, Nedlloyd, or the steel producer Hoogovens, because they will all be vulnerable if economic resurgence does not take place in 1994 as predicted. However, Mr de Guerre recommends investing later this year in 'solid cyclicals' - financially strong companies such as the storage and transport group Pakhoed, and Akzo. This list also includes HBG and other construction groups, reflecting the benefits expected to flow from increased infrastructural spending in the Netherlands, UK and France, as well as from higher international dredging activity.</p>

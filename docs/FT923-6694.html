			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Administrators in at Moran Holdings Shares in Moran Holdings, the tea producer, freight forwarder and property developer, were suspended at 133p last night as the group was put into administration under the Insolvency Act. Mr Ian McIsaac and Mr Tony Houghton of Touche Ross are to be appointed as administrators. Moran Tea Company, a 74 per cent controlled subsidiary listed on the Calcutta Stock Exchange, and the wholly-owned freight forwarding interests in the UK are trading profitably and are excluded from the administration which will cover the holding company. This has been made insolvent by the property side. The group's main property arm, which is developing the Piccadilly Village development in Manchester, is 'solvent though in need of shareholder support', according to Mr Colin Gordon-Smith, Moran chairman until three weeks ago and now a non-executive.</p>

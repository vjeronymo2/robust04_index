			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 6 June (MTI) -- Peter Boross, prime  minister of the outgoing government, held talks with Alliance of  Free Democrats (SZDSZ) Chairman Ivan Peto and acting SZDSZ  parliamentary faction leader Gabor Kuncze. In the May general  elections, the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum garnered 9.59  percent of the vote and the opposition SZDSZ, 18.14 percent.  The SZDSZ is expected to enter into a coalition with the  victorious Socialist Party, who received 54.15 percent.    Boross briefed Peto and Kuncze on what kind of information  he  is to provide the next cabinet when handing over governmental  affairs, and what measures he deems necessary for a smooth  change in government during the remainder of the year.    Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Kuncze said that  Boross had listed tasks arising from the transfer of government,  outlined affairs involving state guarantees, and discussed  privatization. Both sides agreed on a need for changing the  previous relationship between ruling parties and the opposition,  Kuncze said.    Boross asked for the SZDSZ's opinion on the possibility of  Gyorgy Szabad staying on as speaker of parliament. Peto told  the press that his party holds the idea to be improper, because  in their view the agreement reached after the 1990 elections,  that the strongest ruling party is to name a speaker of  parliament, should be applied again this time.    Regarding the coalition talks beginning on Tuesday [7 June]  between the the Socialists and the Free Democrats, Peto said  they would probably discuss technical matters and select topics  for future negotiations. The SZDSZ chairman presumed that it  would take at least three years [as received] to formulate a  joint position on the most important questions.</p>

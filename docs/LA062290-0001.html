			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SO WHO'S LAUGHING NOW?;  </P> <P> * HARD-LINERS WIN, PEACE LOSES WITH BUSH'S UNAVOIDABLE PLO CALL  </P> <P> Only the hard-liners in the Middle East can be happy right now. No doubt  President Bush's decision to suspend talks with the Palestine Liberation  Organization fills many of them with the wicked glee that comes from observing  mindless destruction.  </P> <P> It's true that the limp peace process orchestrated by Washington wasn't getting  far: 18 months of desultory chats, mainly for show, between the American  ambassador in Tunis and a PLO representative, combined with bitter wrangling  between Washington and Jerusalem and unapologetic foot-dragging from Prime  Minister Yitzhak Shamir.  </P> <P> But now the risk is that the tension will intensify and the region will slide  toward war. This is why low-level talks with the PLO were better than no talks  at all.  </P> <P> But when PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat could not bring himself to repudiate the  unsuccessful terrorist raid on an Israeli beach last month, engineered by  poisonous anti-American PLO hard-liners, President Bush made the inescapable  call -- while couching it in the least dire terms. By selecting suspension  rather than flat cancellation he pointedly left open to Arafat the option of  condemning the raid and disciplining the PLO perpetrators within his own  executive council in order to re-start talks with Washington.  </P> <P> The Palestinians have from the Bush Administration a serious commitment to a  peace process in which they would be wholly included, and in which the Israelis  would not be permitted to call every major shot. Arafat &amp; Co. are not  likely to get a better deck of cards to play with from Washington than they are  getting from Bush and his secretary of state.  </P> <P> Turning now against PLO Executive Committee member and terrorist Abul Abbas  will not be easy for Arafat and his allies. But this is the only way out of the  corner that the PLO painted itself into when it originally agreed to talks on  condition that it renounce terrorism -- and 18 months later failed to deliver  on its part of the deal.  </P></p>

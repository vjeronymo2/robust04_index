			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / World Trade News: Swedish law on foreign investment attacked SWEDEN was urged yesterday to smooth the path for foreign companies wishing to invest in the country. Sir Brian Corby, president of the Confederation of British Industry, made the point at a UK-Sweden trade meeting. He said if Sweden wanted to join the European Community, it must make it easier for foreign companies to invest in the country. Sir Brian directed his criticism at company laws, which he claimed did much to discourage foreign investment. He said British companies regarded Sweden as a'hostile environment for foreign investors' because they were unable to hold more than 40 per cent of the equity and 20 per cent of the voting rights in a Swedish-owned company without securing the Swedish government's approval. Last year there were no UK company acquisitions in Sweden at all and only five in 1989 worth together a mere Pounds 5m . This contrasts with Sweden's acquisition of 25 UK companies last year and 18 in 1989 worth Pounds 2.945bn. The ruling Social Democrats are expected to announce a reform of Sweden's company laws within the next few weeks, but it remains uncertain whether the changes proposed will meet Sir Brian's criticisms.</p>

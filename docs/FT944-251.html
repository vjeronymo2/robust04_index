			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Management: Big ideas and big books - The FT canvassed businessmen, consultants and academics for their thoughts on two questions Percy Barnevik, president and CEO of ABB Asea Brown Boveri. Big idea: Managers need to break their organisations out of the narrow confines of national borders if they want to tap the opportunities for freer global and regional trade opened in 1994 - such as the Gatt agreement, Nafta, an expanded European Union and progress in the Asia-Pacific region. This requires not only global management but also regional management with full decision-making responsibility for total operations and product supply in, for example, eastern and western Europe combined. Reading: The Endangered American Dream by Edward N Luttwak (published by Simon &amp; Schuster). Luttwak has a lot of insight and is provocative. Having seen the end of the European 'welfare state', the collapse of communism and the slowing of the Japanese economic engine, you wonder after reading this book where the world's one remaining superpower really is heading long term. While you may not agree with all of his descriptions and recipes for change - reforms to public education, taxation and industrial policy, and unprecedented trade liberalisation - he gives you reason to think. The author's humour and hands-on style also make it easy to read. David Simon, group chief executive and deputy chairman, British Petroleum. Big idea: Listen. Advice in short, punchy statements rarely seems to stick; maybe people need their advice wrapped in academic paper. But a friend sent me a simple card once: 'Listen first, think next and act after.' To that I would add - look around you at other businesses as you listen to people in yours. A continuous benchmark process, maybe? Reading: Changing the Role of Top Management: Beyond Strategy to Purpose by Christopher A Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal (Harvard Business Review, November-December 1994). Why? Because it reinforced many conversations with friends in BP about our own path to performance. If vision seems like a little luxury - try purpose. Once you have it, how to make it happen? Try process. Who? You and yours - try people. Professor Gary Hamel, professor of strategic and international management, London Business School. Big idea: 1995 should be the year of the 'numerator'. In the quest for higher productivity, companies must focus relatively more on growing revenue (the numerator in most financial ratios) and less on cutting headcount and investment (the denominators). Today employees are often told, if you don't get more efficient you'll lose your job. Yet workers know that if they become more efficient, they'll still lose their jobs unless there is top-line growth. Sitting atop the highest unemployment rates in the developed world, growth must become the overwhelming obsession of Europe's senior executives. And don't whine about short-term investors or a lack of risk capital. Swatch, Nokia, Virgin Atlantic and International Service Systems have all proven that it is imagination, far more than capital, that powers growth. Reading: Great companies fail when there is no way of mounting a successful assault on the out-of-date beliefs, assumptions and prejudices of top management. Perversely, the responsibility for crafting strategy typically rests with the corporate 'politburo', whose intellectual equity is invested more in the past than in the future. If it is to be of any use, strategy-making must be a subversive activity. Hence my enthusiasm for The First Dissident by William Safire (Random House), a contemporary study on the Book of Job. If Job could challenge God's fairness, and live to tell the tale, how much more hope for those seeking to challenge the far less awesome interests that defend corporate orthodoxy. Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of business administration, Harvard Business School. Big idea: The best 'big' idea is to look for lots of small ideas, some of which will prove to be the breakthrough new idea that helps the business leap in new directions. Put innovation back into the centre of the business; in too many companies it has been displaced by internally-focused and rigidly controlled quality and re-engineering programmes. Stimulate creativity at all levels. Hold regular brainstorming sessions about new ways to do things. Let a thousand small flowers of experimentation bloom. Reading: A toss-up between Truman by David McCullough and No Ordinary Time by Doris Kearns Goodwin about Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. These penetrating works of political biography show national leaders successfully mastering mega-challenges of historical proportions. You see them make tough decisions, invent imaginative new policies and programmes, build support for operating in the public spotlight and lacking the singular authority that most business CEOs have. The change problems in business suddenly seem more manageable. Joseph M Juran, a pioneer of total quality management and founder of the Juran Institute. Big idea: Set out to become the quality leader in your industry. Recall that Japan, a country once notorious for its shoddy goods, became an economic superpower, chiefly because it attained world quality leadership. Reading: No answer. Clive Williams, head of management consulting, Ernst &amp; Young (UK). Big idea: Organisations are learning to live in a state of constant transition. In these conditions traditional concepts of the managerial role have ceased to exist. Instead of clinging to outdated practices managers should concentrate on developing new business styles and shifting the organisation's centre of gravity from a fixed line-based structure towards a flexible, prospect-based organisation. In 1995 the challenge is to become a genuine enabler of people and to focus on four imperatives - speed, adaptability, responsiveness and innovation. Reading: The Scottish Himalayan Expedition by WH Murray (excerpt from a training manual). Why? Because it ties in with the challenge in the fusion concept just described. But most of all because I like it. Hugh Dickinson, managing partner, Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton International (UK). Big idea: The one 'big' idea must be the rebirth of leadership - more specifically, in establishing the vision for the business, in focusing the organisation on the one or two central ideas that will shape vision into reality, and in being ready to take the tough people and resource deployment decisions that go with the territory. And leadership in recognising, resolving and accepting the give-ups and trade-offs that will inevitably be required. Reading: Competing for the Future by Gary Hamel and CK Pralahad - in particular, its last 20-page chapter, 'Thinking differently about the organisation'. Why so? Because of the book's eloquence in capturing the need to raise growth once more to the top of the corporate agenda. And, in its final pages, in its articulation of the significance of the complex interplays and feedback loops between corporate strategy, business vitality and organisational choice. Mohamed Al Fayed, chairman, Harrods. Big idea: Invest in success. If you are fortunate to have a brand that is already admired and enjoyed, support it to the hilt and watch it take your company forward. In the 10 years since acquiring Harrods, we have invested Pounds 200m in refurbishment, in opening new departments and in improving our standards of service. Even great national institutions need generous capital investments if they are to be worthy of their customers' support into the next century. As a 'big' idea this may not be new but as an Egyptian sage I once knew put it: 'New is easy, good is hard.' Reading: Harrods sells huge numbers or business books but I must confess I don't read them. By the time a man can afford Pounds 24.95 for a hardback by a former big name, usually looking back, he should be sufficiently sure of himself in business not to need that sort of advice. It is better to buy that classic work of fiction you always meant to read but never got around to or a couple of CDs by a composer you don't know. Let your overworked brain do the thing you never allow it to do: to idle. You will be surprised by how many good ideas you come up with when you are not thinking.</p>

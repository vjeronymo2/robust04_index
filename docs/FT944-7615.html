			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Tarmac and PJ Walls of Dublin - Contracts and ventures The contract to built one of the biggest infrastructure projects in the Irish Republic, a Pounds 67m (Dollars 105m) road tunnel under the River Lee at Cork, has been awarded to a joint venture between Tarmac, the UK construction group, and Irish contractors PJ Walls of Dublin. Construction of the immersed tube tunnel, made of pre-cast concrete boxes, each weighing up to 30,000 tonnes, is due to start early next year and will take 3 1/2 years to complete. Mr Brian Pellard, managing director of Tarmac Construction, said the British group also was 'making a strong bid' to build the tunnel section of the proposed bridge and tunnel link between Denmark and Sweden across the Oresund Strait.</p>

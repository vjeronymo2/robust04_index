			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Belgrade, 27 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Foreign Ministry  of the republic of Serb Krajina sent a letter today to all  diplomatic and consular missions in Belgrade, warning that the  text carried by the 24 January newsletter of the U.S. Embassy in  Belgrade was written in the spirit of the falsehoods concocted  by the Croatian propaganda headquarters.    The letter, also forwarded to TANJUG, says that by writing  the article in the US embassy's newsletter, Madeleine Albright  -- the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations -- had "abused the  hospitality of the Serbian people and overstepped the norms of  diplomatic conduct" because she called on "all countries to help  the war crimes tribunal."    The text implies that "the Ovcara mass grave near Vukovar  contains evidence about Serbian crimes against the Croats --  something the European civilization of the 20th Century ought to  be ashamed of."

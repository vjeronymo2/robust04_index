			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Australia's main market indicator increased again this week, rising just 3 cents to 617 cents a kg. a new record for the season. The small advance covered sharp rises affecting finer merinos, up by 20 to 40 cents, and a wide range of small changes, including reductions for one or two crossbred categories. An erratic market impression is not unprecedented in the final weeks of selling season, which concludes in Australia at the end of June. Helping to confirm overall wool market confidence is the progress made in disposing of Australia's large wool stockpile. From July 1 this will be sold by fixed schedule, and as the deadline approaches heavier sales are reported, including sales for deferred delivery which make inroads into the fixed schedule. The emphasis is on the possibility of lower supplies in relation to demand during the next few months.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY URGES DEATH FOR CONVICTED SERIAL KILLER  </P> <P> Jurors on Tuesday recommended the death penalty for convicted serial killer  Louis Craine.  </P> <P> Two of the murders for which Craine was convicted on April 26 had been linked  to the so-called Southside Slayer killings of prostitutes in South-Central Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Craine, 31, also had been found guilty on several counts of sexual assault in  connection with the strangulation murders. He was acquitted on a fifth count of  first-degree murder.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called Relatives 'Liars'  </P> <P> An unemployed construction worker from Watts, Craine had confessed to police  shortly after his 1988 arrest. But he recanted those statements, which were  taped by police and later played for the jury during the trial. Other evidence  against Craine included the testimony of several of Craine's relatives,  including his mother, who linked him to a shirt that was stained with blood of  the same type as one of the murder victims.  </P> <P> Testifying on his own behalf, Craine earnestly proclaimed his innocence,  calling his relatives "liars" and saying that he had never seen the shirt  before. He said he thought his relatives, especially his mother, were mad at  him for having left home at an early age.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys Morris B. Jones and Ronald V. Skyers did not dispute Craine's  confession. Rather, they contended that their client made his statements only  after sustained police interrogation.  </P> <P> "He was unable to understand what he was saying," Jones said.  </P> <P> The defense lawyers portrayed Craine as an illiterate man with a fourth-grade  education and an IQ of 69, who is prone to exaggerations and has a tendency to  "parrot" the statements of others.  </P> <P> They said Craine made his incriminating statements only after investigators had  given him certain information about the murders.  </P> <P> But Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Watson contended that Craine's  statements contained information only the killer could have known.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strangulation Confirmed  </P> <P> For instance, the cause of death of one of the victims, Loretta Perry, had  initially been listed as cocaine overdose. She was found on Jan. 25, 1987, in  the 9500 block of South Defiance Avenue. But after Craine spoke of having  strangled Perry, the woman's body was exhumed and a second autopsy confirmed  that she had been strangled.  </P> <P> Besides Perry, Craine was convicted of having murdered Gail M. Ficklin, found  dead on Aug. 15, 1985; Vivian Louise Collins, found strangled in the 1600 block  of East Century Boulevard on March 18, 1987, and Carolyn Barney, found in a  vacant lot near Craine's parents' home in the 9700 block of South Grandee  Avenue in May, 1987.  </P> <P> Craine was acquitted in the murder of Sheila Rae Burris, who was found stabbed  and strangled on Nov. 18, 1984. She, along with Ficklin and Barney, had been  linked by police to the Southside Slayer killings.  </P> <P> After deliberating 1 1/2 days, the jury settled on death in the gas chamber at  San Quentin State Prison rather than life in prison without possibility of  parole. Compton Superior Court Judge Janice Claire Croft set June 6 for formal  sentencing.  </P> <P> Charges against another suspect in three of the Southside slayings, former Los  Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Rickey Ross, were dismissed Monday after  ballistics tests linking Ross to the murders were proven wrong.  </P></p>

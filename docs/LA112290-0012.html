			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS ON THANKSGIVING DAY  </P> <P> It's the best of all holidays. You don't have to wear a costume. You don't have  to buy a present or trim a tree. You don't have to hide eggs, buy a new outfit,  be a valentine or shoot off fireworks.  </P> <P> Thanksgiving is a day we celebrate family. Kids watch the parades, men watch  football and women watch turkeys brown. It has always been that way.  </P> <P> As a kid, I remember it as a day my grandfather was allowed to smoke cigars in  the house. A day when all the children were allowed to bang on the piano  without Grandma closing the lid on their fingers. A day when no one ragged my  Uncle Wesley about getting a job or reminded my Aunt Mildred she didn't need  another baby.  </P> <P> It was a day Grandma baked extra loaves of yeast bread for everyone to take  home, and no one complained about the cost of the food we were eating. It was a  day that, no matter how poor we were, nickels and dimes always appeared to send  the kids to the neighborhood picture show after dinner.  </P> <P> I can never remember my family offering grace or thanks before a Thanksgiving  dinner. They seemed to want to, but they felt like they didn't have the right  words. So my uncle would yell something like "Over the lips and over the gums,  watch out stomach, here it comes."  </P> <P> Given that, there was something significant about our reunions: We all showed  up for them. I cannot remember a Thanksgiving that all of Grandma's children  and their large families were not seated on milk boxes, piano stools, vanity  benches, folding chairs and glider swings around her table.  </P> <P> And in return for our dedication, we took something away with us: a sense of  belonging to something that was bigger than us, richer than us, better than us,  stronger than us -- that would outlive us all. If there was a death,  unemployment, ill health, domestic problems, it didn't matter. Every  Thanksgiving, we all returned to that house to bind up our wounds before we  returned again to life outside the cocoon. But we always knew it was there.  </P> <P> It doesn't matter if the dishes don't match, there aren't enough chairs to go  around, you're using soup spoons to stir coffee, the turkey is too small, the  pumpkin pies are runny, you borrowed from the credit union to get there, and  all the kids are driving you crazy.  </P> <P> You have a place to be, and you are blessed.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Paraguay monitored through 16  June.    A Technical Planning Secretariat document states that  Paraguay's external debt increased 1.3 percent between January  and May, rising to $1.2328 billion compared with the $1.2067  billion at the end of December 1993. The central government is  the largest debtor with liabilities amounting to $538.3 million,  followed by government-owned enterprises whose financial  obligations add up to $472.8 million, and financial  institutions, whose debts total $221.7 million. Half of  Paraguay's debt has been contracted with international  organizations, $615.7 million; 47.8 percent with the Paris Club,  $589.6 million; and 2.2 percent with Latin American banks, $27.5  million. The slight increase in the external debt is basically  due to the disbursement of credits granted by international  organizations like the Inter-American Development Bank and the  World Bank.

Farmers had a poor  harvest caused by bad weather, fungus, and the boll weevil. In  volume, cotton exports plummeted 51.2 percent to 21,368,249 kg  compared with 44,051,354 kg last year. In value, exports  declined 34.6 percent from $49,849,094 in 1993 to $31,919,800  this year. (Asuncion ULTIMA HORA in Spanish 13 Jun 94 p 8)    According to the General Customs Directorate, there was a  surge in the trade deficit in 1994 through May. Exports totaled  $341.294 million while imports were $1.087 billion, a deficit of  $746.247 million--a 218.65 percent increase compared with the  same period last year. This sharp increase in the trade deficit  reportedly is due to the fact that in the past a considerable  amount of goods entered the country illegally whereas now there  is an ongoing campaign to stem smuggling and imports now are  paying customs duties. It is estimated that total imports amount  to $3 billion annually, of which only $1 billion was registered  in the past. This made the government lose more than $200  million in revenue per year.

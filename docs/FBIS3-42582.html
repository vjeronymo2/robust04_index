			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sh. Odilov, deputy minister of grain </F> products of the Republic of Tajikistan, by N. Vanichkin; place  and date not given: "Bread Passion, or Someone's Misfortune"]    [Text] A neighbor of mine, a woman in her declining  years, called Auntie Vera in everyday life, was an inveterate  optimist. Even the harsh consequences of last year's events  which are known to all did not shake her faith in a bright  future. Nothing could shake her: neither the empty shelves in  the stores nor the long waiting lines in front of the bakeries.  And I, who am younger, could only envy the unshakable faith of  this elderly person. And once when I met Auntie Vera with a  stool in her hand, of course, I could not help but ask her where  she was setting out for at the break of day.    "To look after the grain," was my neighbor's answer.  Our oldtimers' conversations in the entryway have now moved  closer to the window where bakery items are sold. We get up a  little earlier, we get in line, and we share all the news at the  same time. And you might even end up without any bread.  Sometimes a "sit-in" in front of the store for a whole day does  not even help. Not a single bun makes its way to us poor  pensioners. Everything is snatched away by the "good  fellows"--young people. And what is surprising is that they take  it away in sacks and God only knows why they need so much.    [Vanichkin] What is the real reason for the severe  interruptions in the supply of bread for the population that  have occurred recently?    We asked this question of the deputy minister of grain  products of the Republic of Tajikistan, Sh. Odilov.    [Odilov] The situation with bread has indeed become  critical.  And there are many reasons for this. Because of the higher cost  and shortage in the food stores of meat and dairy products, the  population has begun to consume more bakery items. The situation  is exacerbated by the lack of small-denomination coupons at the  trading points. When they are unable to obtain change from  R5,000 or R10,000 banknotes, many people are forced to buy bread  in excess of the norm. Panic buying is also stirred up by the  so-called "wheeler-dealers" in independent trade who speculate  in bread along with workers in the store. Much of it is acquired  by owners of private farms to feed their livestock. And while in  past years internal affairs organs did a certain amount of  preventive work with those who use bread for other than food  purposes, today, as you have noted, they cannot impose order  even in the waiting lines in front of the bread stores. The  situation is extremely critical with fuel and lubricants as  well. Because of all this only about 40 percent of the city's  trade points are supplied with bread products.    Enterprises of our branch, in spite of the shortage of yeast  and other components, are over-fulfilling the daily norm for  bread baking. And this--believe it or not--is more than 170  tonnes. We are producing even more than trade is ordering from  us. We have adequate raw material and capacities. There are even  possibilities of increasing production. The question hinges on  the problem of prompt delivery of bakery products to the  consumers. At the same time in the extremely difficult  conditions with a shortage of the main food product one must be  reasonably thrifty and use bread for food purposes. And trade  workers and also buyers must be conscientious and prevent cases  of violations in the sale of bakery items. One wishes to hope  also that internal affairs organs will turn their attention to  the operation of bread stores and also the illegal actions of  certain wheeler-dealers in the speculation market. Otherwise it  could happen that we would end up without enough supplies of raw  material. And then panic buying could indeed lead us to a bread  shortage.    [Vanichkin] Sharifdzhon Olimovich, you mentioned that there  are possibilities of increasing the production of bakery  products. In this connection I do not think it would be out of  place for you to tell us about how things are going with the  construction of the new capital bakery, whose production  capacities, as was anticipated previously, were to be introduced  at the end of this year. How realistic are these expectations  today?    [Odilov] So far there is nothing to boast about. Although we  did intend to start up a plant by the New Year and make a kind  of gift to residents of the capital, this is not likely to  happen. And here it is not the collective of the enterprise  under construction or the general contracting organizations  involved in the construction of this facility who are to blame.  The builders are working, one might say, day and night. And I am  not saying this just to sound good. You yourself saw how they  brought mattresses and blankets to the construction site for  workers on the second shift. Now everything is set up so that at  least one line with a capacity of 20 tonnes of rectangular  loaves of bread a day will go into operation by the end of the  year. Its startup will make it possible for us to relieve the  critical strain in supplying the population of the right-bank  zone with bread products. Of course, this is with stable  operation of the bread and confectionery combine.    [Vanichkin] What is the reason for the adjustment of the  earmarked plans?    [Odilov] The main one is the failure to make payments to  Russia. Since April of this year we have been unable to settle  accounts with our suppliers under agreements concluded  previously. All the equipment we need is ready to send, the  containers and railroad cars have been ordered, and considerable  penalty payments are being "accumulated" because of their idle  time. Naturally, our associates are becoming more mistrustful,  and this, as you yourself understand, threatens our established  relations. For example, the warehouse for bulk storage of flour  today is in urgent need of solid-drawn tubes with an internal  diameter of 75 mm and wall thickness of 2.5 mm. There are none  in the republic. We signed a contract with the Moscow Tube Plant  but we cannot pay for the deliveries. The payments are not going  through. Thus because the money did not go through for an air  compressor, 24 units of standard equipment have not been  delivered. And what can you say. With a normal finance-credit  system the plant would have gone on-line three months ago.    Workers of the main construction administration are letting  us down too. We do not yet have the blueprints for the boiler,  although they were to have been turned over on 15 October. I  understand that the developers are now having difficulties with  skilled specialists, but since they promised to prepare the  documentation, they should be so kind as to do it by the  earmarked deadline.    [Vanichkin] Sharifdzhon Olimovich, if the boiler is not  working, no heat or steam will go to the production facility.  Consequently even the one production line you plan to start up  at the end of the year will not go into operation.    [Odilov] It is practically impossible to envision ahead of  time the stage of construction readiness at which the failure  would come. And there is no one to solve our problems for us.  But I can assure you with complete confidence that one bread  baking line will be in operation. The steam and heat will be  produced according to a temporary plan from the currently  existing boiler at the Dushanbe bakery-confectionery combine. We  have also solved the problem of the air compressor. Instead of  the air collectors that are in short supply we plan to use  receivers--the Pamir production association promises to deliver  them to us. True, the work front is still not large, but in the  next few days we intend to complete all the startup and  adjustment work on the fourth technological line for bread  baking. To do this we have organized brigades which are now  inspecting all the equipment and working on two shifts.    The desire of the construction workers to solve the bread  problem is commendable. But now they too need help. They are in  extreme need of solid-drawn steel tubes, nonrusting electrodes  or nonrusting welding wire, and bronze and brass faucets.  Possibly certain enterprises or organizations have the  aforementioned equipment. It would be good if any of them would  help the construction workers. And we will agree to any payment  conditions: transfer, cash, or barter. I hope that this request  will not go unnoticed. The entire city needs the bakery, and  this means that each one of us should be interested in its  startup.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norilsk problems seen hitting Russian nickel sales Problems at Norilsk, the world's biggest nickel producer, are likely to cause Russian exports of the metal to the west to fall to about 95,000 tonnes this year, a 14 per cent drop from the 110,000 tonnes expected at the begining of 1994, according to Mr Jim Lennon, analyst at Macquarie Securities, part of the Australian banking group. There was a two-day strike at Norilsk earlier this month because of persistent non-payment of salaries, Mr Lennon points out. There is evidence that Norilsk is being starved of cash for even routine maintenance because the Russian government is taking 80 per cent of the profit on nickel in tax and all Norilsk's platinum group metals profits. The recently-privatised Norilsk still owes its workforce about Rbs150bn (Pounds 45m) and the company says that the city of Norilsk needs Rs 2,000bn to repair its infrastructure. Mr Lennon recalls that the nickel market in the west was tipped into a massive supply surplus by Russian exports which rose from 70,000 tonnes in 1988 to a peak of 160,000 tonnes (including secondary, or recycled, material) in 1992. Between 1991 and 1993, nickel stocks in the west rose by nearly 150,000 tonnes, most of the excess accumulating as Russian cathode in London Metal Exchange warehouses. This forced down prices to an all-time low in real terms of Dollars 1.82 a lb at the end of September last year. Since then, prices have recovered despite a continued rise in stocks because of money pouring into the nickel market from investment funds. Mr Lennon says that about 29,000 tonnes of Russian nickel, which had been stockpiled in Russia during the winter, arrived in the west in July and August. Only 6,000 tonnes found its way to LME warehouses and the rest is assumed to have gone directly to end-users, or has been stockpiled, possibly as collateral for loans. Demand in the west for nickel - used primarily in the production of stainless steel - is growing strongly and consumption is forecast by Mr Lennon to rise by 6.7 per cent to 713,000 tonnes this year and by a further 8.9 per cent to 776,700 tonnes in 1995. However, the recent price rise has encouraged western producers to increase output and he predicts that production will rise by 5.6 per cent this year to 589,300 tonnes and next year climb to 629,000 tonnes. Once imports from the former eastern bloc are taken into account, this will leave the western market with a small deficit this year but one of more than 30,000 tonnes in 1995. Mr Lennon sees three months delivery nickel prices on the LME rising to Dollars 3 a pound (Dollars 6,612 a tonne) by the year-end to give a 1994 average price of Dollars 2.65 (Dollars 5,840), rising to an average of Dollars 3.30 (Dollars 7,273) next year.</p>

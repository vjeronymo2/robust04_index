			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> CAEN-DEMNED: San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen, never a fan of  Southern California culture, included a dig at Orange County in his Monday  column. . . . Caen asked three Bay Area men who had recently returned from  driving through all 58 California counties which county was the worst. Their  opinion: Orange or El Dorado. . . . "All those yuppie west side Tahoe towns are  indistinguishable from the paved-over ennui of Irvine," they concluded. "You've  gotta like these guys!" Caen enthused.

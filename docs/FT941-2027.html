			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Tory MPs again refuse to list Lloyd's stakes Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, is among nine MPs who are persisting in refusing to comply with parliamentary rules on the disclosure of financial dealings in a supplement to the Commons register of members' interests published yesterday. The supplement includes declarations by three of 12 MPs who were criticised by the Commons committee on members' interests for failing to comply with rules requiring disclosure of dealings with the Lloyd's insurance market. The 12 MPs, all Conservatives, were urged by the committee to comply without delay. Only Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, and Mr Hartley Booth, MP for Finchley, have done so. Like other Lloyd's members the three MPs have declared the numbers of Lloyd's syndicates to which they belong, but not details of their personal exposure or of reinsurance arrangements through stop-loss insurance policies. The MPs who have not complied are Mr David Ashby (North West Leicestershire), Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston), Mr Michael Colvin (Romsey and Waterside), Sir Ralph Howell (Norfolk North), Mr Roger Knapman (Stroud), Mr Anthony Steen (South Hams), Mr David Tredinnick (Bosworth), Sir Jerry Wiggin (Weston-super-Mare) and Sir Edward (Old Bexley and Sidcup). The members' interests committee decided last night to debate the failure of the MPs to comply with the rules at its first meeting after the Easter parliamentary recess. Meanwhile, efforts are to be made to persuade those who have not complied to do so. One MP who has not supplied the required details said he was 'not interested in what the committee says'. Fifty-one Tory MPs have now disclosed past or present membership of Lloyd's in the register, including five members of the cabinet and nine junior ministers. Most have declared involvement with loss-making syndicates. Earlier this week Sir Edward accused Labour MPs of running a 'sleazy' campaign to undermine Tory MPs after details of MPs' alleged losses at Lloyd's were published in a Sunday newspaper.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares steady in modest trading volume Institutional investors could find nothing to go for yesterday in a London market where base rate hopes have been fulfilled; share prices drifted aimlessly in the general direction of Budget Day, next Tuesday. Although trading volume remained fairly good, business largely focused around company statements and special situations. London paid little heed to the early firmness on Wall Street, where the Thanksgiving Day holiday is expected to extend until the weekend. After moving erratically through a narrow range, the FT-SE 100 Index closed 2.1 down at 3,067.2. Sentiment appeared to soften in the final minutes after suggestions that Pilkington, the glassmaker, planned to make a rights issue. The stock market made a slow start, with City workers struggling into their offices against a background of serious disruption of London's underground rail network. In the first hour of trading, interest was largely confined to a batch of share placings among relatively small companies which kept some traders busy without exciting the market. Blue chip internationals were generally easier, shying away ahead of Wall Street's likely torpor rather than responding to firmness on other European bourses. Pharmaceutical stocks acted as a drag on the market and oil shares lacked decision while the market continued to keep a wary eye on the weakness of global prices for crude oil. On the domestic front, store and retail issues, the prime beneficiaries from lower interest rates, gave ground as traders waited see if Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, has any unpleasant surprises for them when he delivers his Budget speech. However, there was activity among the UK television stocks as the government proposed limited changes in rules governing commercial television ownership. Equity strategists continued to express disappointment that the half-point cut in base rates announced on Tuesday almost certainly rules out another cut in the Budget. 'We had been hoping for one per cent (cut),' commented Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon, the UK brokerage house. He pointed out the Bank of England should be more market sensitive than the chancellor, a fact which he thinks will create more avid speculation about rate cuts in the future. Nervousness over the general outlook for global markets also continued to run high, with London traders responding cautiously to comments on the GATT talks prospects from France. Mr Nicholas Knight, the strongest bull of the London market, told clients that they should 'worry less about US, more about Japan.' He believes that Wall Street has ridden fairly comfortably through the scare that US interest rates may be about to rise. But he advises selling into any rally in the Japanese market. For the UK, he reiterates the view expressed by many UK strategists that this week's cut in base rates surprised only in its timing and that 'stock prices are going up - period.' Seaq trading volume, at 567.1m shares, against 667.1m in the previous session, was relatively good but the total was swollen by activity in some of the second-line issues. On Tuesday, retail, or customer, business recovered from recent weakness to return a value total of Pounds 1.58bn in spite of the turbulence in the market as the base rate cut was digested.</p>

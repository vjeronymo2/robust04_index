			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US-Japan trade dispute defused The dispute over US access to the Japanese cellular phone market - at the centre of Washington's threats of trade sanctions - appeared to have been defused yesterday. The Japanese group IDO said it had reached a broad agreement with Motorola to expand the US company's cellular phone network, writes Paul Abrahams in Tokyo. Motorola has been trying for almost a decade to become a significant force in the Japanese mobile phone market. IDO, partly owned by Toyota, said the two companies were near agreement over the timing and extent of the expansion of the Motorola network. The Japanese company is offering to add 159 relay stations for Motorola's car phones. Mr Arnold Brenner, Motorola's vice-president, who arrived in Tokyo yesterday to finalise the agreement, wants the expansion completed within 18 months. The Japanese group says it will take more than two years. Discussions over the allocation of radio frequencies also need to be concluded.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Record sales for unit trust Peps - Investors flock in PERSONAL equity plans have become one of the most popular ways of investing money, if the record sales achieved by unit trust Peps are anything to go by. These plans, which account for the majority of Pep deals, achieved net sales of Pounds 846m in the first quarter of the year. They accounted for almost half the net amount - Pounds 1.8bn - taken in by unit trusts in the first quarter of the year. Peps allow investors to hold equities free of income and capital gains tax, subject to investment limits. The maximum investment in a general Pep is Pounds 6,000 in a single tax year. In addition, investors can also hold another Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep. Sales of Peps tend to increase in the first quarter of the year as people top-up or new investors take out a plan before the end of the tax year. Unit and investment trust Peps were given a significant boost in the 1992 tax year when their annual investment limit was raised from Pounds 3,000 to that of a general Pep. The last quarter, therefore, has been the first before the end of a tax year in which unit trust Peps have been on an equal footing with general Peps. 'Since the government allowed people to invest a full Pounds 6,000 Pep allowance in unit trusts, close to Pounds 2bn has been invested,' says Gavin Grant, of the Association of Unit Trust and Investment Funds. At least of equal importance has been the background of falling interest rates which has pitched equities, building societies and National Savings into a battle for investors' money. Building society net receipts amounted to Pounds 820m in the first quarter of the year - approaching three times net receipts in the whole of 1992, which totalled a mere Pounds 295m. Mark Boleat, of the Building Societies Association, said last month that 'faced with renewed competition from National Savings and unit trusts, building societies have been adding to their range of savings products. This has enabled them to maintain a steady inflow of funds over recent months.' Mindful that many people are looking for income, unit trusts have been marketing Peps aimed at meeting this income need. In February, M&amp;G launched a Managed Income fund with a 5 per cent yield. Fidelity offered its High Income fund, investing in high-yielding equities and fixed-interest stocks to produce a 6 per cent yield. The Cazenove Utility and Bond fund, also launched in February, invests in utility stocks to produce a 7 per cent yield. But the most spectacular plan was launched by Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial. Its Higher Income scheme offers a yield of 10 per cent through use of the options market. 'People have been forced to look at Peps to boost their income, and they are proving a very attractive option,' says Robin Bloor, of Chase de Vere, publishers of Pep Guide. 'Money from maturing guaranteed income bonds and the building society has been going into these products.' The Association of Unit Trusts expects sales of unit trust Peps to remain strong in the coming year despite Budget changes to advance corporation tax; these have reduced income tax saving for basic rate Pepholders. Meanwhile, at least 1,000 Foreign &amp; Colonial Pep investors will have part of their Pep holdings sold as a result of an inadvertant breach of the Pep rules by F&amp;C. Its High Income investment trust (not to be confused with Hypo F&amp;C's unit trust plan) has been made ineligible for inclusion in a Pep as a result of new rules announced by the government in December. As a 'non-qualifying' trust - one that does not hold at least 50 per cent of its assets in the UK or European Community - F&amp;C High Income was eligible only for Pep investment of up to Pounds 1,500. The new rules, which took effect on April 6, state that any non-qualifying investment or unit trust which has less than 50 per cent of its assets placed in ordinary shares cannot be included in a Pep. The move was designed to prevent funds investing primarily in gilts or bonds rather than equities. Only 30 per cent of F&amp;C's High Income fund is invested in equities - the rest is in high-yielding convertible preference shares and fixed-interest stock. But F&amp;C does not want to increase investment in equities because this would result in a lower dividend to its shareholders. The trust also has a dollar-denominated loan fixed at 9 3/8 per cent interest until 1997, and cannot afford to switch to lower-yielding equities. The Inland Revenue is giving F&amp;C a period of grace in which it is allowed to sell the trust's shares and re-invest the proceeds. As long as this is done by June 9, there will be no tax liability for those F&amp;C Pep-holders concerned. Once F&amp;C sells the shares, it will hold the proceeds on the money markets until its Pep investors give it new instructions. Investors can switch to a different F&amp;C investment trust or to another company without paying F&amp;C's usual Pounds 50 transfer charge, which is being waived. Jeremy Tigue, director of Foreign &amp; Colonial management and manager of the F&amp;C High Income trust, said it was 'very disappointing' that the change in the rules meant the trust could no longer be held in a Pep.</p>

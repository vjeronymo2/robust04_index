			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW HEIGHTS FOR DOMESTIC AIRLINES  </P> <P> Delta Air Lines' recent $10 billion order for new passenger jets is good news  for the air traveler and the Southern California economy. New planes are safer  planes, and the recent massive airline orders will weed out aging aircraft from  the commercial fleet. The $5 billion-plus portion of the Delta order placed  with McDonnell Douglas Corp. triggers production of the firm's new MD-90 jet at  the Long Beach plant and cushions the region against possible defense contract  cutbacks.  </P> <P> Both Boeing of Seattle, recipient of the balance of the Delta order, and  McDonnell Douglas have had their problems. Boeing, suffering delays in  delivering aircraft, has just emerged from a seven-week-long strike. McDonnell  Douglas has struggled through a painful management restructuring, but now is  embarked on its new generation of passenger aircraft. The MD-90 is the  successor to the MD-80, the tail-mounted twin-jet workhorse of many airlines  for short and medium-range flights. It will be quieter, less polluting and will  be about 15% more fuel-efficient than existing planes.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas also is going into production on a new wide-body jet, the  MD-11, successor to the tri-jet DC-10, carrying from 245 to more than 400  passengers. The firm made a large sale of MD-11s to American Airlines earlier  this year at a price of more than $100 million each. And in April, United Air  Lines announced a $16 billion order of 370 planes from Boeing that will  significantly rejuvenate the United fleet.  </P> <P> There could be a downside to the recent plane orders: The five biggest airlines  are likely to increase their dominance of the commercial passenger field, since  all have substantial numbers of new aircraft coming into their fleets. Airline  experts argue that weaker firms with older fleets will fall further behind just  by standing still. Members of Congress who fear too much airline consolidation  and favor some measure of re-regulation will be watching closely.  </P> <P> But the revitalization of the airline fleet with massive orders of new planes  during both 1988 and 1989 is a most positive development. The average age of  the 5,200 planes flown on domestic routes is 14 years. More than 40% are at  least 20 years old. When the older, noiser, less-efficient jets are retired,  the American passenger public will enjoy a much more comfortable and safer  ride.  </P></p>

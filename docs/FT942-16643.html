			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (4): 1993 - 'annus mirabilis' / Ian Rodger looks at the banking business Swiss banks which are active in international asset management and securities and currency trading still bask in the spectacular success they enjoyed last year. Most admit, however, that they benefited from a remarkable conjunction of positive forces. Interest rates fell throughout the year, driving bond prices higher and encouraging investors to shift more funds from fixed income instruments into equity markets, which also boomed. The all share Swiss Performance Index advanced no less than 40 per cent during the year and volume was active on the Swiss stock exchanges throughout the year. Introduction of a withholding tax in Germany and continuing political turmoil in Italy encouraged more and more foreigners to store their savings in safe, stable Switzerland. Swiss banks are normally reluctant to reveal the size of the funds they manage, but several reported that the amount rose by a third or more. Baer Holding, the parent of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich and one of the few to divulge fund figures, said its funds under management jumped 36 per cent to SFr45bn. Meanwhile, continuing international currency instability enabled the banks to make handsome profits on their trading and financial engineering services. The only banking business that did not do well last year was lending. Net interest income of all the big banks scarcely grew at all, and bad loan provisions were hoisted to record levels - to some extent, it is widely suspected, to hide profits from other activities. Given the continuing recession in Switzerland and elsewhere, the opportunities for balance sheet growth were few. For the big banks, this slump was more than compensated by winnings elsewhere. For the smaller cantonal and regional banks, which rely almost totally on lending, it was a different story. The trend to rapid consolidation in these sectors, which has been under way for the past three years, continued at a brisk pace. The number of regional banks, for example, has tumbled from 185 in 1991 to only 138 at the end of last year. Among the most significant events was the merger of the two cantonal banks in Geneva, the Caisse d'Epargne de la Republique et Canton de Geneve and la Banque hypothecaire du canton de Geneve, into the Banque cantonale de Geneve. This long and carefully planned merger of two still sound banks passed off with scarcely a ripple. The same cannot be said for the collapse of a large regional bank in Lausanne, La Banque Vaudoise de Credit, the bad loan provisions of which exhausted its capital late last year. The bank thrashed about noisily for a few weeks, looking for rescuers. This caused a run on its deposits which had to be covered with emergency support from the Federal Banking Commission. Eventually, after several rejections, it was taken over by the state-backed Banque cantonale Vaudoise in December. The regional banks association has since launched a scheme to try to prevent further erosion within its ranks. It proposes creating a central organisation which would carry out many transactions and back office functions for the individual banks, thereby making them more cost competitive with larger banks. Regional bank officials admit it is already rather late in the day for such a scheme. The combined assets of the 138 remaining members of the association is only SFr70bn, a mere third of the SFr207bn on the books of Swiss Bank Corporation, the smallest of the big three banks. Swiss bankers have also been preoccupied in recent months with a blizzard of legislation and new regulations affecting them, in part a reflection of the federal government's desire to harmonise its practices with those of the European Union. Revisions to the banking law to bring it into harmony with EU practice are in the final stages. The main debate has been over conditions under which the Swiss banking authorities should co-operate with their foreign counterparts. Oddly, one house of parliament wanted to minimise co-operation, fearing that it would undermine bank secrecy, but leading bankers convinced them that co-operation was in everyone's interest, and a balanced version in line with Bank of International Settlements' guidelines has finally won the day. Bankers have also been trying hard to convince Berne that it would not be a good idea to impose the new value added tax, due to come into effect next year, on fees for managing foreigners' money. They fear that the resulting increase in fees will persuade many clients to move their accounts elsewhere. The federal finance ministry, grappling with huge budget deficits, is reluctant to give way on any source of revenue, but the banks - and the country's struggling tourist industry - argue that it would be unfair to exempt the export of products from VAT but not the export of services. A decision is expected in May, but no one is predicting which way it will go. A proposed federal stock exchange law and related regulations dealing with takeover bids is meeting resistance at various levels. The stock exchange law is needed to transfer regulatory power from the cantonal level to the federal level once the national electronic stock exchange begins to operate next year. But bankers have been upset about the drift of the proposed legislation towards strict detailed government regulation at the expense of self-regulation. A strong divergence of opinion among banks and quoted companies on takeover bid rules could delay implementation of the bill. Some feel that any takeover rules must be accompanied by Euro-compatible monopolies legislation. There have been suggestions that the takeover provisions be detached from the stock exchange law, so that the latter can pass more quickly. The fate of a bill to bring Swiss law on investment funds into line with EU practice is also in difficulty, even though the country has watched tens of billions of francs decamp to Luxembourg in the past few years, where the legal framework is more favourable. Bankers place little hope on having stamp duty, a big irritant, removed from investment funds and they are resigned to the exclusion of Sicavs (unit trusts) from the legislation. The government claims the necessary legal framework for Sicavs requires more changes to the companies law as well, and that would be too time-consuming. All this legislation comes at a time when business appears to be getting more difficult for many Swiss banks, especially those that specialise in portfolio management and dealing, than it has been for the last couple of years. No one has been surprised by the slide in the stock market in recent weeks. After three years of big increases, it was difficult to expect the upward trend to continue, but the bond market slump has been more upsetting. The whisper in Swiss banking circles is that damage repair will be necessary over the next few months if clients' portfolios are to produce respectable returns in 1994. To judge by the recent sharply downward trend of bank share prices, investors suspect that the banks may have difficulty making their own profits look respectable, too. The encore to the annus mirabilis could be disappointing.</p>

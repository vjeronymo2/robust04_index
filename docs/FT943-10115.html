			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / FT Ski Expedition: Condor brings a lift Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker aim to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world trip. They are now in South America. We have not set the world on fire with our skiing exploits in July, but we may have set a new towing record, following the final and humiliating immobilisation of our borrowed Lada vehicle. For 500 rainswept kilometres, drivers of four breakdown trucks from the Automovil Clubs of both Argentina and Chile, working in relay, towed us from the shores of Nahuel Huapi, trundling tank-like through the snow-clad Eucalyptus trees of the Puyehue Pass across the Cordillera, back to Temuco and the hamlet of General Lopez, from where we borrowed our Russian vehicle three weeks ago. Our troubles had started just 5.7kms from the lakeside Dut Club Hotel, where we had left our last Argentine money as a tip. Whining and juddering noises came from the back-axle region, accompanied by smoke from our undercarriage: the FT Ski Expedition seemed to be falling apart. Abandoning the vehicle at the roadside, we summoned our usual cab - because of our transport crisis, we had been getting to the slopes by taxi all week  -to take us to the Gran Catedral resort, where we found that none of our credit cards would deliver us fresh funds and no one would change our American Express travellers cheques. (The Argentines are funny about travellers cheques.) After 10 consecutive days of rain, we now found ourselves with no transport, no money and nowhere to stay for our unscheduled extra stop in Argentina. Perhaps we had tempted fate by celebrating our 200th consecutive day of skiing the night before with a champagne dinner in Bariloche. As Lucy and I rode the Telesilla Del Condor chairlift trying to unscramble the mess we were in, a huge condor soared above us, its wings flapping languidly. Low-flying condors are supposed to signal bad weather, but this one brought our first sunshine for weeks. It was a good omen. Our luck was about to change. Funds were suddenly forthcoming from our credit cards, and although Bariloche was packed with families enjoying the school holidays, Heini Kempel, director of the Catedral ski school, found us just about the last empty apartment in the resort. Now we could eat, sleep and ski - but not drive. At first we were reconciled to having the Lada repaired locally, where it would cost more than twice as much as in Chile. Then Lucy had the bright idea: it would be much cheaper to get it towed back to Chile for repairs. When it was fixed, the vehicle's owner, Robert Stanton, would put it on the night train to Santiago, where we could collect it and continue our journey east of the Andes. Our marathon tow ended at the Automovil Club de Chile's garage in Temuco, where we faced a further problem: how were we going to get to the snow without the four-wheel-drive vehicle? Local taxi companies confirmed our fears: no one wanted to drive us to the foothills of the Llaima Volcano (the only ski area for more than 100 miles). But in torrential rain and gathering darkness we managed to lay our hands on a Chevrolet truck and set off into the night. It was 50 miles from Temuco to the nearest snow. Over half the distance was along unpaved and deeply pot-holed roads, with several sections under water. We had to drive past vehicles trapped in the flood amid uprooted drainage pipes. Fortunately we did not become bogged down ourselves or we would have been unable to ski for the first time during our travels. It was a truly wretched night, and the 'skiing', in fields and along the road in almost total darkness and pouring rain - was grim. So was our return journey. The following day we had to repeat the whole process before boarding an all-night train to take us north back to Santiago, and on to what promised to be the best skiing region in the southern hemisphere: the three resorts of La Parva, Valle Nevado and El Colorado - the nearest thing in South America to France's Trois Vallees. At least it was daylight this time, and the flood waters had receded. We took the ancient train from Temuco to Santiago and slumbered fitfully as the ancient locomotive built up speed on its way towards the Chilean capital. We dreamt of volcanoes and condors. Or was it champagne and smoked salmon by the Thames at Henley? Our travel arrangements ware made by Passage To South America, 41, North End Road, West Kensington, London W14. Tel:071-602 9889. We stayed at the Club Hotel Las Lomas De Correntoso in Villa La Angostura, six miles from the Cerro Bayo ski area, and at the Dut Club Hotel near Llao Llao, 13 miles from Gran Catedral ski area, Bariloche.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FACTS AND FIGURES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- JULY STATISTICS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Miles skied: 176 (Total since January 1: 2,005) Vertical feet: 200,000 (Total: 2,274,670) Vertical miles: 38 (Total: 430) Miles driven: 1,868 (Total: 20,183) Miles flown: 37 (Total: 49,817) Mileage (all means of transport) 2,523 (Total: 73,986) Resorts visited so far: 170 (US: 50; Canada: 13; Austria: 32; Italy: 11; Germany: 1; France: 24; Switzerland: 23; India: 1; Japan: 4; Chile: 9; Argentina: 2)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- RESORTS SKIED IN JULY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Chile: Valle Nevado; La Parva; El Colorado; Las Araucarias (Llaima); Villarrica-Pucon; Antillanca.

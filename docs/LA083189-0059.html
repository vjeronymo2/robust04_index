			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Over in Stockholm, Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman is suing a tabloid for  symbolic damages of one crown (15 cents), saying it broke the copyright to his  memoirs. The film director and his publishers took the evening newspaper  Aftonbladet to court this week, charging that it published an article based on  unedited material from his biography, "Laterna Magica," before it was published  in 1987. Aftonbladet's editor, Thorbjorn Larsson, denied the charge, saying the  article was based on interviews, books and television programs.ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

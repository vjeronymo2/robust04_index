			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (9): How to enjoy the best of both worlds - Case Study / Working from home is a privilege but sometimes it can be difficult to split work and home life Helene Hook has the best of both worlds. She works for a well-established software house, part of ICL, called CPS. But she also works at home, in the study of her detached house on the outskirts of Twyford, near Reading. It's a pleasant spot: a string of detached homes in spacious gardens faces hedges and open fields across the lane. Hidden in the grass by the turning is an old-fashioned milestone, with the surprising legend 'Hyde Park 33 miles'. The stone, probably dating from the 1820s, could have been tailor-made for Helene, who moved here two years ago from Marble Arch in central London. She has been a programmer since 1973 and has worked from home since 1985 when she joined CPS as marketing manager. The company then had a turnover of Pounds 1m and employed 150 people. Two people work directly for Helene. She keeps in touch with them and others in the company both by phone and electronic mail, and a secretary comes in weekly to help with filing and administration. Technical support comes from the CPS Reading office which houses financial and support staff. 'Technical support is vital because our work involves constant changes of equipment. Technical support configures the systems and supplies us with excellent 'noddy' guides, so everything comes pre-tested and any new implementations take an hour or less. This saves a lot of time, but it's the kind of thing other, non-IT organisation may not realise when setting up home-working schemes.' Other CPS workers are also home-based, but very mobile, visiting client sites twice weekly on average. Salaries are commensurate with other parts of ICL, anywhere between Pounds 12,000 for junior programmers up to Pounds 30,000 a year for managers. Helene believes this way of working has already become more socially acceptable. Home-working was originally associated with women whose domestic duties as mothers keep them home-tied, but she predicts that caring for elderly relatives will soon become another motive for teleworking. 'It's a wonderful, flexible lifestyle because people are in control of their own time. Of course, there are demands and obligations, meetings and site visits and the like, but even if they're working 37.5 hours a week, they are doing it on their own terms.' In Helene's experience, most people feel it is a privilege to work at home and would not exchange the lifestyle for the more conventional nine-to-five grind. 'People get used to no commuting and working in an environment of their own choice.' Although there's an effort made to bring teams together from the immediate locale, there are far-flung CPS specialists in Scotland and Wales, including one hill farmer. Electronic mail - 'I have grown to love it', says Helene - keeps them all in touch. She does not feel at all cut off, and sees no problem in creating a feeling for company culture. 'We meet people face-to-face a great deal - at ICL training courses, conferences and other get-togethers - as well as receiving booklets and other publications on the ICL way of doing things.' CPS takes great care with recruitment, demanding five years' experience and checking motivation, commitment and working patterns at interview. But management of people thereafter demands the sort of discipline that should underpin any office procedure, remote or not. 'Ensuring quality is down to following procedure. We've been BS5750-qualified since 1989, and all staff have to know our procedures. For off-site working we have to be very formal about setting objectives, monitoring progress on projects, what you expect of people, and what they have to deliver.' CPS, set up as a home-working company in the IT area, is acutely aware that its own obligations, such as health and safety regulations, are less easy to ensure (and enforce) in people's homes. Helene spends a couple of hours at the screen daily and is careful to take breaks, and use a correctly-adjusted chair. 'Most of this is common sense and we rely on employees to assess themselves, but new employees get a start-up pack on how to arrange the equipment.' The room where she works is lined with books and acts as a wine store and, she emphasises, is a general study for the house, not just her office. Although CPS supplies and pays for the hardware, Helene has invested about Pounds 100 in a rack which stacks PC, fax, modem, and other hardware in one corner, leaving the desk free for paperwork. There are few disadvantages, apart from the occasional intrusion on home life when Helene's husband and two children are at home. 'It can be hard to split work and home life - one thing I can never ignore is the fax tone. And calls out of hours can be tricky: little faces come round the door if I'm still on the phone after five minutes.' With the new array of mobile technology - laptops and mobile phones - she believes a new 'mobile army' of workers will emerge. Another factor here is the recession, as companies have sought to reduce fixed costs. 'Instead of huge corporations, many are working towards a central core of fixed costs and mobile, home-based contract staff on the fringes.' Clients think no less of her for being home-based, she finds. 'Suddenly it's not second-class any more. Once employers have experienced the gains in productivity that result, they're convinced, whereas before they were concerned at losing their empire. Now they don't worry about work being done by people they can't see.' She concludes: 'People won't want to work in London if there are many more bomb attacks. Teleworking is the ultimate decentralisation.'

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sunleigh rises 30% to Pounds 270,000 Sunleigh, the leisure products company, reported pre-tax profits up by 30 per cent from Pounds 208,000 to Pounds 270,000 for the six months to end-June. The outcome was struck on turnover down from Pounds 8.94m to Pounds 7.98m, although last year's figure included Pounds 263,000 from discontinued operations. Earnings per share increased from 0.05p to 0.12p, reflecting the lower proportion of group profits derived from Gavel, in which there is a 36 per cent minority shareholder. The Pounds 17.9m acquisition of Maclaren Group, the pushchairs maker, was completed on June 30, when the shares gained a full listing.</p>

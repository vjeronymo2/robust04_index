			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Iraq launches attack on rebels' marsh stronghold IRAQ has launched a heavy offensive against Shia rebels in the country's southern marshlands, Iraqi opposition groups claimed yesterday. Troops backed by tanks and artillery have launched a three-pronged attack in the marshes, killing or wounding hundreds, the Iran-based Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq said. Iraqi opposition groups in London said three Iraqi divisions have been employed in the offensive since April 15, the third attack reported by rebel groups in the south since March. Fighting is said to have centred on Basra, Amara and Nasiriyah - centres of Shia Moslem revolt crushed by Iraqi troops a year ago. The attack follows sporadic shelling of Kurdish towns in northern Iraq and intensified concern in London, Washington and Paris about an Iraqi military build up north of the protected 36th parallel. Iraqi troops are reported to have begun draining large areas of marshland to establish a presence there, after having airdropped leaflets to the thousands of Shia sheltering in the marshes, offering them financial rewards to come out of hiding.</p>

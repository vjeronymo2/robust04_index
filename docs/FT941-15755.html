			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: David Smith declines to Pounds 14m - Shares rise 18p on news of smaller than expected profits fall David S Smith (Holdings), the paper, packaging and office supplies group, yesterday reported a 10 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 13.7m, but said there were signs of a recovery in the market. Mr Peter Williams, chief executive, said growth in demand in the UK corrugated market had averaged about 3 per cent last year, but had reached 8 per cent in recent months. There had also been a recent 'uptick' in France. 'Last year we felt the UK economy was on the rebound, but it slowed down over the summer. We feel the recovery has accelerated again,' he said. The profits fall in the six months to October 30 was smaller than many analysts had expected, and the shares closed up 18p at 456p. Group turnover rose 31 per cent to Pounds 338m (Pounds 259m), thanks largely to a three-month contribution from Spicers, the office products wholesaler acquired for Pounds 91m. Excluding Spicers, turnover was up 3 per cent. But low paper prices, due to depressed demand and competition from cheap imports from Germany, meant operating profits - excluding a Pounds 3.9m contribution from Spicers - fell from Pounds 19.6m to Pounds 15.6m. David S Smith Packaging, Regis Paper, and Kaysersberg in France all reduced their contributions. The group operating margin, excluding Spicers, fell from 7.6 per cent to 5.9 per cent. Increased interest charges of Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 4.4m) reflected higher borrowings due to the capital investment programme, likely to be about Pounds 60m this year. Much of that has been spent on the development programme of the Kemsley mill, now completed. Mr Williams said Kemsley's new paper machine had started up in November, and was on target to reach its annual production level of 200,000 tonnes of recycled packaging papers. Earnings fell to 9.3p (12p), but the interim dividend is maintained at 2.75p. COMMENT David S Smith has been a 'jam tomorrow' story for some time, but yesterday's better than expected results suggest that tomorrow may at last be on its way. Whether or not paper prices recover, completion of the Kemsley mill redevelopment should convert operating losses there into a profit next year, and gives Smith a low-cost facility to compete with continental European producers. Smith has successfully integrated Spicers, and is hopeful of turning around Spicers France. Demand in its main markets shows sign of picking up, and Smith could ride the recovery both in the UK and France. Full-year forecasts of about Pounds 32m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 22 - a substantial premium to the sector - but that falls to 17 on forecasts of Pounds 48m in 1995.</p>

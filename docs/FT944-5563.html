			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Holderbank turns higher after anti-cartel fines Further action was seen among cement shares in response to European Union anti-cartel fines. Switzerland's Holderbank jumped SFr16 to SFr1,045, off a high of SFr1,070, in reply to a much lower than expected penalty. The company, which is to appeal, has said the fine would have no bearing on its forecast for 1994 profits, which calls for a 37 per cent rise to SFr600m. In France, Lafarge Coppee dropped FFr14.30 to FFr398.80 amid profit-taking after Wednesday's 4 per cent advance. The company said the fine would not change its 1994 outlook. Ciments Francais gave up FFr8.30 to FFr157.90, and said it would make provision for the fine in its account. Italy's Italcementi, which has a controlling interest in Ciments Francais and which tumbled 1.7 per cent on Wednesday, rallied L274 to L10,569. Italmobiliare, its parent, was L820 higher at L34,500. MILAN moved ahead 1.2 per cent on the back of the agreement between the government and unions on pension reform that lifted the threat of a general strike today. Volume, at below L400bn, remained thin, however, amid worries that the accord offered no guarantees that promised reforms would be carried out and that tough decisions had only been postponed. The Comit index rose 7.17 to 632.89. Credito Italiano appreciated L40 to L1,628 as speculation grew that it would price its new offer for Credito Romagnolo at around L20,000 a share, below previous estimates of L21,000 to L23,000. Romagnolo retreated L295 to L17,369. AMSTERDAM was slightly weaker, the AEX index slipping 1.22 to 408.18. In a major review of the market, Smith New Court noted that after two years of outperformance of cyclicals, the market had been rotating towards defensive, financial and growth stocks. 'A more selective attitude towards cyclicals as well as increased emphasis on growth stocks is recommended in an environment of continued low interest rates.' Looking forward the broker noted that while there was pressure on cyclicals it recommended an exposure to those which were least affected by the inability to pass on raw material and commodity price increases and whose earnings growth was least likely to surprise on the downside. These would fall into two categories, said Smith New Court: companies benefiting from rising commodity prices, such as Hoogovens and DSM, and those where the large proportion of the expected improvement in earnings was driven by factors such as cost cutting, for instance Hoogovens, DSM and KLM. FRANKFURT ended an uninspired session with a slight loss, which widened fractionally in post-bourse trading. The Dax dipped 1.67 to 2,046.59, and to 2,045.54 in the Ibis. Turnover reflected the lack of interest, a scant DM4.6bn. Reviewing the market's performance during November, Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck commented that hopes for a year-end rally now looked improbable, with sentiment getting worse. The Dax index fell just over 1 per cent on the month and is down nearly 10 per cent since January. Interest rate-sensitive stocks showed relative strength during both October and November, he added. Among those stocks yesterday, Commerzbank was ahead DM2.50 at DM326.30 and Deutsche Bank DM2.50 higher at DM743.50. ZURICH was lower in very quiet trade, lacking fresh factors to trade on, and the SMI index fell 18.9 to 2,576.0. SMH bearers lost SFr8 at SFr628, after a session's low of SFr612, continuing a slide prompted by a flurry of downward revisions of earnings forecasts by analysts who doubted that Christmas sales could compensate for negative currency effects. The stock has fallen by 12.3 per cent over the last fortnight, prompting some analysts to put the shares on hold, viewing the decline as excessive. PARIS saw slippage and the CAC-40 index ended down 11.99 at 1,963.95. Turnover was light at just under FFr3.8bn. It was difficult to discern any particular themes, although the retailing sector showed a mixed response to disappointing November sales data: Carrefour rose FFr32 to FFr2,270, while Casino was off FFr5.90 at FFr158.60. MADRID edged lower as losses elsewhere in Europe brought out sellers. The general index closed 1.03 easier at 300.53. Santander Investment commented that Spanish stocks should thrive next year on expectations of good earnings and relatively stable long-term interest rates, and forecast that the general index was likely to climb to between 350 and 360 by the end of 1995. It said smaller cyclical stocks and consumer related shares would outperform the market in 1995, the former helped by expected strong growth in exports of goods and services. ISTANBUL finished at a third consecutive 11-month high in spite of profit-taking which erased most of the morning gains. Volume of TL6,690bn was a new record high. The composite index finished 246.2 or 0.9 per cent stronger at 28,427.24, taking gains over the last week to 6.5 per cent. Ms Nur Pekin, Turkish analyst at Schroders, said that the recent strength in the market, mainly during the past two weeks, had been the result of two factors: speculation by investors on publicly owned companies which could be privatised, and a reduction in interest rates which had caused a flight of capital into equities.

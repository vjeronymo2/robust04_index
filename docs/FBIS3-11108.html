Last year's trade deficit reached 3.6 billion  pesos. But the members of the economic team do not seem to be  worried.    As a counterbalance, it was officially announced that the  February inflation rate was zero, while wholesale prices dropped  0.2 percent.    Economic Programming Secretary Juan Llach said that with  these results Argentina has reached the cost of living  percentage of the developed countries. Reaching a trade balance  in the short term is, however, very far away.    LA NACION was able to learn from a reliable source at the  Economy Ministry that December 1993 imports reached 1.55 billion  pesos and exports 1.05 billion pesos.    For some analysts, the figures for the first 11 months of  last year published by INDEC [National Institute of Statistics  and Census] should cause alarm. In 1992 the negative balance  reached 2.8 billion pesos, and in only one year the trade  balance has registered a significant deficit.    During 1993 the deficit grew more than was expected by  Economy Ministry officials, who find an explanation in an  increase of capital goods imports.    They said: "The country is re-equipping itself."    But the truth is that the increase in capital goods imports  was minimal compared to the high increase in the balance of  payments. In 1992 the increase in the balance was 37.5 percent,  while in 1993 imports grew 40.9 percent.    A difference in the deficit of 700 million pesos in 12  months  is not small, and everything seems to indicate that this trend  will continue.    In 1993 exports grew at a rate of 7 percent, while imports  went over that figure, reaching an 11 percent increase.    The arguments used by the aides of Economy Minister Domingo  Cavallo have created concern among some analysts, who do not  doubt their assertion that the same negative trend will continue  in the next few months.    Trade with the United States would be one of the main  reasons  that the Argentine trade balance is in the red every month. Of  the total deficit, about 2.2 billion pesos is reportedly with  that country.    Argentine imports from NAFTA were 18.3 percent higher than  in  1992.    Of the 3.7062 billion pesos in imports, 92 percent came from  the United States.    The other face of the coin was improvement in trade with  Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. In this case the  negative balance was reduced by three-quarters as compared to  the trade deficit of 1992.    The deficit was 500 million pesos in 1992, while in 1993 the  deficit was only 146 million pesos.    In the first 11 months of 1993 imports increased by 31.9  percent in capital goods, 5.2 percent in vehicles, 7.7 percent  in consumer goods, and 7.1 percent in intermediate products.    Another reason why the trade balance continues to be  negative  is the lack of exports by car manufacturers.    It has been learned that the auto industry has a debt of  approximately $300 million, without counting the 21,000 cars and  spare parts included in Protocol 21 (agreement with Brazil).    The destinations of Argentine exports were: $2.5218 billion  to Brazil, $1.187 billion to the Netherlands, and $1.1294  billion to the United States. The total sales represent 40  percent of the sales abroad.    The main Argentine imports came from: the United States,  with  $3.411 billion; Brazil, with $3.219 billion; Germany, with  $921.7 million; and Italy, with $879.5 million.    INDEC also confirmed that during the first 11 months of  1993,  27.3 percent of exports were products of the industrial sector,  37.6 percent from the agricultural sector, and 26 percent were  primary products.    This shows a drop in the exports of agricultural products  and  an increase from 22.7 to 27.3 percent of industrial products.    This week Industry Secretary Carlos Magarinos will announce  a  package of measures to help regional economies. New instruments  are expected to be implemented to improve exports.    There are indications the economic team is working to try to  cover the hole produced by the overevaluation of the local  currency.    We will have to wait.</p>

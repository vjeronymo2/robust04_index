			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Feel the quality, not the quantity: As the UK economic recovery gathers pace, are manufacturers investing enough Mr Ian Cooper struggles to contain his excitement. 'It's as though there is no tomorrow. Business is colossal. We can't accept orders until the New Year.' The chairman of Cooper Clegg, a Gloucestershire colour printing business, has not seen anything like it since starting the company 10 years ago. This year he is spending Pounds 7m on machinery but the company will still not meet demand. Next year, capital expenditure should double. 'We weren't slow in implementing an investment programme but we underestimated the strength of the recovery,' Mr Cooper emphasises. 'Big holiday companies wanting 1995 brochures are placing contracts elsewhere in Europe because there is no capacity here. It's like the bad old days when the UK lost out because it couldn't cope with demand,' he adds. Mr Cooper's words will cause concern among those anxious that the vision of sustained recovery offered by low inflation, cheap money and steady growth could be under threat. They fear that, with retail sales rising, manufacturers' stocks falling and spare capacity dwindling, British industry's failure to spend soon enough and widely enough to replace capacity lost during the recession could again spoil a nascent upturn. The nightmare - a depressing replay of Britain's economic record - would be a manufacturing sector unable to meet demand, mounting supply constraints, rising inflation and another upsurge in imports. So far at least, the pressures experienced by Cooper Clegg appear rare. But given increasingly optimistic growth forecasts for the economy this year opinion remains divided on whether another boom-bust cycle can be avoided. Although the government is predicting only a modest 2.75 per cent growth in GDP this year, GDP in the three months to June was 3.7 higher than the same period last year. Mr David Miles, UK economist at Merrill Lynch, says that, given the accelerating pace of economic growth, investment activity must rise rapidly in the next two years if industry is to avoid overheating. But Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Saloman Brothers, is not alone in identifying an investment pick-up on a scale which should be sufficient to avoid severe capacity problems. He also makes the point that the more flexible labour market which now exists might succeed in avoiding a repeat of past shortages of skilled labour. Last week's official figures from the Central Statistical Office, which show a long-awaited rise in manufacturing investment during the second quarter of 1994, mirror other surveys by business organisations indicating an improvement in companies' investment intentions. This trend has given rise to some optimism, though the pattern of investment spending remains volatile and there have been statistical 'false starts' in the two years since the recovery began. While the latest Confederation of British Industry industrial trends survey for the three months to July indicated rising investment optimism within the motor industry and among building material producers and electronics companies, the picture was much less buoyant within the aerospace, chemicals, and food and drink sectors. Even if a patchy upturn in capital spending is under way - fuelled by growing confidence, rising profits, low capital costs and increasingly healthy corporate balance sheets - there is much lost ground to make up. Since investment in UK manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 per cent of total UK investment, peaked in 1989 it has fallen by almost one third, bringing it to its lowest level, as a proportion of gross domestic product, for more than 30 years. The collapse in investment may not, however, have been quite as bad as first appears. Part of the fall may reflect lower prices for plant, machinery and property. The decrease may also mirror a growing tendency among manufacturers to contract out work which is then classified as service industry expenditure. Yet nobody is making light of the decline. In the machine tools sector, capital investment 'fell off a cliff' during the recession, according to the Machine Tool Trades Association. In 1990, UK machine tool makers were spending a total of Pounds 34m a month on new plant and equipment, a figure which dropped to Pounds 14m by March 1993. It is now back to only Pounds 20m. The reluctance of many companies to sanction fresh capital expenditure follows the mauling they received during the recession and the need to rebuild balance sheets. Mr Robert Barrie, UK economist at stockbrokers BZW, points out that much of the corporate sector remains highly debt conscious and is still repaying debts incurred in the 1980s. Companies are still reluctant to borrow more from the banks. But the availability of cash from within increasingly profitable companies may well help finance a significant expansion in investment programmes, he added. Cash, however, is not the only factor. Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, has repeatedly warned that the refusal by companies to adjust investment criteria in the face of low inflation and cheaper finance is frustrating badly needed investment. A recent CBI survey of investment criteria found that most UK companies were insisting on pay-back periods of two to three years or a return on capital of at least 20 per cent - or both. Taken at face value, such expectations exceed by a wide margin the investment performance required by many of the UK's manufacturing competitors. The Bank's criticism of companies' stubborn insistence on high investment returns is angrily rebutted by much of the corporate sector itself, which insists that the crucial factor limiting investment is expected demand. But it is clear that the government faces a difficult task in persuading companies to share its rosy economic assumptions. 'There is still a great deal of cynicism over whether inflation has been licked. Living with it has become a way of life and industry will need to see it stay low for a long time before they change their approach to investment,' says Lord Weir, chairman of Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering business. 'Who can blame people for not investing? In the paper-making business they've faced rotten demand and rotten margins and now confront pressures on raw material prices,' says Mr John Lloyd, managing director of Portals, the international bank note and specialist paper maker which has bucked the trend by recently investing Pounds 19m in new machinery to safeguard its market. Serious and widespread supply bottlenecks still appear some way off, despite CBI hints that a few are on the horizon. Many general engineering companies, in particular, are still reporting under-used capacity. Indeed, current order books for UK machine tool makers show that while their overseas sales are rising rapidly as companies expand and update equipment, domestic order books remain worryingly flat. While companies such as Weir have maintained investment programmes throughout the recession, much of the emphasis has been on improving manufacturing competitiveness and efficiency rather than on additional capacity. 'It is the quality of investment which is going to matter most,' stresses Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley. 'It would be much more desirable to have an increase in investment focused on those industries in which the UK has a chance of boosting market share than a massive, across-the-board binge that leads back to another volatile swing in the business cycle.' The quality-before-quantity strategy is echoed by other companies like Devro, the Scottish-based sausage casing manufacturer, which has invested throughout the recession in high-technology equipment and in research and development. According to Dr Graeme Alexander, Devro chief executive: 'In bad times, too many people take too short-term a view and just cut costs. But you mortgage your future if you cut costs on technological development.' FKI, the Halifax-based electrical engineering and electronic components group last year raised its capital spending programme to Pounds 20m and this year will spend nearly Pounds 27m. Mr Bob Beeston, FKI chief executive, says raising capacity has not been the priority: 'We have, for example, introduced computer-aided design equipment to help improve the throughput of engineering designs onto the shop floor and spent resources on improving environmental standards.' Earlier this year, FKI paid nearly Pounds 26m for Rhombus, a German castor manufacturer which had become vulnerable to takeover in part because of a big capital spending programme on plant which was heavily under-utilised during the recession. 'Investing for capacity is not the only game,' Mr Beeston adds. But despite occasional strategic errors by German companies, they have consistently pursued more effective, long-term capital investment programmes than their UK counterparts, giving them a vital competitive edge over UK manufacturing in world markets. In launching the government's drive to improve British industry's competitiveness earlier this year, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, warned that UK manufacturing productivity was 25 per cent below that of its main European rivals. The pattern is repeated when it comes to capital investment. Although international comparisons are difficult, figures suggest that UK investment, in relation to GDP, is not only consistently lower than in countries such as Germany, France and Italy but has been far more erratic. The performance has been in part responsible for a decline over decades in Britain's share by volume of world manufacturing exports. It stabilised, however, during the 1980s at about 6 per cent, less than half that of Germany. 'An investment recovery is under way but the real concern is the continuing, chronic problem of low investment, which the cyclical upturn in capital spending is not going to resolve,' says Mr Ian Thompson, chief economist at the Engineering Employers' Federation. 'Britain simply does not have a manufacturing capacity of sufficient breadth and depth to make it fully competitive. The government must take steps towards changing the anti-investment bias built into corporate taxation.' The view is shared by organisations such as the British Chambers of Commerce, which wants investment programmes in excess of five years duration exempt from capital gains tax. The CBI, too, wants reform of capital gains tax in the belief that investors would be more inclined to take returns in the form of capital gains, thereby relieving pressures on companies to pay high dividends. The CBI is also calling for a more generous system of capital allowances and cuts in corporation tax to make available higher levels of retained earnings for reinvestment. As Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, assembles his 1994 budget plans, he will be left in no doubt that extending a helping hand to investment is high on the wish-list of a manufacturing sector that has to haul itself up into the first division. But with such pleadings now part of the perennial, pre-budget lobbying Treasury ministers will be equally keen to emphasise the role which industry itself must play in solving its own structural problems. They continue, for example, to point the finger at high dividend payments as one obstacle to higher investment. The CBI is also pursuing its joint initiative with the City to overcome the short-termism which business says has frustrated long-term investment in fixed capital, research and development and training. Mr Nick Kuenssberg, managing director of Dawson International, the knitwear and clothing group, also wants government help, but of a different kind. 'I would like it to get a grip on itself. If they want the feel good factor to return they must show they are really in control, that they did plan the recovery and that they will support the marketplace. We have low inflation and low inflationary expectations; to even hint of an increase in interest rates now is completely nuts.' Like any sensible businessman, FKI's Bob Beeston is not going to reject any beneficial changes in taxation or capital allowances. But he adds: 'It is, in the end, up to a company to keep its eye on the ball, look after its customers, think ahead and make enough profits to invest for the future. It is the corporate culture that needs changing; Britain has some damn good manufacturing companies but nothing like enough.'</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Insurers poised to move to Lloyd's INSURANCE companies in significant numbers are poised to move their operations in the London market to the Lloyd's of London building, underlining growing links between Lloyd's and the conventional company insurance market. A number of companies - including Anglo American and American International Group - are already close to signing agreements to rent space on the third floor of Lloyd's. Altogether, 20 companies have expressed interest in moving to the market's glass-and-steel headquarters. The greater physical integration between Lloyd's and the London company market comes as Lloyd's works on the possible attraction of corporate capital to the market in the wake of last January's Rowland task force report. The Lloyd's council recently introduced regulations allowing syndicates to make more use of outside reinsurers. Lloyd's is keen to increase rental income after a fall in the number of syndicates at the market. More than 120 syndicates have either closed or merged in the past 18 months, leaving one of the four underwriting floors vacant and another under-occupied. Office space at Lloyd's is much more expensive than elsewhere in London, even though the figure of Pounds 125 a sq ft includes all services costs apart from telecommunications, according to Mr Nick Phillips, general manager of property at Lloyd's. But if companies operate on the same basis as Lloyd's syndicates (running their underwriting operations in an open-plan office alongside other insurers), they are likely to occupy less space than they would do in a typical office. Companies could also win greater amounts of business by being attached to Lloyd's, which Mr Phillips described as 'a mecca for brokers'. Insurance companies rented offices at Lloyd's previous headquarters in Lime Street until 1986, although they did not operate like Lloyd's underwriters.</p>

NODONG SINMUN says that the proclamation of the programme by  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 20 years ago was a  historical event which opened the road of a revolutionary turn  in the building of the Workers' Party of Korea and in the  struggle of the popular masses for socialism.    The paper quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as  saying:    "Our revolution has greeted a new upsurge under the guidance  of Comrade Kim Chong-il. It was since the start of his guidance  that a new turn began to take place not only in the party work  but also in the work of the political, economic and cultural  domains and great innovations and upsurge have been effected in  all the fields of socialist construction."    The paper says:    The 20 years since the proclamation of the programme of  modelling the whole society on the chuche idea have been decades  of gigantic creation and construction in which all the spheres  of social life have been thoroughly transformed our own way,  with a tight grasp on the idea and theory of the dear leader as  the lifeline of the Korean revolution, decades of a proud  struggle and victory in resolutely defending and glorifying  socialism, determinedly smashing all challenges and obstructions  of the imperialists and the reactionaries.    In the course of the efforts to implement this programme,  our  party's revolutionary line of independence, self-sustenance and  self-reliance in defence has been strictly applied in all  domains of the state activities and social life and Korean-style  socialism has been strengthened and developed into the most  solid and viable socialism remaining unshaken in any storm.    And it must be noted that in the struggle to imbue the whole  army with the chuche idea, the Korean People's Army has been  built up into combat ranks of a-match-for-a-hundred soldiers  ready to devote their youth and lives for the party and the  leader, into invincible army equipped with modern means of  attack and defence of our style. This is a proud success defying  comparison.    The Korean people have been able to effect changes of the  century in all sectors of the revolution and construction under  the slogan of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea and  they owe all this to the wise guidance of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il.    All the party members and other working people should hegard  it as their first and foremost task to arm themselves firmly  with the idea and theories of the dear leader, the basis of our  singlehearted unity, and should resolutely defend and glorify  the leadership exploits of our party through the application of  the chuche idea.    MINJU CHOSON calls upon all the officials and working people  to increase the might of our motherland in every way and carry  to accomplishment the revolutionary cause of chuche started in  the secret forest of Paektu by more resolutely fighting in  singlehearted unity around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il,  deeply cherishing the great national honour and happiness in  living and making revolution under the leadership of the  illustrious leader.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] North Korea will have to face hard times, Ukrainian  Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told journalists on Tuesday [14  June].    Commenting on the decision of North Korea to cease its  participation in the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA],  Zlenko said he believed it would be very difficult to confront  the whole world community which stands for the elimination of  nuclear weapons.    Zlenko repeated that the position of Ukraine had been made  clear during the recent visit of the North Korean foreign  minister. He said Ukraine was hoping that North Korea was  moving towards a non-nuclear status. On this basis, Kiev is  ready to cooperate with North Korea, Zlenko added.</p>

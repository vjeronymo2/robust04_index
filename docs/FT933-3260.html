			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Arafat put to the test over declaration, says Rabin - How the PLO leader must balance himself between Israel's demands and his constituents' expectations THE SOMBRE note struck on Monday evening by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, following the signing of the declaration of principles with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, underlines just how much negotiating work has to be done before either side can feel confident about the intentions of the other. While acknowledging the commitments made by Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, in agreeing the document, Mr Rabin said he would believe that a real breakthrough had been made only if the PLO fulfilled its pledges. 'We have decided to take a chance, to put him to the test,' said Mr Rabin. Much of Mr Rabin's caution inevitably stems from the long and bloody history of Israel-PLO relations. But the publication of the declaration of principles signed at the White House also reveals the extent to which Mr Arafat appears to have compromised on the declared aims of the Palestinian negotiating team during the previous rounds of talks in Washington. Whether those compromises are primarily a tactical shift by Mr Arafat to win Israeli recognition for the PLO and reassert his weakening hold on the organisation, or represent a more fundamental reappraisal of what the Palestinians can realistically hope to achieve, should slowly emerge as the negotiators seek to put flesh on the broad principles that have been agreed. The two critical areas will be security, which is likely to be Mr Rabin's personal touchstone in judging the performance of the PLO, and on the extent to which the Palestinians will accept far more limited powers for the interim self-governing authority than they had previously demanded. Mr Arafat has accepted that the Palestinian Interim Self-Governing Authority, which will administer 'West Bank and Gaza strip territory' for a five-year period, will not touch on such issues as the status of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, refugees, security arrangements and relations with neighbouring countries. Instead it will administer areas such as education, health, welfare and tourism, while also building up a local police force, a role previously rejected by the Palestinian negotiating team as being akin to acting as the administrators for the occupation force. They had said repeatedly that such a deal would not be acceptable to the majority of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Instead they demanded an elected authority with important legislative functions, which would also have some competence on highly contentious issues such as the ownership of land and the utilisation of water resources. The ambition of the Palestinian team at the earlier rounds of Washington talks had clearly been to acquire as many of the attributes of a future independent state as possible, while Israel was equally determined to resist making such concessions. If, as seems possible, Mr Arafat has in large part abandoned that aim, the negotiations over the powers assigned to the interim self-governing authority could proceed relatively smoothly. But if the PLO leader finds it increasingly difficult to build and sustain a Palestinian consensus once the initial euphoria of international recognition subsides, then the issues which blocked progress at the Washington negotiations could quickly resurface. The challenge of reconciliation among the Palestinians in the occupied territories will bear even more heavily on the issue of security. Within three months Israel and the PLO are due to have concluded an agreement providing for the redeployment of Israel military forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area and the phased introduction of a Palestinian police force. Until very recently, Mr Rabin's premiership had been notable primarily for its vigorous response to security issues. The ejection of over 400 Palestinians from the occupied territories last December, the subsequent travel ban on Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza into Israel, and the week-long bombardment of Lebanon all confirmed that for Mr Rabin the safety of Israelis came before building confidence that might promote peace. While Mr Rabin might now fairly reflect that his toughness paid off, it would be unwise of Mr Arafat to assume that the Washington agreement will soften the Israeli response to further outbreaks of Palestinian violence. In addition, the declaration of principles commits the the new Palestinian police force to co-operate with Israeli security forces in combating Hamas and other radical Islamic groups in the territories which remain committed to the armed struggle. And even after the redeployment of the Israeli army, Mr Arafat has agreed that Israelis, military and civilian, may continue to use roads freely within the Gaza Strip and Jericho. All this leaves the PLO leader with a huge, and probably contradictory, list of requirements to fulfil. Balancing himself between the demands of Mr Rabin and the expectations of his constituents could well prove the greatest test yet for Mr Arafat's formidable powers of survival.</p>

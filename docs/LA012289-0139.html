			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME ALONE IN FIRST AFTER VICTORY OVER BELL-JEFF  </P> <P> It began like a horse race, evolved into a prize fight and ended with Notre  Dame High hitting the jackpot.  </P> <P> The Knights held all the winning numbers Saturday night, and the prize was sole  possession of first place in the San Fernando Valley League as Notre Dame  rolled over Bell-Jeff, 87-71, before a jam-packed Bell-Jeff gym.  </P> <P> Ken Hicks and Brian Jones -- take your Division I pick -- dominated the  showdown, scoring 35 and 31 points, respectively, while conducting a  3-point-shot seminar.  </P> <P> Hicks, on his way to Stanford next season, made 4 of 10 3-point shots while  Jones, who has drawn interest from Baylor, Pepperdine and Texas El Paso, made 5  of 8.  </P> <P> Notre Dame (10-8, 4-0 in league play) made 31 of 55 shots overall (56%),  including a sizzling 10 of 11 in the final period.  </P> <P> "This game, I'd say definitely, I was pumped," Hicks said.  </P> <P> Bell-Jeff, meanwhile, was deflated. The Guards (15-2, 3-1), who entered the  game with 4 players averaging in double figures, kept 3-point pace in a quick  first quarter, taking a 21-20 lead at the break.  </P> <P> But before the game's final buzzer, 3 of the 4 -- Nick Sanderson (24 points, 4  3-point baskets), Chris Dyer (17 points) and Ray Witt (8 points) -- had fouled  out, and the fourth, Joe Dunn (14 points), was teetering with his fourth foul.  </P> <P> The game also featured a brawl that resulted in the ejection of 2 players and a  Notre Dame fan.  </P> <P> Things became so chaotic at one point that an official inquired at the scorers'  table if there were any police present.  </P> <P> "The cheap shots," a disgusted Notre Dame Coach Mick Cady said, "the people  don't come out here to see that. Really, you want to play good, hard  basketball. All this bush-league stuff is on the side."  </P> <P> With 2:51 remaining in the third quarter, Notre Dame's Pico Sandoval and  Bell-Jeff's Matt Corse were ejected after coming to blows during a stoppage in  play.  </P> <P> Tempers had already flared under both baskets and tempers continued to heat up  even after the skirmish, which drew a fan from the stands and created a  15-minute delay.  </P> <P> "Corse is our best defensive player," said Bell-Jeff Coach Joe Dunn, who  conducted a 30-minute, closed-door team meeting after the game. "If he was  guarding me and in my face all the time, I'd be angry, too.  </P> <P> "We lost more than they did."  </P> <P> Hicks set the first-half tempo with a 3-point swish before the game was 5  seconds old.  </P> <P> Hicks hit another 3-point shot and Jones and Mike Rimkunas each connected from  long distance. But Bell-Jeff answered with 3 3-pointers from Sanderson to take  an early second-quarter lead.  </P> <P> Sanderson's first 3 baskets were 3-point shots, including a cruise missile from  well behind the perimeter line at the top of the key.  </P> <P> Notre Dame continued the long-distance shooting in the second half, parlaying a  16-4 run into a 46-35 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Hicks made 2 more 3-point shots and scored 10 points, and Jones, hitting from  everywhere, scored 11 points in the quarter.  </P> <P> Bell-Jeff never came closer than 63-57 with 6:42 remaining in the third  quarter. Hicks scored 15 and Jones 13 in the second half. The pair also teamed  for a Jones-breakaway-hit-Hicks-the-trailer-for-a-monster-jam that iced the  game, 81-65, with 2 minutes to play.  </P></p>

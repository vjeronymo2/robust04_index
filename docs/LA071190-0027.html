			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPRAYINGS TARGET MOSQUITOES  </P> <P> County Environmental Health Services workers are spraying a neighborhood near  the Tijuana River this week in an effort to reduce the mosquito population and  prevent an outbreak of diseases the pests carry.  </P> <P> The sprayings, which began Tuesday night and will continue through Thursday,  will take place along the riverbed east of 19th Street in Imperial Beach to the  international border and also in the Robinhood Homes subdivision, said Gary  Stephany, the health department's deputy director.  </P> <P> Health officials decided to conduct the sprayings after catching a large number  of mosquitoes in traps, including the species that sometimes carries malaria  and encephalitis, said Moise Mizrahi, a department spokesman.  </P> <P> "One small trap produced upwards of 1,000 mosquitoes," Mizrahi said.  </P> <P> No cases of disease have been reported in the area, Stephany said.  </P> <P> The neighborhood has been sprayed during each of the past four summers, partly  because mosquitoes breed particularly well in the river valley, Mizrahi said.  </P> <P> Stephany described pyrethrins, the insecticide that will be used in the  sprayings, as "relatively harmless" to humans and warm-blooded animals.  </P> <P> "Because a few people may have an allergic reaction to it, persons in the areas  being fogged should stay indoors during the process," Stephany said. "It is  recommended that pets, including birds and fish, be kept inside or covered."  </P> <P> The sprayings will occur between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. each of the three days, if  weather permits, Stephany said.  </P></p>

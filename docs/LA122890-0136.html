Alejandro Lara, 30, was sentenced by  Superior Court Commissioner Florence-Marie Cooper for the May 11, 1989, murder  of Alba Susanna Flores.  </P> <P> Lara was found guilty of murder, committing lewd acts upon a child and child  abuse. The murder trial for the girl's mother, Natividad Flores, 28, begins  next week. After her burning body was found in the park, her mother told police  that the girl had left home in anger after being refused ice cream money. She  later changed her story and said Alba was punished for refusing to take a bath.  Police said the mother admitted hitting the girl with a broom handle, kicking  her and tying her up with shoelaces in the apartment she shared with Lara.  </P></p>

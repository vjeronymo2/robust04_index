			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Delegates look back longingly to 1976: Supporters are hoping Clinton can repeat Carter's success THIS week's Democratic convention in New York is the fourth time the party has come to the Big Apple for its election year get-together, and delegates are hoping it will prove a repeat of 1976, when another little- known governor of a poor southern state arrived to accept the party's presidential nomination. On that occasion, Mr Jimmy Carter went on to win the White House from a sitting Republican president, a feat fellow-southerner Governor Bill Clinton would love to emulate. Mr David Dinkins, New York's mayor, also hopes for a reprise of 1976. At the time, the city was recovering from a severe fiscal crisis, and the convention proved a big psychological lift for New York and a minor boon for its economy. This year the city is also struggling to overcome a financial emergency, but Mr Dinkins is confident the convention will breathe fresh life into the ailing local economy. He estimates that the press coverage of the event will be worth the equivalent of Dollars 200m (Pounds 105m) in advertising expenditure (although he makes a big assumption that all the coverage will be positive about New York, which it won't). In addition, the mayor estimates that Dollars 190m will eventually be spent on preparations for the event and Dollars 110m by the convention during the week itself. On top of that, as much as Dollars 175m will come in from the general increase in economic activity around the convention centre and the city, and another Dollars 27m is expected from tax revenues. If the figures are anywhere near correct, New York should be left with a handsome profit. The cost of hosting the convention is Dollars 21m, almost all of it paid for by the city. It is interesting to compare how the Texas city of Houston is financing the costs of hosting the Republican convention next month. It has raised part of the Dollars 10m estimated costs from private sources. The rest, however, is coming from a most un-Republican source - a (read my lips) tax increase. A large part of New York's Dollars 21m outlay will be spent on security, and calming the fears of the thousands of out-of-towners attending the convention. No fewer than 2,400 police officers will patrol Madison Square Garden during the week, and their overtime will alone cost more than Dollars 6m. The area surrounding the convention venue has been cleared of drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes, and the Department of Consumer Affairs will be issuing warnings to visitors about street con artists. Private enterprise, meanwhile, should fill any gaps in security. One (probably Republican) businessman who owns a gun-permit service in Queens plans to rent bullet-proof vests to delegates for Dollars 10 a day while handing out a friendly little pamphlet called 'Welcome to Fear City'. Although New York officials deny it, pressure groups have complained that large numbers of homeless people have been cleared from the streets around the Garden in time for the convention. Even if the area was being 'tidied' up for delegates, the vast army of homeless in New York will not be totally ignored this week. Mr Jerry Brown plans to eschew the comforts of a flashy midtown hotel and spend his nights in a city shelter for homeless; the Coalition for the Homeless will hold a nightly candelight vigil; and there will be an 'Unconvention Sleep-In' in Central Park. Other alternative events include an Unconventionals Crash the Convention Concert organised by local anarchists, the Reverend Al Sharpton's Black Agenda March, a No Police State March, and an Unconventional Smoke-In at Washington Square to campaign for legalised marijuana. One wonders if Governor Bill Clinton, a self-confessed marijuana user (but not inhaler) will attend. Finally, a note about media overkill. While there will be 4,928 Democrat delegates attending the convention this week, organisers have arranged accreditations for 15,000 journalists. That's three hacks for every one delegate. No excuse, then, for any missed stories. Anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela will attend the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday as a guest of party chairman Mr Ron Brown, Reuter reports. Political observers speculated that Mr Mandela's appearance at the convention might be a pointed rebuke to President George Bush for not putting pressure on South Africa's government to help end their dispute over violence in black townships. Mr Mandela had been scheduled to visit New York and address the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday on the deadlock in South Africa's democracy talks.</p>

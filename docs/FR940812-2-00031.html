Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 18, 1993, Administrator Carol Browner announced an initiative to further the protection of human health and the environment_referred to as the Hazardous Waste Minimization and Combustion Draft Strategy (``Draft Strategy''). The Draft Strategy was designed, among other things, to further the reduction in the quantity and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated in the United States as well as to strengthen federal controls governing hazardous waste combustion. Since the announcement of the Draft Strategy, the Agency has held extensive discussions with all the interested stakeholders, including a series of Roundtable discussions. Based on these discussions, EPA developed and released on May 24, 1994, a Draft Plan to implement the waste minimization part of the Draft Strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Draft Plan describes two phases: the first phase focuses on hazardous wastes containing metals and/or halogenated organics burned in combustion units. The second phase will move beyond metal- and halogen-containing wastes managed in combustion devices and will address source reduction and recycling opportunities for the broader universe of hazardous wastes managed by a variety of practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Key components of the Draft Plan include: establishing specific goals for source reduction and recycling; prioritizing wastestreams and industrial processes for source reduction and recycling; identifying and evaluating source reduction and recycling opportunities for these wastestreams and industrial processes; arraying potential voluntary and regulatory mechanisms for effecting source reduction and recycling; and measuring progress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the building blocks for the Draft Plan is setting priorities for source reduction and recycling. EPA has developed and is today releasing the Draft Methodology Document, which describes a proposed hazard-based methodology for ranking hazardous wastestreams and, in turn, ranking the industrial processes that generate them. The document also presents draft ranking results for certain wastestreams and industrial processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is soliciting comments from reviewers on a number of specific issues presented in the Draft Methodology Document. Some of these issues are summarized below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> Criteria relevant to developing a prioritization methodology.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> There are a number of criteria which could potentially be considered in setting priorities for waste minimization. Some potential risk- or hazard-based criteria include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Waste quantities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Waste characteristics (e.g., constituent concentrations and physical/chemical properties)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Waste management practices (e.g., combustion)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Constituent releases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fate and transport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Human and ecological exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Human and ecological toxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other possible criteria include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Protection of natural resources (e.g., stratospheric ozone and ground water)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Demand for waste management capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Environmental justice concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Technical/economic feasibility of promoting waste minimization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is soliciting comments on which criteria (among those listed above or others not listed above) should be emphasized in setting priorities for minimization of hazardous wastes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Imperial Chemicals Industries Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday reported its last set of results including Zeneca, its bioscience business. Shorn of Zeneca and its fibres operations, sold to Du Pont, first-half profits before tax and exceptional items rose from Pounds 146m to Pounds 167m. Trading profits were up from Pounds 149m to Pounds 180m. The results benefited from currency movements and cost savings. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive, said: 'I regard the performance as solid in very difficult circumstances.' For many of the businesses, the trading environment continued to be tough. It was essential to pursue restructuring programmes vigorously.</p>

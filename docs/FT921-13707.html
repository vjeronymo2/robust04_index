			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Dinosaurs cling to power: Dissatisfaction with Greece's ageing politicians AS Mr Andreas Papandreou, the former Greek prime minister, relaxes after his acquittal on corruption charges, he may well reflect that even Pericles, the greatest Athenian politician of them all, was once accused - and cleared - of embezzling state funds. But he might also recall that one of the ancient statesman's few political blunders was his insistence on clinging to power into old age. Both Mr Papandreou, now the opposition leader, and his lifelong political rival, prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis, say they have no intention of retiring, although they are 72 and 73 respectively. They can point with justification to 84-year-old President Constantine Karamanlis, a former conservative prime minister born in northern Greece when it was part of the Ottoman Empire, who is still an active head of state. However, the three elderly leaders are collectively known as 'the dinosaurs' to an increasing number of Greeks impatient to put behind them an era of domestic political intriguing and unashamed use of patronage. Their frustration is openly expressed. Younger technocrats'efforts to contribute to policy-making are undermined by rivalries between senior ministers. Foreign ministry officials complain they are not consulted on fast-moving developments in the Balkans. Businessmen are reluctant to make a substantial investment without an assurance that it is viewed favourably by senior members of the government. Regardless of the not-guilty verdict, Mr Papandreou's reputation remains tarnished, if only because he failed to sever links with Mr George Koskotas, the former Bank of Crete owner who admits embezzling its funds, despite repeated protests from the governor of the central bank. Mr Mitsotakis is also open to criticism for appearing to exploit the judicial system to give his conservative New Democracy party an edge in two general elections that followed Mr Papandreou's indictment by parliament in 1989. Public attention is now focused on Mr Dimitris Tsovolas, a co-defendant and former finance minister, who refuses to pay a Dr912,000 (Pounds 2,800) fine to buy off his 2 1/2 -year sentence for breach of trust. After being stripped of his parliamentary seat, he remains holed up in the central offices of Mr Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), vowing to resist arrest. Mr Papandreou's call for an immediate election sounds hollow, even to his supporters, give his precarious state of health. The chances are that a serious contest for the Pasok leadership will get under way in the next few months.</p>

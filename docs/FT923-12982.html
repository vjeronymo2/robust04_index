			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Economic Viewpoint: The dubious case for Mark revaluation The Bundesbank has long argued that if other countries do not like the effects of German interest rate policies, they can always realign against the German D-Mark - or for that matter float downwards. For neither the ERM, nor the projected Emu, is a Bundesbank creation. But both have been - the Bundesbank protests a little too much - foisted upon it by the politicians. Indeed, at various times in the last few years, the Bundesbank has actually offered the French authorities a realignment, which the latter have adamantly refused. The reasons why a general ERM realignment would not enable the UK to escape from present interest rate constraints have been explained dozens of times, most recently and cogently by the chancellor, Norman Lamont. These reasons apply to nearly all the hard core of Community countries, with the possible exception of Italy. In brief it is that a devaluation would simply add to the risk premium that the market would demand for holding the non-German currencies. The extreme alternative of setting interest rates and ignoring the exchange rate - which is an exaggerated description even of Fed behaviour - would be a recipe for inflationary crisis for an ordinary European country. Could there, however, be a unilateral German revaluation, which did not look like a devaluation by other countries, and which looked final enough for the markets not to expect further upward moves, and therefore not to increase the interest rate premia on non-German currencies? If, say, Italy and the UK both realigned downwards without France, it would clearly be a devaluation by both the former countries. We know that this will not happen in the case of the UK so long as John Major and Norman Lamont both remain at their present posts. The essential condition that would make a realignment into a genuine German revaluation would be one in which France participated and in which most important countries outside Germany remained linked by present parities. It is more difficult to say whether a genuine revaluation would have also to be against Germany's smaller neighbours, such as the Benelux countries, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden. But the more of these countries that stayed with France and did not move up with the D-Mark, the more the move would look like a genuine D-Mark revaluation. Leaving aside the practicality, is the case for D-Mark revaluation as strong as the Bundesbank and mainstream economists suppose? I have always needed to be convinced and never quite have been. Normally high-inflation countries devalue and low-inflation countries revalue. The very fact that Germany has been losing its inflation advantage to France makes the case for revaluation a strange one. Even Britain has very much improved its competitive position against Germany in the last decade - admittedly starting from a position when sterling was much overvalued. The conventional case for revaluation is that because of reunification, Germany has to move resources out of the export sector and into reconstruction efforts in the eastern provinces. After his recent Ditchley lecture, Dr Kurt Biedenkopf, the prime minister of Saxony, said that Germany would have to devote about 5 per cent of its GDP to reconstruction in the east. In fact, however, Germany has largely done so, thanks to the running-down of its former balance of payments surplus. It is too often forgotten that as recently as 1989 the old Federal Republic had a payments surplus of 4.8 per cent of GDP, larger than that of Japan, and received endless lectures from the US administration for its pains. By 1991, the German current balance of payments had moved to a deficit of 1.2 per cent of GDP, and the OECD expects the deficit to remain in 1992 and 1993. This swing of resources is a practical demonstration of the savings and investment approach to the balance of payments, which suggests that there will be a surplus if domestic investment opportunities fall short of local savings, but a deficit when such investment opportunities - in this case defined broadly to include all special expenditures in the east - run ahead of local savings. The case for a revaluation from a German point of view is simply that it would represent a tightening of German monetary policy for any given level of interest rates - just as the upward overshooting of, first, sterling and then the dollar represented a tightening of policy for the UK and the US in the early 1980s. A revaluation would help Germany to reduce inflationary pressures more quickly. But how would other countries benefit? The short answer is that they would only benefit if the Bundesbank regarded the appreciation of the D-Mark as a sufficient reason for maintaining a level of interest rates a couple of percentage points or more below what would otherwise be the case. The UK Treasury in the late 1980s played with the rule by which each 4 per cent appreciation of sterling was equivalent to a 1 per cent rise in base rates. In the absence of a similar sort of rule being followed by the Bundesbank, Germany's partners would have little to gain from a revaluation. But unless all the conditions, outlined earlier in the article, were rigidly observed, they would risk losing their hard-won counter-inflationary credibility with nothing in return. It is in no one's interest that Germany should lose its reputation for low inflation. But that should not mean a mechanistic pursuit of broad money targets for M3. The OECD attitude, if one attempts to translate its annual report on Germany out of OECD-speak, is that the Bundesbank is right to maintain high interest rates, but should not raise them further and should not take too seriously the overshooting of the official money target. The OECD lists three plausible reasons why above-target rate of German monetary growth can be misleading. First, reunification may have changed at least the short-run relationship between the broad version of the money supply known as M3 and the national income. Second, the canvassed introduction of a withholding tax on interest incomes may also have affected this relationship. Third, and most interesting of all, 'there is evidence of increased D-Mark hoarding and the use of the Mark as a parallel currency in east European countries'. These complications are reminiscent of Britain in the early 1980s when broadly defined money also became a treacherous guide to economic conditions. The similarity extends to the argument that an interest rate increase might worsen broad money growth in the short run, as the inverted yield curve encourages investors to place long-term funds on deposit at the banks. Later in the 1980s the UK relationship between broad money and spending improved, just as broad money targets were abandoned - giving an interesting new twist to Goodhart's Law. What is probably required in Germany is a temporary above-target rate of monetary growth, which should then be steered back to a lower rate before a British-type credit boom can prevail. The first part of this course will be followed anyway, whatever decision the Bundesbank Council makes today, as it is far too late in the year to get German money supply growth back on track.</p>

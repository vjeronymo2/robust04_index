			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TROUBLED KAYPRO LAYS OFF MORE WORKERS  </P> <P> Kaypro Corp., the financially distressed personal computer manufacturer, said  Wednesday that it laid off 40 workers at its Solana Beach manufacturing and  office facility last Friday, a 17% reduction in its work force.  </P> <P> Kaypro spokesman Joseph Marcello also said Wednesday that Kaypro's cash flow is  now insufficient to finance the company's operations and that payment of some  suppliers has been delayed. As a result, some of those suppliers have refused  to ship Kaypro necessary components to make some of its computer products.  </P> <P> Marcello said he could not say how the company was getting cash to fund  operations. In the past, Kaypro Chairman Andrew Kay has personally loaned  Kaypro more than $2.8 million to pay its bills, but Marcello said he could not  say whether Kay has made more loans recently.  </P> <P> Kaypro's 12-acre manufacturing plant in Solana Beach is scheduled to be sold  Feb. 27, Marcello said. Gains from the sale are ticketed to provide the company  with cash as well as pay off a $7-million loan from Commonwealth Financial.  </P> <P> Marcello said Kaypro booked $145,000 in orders for its computers Jan. 31, the  highest daily total in three months. He held out the possibility that, if the  order rate is maintained, Kaypro might hire back some of the workers laid off  last week. The layoffs reduced Kaypro's payroll to 198 workers.  </P> <P> The company has been cutting jobs steadily over the last 18 months. Last  Thursday, the day before the latest round of layoffs, Kaypro said in a press  release that it had reduced its payroll to 238 workers, from the 577 as of  October 1987.  </P> <P> Of the 40 workers let go last week, 20 were manufacturing employees and the  rest were spread among technological support and engineering staff, Marcello  said.  </P></p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Labour names share option 'millionaires' Labour yesterday claimed that four directors of PowerGen and National Power, the electricity generators, have made notional profits of more than Pounds 1m each from executive share option schemes. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said figures extracted from annual reports showed salary increases were 'the tip of the iceberg' in the creation of utility millionaires. Mr Brown said the beneficiaries of executive share option schemes included Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, with a notional profit of Pounds 1.2m; Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen (Pounds 1.7m); Mr John Rennocks, PowerGen finance director (Pounds 1m); and Dr Alf Roberts, PowerGen commercial director (Pounds 1.1m). Mr Brown also claimed that Lord Young of Graffham, chairman of Cable and Wireless and a former trade and industry secretary, had made a notional profit of Pounds 1.8m. He called for 'an end to the lax tax rules which mean that privatised utility bosses in electricity, water and telecom are becoming millionaires at our expense, subsidised by the British taxpayer'. Mr Brown said executive share options issued to senior managers of privatised utilities were worth a total of Pounds 350m, and would raise Pounds 105m in notional profit if redeemed by the holders at existing prices. He said the options were costing the taxpayer Pounds 200m a year in lost tax revenue, equal to the cost of exempting pensioners from the government's plan to increase value added tax on domestic fuel from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent. The Labour party is committed to ending tax relief for such options and treating them as income, exposing holders to taxation at their full marginal rate of income tax. The discretionary options scheme used for executives, which differs from that used for other employees, is popular because the options are free of income tax, provided they are exercised between three and 10 years after they are issued. It allows for grants of options worth up to Pounds 100,000, or four times the recipient's salary, and the price can be as low as 85 per cent of the market value. The only tax payable is capital gains tax when the shares are sold. The Inland Revenue estimates the impact on taxation revenue at between Pounds 30m and Pounds 55m a year - about a quarter of Labour's estimate.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 16 June that U.S. forces in Japan  [USFJ] have surveyed air bases of the Air Self-Defense Force  [ASDF] that can be used by the latest U.S. fighter jets at a  time when debates on sanctions against North Korea have heated  up. The USFJ is believed to have surveyed the ASDF air bases to  prepare for an emergency on the Korean peninsula. The USFJ  appears to have chosen four air bases -- Chitose Air Base,  Mizawa Air Base [currently under joint use by Japan and the  United States), Matsushima Air Base, and Komatsu Air Base -- for  use by U.S. forces. Those air bases are expected to be used by  U.S. Air Force fighter jets that are deployed from the United  States to Japan to bolster the fighting capability of the USFJ  in the event of an emergency on the Korean peninsula. There is a  possibility that the USFJ will ask the ASDF for rear support.  The use of those air bases by U.S forces will certainly trigger  a controversy because it raises the question of Japan's exercise  of the right of collective self-defense.    In the past few months, U.S. forces have deployed Patriot  missiles and armed helicopters in South Korea. U.S. forces also  plan to deploy more fighter jets in South Korea and quickly  deploy aircraft carriers in waters off the Korean peninsula.  There is no change in the USFJ's air power. The survey of ASDF  air bases by the USFJ is taken as their first move in Japan  following the tense situation on the Korean peninsula.    The USFJ is believed to intend to use the ASDF air bases to  bolster its air power and to enhance readiness to prepare for an  emergency on the Korean peninsula. Chitose Air Base and  Matsushima Air Base are far away from the Korean peninsula and  North Korea's fighter jets have a short flying range, with the  exception of MiG-29 fighter jets. The USFJ is believed to want  to use the two air bases for defensive purposes.    According to a source in the Defense Agency [DA], U.S.  forces  in the United States plan to send air wings consisting mainly of  F-16 fighter jets to Japan in the event of emergency in the Far  East. The U.S. forces also plan to send Airborne Warning and  Control System (AWACS) aircraft and air tankers to Japan. It is  unclear how many combat aircraft the U.S. forces plan to send to  South Korea in the event of an emergency on the Korean  peninsula. An air wing is composed of 25 F-16 fighter jets and  400 ground crews.    In the event of an emergency on the Korean peninsula, there  is a possibility of the USFJ asking the ASDF for rear support  including the supply of oil and ammunition. It is difficult for  the ASDF to provide such rear support under the current law. If  emergency legislation with a limited period of enforcement on  the Acquisition and Cross-Serving Agreement (ACSA) is enacted,  then the ASDF would be able to provide rear support for the  USFJ, depending on the circumstances.    The ASDF's rear support for the USFJ may constitute a  "military action," and Prime Minister Hata has stated that  "Japan cannot participate in any military action." The ASDF's  rear support for the USFJ, therefore, may trigger the question  of Japan's exercise of the collective riht of self-defense.    There is a view that the USFJ has surveyed the SDAF air  bases  in a bid to look for shelters for U.S. military aircraft, and it  remains unclear how the USFJ intends to use the ASDF air bases.  The fact is important, however, that the USFJ has studied the  possibility of using ASDF facilities at a time when the  situation on the Korean peninsula has grown tense. Another  source in the DA, has tried to keep the survey of ASDF air bases  by the USFJ from triggering any controversy, saying, "I believe  that the USFJ is simply preparing for the worst case."    The USFJ is able to use five ASDF air bases including  Chitose  Air Base, Hyakuri Air Base, and Komatsu Air Base only when joint  Japan-U.S. military exercises are conducted. There is no legal  basis for the USFJ to use those air bases in the event of an  emergency. A senior DA official has indicated that "the ASDF and  the USFJ can jointly use those air bases in accordance with the  Japan-U.S. Status of Force Agreement."</p>

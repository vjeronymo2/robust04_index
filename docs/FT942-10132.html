			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Start to fight, Scots Conservatives urged Scottish Conservatives, cowed by their disastrous performance in last week's regional council elections, were urged yesterday to fight back and 'stop taking opposition insults and smears on the chin like gentlemen'. The call for a more aggressive approach was issued on the opening day of the party's conference in Inverness by Mr Adrian Shinwell, its Scottish president. The sentiment was echoed by party activists milling around the conference hall. Mr Shinwell said the party needed to 'assess policy matters to see if they stand up to objective scrutiny'. That required a 'period of examination and reflection'. The party 'desperately needs to assess and improve our presentation of ourselves and our policies'. Although Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, referred to the regional elections as a 'sideshow' in comparison with the European elections, it was a line which several delegates rejected in private conversation. The Conservatives finished in fourth place - behind Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party - with less than 14 per cent of the vote. This result could not be brushed off, one delegate said. The issues which had made the party so unpopular last week would surface again in the European elections. For her and other delegates the most damaging thing the government had done was to levy value added tax on domestic fuel. 'I don't think people in the south realise what that means to us in Scotland. We still have some of our radiators on in May and put the central heating back on in early September.' A senior Tory dignitary was dismayed at the way the party had permitted the opposition to set the agenda for nearly two years on the intensely sensitive issue of water, which dogged the local election campaign. Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems had planted the idea in the public mind that the Tories intended to privatise Scotland's water - now controlled by the regional councils. When the government belatedly rejected that policy, it had not done so forcefully enough. 'We failed to educate the Scottish electorate in the basic facts about water  -that it does not come free, that it will cost a lot to improve it and that we were trying to find a way of doing that (which) would not cost the council taxpayer too much.' Another Tory from the central belt wondered if the mastery which Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, enjoys over the opposition in the House of Commons had not lulled the Scottish party leadership into a false sense of security, which had been blown away by last week's elections. 'I think they all need to be more combative,' he said. That was the message from Mr Shinwell. But although this Glasgow lawyer is a nephew of the doughty Labour MP, the late Emmanuel Shinwell, he does not project a particularly combative image, and both Mr Lang and Sir Michael Hirst, the Scottish party chairman, are men of reason rather than political street-fighters. In any case, in spite of Mr Hurd's encouragement, the European elections will be very difficult for the Scottish Tories. They hold no Scottish Euro-seats and have realistic hopes of winning only one, north-east Scotland. As Tories in the tea room noted, the elections are likely to be presented by the opposition as a referendum on the government, and damaging policies such as VAT will still be in place, whatever 'examination and reflection' Mr Shinwell might like to see.</p>

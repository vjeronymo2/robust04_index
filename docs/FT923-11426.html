			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / MoD's record on contracting criticised MINISTRY OF DEFENCE efforts to cut costs by privatising services have been dogged by errors, delays and mismanagement, according to a government report published today. Failure to keep sufficient records meant the amount saved in 13 years of contracting out was impossible to check, says the National Audit Office, the government's spending watchdog, The MoD's problems cast doubt on prospects for plans to extend contracting out to other departments, the next stage in reforming government machinery. All government departments have submitted plans to the Cabinet Office to contract out parts of their work. Sir Peter Levene, the government's efficiency adviser, is considering the schemes, some of which should be implemented from this autumn. MoD failings uncovered by the Audit Office include reporting errors that led to a 40 per cent overestimate in the amount of cash saved; failing to train officers how to monitor contractors; and a wrongly assessed catering bid which led to the work being kept in-house at a cost of Pounds 1m over three years. As a result, the audit office recommends that the MoD hives off part of the contracting-out process itself. Not all the MoD's efforts were in vain. By 1994, the departmentwill have put out to competition contracts worth at total Pounds 243m. However, it says it was 'unable to quantify' MoD claims that contracting out had cut costs by Pounds 64m a year, an average 24 per cent saving on each contract. The MoD kept a record only of how much was saved in the first year of contracting out, even though 'many hundreds of contracts have since been relet'. The audit office also notes 'clerical errors' in reporting figures to the MoD's in-house market testing consultancy . The MoD said yesterday: 'Market testing in some areas has not progressed as fast as expected.' It said it had been distracted from the process by more pressing concerns such as the Gulf war. It said it had taken steps to improve its guidance and training on contractor appraisal. Ministry of Defence: Competition in the Provision of Support Services. HMSO. Pounds 7.25.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Universale posts Sch607m deficit Universale-Bau, the troubled Austrian construction group, has reported a Sch607m (Dollars 54.07m) loss for 1993 as a result of heavy losses by operations in eastern Germany and Hungary. No dividend is being paid in respect of 1993, compared with a 20 per cent payment for 1992. The loss, which compares with a profit of Sch55m in 1992, was largely covered by liquidating reserves of Sch605m. Revenues rose to Sch7.4bn from Sch7.1bn. Universale, 64 per cent owned by Creditanstalt-Bankverein, sacked its chief executive, Mr Josef Vlcek, and two other directors in January following the deterioration of its activities in eastern Germany and Hungary. Operating profits fell last year to Sch15m from Sch103m in 1992. Mr Reinhold Sussenbacher, the new chief executive, said activities in Austria made a small operating profit. Mr Sussenbacher has forecast that the group would break even in the current year, although the Hungarian and German operations would remain in loss. He said the group could see a turnround in these operations and would not withdraw.</p>

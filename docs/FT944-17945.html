			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / EU's car dealership networks to remain The European Commission is set to allow Europe's car manufacturers and dealers to keep their privileged system of exclusive car dealer networks, with some modifications, for another 10 years. Yesterday's long-awaited Commission draft document setting out the industry's further exemption from normal EU competition rules was greeted with cautious relief by carmakers and dealers but consumer groups reacted angrily. The Commission claimed that proposed changes to the terms of the exemption would make it easier for consumers to seek the best deals in any EU country, and would increase competition in car sales and servicing. But consumer groups claimed that they would 'do nothing' for buyers. The changes include a provision for dealers to be allowed to sell more than one make of car - but only from separate sites under separate management; for dealers to be allowed to buy spare parts from makers other than the car manufacturers and to advertise outside the territory allocated to them; for independent repairers to have access to manufacturers' technical information; and measures to remove obstacles to cross-border trading. However, manufacturers will still be able to choose which dealers they supply, and the dealers will retain exclusive franchises within clearly defined sales territories for 10 more years after the industry's current 'block exemption' from EU competition rules expires on June 1. The document was described by the Commission as the best way of serving consumer interests through safeguarding standards of sales and servicing for a complex product with important safety considerations. Ms Valerie Thompson, head of communications at BEUC, the European Consumers' Organisation, said: 'They are small steps but they have not gone far enough . . . the main consumer benefit of going to one showroom and being able to compare rival makes of car, quality and prices would not be allowed.' Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, chief operating officer of Fiat, the Italian carmaker, and president of ACEA, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, expressed concern that some of the proposals 'would represent a significant additional cost burden and would lead to greater undue complexity' for makers and dealers. The carmakers are unhappy that, despite the restrictions on sites and managements, the proposed rules open the door to the creation of multi-franchise dealer groups. Mr Robert Blower of the UK's multi-franchise Cowie Group welcomed the document as a significant shift in the balance of power towards dealers away from manufacturers. 'The ability to advertise outside territories, use independent suppliers' parts and multi-franchise gives us most of the things dealers have been looking for from the review,' he said.

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Beating a path to the quiet man's door: Brazil's vice-president, in line for the top job via a corruption scandal MR Itamar Franco, Brazil's bespectacled vice-president and the man who would take office if President Fernando Collor were ousted, was until recently considered Mr Collor's best weapon in his struggle to stay in power. Dogged by a reputation as negative as that of Mr Dan Quayle, his US counterpart, Mr Franco has marked his 2 1/2 years in office by querulous criticisms of the government and outspoken opposition to some of its policies, causing him to quit Mr Collor's party. Since he tried to sack the justice minister while Mr Collor was travelling, Mr Franco has not been allowed to sign anything during the president's frequent foreign trips. Today, though, senior politicians and businessmen are beating a path to the vice-president's door. Mr Collor's position appears very shaky after the approval on Wednesday by a congressional investigating commission of a report accusing him of massive corruption. Mr Alexandre Barros, a political consultant who prepared a detailed profile of Mr Franco in June, says: 'Initially we only sold a few copies. Now everyone is calling us.' Inside his office, in an annexe to the presidential palace, Mr Franco is lying low. He claims to have been 'praying for Mr Collor's survival', but is said to be preparing behind the scenes for office. He has let it be known that he recently read former US President Richard Nixon's biography. Mr Franco could hardly be more different from his boss, a former playboy who loves dangerous sports. The divorced and introverted vice-president likes reading and cannot be imagined zipping about on a jet-ski, a Collor hobby. Albeit not a man of vision or a great orator, the 61-year-old Mr Franco has two important strengths. His reputation for honesty is impeccable and, having been a senator for two eight-year terms and twice mayor of his home town of Juiz de Fora, he knows the political system inside out. Thus he is much better equipped to steer bills through Congress than the arrogant and confrontational Mr Collor. Among the business and financial community, the biggest doubts about Mr Franco are on his economic policy views. He is a fervent nationalist. He opposed the privatisation of the Usiminas steel mill and criticised Mr Collor's modernisation policies. During the crafting of the 1988 constitution, he voted for protection of Brazilian companies. However, analysts point out that Usiminas is based in Mr Franco's home state of Minas Gerais, and they believe it would be difficult to alter the direction of economic policy because most of Brazilian society backs the move towards modernisation. Mr Carlos Langoni, an economics professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, says: 'Itamar will not change the agenda because there's no alternative - simple as that. He might move more slowly, however, on trade liberalisation and privatisation.' This view is confirmed by Mr Franco's close friend, former vice-president Aureliano Chaves: 'Current policy is in the right direction, but there could be more attention to social needs.' As a sign of his conversion, Mr Franco seems to have agreed to keep on Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, the well-respected economy minister, in a national unity government. However, if the vice-president does step up a rung, he will be backed by a broad political coalition, which, while facilitating the passage through Congress of such bills as crucial fiscal reform, will also put pressure on him to give key portfolios to political allies, particularly from the Democratic Movement (PMDB), the largest party. It could not have been easy for Mr Itamar to be deputy to a man who refused to allow him into decision-making. In April, for example, when Mr Collor abruptly sacked his whole cabinet, Mr Franco only found out from television. Any sympathy he might have felt for the president was lost when he discovered that the presidency was investigating his tax returns in an apparent attempt to discredit him. As the clamour grows for Mr Collor's resignation or impeachment, Mr Franco sits and waits, while his aides make a concerted effort to improve his image. After meeting Mr Franco this week, the influential Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso said the vice-president was reforming his ideas. 'The Itamar of Usiminas will not be the Itamar of the presidency,' he said. See feature</p>

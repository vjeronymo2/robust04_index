			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- International Trade and  Industry Minister Eijiro Hata confirmed Tuesday [10 May] that  Japan and the United States have begun informal talks in a bid  to resume the stalled trade "framework" negotiations.    Japanese trade officials in charge of the framework talks,  for example, have made contacts with their U.S. counterparts by  telephone, Hata told a regular press conference. As there is  little time before the end-of-June target for restarting the  talks, Japan wants more opportunities for discussion with  Washington, Hata said.    The trade minister previously said Japan wants to use "all  kinds of communication channels" with the U.S. to pave the way  for an early reopening of the framework talks, suspended since  the breakdown in the February summit between then Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.    Tokyo and Washington vowed efforts for a breakthrough in the  suspended trade talks before the July summit of the Group of  Seven (G-7) leading industrialized nations in Naples.    On Japan's assistance to South Africa, Hata said his  ministry  is now working to formulate specific aid programs for the  country.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts slip on unease over retail price index data LONGER-dated gilts eased yesterday as the market absorbed worse-than-expected average UK earnings figures for March and prepared for today's inflation figures for April. Earnings rose at a year-on-year rate of 7.5 per cent, up from 7 per cent the previous month and ahead of expectations (although the figures for the previous month were restated to 7.5 per cent on a new calculation basis). The news was not devastating, but combined with unease about the retail price index figure and some reported profit taking, helped to take the shine off the gilt market. The RPI is widely expected to show a year-on-year rise of around 4.4 per cent, compared with 4 per cent the previous month - though some estimates predict a rise as high as 5 per cent. Should the figure come close to the lower expectations, the Bank of England is expected to sell more gilts, another factor which helped to hold back gilt prices. Shorter-dated gilts remained steady as sterling remained firm and the three-month interbank rate remained at 10 1/16 per cent. The benchmark 9 per cent bonds maturing in 2011, however, lost around  1/8 of a point on the day to close at a yield of 9 per cent. On Liffe, in moderate trading, the long gilt future - having broken above 99 at the start of the day - closed at 98 3/4 . GERMAN government bonds lost ground in late trading as the market continued to absorb bad news on the wage front and further warnings that interest rates are likely to remain high for some time. News that the largest of the four public sector unions, OeTV, had rejected the pay offer negotiated by their leaders (only 44.1 per cent voted in favour of acceptance, well short of the 50 per cent needed), did little to dent the bund market immediately. The news had been widely expected. But by late in the day, sentiment turned for the worse. The bund futures contract on Liffe, having opened at 87.26 and hit a high of 87.44, retreated to 87.15 in late trading. In the cash market, yields on 10-year bunds rose slightly, hovering just below 8 per cent. Warnings that real interest rates were likely to remain high for some time came from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of the Bundesbank. He warned against the 'quick fix' of lowering rates and added demand for capital around the world would keep real interest rates high for some years. PROFIT-taking by investors in French government bonds caused 10-year OATs to lose some ground yesterday - though with bund prices also easing, the yield spread between the two markets remained at just over 60 basis points. The French franc fell from its recent high point, touched on Wednesday, but continued to hover around its central rate against the D-Mark of 3.3539. The yield on the benchmark 8.5 per cent OAT due 2002 slipped slightly to around 8.58 per cent in late trade. PREDICTIONS from the Federal Reserve that money supply growth was exhibiting a recovery took the edge off Treasury prices yesterday. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 102 9/16 , yielding 7.858 per cent, while at the short end of the market the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 1/2 , to carry a yield of 5.085 per cent. The comments on money growth came from Fed governor Mr Lawrence Lindsey, who said he expected the latest money supply data, due out late yesterday, to show the beginning of a bounce back. This disappointed those sections of the market which had pinned its hopes on further weakness in money figures spurring the Fed into another easing of monetary policy. Mr Lindsey's comments overshadowed the weekly jobless claims data, which showed a rise of 10,000 in the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance. The rise was bigger than expected, but the news failed to stimulate any buying interest. AFTER their strong rise in the middle of the week, Japanese government bonds continued to move ahead yesterday, further buoyed by the strength of the yen. The yield on the benchmark bond No 129 eased further, from 5.5 per cent to 5.487 per cent on the day. The yield was last below 5.5 per cent in mid-April. However, concerns about the amount of new bond issuance due from Japanese corporate borrowers continue to overhang the market, and could restrict further gains.</p>

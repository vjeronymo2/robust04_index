			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / World markets rise as fears of increase in US rates diminish World bond and equity markets forged ahead yesterday as subdued US inflation figures raised hopes that the Federal Reserve would delay its next move to increase short-term interest rates. US producer prices for finished goods fell by 0.5 per cent in September, thanks to a drop in energy prices. The core index, which excludes food and energy, rose by just 0.1 per cent, less than the markets had expected. Producer prices are regarded by private sector economists as an early indicator of price pressures. But economists at the Federal Reserve, the central bank, regard the measure, along with the consumer price index, which is published today, as backward-looking. Still, the positive news on producer price inflation encouraged a surge in buying of longer-dated US Treasury bonds. By late in the day the price of the benchmark 30-year government issue was more than half a point higher, with the yield slipping to 7.847 per cent. Early on, this week's rally in US share prices, which had stalled on Wednesday, appeared to gain a new lease of life. Within minutes of the opening of the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged by more than 50 points, triggering the market's restrictions on program-guided buying for the second time this week. By the close, however, the Dow was up just 14.80 at 3,889.95 as the confidence of investors buckled in the final hour, ahead of economic data due out today. European markets were pulled up by Wall Street's early strength. In London, the FT-SE 100 Index closed up 41.4 points at 3141.9, while UK government bonds gained half a point. In Germany, the DAX index rose 1.7 per cent in after-market trading and government bunds were up by around seven-eighths of a point. In previous weeks, world markets reacted negatively to US statistics indicating strong economic growth, which led traders to fear that the Fed would move quickly to raise rates to quell inflationary pressures. But last Friday's weaker-than-expected US employment data have led to a change in sentiment. Details, Page 6; Bonds, Page 25; Currencies, Page 32; World stocks, Page 39; London stocks, Page 42</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Blunders hit Campbell election campaign A SERIES of blunders by Ms Kim Campbell, Canada's prime minister, has thrown her Progressive Conservative party on the defensive in the campaign leading up to the October 25 general election. With less than a month to go, opinion polls show the Tories losing support both to their main opposition, the Liberals, and to two regional parties, the separatist Bloc Quebecois in Quebec, and the Reform party in western Canada. A Gallup poll published over the weekend gave the Liberals 37 per cent of decided votes, compared with 30 per cent for the Tories. But the Bloc Quebecois was backed by 38 per cent of voters in Quebec, suggesting it could win as many as 40 seats in the 395-seat House of Commons. The BQ's support has held firm, although the two big parties still hope to convince Quebeckers that a vote for the Bloc is wasted because it has no hope of forming a majority government, or of being included in a minority one. Numerous minority-government scenarios are increasingly being discussed in political circles. Among the possibilities which have been raised is a Liberal-Conservative alliance, designed mainly to blunt the BQ. Ms Campbell has succeeded in distancing herself from her unpopular predecessor, Mr Brian Mulroney. But her bursts of dogmatic candour have not played well against the more reassuring, middle- of-the-road style of Mr Jean Chretien, the veteran politician who leads the Liberals. In particular, Ms Campbell has been hurt by her promise to eliminate the CDollars 35bn (Pounds 17.3bn) federal budget deficit within five years, without spelling out how this will be done. She has adamantly refused so far to discuss the highly-charged subject of social security reforms, which would be the key to any serious deficit-cutting exercise.</p>

However, setting macroeconomic numerical targets  is acceptable."    He then proposed that as a specific numerical target, the  government set itself the task of reducing Japan's current  account surplus to about 2.5 percent of gross domestic product  (the government proposes a figure of 2.8 percent in its economic  outlook for fiscal 1994).    At the same news conference, Manae Kubota, director general  of the Economic Planning Agency, touched on the government's  430-trillion yen public investment plan, saying: "The  government should consider reviewing the plan, including  increasing that amount."    Her comments were a call for Japan to reduce its surplus by  strengthening domestic demand.</p>

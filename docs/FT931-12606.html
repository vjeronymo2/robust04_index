			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (7): Strong arm of the law - The city heads a legal regional table THE POSITION of Leeds as Britain's leading law centre outside London was confirmed this month when Legal Business, a trade magazine, published its latest league table. Ranked by annual gross fees, Leeds has six firms in the top 20, three of them in the top five. The three giants are Dibb Lupton Broomhead, Hammond Suddards and Booth &amp; Co, respectively in first, second and fourth place. The three firms on the next rank are Simpson Curtis, 12th, Eversheds Hepworth &amp; Chadwick, 15th, and Walker Morris, 18th. Gross fees ranged from Pounds 28.8m for Dibb Lupton Broomhead to Pounds 9.8m for Walker Morris, but will be surpassed this year. Mr Robin Smith, head of Dibb Lupton Broomhead, says his firm's sales are running at an annual Pounds 36m, up from Pounds 22m two years ago. The corporate law industry is a good one to be in, with counter-cyclical elements that a l l o w recession to be weathered. For example, insolvency and litigation come into the ascendancy in bad times, when corporate finance and merger and acquisitions markets falter. However, the league table flatters Leeds because neither Dibb nor Hammond Suddards is entirely in the city, earning fees also in Manchester and Sheffield in Dibb's case and in Bradford, from where AV Hammond leapt to take over Last Suddards in Leeds in 1988. Each also runs a London office. This would put Booth &amp; Co at the top of the league if it were based on single-city offices - not that this makes Booths either provincial or parochial. More than half its work is in the financial sector and spread widely: this month it won a competitive tender against rivals in all the big cities to handle all non-property legal work in England for Scottish Equitable. Simpson Curtis, Eversheds Hepworth &amp; Chadwick and Walker Morris also operate only from Leeds. In contrast, Broomheads was Sheffield's leading law firm when it merged with Dibb Lupton in 1988 and work is still spread evenly, in terms of numbers of fee-earners at desks, between the two cities. There are about 220 staff - 105 of them fee-earners - in each place. The firm has another 149 people in London, 69 of them fee-earners, and 50 in Manchester, half of them solicitors. There are also 110 back-office workers in Bradford. This gives Dibb a payroll of 750 people, making it a very large business indeed. Hammond Suddards has about 620 in total, of whom 250 are Leeds and 50 in London. Bradford back-offices house the rest. However, all of the firms have a national outlook. They grew out of demand from regionally-based clients, but are marketing themselves much more widely now. Hammond Suddards, for example, handles all of ICI's environmental and planning work. All have at least doubled in size in the past five years. Size matters: it enables them to house many different types of specialist and pursue a 'swings and roundabouts' policy in changing markets. Price advantage was one driving force for growth, as London prices went silly for northern commercial clients in the latter half of the 1980s. Even though London rents have dropped, Leeds still has an edge. Mr Peter Thompson, managing partner of Eversheds Hepworth &amp; Chadwick says salaries of supporting staff such as secretaries and legal executives are several thousand pounds per head per year more in London than Leeds, a situation that is unlikely to change. Mr Trevor Lewis, managing partner of Hammond Suddards, says anewly-qualified solicitor costs about Pounds 5,000 a year more in London than in Leeds. Typically, what costs Pounds 150 an hour in legal fees in Leeds costs Pounds 50 more in London. Mr Smith puts the price advantage of a highly experienced lawyer's time even higher if the price is carried into London itself. 'We can provide the same quality in our London office at a price which makes much more sense in the market. We reckon we can charge - in London - Pounds 100 an hour less than some of the big City firms for the same level of advice,' he says. That is because back-office work is carried out in Leeds, Sheffield or Bradford, where overheads and staff wages are lower. 'But we don't sell on price; we sell on quality,' Mr Smith avers. Even so, Dibbs is winning a lot of work from hard-pressed south-east corporate clients looking for savings. Specialisation has also helped firms to develop market leadership in particular niches. In 1987, Eversheds Hepworth &amp; Chadwick was one of the first anywhere into environmental issues, poaching lawyers from local authorities - the enforcers of green law - to act instead for companies so they could get on the right side earlier of tightening legislation. Simpson Curtis has recently carried its fight into London too. It has three partners there in new offices near St Paul's, with another two on their way. Mr Martin Shaw, senior partner, has also started a drive against London-influenced 'macho' practices. 'When you're doing a flotation or acquisition, why do meetings have to start at 5:30pm and go on all night? What are people trying to prove? There is no need for it and it doesn't impress clients. 'Our clients are now much more sophisticated. They have got over the mystique they used to associate with the law and question why we have to do things in certain ways. They want to see efficiency. And we have to demonstrate value for money, to give the client more than he expects.' All the law firms have trimmed in the recession, but, paradoxically, have never stopped recruiting qualified people. The drive to reduce numbers is about efficiency, shedding indirect staff and less able partners. 'We are all investing heavily in buildings and technology to push up productivity,' Mr Smith says. 'None of us is part of the inner circle of City of London institutions. We sell our services to clients who, in the main, make and sell things. This shapes the way we do things ourselves. We see ourselves as no different from any other commercial undertaking.' Mr Lewis says Leeds' modern legal industry probably began about 10 years ago, when London prices started to escalate. That was when AV Hammond 'went entirely commercial', dropping all criminal and matrimonial work. Though everyone claimed to be as good then as they are now, all know they are in a new, professional league, according to Mr Thompson. All acknowledge that competition among themselves has been a strong force for change and better practice. It has also attracted clients. 'If you want to buy an antique, you go to a place like Harrogate where there are enough dealers to create a genuine market,' Mr Lewis says. 'Competition has never been tougher,' says Mr Shaw. 'There is serious undercutting, including loss leaders being offered to win other business.' Some of those City institutions make have to look to their laurels.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   BRITAIN'S LEADING REGIONAL LAW FIRMS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Law firm            Gross fees    Fees per    Profits per   Rank in UK                      Pounds m   fee-earner     partner     (gross fees)                                 Pounds '000   Pounds '000  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dibb Lupton Broomhead  28.8          87          166            1 Hammond Suddards       20.1          98          163            2 Booth &amp; Co             17.4          97          139            4 Simpson Curtis         11.7          91          150           12 Eversheds   Hepworth &amp; Chadwick  10.6          75          113           15 Walker Morris           9.8          71          104           18  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Leeds has six firms in the UK's top 20 outside London, three of them in the top five  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Legal Business  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Washington bank settles loan bias case The US Department of Justice yesterday settled a loan discrimination case against a Washington bank which had refused to open branches in black majority areas, setting a new standard for the siting of banks' outlets. In the first case of its kind, Chevy Chase Federal Savings Bank of Washington DC was charged with 'red-lining' minority areas by refusing to open branches or market its services in them. Although the case against Chevy Chase is not the largest case of racial discrimination the department has brought against a lender, it considerably broadens the legal net on the issue. In previous cases, lenders have been accused of turning down loans for individual loan applicants because of their race. 'To shun an entire community because of its racial make-up is just as wrong as to reject (applicants) because they are African-American,' Ms Janet Reno, the US attorney-general, said yesterday. To settle the case, Chevy Chase agreed to make Dollars 140m (Pounds 90m) of special mortgage loans available at one percentage point below the prevailing rate in majority black areas of Washington and neighbouring Prince George's county in Maryland. Chevy Chase will also open three mortgage offices in black majority areas of Washington and one full bank branch in the city's depressed Anacostia section. Before the settlement, Chevy Chase had 78 bank branches and 20 mortgage offices, but none was in any of the census areas in which blacks made up a majority of the population. 'Some neighbourhood banks may turn away blacks because of their race, but other neighbourhoods may not even have banks to which blacks can turn,' Ms Reno said. Both the Justice Department and federal bank regulators have stepped up efforts to enforce fair lending laws. In one of the biggest cases, the Federal Reserve refused to allow Shawmut National to acquire another bank because of patterns of lending bias until Shawmut had overhauled its lending procedures and reached a settlement with the Justice Department. Other big banking groups on the acquisition trail, alerted by the Shawmut case, have taken pre-emptive steps to expand their lending to minorities. But yesterday's settlement is the first where the Justice Department pursued denial of service to an entire area.</p>

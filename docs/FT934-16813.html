			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Car bomb injures 30 Israelis ABOUT 30 Israelis were injured yesterday when a Palestinian suicide bomber drove a car laden with explosives into a bus near the West Bank settlement of Beit El. The dead bomber, identified as 20-year-old Kamal Bani Odeh from the West Bank village of Tamoun, was said by Israeli military officials to have belonged to the Hamas Islamic resistance movement. He had been wanted by the army for more than a year, for the alleged stabbing of an Israeli civilian. The bombing, which followed three failed suicide attacks by Hamas activists in the past month, came in the wake of a series of Israeli army operations in the occupied territories targeting Hamas members and other radical Palestinians opposed to the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord. There have been about three dozen arrests.</p>

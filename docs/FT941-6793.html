			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: Threat to America West rescue plan Unsecured creditors of America West Airlines, the last big US carrier still in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, are threatening to block a rescue plan put forward by the company and support a rival plan rejected by the board. America West last week agreed to a Dollars 220m bid by a consortium linked with Continental Airlines to pave the way for its reorganisation, preferring it to a rival offer from Mr Michael Steinhardt, a New York money manager. The consortium, AmWest Partners, is led by Air Partners, the investment group which brought Continental Airlines out of bankruptcy last year and which owns 28 per cent of Continental. One of Air Partners' principles is Mr David Bonderman, Continental's non-executive chairman. Other investors in AmWest Partners are Continental Airlines itself, with Mesa Airlines, a New Mexico-based regional carrier, and Fidelity Investments, an investment group that specialises in bankruptcy rescues. Under America West's preferred plan, AmWest Partners would provide America West with Dollars 100m of long-term unsecured debt and Dollars 120m of equity in return for 37.5 per cent of the reorganised company. An unnamed secured creditor would get 7.5 per cent, unsecured creditors would get 45 per cent, and the remaining 10 per cent would be divided among existing shareholders, provided the unsecured creditors receive the full value of their claims. America West said it would retain its independence after the proposed reorganisation, but the alliance with Continental would enable the two to co-operate in a range of marketing and operational areas. The unsecured creditors said they opposed the AmWest plan, claiming it involved creating two classes of stock that would leave AmWest with 70 per cent of the votes. It favours the proposal put forward by Steinhardt Partners of New York because this would give unsecured creditors 51 per cent of the equity.</p>

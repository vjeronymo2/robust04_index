			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below 17,000 on futures-related selling THE Nikkei average lost 2.6 per cent yesterday, falling below the important level of 17,000 for the first time since August 26, as futures-related arbitrage unwinding depressed share prices, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index fell 466.00 to 16,903.81. The index opened at the day's high of 17,331.59, then fluctuated in a narrow band for the rest of the morning. Later, arbitrage unwinding and index-linked selling pushed the index to the day's low of 16,833.70. Volume fell to 180m shares from 212m. Buying by public funds was not seen and trading by arbitrageurs dominated activity. Losers led gainers by 780 to 133, with 180 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first-section stocks lost 20.28 to 1,292.99 but in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.95 to 1,039.94. Market participants said the government's 'guidance' to financial institutions not to sell holdings was distorting the market. Rumours that a leading Japanese broker had advised clients to liquidate holdings worried some investors, as did speculation that September money supply figures, to be announced today, would indicate negative growth. However, some investors hope weak economic indicators may prompt the Bank of Japan to ease interest rates. One strategist noted that the Bank of Japan's branch managers' meeting at the end of October could provide indication of the timing of a cut. Pharmaceutical stocks, which had previously gained on the Aids and Interferon themes, fell on profit-taking. Green Cross, the most active issue of the day, lost Y50 to Y1,480 and Meiji Milk Products fell Y28 to Y942. Retailers fell on last week's weak interim earnings announcements. Isetan, a leading department store, lost Y130 to Y2,220 and Marui fell Y30 to Y1,030. Export-oriented companies were lower as the yen regained its strength against the dollar. Hitachi lost Y22 to Y726 and NEC fell Y14 to Y692. Japan Radio, the wireless telecommunications equipment maker, tumbled Y200 to Y1,320 on fears of poor earnings. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 361.66 to 18,709.67 in volume of 7.4m shares. Roundup The bullishness which sent Hong Kong higher yesterday was not apparent elsewhere in the region. Bombay was closed to enable brokers to complete settlement of deals but trading should resume today. HONG KONG shot up in late trading on a wave of overseas buying which brokers attributed to renewed confidence in the long-term economic prospects for China and Hong Kong. The Hang Seng Index ended up 104.58 or 1.75 per cent at 6,089.91. Turnover fell to HKDollars 3.42bn from Friday's HKDollars 3.99bn. Among the most active stocks were HSBC Holdings, up HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 59, Cheung Kong, up 80 cents at HKDollars 22.60 and Sun Hung Kai Properties, up 50 cents at HKDollars 34.25. SEOUL saw renewed optimism on hopes of an end to the recent political instability. Reports that the former co-chairman of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party was not to join a new political party boosted sentiment, analysts said. The composite index climbed 13.25 to 539.70 in turnover of Won315bn. AUSTRALIA closed just off its opening level, after dipping below a key support level earlier in the day. The All Ordinaries index dropped below 1,410 to 1,408.8 before recovering to close at 1,417.6, down 2.2. Turnover was moderate at ADollars 169.5m. The biggest volume in the mining sector was Forsayth, which traded 44m shares overnight at 24 cents. Brokers said the deal was crossed by the Perth stockbroker Hartley Poynton, which sold a further 11m to the London-based brokers County NatWest in an overseas deal. The chairman Mr Andrew Kroger was believed to be the seller and the shares finished unchanged at 25 cents. NEW ZEALAND closed at a 13-month low, as the NZSE-40 capital index fell as low as 1,357.71 before recovering to a 1,365.36 finish, down 8.59. Fletcher Challenge was the focus of the market, as it went ex-dividend of 7 cents. The stock ended unchanged at NZDollars 1.85. The other stock to feature was Lion Nathan, which lost a further 10 cents to NZDollars 4.10. It lost 11 cents on Friday on a report that a broker had downgraded Lion's profit forecast. TAIWAN reversed early gains to finish slightly lower. The weighted index, which opened up more than 20 points, closed 14.81 lower at 3,734.51. Turnover was TDollars 13.7bn. MANILA's power cuts continued to interrupt trading and the composite index closed 13.50 lower at 1,357.61 as combined turnover eased to 211m pesos from 234m. PLDT fell 10 pesos to 940 pesos in spite of a strong rise in US trading on Friday. KUALA LUMPUR concentrated on domestic issues as the composite index gained 4.28 to 612.33. SINGAPORE's investors remained buyers of Malaysian issues and the Straits Times Industrial index fell 5.71 to 1,328.41.</p>

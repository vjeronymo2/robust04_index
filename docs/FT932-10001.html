			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Generale des Eaux advances GENERALE des Eaux, one of France's largest industrial holding companies, saw net profits rise to FFr2.91bn (Dollars 545m) last year from FFr2.61bn in 1991 in spite of the slowdown in the French economy. The group, which has extensive interests in water distribution, media and construction, said it hoped to achieve another increase in net profits this year, although it made no forecasts. It stressed that it saw no sign of improvement in the general economic situation, nor did it expect one in the foreseeable future. Generale mustered an overall increase in sales of 6.3 per cent to FFr143.4bn in 1992 from FFr135.3bn in 1991. Its international interests were affected by the franc's strength following the September currency crisis, with sales outside France rising modestly to FFr38.7bn from FFr36.5bn over the same period. On constant exchange rates it would have made sales of FFr40.3bn. In spite of the chilly economic climate, Generale increased its investments to FFr13bn in 1992 from FFr11.5bn in 1991. It invested FFr3.5bn in its water interests, FFr2.8bn in energy and FFr1bn in property. Operating profits rose by 6.9 per cent to FFr5.95bn last year from FFr5.56bn in 1991 when growth from water, energy and electricity interests compensated for a decline in profits from construction and public works. Generale, like other French property groups, was badly affected by the downturn in the property market. It made a loss on its property interests last year, but managed to bring that division back into the black with the income from its estate agency activities.</p>

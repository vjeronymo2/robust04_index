			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Mid-life crisis in the North Sea: Oil groups are launching costly schemes to refurbish their ageing offshore platforms Mr Rob Holland is a superintendent with AOC International, an offshore construction company. He and his work crew recently spent a month dangling on scaffolding beneath the Brent Bravo oil platform in the North Sea, welding a 100ft steel beam to its underside. The beam was so heavy that it had to be split into five sections and manhandled into position with block and tackle. The work was the start of what is likely to be one of the most ambitious engineering projects undertaken in the North Sea. Shell and Esso, joint owners of the 17-year-old Brent field, the largest in the UK sector, are trying to extend its life beyond its 1998 expiry date with a Pounds 1.3bn project to re-pressurise the wells and modernise three of its four production platforms. According to Mr Walter van der Vijver, manager of the Brent fields in Aberdeen, this plan - if it works - should add 10 years to Brent's life and enable it to produce additional oil and gas equivalent to the output of a small to medium-sized North Sea field. He describes it as 'mid-life crisis work'. The Brent project is a striking example of what many see as a new stage of life for the North Sea. With more than a quarter of a century of production behind it, its installations are showing their age and forcing oil companies to decide whether to invest in extending their lives. Mr David Black, who analyses North Sea developments for Wood Mackenzie, the stockbroker, says: 'There is a realisation now that some fields which have been around for some time still have useful life left.' Decisions are being influenced by a number of factors. The most pressing is the weak oil price, now close to its lowest point in real terms since North Sea production started, which is prompting greater financial rigour. In spite of the substantial cost of redeveloping Brent, Shell believes that it will yield significant gains in efficiency: manpower offshore will be reduced by up to a half which, in turn, will sharply reduce the cost of servicing and supporting platforms. Shell calculates offshore labour costs at Pounds 60 an hour. According to Mr Van de Vijver, the Brent plan has been successfully tested against oil at Dollars 15 a barrel, compared with its current price of Dollars 16.30. 'And even if it fell to Dollars 12, we'd go ahead,' he says. Unfortunately, the characteristics of Brent oil are unique, so other fields cannot be given the identical treatment. But rapid advances in technology and greater cost-awareness have opened up other prospects. A different technological approach was adopted at Scott, a new field which came into production earlier this year. Cost savings were achieved by pre-drilling the wells and locating as much wellhead plant as possible on the sea floor rather than on the platform. This enabled Amerada Hess, the US operator, to complete in only four months start-up work that would normally have taken more than a year, and will lead to reduced manning, according to Mr Rex Gaisford, director of projects. In some fields, manning reductions are being taken much further. Shell is planning to reduce the number of men at its giant Leman gas field in the southern sector of the North Sea from more than 100 to only a handful by 1996. It has also commissioned a study from Kvaerner, the Norwegian offshore constructors, for a new type of platform that would be unmanned, and would only need to be visited by a support vessel once a year. Although new seismic techniques and sophisticated drilling and oil recovery technology tend to attract the most attention, one of the most significant advances offshore was the development of floating cranes, capable of lifting loads of more than 10,000 tonnes in one go, compared with 1,000 tonnes previously. Thanks to floating cranes, installations containing complex plant and machinery can now be assembled onshore where costs are a fraction of those offshore, and then floated out and lifted onto the platform. Cost consciousness has even forced changes in the relationship between North Sea platform operators and their contractors - traditionally an area where the oil companies kept the benefits of greater efficiency to themselves, excluding others from sharing in them. In what is likely to be a pioneering change, the operators and contractors in the newly opened Hyde gas field formed a partnership where any savings in development costs were shared out among the five members. Normally, the operators would hire the contractors at a fixed rate, which gave them an incentive to make a high-priced tender for the work. Mr Chris Rhodes of BP, one of the two oil companies involved (the other being Statoil of Norway), says: 'We felt there was something to be gained from a different relationship with the contractors, one that would take costs out rather than take them in.' There was scepticism in the industry that the experiment would work, but Hyde came in 25 per cent below its Pounds 50m budget, and Mr Rhodes estimates that three-quarters of these savings were due to the arrangement. According to estimates by Wood Mackenzie, new technology and organisational methods have halved production costs in the North Sea. At old platforms these range between Pounds 3.50 and Pounds 5.50 a barrel, at new ones only Pounds 2.50. Shifting patterns in energy use, particularly the growing popularity of natural gas, have also played a part. Once flared off as a useless by-product, gas is now making marginal fields viable, and is likely to overtake oil as the North Sea's leading product within the next 10 years. The other factor shaping developments is the attention to safety since the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988, in which 167 men died. This greater focus on safety is reflected at the newly opened Piper B platform, which stands less than half a mile from the yellow buoy marking the site of its ill-fated predecessor. Compared with the untidy jumble of older platforms, Piper B has a sleek, space-age look. Its most dramatic features are the eight aluminium lifeboats jutting out of the side, ready to nosedive 80ft into the sea in an emergency. The platform lay-out puts personal living quarters at the opposite end from the oil and gas facilities - and shielded by fire-resistant walls. The platform cost Pounds 1.5bn. But its sophisticated controls mean that operating costs will be lower than Piper Alpha's - as little as Pounds 2.50 a barrel, according to Mr Michel Romieu, chairman of Elf Enterprise Caledonia, the operator. But this willingness to invest large sums of money in order to achieve long-term savings is relatively new to the North Sea. Dr Chris Fay, managing director of Shell UK, says: 'We used to measure things by their capital cost; now it's by their lifetime cost.' This change has had a profound influence on planning, and means that new equipment in the North Sea is of higher quality - the extra cost being justified by the fact that it should last longer. A further stimulus to this growth was the government's decision in the last Budget to change the way North Sea oil is taxed so as to give greater incentives to production rather than exploration, reflecting the view that all the big fields have now been found. Although much of the redevelopment work, including Brent, was launched before the change was announced, there is now a stronger incentive for the owners of the largest fields to invest in extending their lives. According to the latest estimate from Scottish Enterprise, the economic development agency, some Pounds 40bn is likely to be invested in UK North Sea oil production over the next four years, including the development of 70 new wells. This will help output from the sector to rise to a peak of 2.48m barrels a day in 1995, up from some 2m this year, although after that it will start tailing off as fields dry up. Mr John Browne, chief executive of BP's exploration division, told the Offshore Europe exhibition in Aberdeen last month that BP would be raising its investment by 10 per cent over the next three years. He expects to see his own company's UK production rise by more than 6 per cent as a result. Mr Browne forecast that new technology and cost reduction could increase North Sea oil recovery by as much as 25 per cent, from 60bn barrels to 75bn (to date some 12bn have been extracted). Other oil executives found those figures over-optimistic. But they do not disagree with the implication that the North Sea should manage to stave off old age for some years yet.</p>

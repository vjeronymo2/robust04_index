			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Northwest Air in two union deals NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth largest US carrier which is currently integrating operations with Europe's KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, announced yesterday that it had secured an 'agreement in principle' with two major unions over key work-rule and pay concessions. Details of the agreement, which is subject to ratification, were not made public. However, two months ago, Northwest offered employees a 20 per cent equity interest in the company if they would provide cost savings of about Dollars 883m over a three-year period. The cost-savings were seen as critical to the US airline's future, and there has been speculation that it might file for bankruptcy protection if the wage concessions were not forthcoming. Yesterday's deal was struck with the International Association of Machinists and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, representing the mechanics and flight attendants respectively. The major employee group which has not yet struck a deal is the Air Line Pilots Association. Three other unions also remain in negotiation with the carrier.</p>

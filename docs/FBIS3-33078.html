Accompanied by Antonio  Gonzalez, one of the discoverers of the vaccine against  Hepatitis-B, as well as by several tourist sector (?and) medical  industry officials, Martinez discussed, with the Medellin City  Council and the municipal firm, Metro-Salud, exchanges in that  area. He held talks with businessmen from several sectors on the  prospects of direct investment in other businesses that Cuba  offers; and at the liquor firm that belongs to Antioquia  Department, the possibility of bottling Cuban rum and  distributing it from there was analyzed. The diplomat gave a  talk at the University of Antioquia on Cuba's current situation  and its future.    The Cuban delegation headed by Ambassador Martinez also  looked into the possibilities for exchanges in the spheres of  education and culture, as well as of joint publishing, with the  Autonomous Latin American University, and visited the daily  papers EL COLOMBIANO and EL MUNDO.    The visitors also met with Mayor Jose Luis Ramos, on which  occasion it was proposed that Medellin become Cienfuegos' twin  city. The Cuban delegation was also received by Antioquia  Governor Juan Gomez, who, like Mayor Ramos, was accompanied by  the secretaries in charge of the various sectors in that region  of northwestern Colombia. At that meeting, the possibilities for  expanding cooperation in the field of sports, in which three  Cuban trainers have been working for some time, were examined,  as well as in the fields of health, education, and the  scientific/technical sphere.</p>

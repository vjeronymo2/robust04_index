Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> VIETNAM IN FINAL CAMBODIA PULLOUT  </P> <P> Thousands of Cambodians threw Vietnamese troops flowers today as Hanoi began a  pledged final withdrawal from an 11-year war against resistance forces its  superior firepower could not suppress.  </P> <P> In the government-organized ceremony, vehicles carrying thousands of soldiers  bearing rifles rumbled out of this northwestern province after a band played  pop music. A commander waved flowers in the lead.  </P> <P> Vietnam says it is conducting a six-day withdrawal of its last 26,000 troops  from Siem Reap and several other areas of the country. But opposing guerrilla  forces charge that Vietnam is faking the troop movement and actually hiding and  disguising its troops.  </P></p>

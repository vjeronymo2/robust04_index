			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges up yet again as region wavers Buying by overseas investors narrowly outpaced large-lot selling by domestic institutions, and the Nikkei index finished marginally higher, gaining ground for the sixth consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average rose 41.51 to 20,663.63 after a low of 20,509.90 and a high of 20,700.94. Active selling by corporate and financial investors pulled share prices down in the afternoon session, but overseas buying then came in and the index recouped its losses. Arbitrageurs, who were heavy buyers on Tuesday, retreated to the sidelines as they adjusted their positions ahead of today's last trading session for April settlements. Volume totalled 440m shares against 552m. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 2.56 to 1,658.18, and the Nikkei 300 by 0.60 to 303.27. Gainers led losers by 506 to 503 with 173 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.94 to 1,358.77. Traders said that investors were growing cautious in reaction to the recent gains in share prices. However, Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, said that increasing evidence that corporate earnings were now bottoming out was underpinning share prices. Buying by overseas investors pushed up heavy electricals. Hitachi rose Y20 to Y1,030 and Toshiba gained Y7 to Y803. Consumer electronics shares also rose with Matsushita adding Y60 to Y1,810 and Sony up Y30 to Y5,970. TDK, the video game maker, lost Y90 to Y4,540 on poor profits. Large capital shipbuilders were also strong on foreign buying. Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding rose Y14 to Y373 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries added Y8 to Y723. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone saw continued support from bargain hunting after its recent weakness. The stock rose Y25,000 to Y867,000. Speculative stocks lost ground on profit-taking. Sumitomo Coal Mining fell Y32 to Y948 and Chino fell Y90 to Y1,050. Non-life insurers lost ground. The industry had been requesting an increase in fire insurance premiums, but it has been hit by the government's decision to freeze all rises in public service rates. Tokio Marine and Fire fell Y10 to Y1,330. Mining stocks, which had gained in tandem with commodity prices, met profit-taking. Sumitomo Metal Mining fell Y2 to Y942. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 12.55 to 22,724.04 in volume of 26.3m shares. Roundup Sentiment was mixed around the Pacific Rim. Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Bombay and Colombo were closed for public holidays. SYDNEY seemed in confused disarray as weakness in the gold, banking and resource sectors left the All Ordinaries index down 26.5, or 1.2 per cent, at 2,105.9. In the banking sector, down nearly 3 per cent overall, ANZ took the sharpest fall to end 22 cents, or almost 5 per cent lower at ADollars 4.44 although it posted a big jump in half year profits. The golds sub-index dropped 39.9, or 1.7 per cent to 2,333.4 following weakness in New York bullion overnight, and the resource and commodity sectors followed suit, this time on profit-taking. MANILA's buyers paused for breath and again and the composite index fell another 22.77 to 2,879.21 although traders said that the mood remained positive. Turnover fell from 1bn pesos to 762m pesos. HONG KONG balanced afternoon profit-taking against positive Chinese comments on airport project financing, and the Hang Seng Index rose 31.26 to 9,521.37, well below the day's peak of 9,664.07. Turnover improved from HKDollars 3.97bn to HKDollars 4.59bn. Jardine Matheson outperformed with a rise of HKDollars 2.50, or 4.2 per cent to HKDollars 62.50 on institutional bargain hunting. TAIPEI featured strength in electronics as the weighted index staged a weak rebound after seven straight sessions of falls, closing 6.06 higher at 5,775.18 in slow turnover of TDollars 36.22bn. Reports that the government had agreed gradually to raise the ceiling of foreign equity investment funds to TDollars 20bn from the current USDollars 7.5bn, lifted electronics, a foreign favourite, with ASE up TDollars 2.50 to TDollars 81.50 and Acer TDollars 1.50 better at TDollars 57. BANGKOK was led higher by the finance and banking sectors, which accounted for over 45 per cent of the business done yesterday as the SET index closed 10.21 higher at 1,348.80 in turnover of Bt7.1bn. KARACHI closed flat in low volume, the KSE 100 index rising 0.93 to 2,246.61, but Fecto Cement put on Rs1.25 to Rs52.75 on dividend hopes.</p>

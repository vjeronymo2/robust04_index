			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Arts: Britain's opera houses move into the future - Richard Fairman reviews a morale-boosting year of innovative productions, noisy audiences and new theatres The nation may have lost its enthusiasm for moving house, but opera companies are on the move as never before. In a round of keeping up with the Joneses that puts Acacia Drive to shame, UK opera companies are all - with one exception - in the process of redeveloping, upgrading, or building new homes from scratch. It has not gone unnoticed in political circles that the first new opera-house to open its front door to the public was the only one in the private sector. Glyndebourne did everything right. Having raised private sponsorship during the boom years, it built its new theatre when costs were low during the recession. Unveiled in May, 60 years to the day after the first performance in the old house, this handsome building combines good acoustics and international class, all at the very reasonable price tag of Pounds 33 million. Nobody will have begrudged Glyndebourne its year of triumph, not even those who booed the new production of Don Giovanni. As well as the theatre, this year's festival inaugurated a new artistic partnership between Andrew Davis as music director and Graham Vick as director of productions, a team which has ambitions to lead this rural festival into new pastures, more challenging than the old. Their own contribution to the season was Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin, stylishly designed, well sung and played. This was self-evidently an evening of quality, even to those (admittedly a minority) who found it cool and calculated, as I did. Deborah Warner's uncompromising production of Don Giovanni divided opinion more violently. The key question for Glyndebourne is how far its core audience will be prepared to support this shift in artistic direction. Seats used to be like gold dust, but not this year. What will happen in 1995, when the new productions are Rossini's Ermione and Janacek's The Makropoulos Case? Or in 1996 with Handel's rarely-heard oratorio Theodora (in the hands of enfant terrible Peter Sellars) and Berg's Lulu? At Covent Garden any action on the rebuilding front remains on hold at the moment. Westminster City Council approved the revised plans for the Pounds 100 million redevelopment scheme submitted by the Royal Opera House in June, but that was probably little more than a formality. The phantom of the opera waiting in the wings for the general director, Jeremy Isaacs, is public opinion, which dislikes the idea of the poor man's National Lottery stake going to pay for the rich man's opera-house. For the time being, however, morale at the Royal Opera remains fairly high. Nothing brings a company's artistic strategy more clearly into focus than embarking on Wagner's Ring. After a couple of false starts in recent years - one staging abandoned, another borrowed - this latest production by Richard Jones looks set to run the course, guaranteeing front page news as it goes its wild way. Either one loves Wotan as a traffic cop and the Rhinemaidens as fat, flubbery, Michelin-girls, or one hates them. To please its paymasters, the Royal Opera might think of making a gesture towards the UK's balance of payments. A clear trend has emerged this year for in-house productions - like Massenet's frothy Cherubin and the recently-televised La traviata - to be sturdy examples of British manufacturing, while those imported from overseas have been shoddy goods. Did nobody notice that the Old Testament dust had settled on Rossini's Mose in Egitto before it left Bologna, or that the kiss of death had long since suffocated Toulouse's moribund production of Gounod's Romeo et Juliette? The Royal Opera also hit the headlines when The Hecklers booed and jeered a revival of Birtwistle's Gawain. Ironically their protest backfired: thanks to the publicity the opera was a near sell-out, so 'boo' to them instead. In musical terms it has been a good year, especially for the music director, Bernard Haitink, who was praised for his Ring and showed himself a tender Janacek conductor with Katya Kabanova. If the redevelopment becomes reality and the Royal Opera House closes in 1997, what will he do? Surely he will not be content to be conductor without portfolio? One irony is that the arrival of the National Lottery could give us less arts, not more. If English National Opera succeeds in getting the Pounds 40m it requires for the refurbishment of the Coliseum, both London opera-houses could be closed for building work at the same time. Restoring Edwardian grandeur is the aim here: much of the splendour of Frank Matcham's Imperial Rome interior is under a layer of grime at the moment (how many have seen the mosaic floors proclaiming 'Salve' inside the entrance?). The company spirit at ENO will have been buoyed by a rise in attendances to around 78 per cent (up from 60 per cent) since the summer. Having inherited a stock of productions that the Arts Council declared redundant, the new regime has set about renewing the standard repertory at top speed. Sometimes the haste was obvious. Productions such as Cosi fan tutte and Eugene Onegin sought to offer novelty at the lowest possible dent to the balance sheet and may be replaced themselves in a year or two's time. The disastrous Jenufa will probably not last even that long. Perhaps the disposable opera production has finally arrived. Dennis Marks, the general director, will be aware that his successes have been the most professional presentations, like Massenet's long-unseen Don Quichotte and Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier with old ENO troupers Anne Evans and John Tomlinson lured back from Bayreuth. Musorgsky's five-hour Khovanshchina offered an epic lesson in Russian history to which the party faithful turned up in large numbers. Even Judith Weir's slip of a new opera, Blond Eckbert, was reasonably well attended, although Marks looked enviously at the full houses for Birtwistle up the road. If only The Hecklers could have visited ENO too, he opined ruefully. Scottish Opera is lucky enough to have unveiled its new theatre already. Although the company's base remains in Glasgow, it now has the refurbished 1920s Empire Theatre for its visits to Edinburgh. A highly-praised gala performance of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde in June marked the transformation of this ex-bingo hall into an opera-house of some style, blessed with excellent sight-lines and lively acoustics - all for a mere Pounds 21m out of the corporate sporran. The canny Scots spend their money wisely. In artistic terms, more regrettably, there was no profligacy either. The company enjoyed modest successes, such as a pleasing L'elisir d'amore and an effective Peter Grimes, but Tim Albery's staging of Fidelio was the only one to exhibit real flair and ambition. Perhaps surviving at all in the present economic climate is as much as one has a right to expect. Smaller companies did not enjoy a good year. Opera Factory made a heartrending appeal from the stage for donations, but after their cliche-ridden production of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress and the premiere of Nigel Osborne's uncommunicative Sarajevo, sympathisers will have put their wallets straight back in their pockets. Almeida Opera's two premieres - Elena Firsova's The Nightingale and the Rose and Jonathan Dove's Siren Song - were short and sweet. English Touring Opera kept ticking over with La Boheme and Gluck's Orfeo. The exception (again]) was Glyndebourne Touring Opera, which scored a monster of a hit with Birtwistle's King Kong opera, The Second Mrs Kong. Round the rest of the country opera managers were deserting ship. Ian Ritchie had barely been with Opera North for a year before he was packing his bags, apparently oblivious that he was running the only opera company not moving to a new theatre. From its base in Leeds, Opera North continues to seek out the operas that nobody else dares to play. This season included a creditable attempt to resurrect Chabrier's seductive Le Roi malgre lui, a newly-discovered version of Puccini's La rondine and Verdi's first opera, Oberto, produced by John Tomlinson, laying aside his Wagnerian spear. In addition, the company scored a popular goal with Benedict Mason's footballing opera, Playing Away, when it arrived back at its home ground after the premiere at the Munich Biennale. Opera North remains at the top of the 'Adventurousness' league. Matthew Epstein lasted longer at the head of Welsh National Opera - three years out of his contracted five. Blaming cuts in subsidy, he left no doubt as to the reason for his departure, adding ominously as he went that he hoped 'WNO will be strong enough to move into (its new theatre)'. The plan in Wales is for a wholly new theatre in the Cardiff Bay development area, financed with a grant from the Millennium Fund. At a cost of around Pounds 43m the company hopes to have a striking 'glass necklace' building that will become a local landmark, like the opera house in Sydney. With a bit of luck it might be suitable for opera, too. Epstein's talent-spotting eye was doubtless responsible for finding some of WNO's promising young singers during the year, but there have also been interesting productions, like the provocative Turandot and a heavenly staging of Berlioz's Beatrice et Benedict, produced by Elijah Moshinsky. I have left this until last, because it was the most outstanding opera performance in Britain this year, near to perfection in every way. An evening like that leaves one full of optimism for a future which sees our opera companies installed in fantastic, state-of-the-art theatres. If any of them fails to get the money, they could always try buying a ticket for the National Lottery.</p>

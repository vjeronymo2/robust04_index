Wishing It and Ourselves Success"]    [Text] Not long before the memorable 21 September, at the  old parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, I was shown  the schedule for the preparation of draft laws in 1993-1994.  More than 30 of them directly affected the Armed Forces. I  would not presume to judge how far all these drafts truly  reflected the vital problems of the Army, servicemen, and their  families, but certainly the schedule itself indicated the  existence of a comprehensive program of legal provision for the  life and activities of the Armed Forces. Suffice it to say that  the draft Fundamentals of Legislation on Veterans had already  passed its first reading and was close to becoming law.    I recall this today only because I would like the new  parliament's deputies and us to remember the purpose of the  lofty assembly -- not only to resolve Federation Council and  State Duma property questions, not only to enable factions to  get down to brass tacks, make political statements and debate  with the government and the president, but also to carry out  meticulous work on Russian legislation. Particularly as it  turns out that our legislation is far from perfect and has big  gaps in it, like a ship on the stocks.    But this is just one area in which legislators apply their  efforts. One of many. And servicemen, of course, are one  stratum of the population that is waiting impatiently for the  rule-of-law state to take their interests into account. If one  is talking about laws that have already been adopted, they  represent merely a kind of foundation stone -- there is no end  of work to be done to provider the superstructure and work out  the details.    Both chambers of the Federal Assembly start work today, 11  January. Having found their workplaces, not without difficulty  (and scandal), our elected representatives have to solve a mass  of organizational questions -- who is to head the chambers, who  is to head the committees and commissions, what the standing  orders should be, what to pay attention to first and foremost,  and so on. At the stage of consultations the parliamentary  forces did not make much progress toward accord. But let us  hope that the very atmosphere of parliamentary business will  attune the deputies to cooperation. As for various threatening  statements by the leaders of factions in the State Duma, let us  put them down to the obligatory rhetoric on such occasions.    Of course, it would be naive to hope that the new  parliamentarians will focus exclusively on legislative activity.  The obligatory backcloth, as in any parliament, will be  political struggle. The question is to what extent will this  struggle preoccupy deputies' minds and will there be any room  left for actual legislation.    We are all faced with an example of the tragic denouement of  the conflict between the two branches of authority. Will this  lofty assembly be the bulwark of a rule-of-law state or will it  turn into another source of political tension in the country,  embroiling the broadest strata of the population in an  internecine struggle? Unfortunately, there are few grounds for  optimistic forecasts at the moment. On the one hand, the energy  of election rivalry is not yet spent and is still making an  impact, on the other hand, the new parliamentarians' ambitions  are beginning to take shape. Naturally, the interplay of these  ambitions is hotting up the atmosphere of the Federal Assembly,  which was not exactly cool to begin with.    What can one hope for in such a situation? The common sense  of the majority of parliamentarians, that is all. Presumably,  only a few of them will not be aware that what is being decided  today is the fate not of individual statesmen and politicians  who see themselves as irreplaceable, but the fate of the  reforms, and, ultimately, the fate of Russia. In fact, it is  all clear and simple: If this parliament turns into an arena of  intransigence, with squabbles and feuds as its main attractions,  we will all have to forget about our dreams of a civilized,  rule-of-law state for a long time.    So a new chapter of Russian parliamentarianism is beginning.  It is hard to imagine any Russian citizen not wishing the  Federal Assembly success. In the end, any other outcome would  result in irrevocable losses for society and the forfeiture of  civil peace. But, as the say, let us wait and see.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Murcia: "Candidates' Offensive Against </F> Voter Apathy"]    [Text] In the weeks ahead, particularly in  January, presidential and congressional candidates will launch a  major propaganda and proselytizing offensive aimed at  penetrating the apathy that has seriously affected the election  campaign.    Many candidates are very concerned about the conclusions  drawn by pollsters suggesting that 40 to 50 percent of all  Colombians have no interest in the four elections to be held in  1994. The number of undecided voters is also high. Under such  conditions, if politicians do not adopt a more convincing  attitude toward the voters, more could abstain than in previous  years, these same analysts say.    Neither presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano nor his  campaign managers and advisers agree. They predict that  enthusiasm among Liberals will pick up in 1994 and equal that  seen in previous campaigns. They claim that Liberals could make  up 55 or 60 percent of the total number of voters. They estimate  that over 3.5 million Liberals will vote, 2 million for Samper  and the rest split by the remaining four precandidates still in  the race by 13 March: Humberto de la Calle, Carlos Lemos  Simmonds, Rodolfo Gonzalez, and David Turbay. It is rumored that  Luis Guillermo Sorzano is preparing to launch his candidacy for  the Senate although he has delayed the announcement.  <H5>  Election Calculations </H5>   They estimate that some 6 million persons will go to the  polls to cast their ballots for the various parties and groups  in the congressional elections. For obvious reasons, that figure  could be somewhat lower for the presidential elections because  the lure and intensive work of congressional candidates will be  missing. However, at the last minute, the element of the mayoral  and gubernatorial races could possibly rouse voters out of their  apathy.    The Conservative election between presidential candidates  called by the union of the "rebel quintuplets": Rodrigo Marin,  Rodrigo Llorente, Juan Diego Jaramillo, Gabriel Melo, and  Roberto Gerlein, but rejected by those following the guidelines  of the Conservative leadership supporting Andres Pastrana, could  rally some 600,000 votes, according to its organizers'  estimates. However, when one considers that the Conservative  Party could win nearly 160,000 votes for Congress, the party  could find itself in a difficult situation due to the split into  two major blocs for the 8 May elections. One group would back  Andres Pastrana while the other would rally behind the candidate  chosen from among Rodrigo Marin, Juan Diego Jaramillo, Rodrigo  Llorente, Gabriel Melo, and Roberto Gerlein.    Under these conditions, the Conservative picture does not  look particularly promising because Alvaro Gomez Hurtado is  expected to make his political move following the 13 March  elections and there is no indication of which way he will go.  While Gomez Hurtado has not sided with either faction, his  silence is an obvious sign of indirect support for the "rebel"  election.    It will not be easy to control Congress for the coming  elections because senatorial candidacies are nationwide. This  fact forces candidates to spread out all over the country,  changing the terms of regional politics. In addition, the  separation of congressional elections from those for councils,  assemblies, mayoralties, and governorships leads one to think  that terrorist groups might do their utmost to disturb law and  order.  <H5>  Everything To Win </H5>   Although public opinion polls point to a possible tie  between  Samper and Pastrana on the first presidential ballot, it should  be noted that after the Liberal nomination, the Liberal  precandidates now opposing Samper will back him. In contrast,  Pastrana will face a split in his party that appears to be  irreversible. While Pastrana could possibly win a few Liberal or  independent followers, he will not have other elements in his  camp like those that backed Belisario Betancur's national  candidacy in his race against Alfonso Lopez Michelsen. The  latter was a candidate who faced Liberal resistance and, above  all, a very strong rival in the ranks of his own party: Luis  Carlos Galan, who is a far cry from Enrique Parejo.    Among his political assets for 1994, Samper can also rely on  the fact that Gaviria's positive image resulting from the blows  the latter dealt to drug trafficking will help him more than  they will Pastrana. This is so even though he has had to put  some distance between himself and this government on such issues  as agrarian policy, the economic liberalization program, and  social security reform. He also hopes to get on well with the  followers and leadership of the Democratic Alliance M-19, mainly  because of similar positions on many social, economic, and  political issues.  <H5>  Favorable Star </H5>   Andres Pastrana, to whom the past two weeks have not been  kind because of the revolt of the quintuplet union and because  of what happened to his cousin, Gustavo Pastrana Gomez,  diplomatic adviser in Uruguay, is confident that his good rating  in public opinion polls will hold until May because to date, his  campaign has been waged more on image than on any platform. His  visit to Venezuela on Wednesday was an attempt to win back  points and divert attention to other issues. In that  international action he had the support of Development Minister  Luis Alberto Moreno, his future campaign director.    All predictions revolve around two key persons in the  campaign: Andres Pastrana and Ernesto Samper, assuming that no  blows will be struck in the elections. However, Enrique Parejo,  Miguel Alfredo Maza Marquez, Antonio Navarro, Humberto de la  Calle, and Carlos Lemos are confident that the rules of play  will change in their favor and that the "sure bets" are in for a  surprise. "They have ruled us out ahead of time, but they are  going to get the surprise of their lives," Parejo says, dreaming  of an election fluke. "It's not over yet," De la Calle argues.  Lemos is quieter, perhaps because he is beginning to be named  for the vice presidential spot in Julio Cesar Sanchez's  proposal, the key to a "winning team" with Samper.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Boeing wins Dollars 5bn order for its 767s BOEING yesterday launched a programme to build an all-cargo version of its 767 twin engine wide-body aircraft after winning a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) order for 60 all-cargo 767s from United Parcel Service (UPS). The Atlanta-based package delivery company has placed firm orders for 30 new 767 cargo aircraft and taken options on a further 30. Boeing said it was the largest order for all-cargo aircraft it had ever received. It comes as Boeing, like other manufacturers, is coming under pressure from financially pressed airline customers to defer or cancel new orders. Detailed design engineering on the new cargo aircraft, based on the Boeing 767-300 extended range airframe, will begin immediately, with production starting in the second quarter of next year, Boeing said. The first 767 freighter will roll out of production and enter flight testing in the second quarter of 1995 with delivery to UPS in October 1995. The new cargo aircraft will be capable of carrying 56 tons of cargo over a range of 3000 nautical miles or 45 tons as far as 4000 nautical miles. UPS has not selected the engines for the aircraft. Aircraft exports involving British Aerospace have won export credit guarantees worth Dollars 106m, the Export Credit Guarantees Department, Britain's official export credit insurer, said yesterday, David Dodwell writes. The guarantees have helped to ensure finance for the sale of nine aircraft to five countries as part of the pan-European Airbus project. They concern the lease of two A330-600R aircraft to Ansett Airlines of Australia, two A310-300s to Tarom of Romania, and two A320s apiece to TransAsia of Taiwan and Air Lanka. The purchase of an A320-200 by Tunis Air has also been supported.</p>

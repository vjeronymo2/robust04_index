			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PICUS LINKS WARNER PLAN, SOUTH AFRICA;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE BUILDER OF THE WARNER RIDGE OFFICE PROJECT SAYS IT WILL  GENERATE $4.5 MILLION FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING.  </P> <P> The controversy over the Warner Ridge project took new twists Friday as Los  Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus accused one of the project's partners of  doing business with South Africa, and the developer told a Pierce College group  his project will generate $4.5 million for low-income housing.  </P> <P> The heavily lobbied proposal to build half a dozen office towers -- ranging  from three to seven stories, with 810,000 square feet of space -- at De Soto  Avenue and Oxnard Street comes before the full council next Wednesday.  </P> <P> It's unclear what the outcome of the vote will be, City Hall watchers say.  </P> <P> Picus, who is seeking to quash the project and force the rezoning of the  property to permit only residential development, distributed a letter Friday to  her council colleagues revealing that Johnson Wax Development, a 50% partner  with the Spound Co. in the project, has a subsidiary in South Africa.  </P> <P> Picus said Johnson Wax's subsidiary is relevant to the Warner Ridge debate  because of the council's longstanding opposition to South Africa's apartheid  regime. The city has passed laws barring firms from receiving municipal  contracts if they do business in South Africa and required the city's public  employee pension funds to divest stocks or bonds in companies tied to South  Africa.  </P> <P> Connection to firms doing business with South Africa has not been used in the  past as grounds to deny building permits or zoning changes, however, a city  Planning Department official said.  </P> <P> The councilwoman told a reporter her letter was primarily aimed at the  council's three black members and particularly at Councilman Robert Farrell, a  South-Central Los Angeles lawmaker who is the sole member of the council's  planning committee to support the proposed Warner Ridge development. The  committee voted 2 to 1 to support Picus last month.  </P> <P> Farrell is also a council leader on the issue of South African divestment. To  counter Picus' move, the Warner Ridge team quickly dispatched black attorney  Yvonne Brathwaite Burke to City Hall to meet with Farrell to explain the  Johnson Wax situation.  </P> <P> Steve Afriat, a lobbyist who represents developer Jack Spound, said Johnson Wax  is "one of the most philanthropic and civil rights-minded corporations" and has  the "highest record of working with anti-apartheid activists." Afriat said the  billion-dollar corporation had even been asked by anti-apartheid activists in  South Africa to remain in their country because it is a large and enlightened  employer of blacks.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Spound caught his opponents by surprise Friday when he told a Pierce  College panel that his project would -- if allowed to proceed -- contribute  $4.5 million toward the construction of low-income housing in the city of Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> "That came out of the blue," said Shirley Blessing, treasurer of the Woodland  Hills Homeowners Organization. WHHO is Picus' major ally in the fight to kill  the proposed Warner Ridge project.  </P> <P> Afriat said the $4.5 million figure was based on an estimate of how much the  Warner Ridge project would be required to pay into a city housing fund if the  City Council passes a proposed law to require commercial development projects  to pay fees into a fund to build low- and medium-priced housing.  </P> <P> Spound brought up the $4.5-million housing fee Friday during a meeting of the  Pierce College Planning Advisory Committee, held to give WHHO another  opportunity to urge the college to change its position on the Warner Ridge  project. The college opposes residential development on the property, next to  college land, but is neutral on commercial development on the site.  </P> <P> After hearing from both sides, the college panel stuck to its previous  position. "It was disappointing," Blessing said.  </P></p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Recession hits French chemicals group profit RHONE-POULENC, which is expected to be privatised shortly by the French government, yesterday reported operating profits down 19.3 per cent from FFr2.162bn (Pounds 250m) to FFr1.7bn for the first quarter. The group suffered a 7.9 per cent fall in turnover from FFr21.5bn to FFr19.8bn. Excluding exchange rates, the fall was 4.7 per cent. Turnover was also affected by last year's European Community common agricultural policy reforms. The company warned that operating income during the first half of the year was likely to remain weak due to sluggish economic conditions. However, it predicted that improvements from the health and agrochemicals divisions should contribute to operating income gains during the second six months. The situation facing fibres and chemicals would continue to be difficult, it added. Operating profits at the organic and inorganic intermediates division fell from FFr264m to zero, on sales down 16.8 per cent at FFr3.572bn. The speciality chemicals posted trading profits down 25 per cent from FFr196m to FFr147m on turnover down 15.5 per cent at FFr3.347bn. Trading results at the fibres division also fell, this time 78 per cent from FFr232m to FFr51m on turnover down 19.2 per cent at FFr2.871bn. Agrochemicals operating profits fell 22.6 per cent from FFr625m to FFr484m on turnover down 11.9 per cent at FFr2.86bn. About 53 per cent of its turnover is in Europe.</p>

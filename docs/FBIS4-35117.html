			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 26 Jun (EFE) -- The general elections,  presidential and legislative, will be held in Peru on 9 April  1995, the second Sunday in April. This announcement was made  today by the National Elections Board [JNE].    JNE President Ricardo Nugent stated that the electoral law  establishes that the elections will be held on the second Sunday  of April. He added, however, that the executive branch must call  for the elections.    Nugent also said that the JNE will look into the possibility  of submitting a draft bill to modify the current law and to  establish that electoral propaganda is allowed until the day of  the elections, as well as to allow the disclosure of public  opinion polls.    According to the law currently in force, electoral  propaganda  is only allowed until 48 hours before the day of the elections,  and the results of polls can only be disclosed until 15 days  before the elections.    In a statement to the media, Nugent said that "nobody is  going to change his opinion whether he is told something the day  of the elections or 48 hours before."    Nugent also said that on the day of the upcoming general  elections, any political party or civic group will be able to  carry out vote counts parallel to the official vote returns of  the JNE.</p>

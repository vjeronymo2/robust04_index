			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Finland plans to cut state ownership in Finnair to 50.1% Finland's government is to seek parliamentary approval to cut state ownership of Finnair, the national airline, to as little as 50.1 per cent. The move would be in line with the country's privatisation programme. The state owns 72 per cent of Finnair, and the government says it wants to retain a majority stake in the airline for the moment. Approval of the scheme would enable Finnair to issue new shares to private investors when market conditions allow. The company made FM89.8m (Dollars 16m) profit in the six months ended September 1993, compared with a loss of FM197m in the same period of 1992. It has said it expects full-year losses to halve from FM415m.</p>

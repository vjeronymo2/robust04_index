Largely deprived of logistical support,  the PKK is also losing its leading cadres. Muslum Durgun, alias  Dr. Baran, who was known to be [PKK leader] Abdullah Ocalan's  right-hand man, recently committed suicide when the security  forces cornered him during an operation.    [Begin unidentified off-screen correspondent recording] The  loss of logistical support is cited as the main thing causing  the PKK to bleed. The organization has reportedly started  sustaining losses, because it is finding difficulty in obtaining  shelter, food, and militants. The latest example is the loss of  Dr. Baran, who was known to be close to Ocalan.    Dr. Baran, the so-called official responsible for Dersim  [the  Tunceli and Erzincan regions] Province, used a hand grenade to  commit suicide when he was cornered in a clash with the security  forces.    The Interior Ministry announced that the militant using the  alias Dr. Baran was found dead on 12 March 1994.    According to available information, the PKK, which is  gradually losing strength, is preparing for a show of force  during the local elections. The PKK asked for a boycott of the  elections. If the boycott succeeds, the PKK is expected to  become active again to regain strength. But reports from the  region show that the PKK's call for a boycott will not succeed.  There is reportedly enthusiasm in party headquarters in east  and southeast Anatolia three days ahead of the elections.    Reports from the region indicate that the security forces  have completed their preparations for dealing the final blow to  the PKK soon after the local elections. [end recording]</p>

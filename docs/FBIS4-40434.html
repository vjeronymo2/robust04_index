			<p>BFN     [Text] Two cubic meters of water continue to leak every  hour from a storage facility in the second power unit of the  Chernobyl station, its chief engineer Viktor Vasilchenko told  INTERFAX-Ukraine.    The leakage from the storage of processed nuclear fuel was  detected on 11 June.    Vasilchenko said the leakage resulted from the way storage  facilities of this kind had been installed.    Vasilchenko also said that the heating elements would be  removed from the storage before Friday and the source of leakage  would be found soon after. He thought that even if the storage  facility was destroyed, nothing serious would happen.    Alexander Yelchishchev, chief of a shift in the station, had  told INTERFAX-Ukraine that radiation in neighboring premises was  normal.</p>

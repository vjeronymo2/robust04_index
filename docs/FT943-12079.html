			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mindless sort of irritation Sir, I would like to make the loudest possible plea for a return to some old-fashioned and sensible telephone answering skills in the many service and other organisations that one has to deal with as a matter of daily necessity. I surely am not alone in wishing to hang up and phone some other organisation when the person on the other end of the line says: 'Hello, thank you for calling the Mucky Sludge Company. This is Kevin/Debbie speaking. How may I help you?' (How I wish to tell them]) After you have been transferred through a couple more of these over-programmed people, you are definitely left wondering about the real service intentions or qualities of the company you have telephoned. The person who invented this form of mindless response needs medical treatment urgently. Harold Cottam, Pentwyn, Dorstone, Hereford HR3 6AD</p>

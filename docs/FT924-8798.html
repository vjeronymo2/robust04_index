			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden (1): Unity beats speculators - Two months ago, the main political parties suspended hostilities to see off currency speculators and restore competitiveness. Though they favour moves to join the European Community, the electorate is less keen SWEDEN'S ability to adapt its economy and political system to the realities of international recession was put to a severe test this autumn as capital flowed out of the country in a crisis of confidence. In its stubborn defence of the krona's fixed exchange rate, Sweden stood impressively united. A wide alliance emerged combining the political parties, employers, financiers, trade unionists and the public. For many Swedes it became a patriotic duty to stand firm against devaluation. Other European countries - Britain, Spain, Italy and Finland - caved in under the pressure of the speculators. The French franc was saved by the powerful intervention of the Bundesbank. Only Sweden among those in the eye of Europe's financial storms came through by its own efforts. 'I have found many governments on my recent travels around Europe who have been impressed by what we did,' says Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's conservative prime minister. At one point the central bank was forced to increase its overnight lending rate to 500 per cent to convince the markets of Sweden's resolve. 'At first, we underestimated the severity of the crisis,' admits Mr Bildt. Indeed, it took at least a fortnight of public urging from Mr Bengt Dennis, the central bank governor, to convince the government it must reassure the markets that it would eliminate the country's structural budget deficit. National resistance to devaluation was impressive. After all, Sweden has used that weapon many times since the war to improve its industrial competitiveness at the expense of its trading partners. However, Mr Bildt argues: 'Devaluation does not work in the long run - that was our experience.' Mr Ingvar Carlsson, leader of the Social Democrats, agrees with him. Under enormous pressure, the main political parties suspended their animosities to hammer out two separate national crisis packages designed to defend the krona and restore the country's industrial competitiveness. 'It was an historic milestone,' declares Mr Carlsson. There have been sacrifices on both sides. Cherished welfare programmes, such as child benefit, have been cut. Some of the government's free market plans, such as privatising state industries, have been postponed. Living standards will be squeezed and there will be more unemployment. But opinion polls suggest nearly 90 per cent of Swedes agree with what was done. The response to September's crisis shows how Sweden has changed over the past three and a half years since the abolition of its foreign exchange controls in July 1989. From being a model social democracy, it is being transformed into a market-oriented economy determined to integrate into western Europe. All the controls and regulations that cut the country off from the rest of the world have gone. From January 1 Sweden will become a member of the 19-nation European Economic Area. Now most influential Swedes want to become good Europeans and travel on the inside track of the Community. The consensus among the country's great and the good over the virtues of EC membership remains solid. When formal negotiations begin with Brussels on Sweden's entry early next year the impetus for a swift and successful outcome will quicken. Mr Bildt insists his country's tight timetable for EC membership can still be kept despite doubts over the Maastricht treaty in Denmark and Britain and worries over lost EC momentum. He wants to see an outline agreement ready by next December so it can be ratified by parliament and then presented for the approval of the Swedish people in a binding referendum perhaps in the spring or early summer of 1994, before the general election due that autumn. If all goes well, Sweden could then join the EC on January 1 1995. The prime minister considers that negotiations with the EC will take only 'two to three months' to reach a satisfactory outcome. He sees the only problem area as regional policy, with reassurances from Brussels that it will recognise the special needs of Sweden's Arctic Circle area. But enlargement also involves Finland, Austria and probably Norway as well as Switzerland. Mr Bildt accepts their negotiations could prove harder and might hold up Sweden's move. At present the opinion polls suggest most Swedes are against EC entry, partly because of the confusion over the ratification of the Maastricht treaty, but also because many identify the EC cause with a currently unpopular government. But, Mr Bildt insists the mood is changeable. With all the main political parties campaigning for a Yes vote in the referendum, he believes the pro-EC forces will win. He also draws comfort from the fact that unlike in Norway the present hostility towards the EC in Sweden has not led to the development of a political movement aginst entry. Only the tiny Greens and the former Communist party oppose Sweden's EC entry and neither has more than 4 per cent of the vote at present. The politicians believe they have time to convince the voters to support the EC. There is a sound reason for the apparent haste by those who want to see rapid negotiation for Sweden to join the EC. Under the country's constitution so fundamental a change must be ratified by two successive parliaments. Ratification is needed for any amendment to the constitution at least nine months before a general election and this must be voted through again by the incoming parliament. In practice, this would mean ratifying Sweden's entry terms by next December 18 as the Swedish voters go to the country again on September 18 1994. If this timetable goes adrift Sweden would not be able to join the EC until January 1998. In the meantime, Sweden faces other severe problems. Its recession is likely to continue longer than anybody expected a few months ago. Unemployment looks set to rise to 9 per cent or more - figures not seen in Sweden since the early 1930s. An export-led recovery is expected as the country's industrial competitiveness improves with lower costs and greater productivity, but for most Swedes the next two years will mean a probable decline in living standards and real wages, with negative or next to no growth before 1995. With the international money markets likely to remain feverish, Sweden is still vulnerable as a small, open economy dependent on exports to maintain its relatively affluent lifestyle. Pressures on the krona have abated, but they could return again. The future of the country's banks and financial institutions continues to cause concern. The credit losses resulting from the reckless lending policies of the late 1980s after deregulation have already forced the state to underpin Nordbanken, Gota Bank and the savings bank Skopbanken. The government is taking the unprecedented step of guaranteeing to uphold the financial system at a cost of up to SKr90bn over the next three years. This will be a severe burden on the taxpayer and could trigger wider anxieties about the solidity of the banks. But there is a greater worry ahead. Sweden's budget deficit is forecast by the Ministry of Finance to reach 10 per cent of the country's gross national product by the 1993-1994 financial year, a figure Mr Bildt and others accept is 'unsustainable'. The protracted slump means the cyclical debt will go on rising as the structural one declines, so Sweden will have no choice but to reduce the huge size of its public sector. So far, it has only been trimmed round the edges. More drastic surgery will be necessary next year. But there could be strong resistance to change, as illustrated in recent weeks by the trade union uproar over the all-party proposal that workers should lose two days from their statutory five weeks and two days' paid holiday. Vested interests in the Swedish welfare state remain formidable. Politicians across the spectrum have talked for years about restructuring the public services - making them more sensitive to consumer needs and introducing greater individual choice. But when it comes to action, much of Sweden's public services are run by the local authorities, not the central state. Moreover, any radical strategy would involve job losses and upheaval while the Swedish labour market has no employment opportunities. This is why Mr Bildt and others talk about a phased programme of renewal. All sides agreed in September's crisis package that financing and administration of the health service should be shifted from the state to employers by the mid-1990s. That is a sign of what may come elsewhere in the public sector. In Mr Bildt's phrase, Sweden's 'welfare state' will be transformed into a 'welfare market'. Despite the rapidity of the structural changes that are occurring as the country adapts to the needs of EC membership and global competition, older values of solidarity and fairness will not be turned over easily. Continuity remains as important as change in modern Sweden.</p>

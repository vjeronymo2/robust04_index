			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM, in the preamble to the 1983 Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13, concerning the period of bond liability, provides clarification that under 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2), which states that implementation of an alternative postmining land use that is beyond the control of the permittee need not be covered by the bond, the permittee is excused from bonding for third-party actions only insofar as they relate to implementation of approved postmining land uses by the third party (48 FR 32932, 32943, July 19, 1983). In other words, because the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2) is operative only upon implementation of an industrial, commercial, or residential land use, it is improper to release a bond where there is no actual implementation of the approved land use. Therefore, a final bond release decision must be based in part on submission of adequate proof that the industrial, commercial, or residential land use has substantially commenced and is likely to be achieved. If the industrial, commercial, or residential land use was approved as an alternative land use, and the use has not been substantially commenced within 2 years following completion of regrading, bond release decisions must be based upon the permittee's demonstration of compliance with the revegetation success standards for the premining land use according to the full revegetation requirements of 30 CFR 816.116 and 817.116, which include the requirement at 30 CFR 816.116(c) (2) and (3) and 817.116(c) (2) and (3) for a minimum 5- or 10-year liability period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM's decisions in appeals of ten-day letter and notice enforcement actions (under 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(iii)) have been consistent with the above interpretations of the 1979 and 1983 preamble discussions concerning the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2), 816.116(b)(4), and 817.116(b)(4) as they relate to release of bond liability on areas with approved industrial, commercial, or residential land uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Colorado's proposed Rules 3.02.3(2) (a), (b) and (c), which provide for bond release when the permittee successfully demonstrates that it has met the revegetation requirement for lands with an approved postmining land use of industrial, commercial, or residential, is consistent with the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(4) and 817.116(b)(4) as explained in the 1979 preamble to the Federal regulations concerning bond liability. However, Colorado's proposed Rule 3.02.3(2)(c) does not require a demonstration that the land use has substantially commenced and is likely to be achieved prior to release of bond liability, as discussed in the preamble to the 1983 Federal regulations concerning bond liability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Colorado's proposed Rule 3.02.1(7), discussed in finding No. 4.b above, is relevant to the need for the permittee to comply with the full revegetation requirements of 30 CFR 816.116 and 817.116 in the event that approved alternative industrial, commercial, or residential land use has not been substantially commenced within the 2 years following completion of regrading. Colorado's proposed Rule 3.02.1(7) requires that the permittee's performance bond must be sufficient to reclaim the site to a condition capable of supporting the premining land use in the event of bond forfeiture. This proposed rule is consistent with the requirements of the 1983 Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(d) as discussed above, that, if the permittee cannot demonstrate that an approved alternative industrial, commercial, or residential land use has substantially commenced and is likely to be achieved, the permittee must demonstrate compliance with the revegetation success standards for the premining land use according to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116 and 816.117. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

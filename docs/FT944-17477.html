			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taipei down 4.2% on default case Share prices lost ground on small-lot arbitrage selling as public fund managers, which supported prices on Wednesday, held the sidelines, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average shed 96.32 to 19,655.23 after a day's high of 19,748.45 in the morning and a subsequent low of 19,645.43. Volume was 203m shares, against 197m. Most investors were reluctant to build positions ahead of the three-day weekend. The Topix index of all first section stocks closed 5.78 down at 1,576.27 and the Nikkei 300 lost 1.09 at 288.80. Falls led gains by 659 to 328, with 191 issues steady. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved 2.30 to 1,299.90. Lingering doubts over Japan Tobacco also weighed on investor confidence. Although the offer was oversubscribed, successful applicants who won the lottery for shares might let their applications lapse by not paying for their JT stock by the deadline next Tuesday. Some Japanese brokers expect as many as 30 to 40 per cent of the successful applicants to abstain. Any stock which becomes available as a result of lapsed applications will be reallocated to applicants rejected in the first round, and this will be announced next Friday. The second round applicants have until October 19 to pay, and any left-over stock as a result of lapsed second-round applications may be offered into the secondary market by the government on October 27, the listing date. Japan Telecom, regarded as a benchmark of investor confidence in former state-owned companies, slipped Y130,000 to Y4.01m. It rallied on Wednesday on active buying by brokers looking to prop up waning interest in Japan Tobacco. In Osaka the OSE average rose 20.81 to 21,990.09 in volume of 8.7m shares. Roundup Australia and Hong Kong were inclined to wait for today's US jobs data; other markets had more parochial considerations. TAIPEI was sharply lower for a second straight day, losing 4.2 per cent in active trade as the Hualon Group's payment defaults case continued to dominate activity. The weighted index ended 291.27 points down at 6,653.32 in active turnover of TDollars 70.20bn, having fallen 3.3 per cent on Wednesday. At least 15 Taiwanese brokerages, including two units owned by Hualon, were involved in the payment defaults totalling TDollars 2.6bn in the previous three days, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Hualon Corp plunged the daily 7 per cent limit for the second day, shedding TDollars 1.7 to TDollars 22.9. SINGAPORE fell 2.0 per cent, led by losses in blue chips as institutional investors succumbed to concerns on Wall Street. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 47.52 points lower at 2,333.31. Singapore Airline foreign shares dived SDollars 1.30 to SDollars 13.70 on news that it will cut published fares for 33 destinations. SHANGHAI's A share index dropped 6.8 per cent amid persistent, renewed rumours that China's leader Deng Xiaoping was seriously ill. The index gave up 48.81 at 674.56, falling below support at 700, in reduced turnover of Yn2.9bn. The B share index, of shares available to foreigners, dipped 1.02 or 1.3 per cent to 78.63. WELLINGTON continued lower for the third consecutive day, with interest rate worries leaving shares 1.8 per cent down. The NZSE-40 capital index finished 36.86 weaker at 1,998.16. SEOUL followed an early spurt in banking and low price/earnings ratio stocks with broadly based buying, and the composite index moved ahead 12.64 to a new 1994 high of 1,069.93. In banks, Shinhan climbed Won800 to a record Won19,800 and Korea Long-Term went the day's limit up, Won1,000, to Won25,600. JAKARTA's official index ended 7.82 higher at 511.46 after investors bought a range of high-capitalisation stocks. BOMBAY saw sustained buying on expectations of a favourable credit policy being announced on Monday week, the BSE 30-share index advancing 29.44 to 4,379.49.</p>

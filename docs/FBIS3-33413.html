			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Subcommander Marcos has admitted he is the Zapatist  National Liberation Army [EZLN] general commander. Well, at  least this is what Manuel Camacho [the commissioner for peace  and reconciliation in Chiapas] called him. Commander Marcos, or  subcommander if you prefer, who has become a full-fledged  legend, today answered questions posed by domestic and  international reporters during a news conference that lasted  nearly two hours.    Today, Commander Marcos got up early, invited radio  reporters  to come over to the San Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral, and  talked with them from 0700 to 0900. The subcommander said he  would talk about any issue presented by reporters, but he ended  up saying what he wanted. He asserted that the achievement of  democracy in Mexico has to start with the will of the entire  nation and that national issues cannot be agreed upon at the San  Cristobal de las Casas bargaining table. In this way, the  subcommander changed his position from the one he held after the  first peace and reconciliation meeting. At that time, and  contrary to Camacho's position, Marcos stated that  national-level issues would be included in the agenda. It seems  Camacho has won yet another point.</p>

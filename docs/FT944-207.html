			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cariplo bid for Rolo gets green light The Bank of Italy has given the go-ahead for the L3,291bn (Dollars 2bn) bid for Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the Bologna-based commercial bank, launched by a consortium headed by Cariplo, Italy's largest savings bank, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The bid still requires the approval of Consob, the stock exchange watchdog, but this is unlikely to be withheld. The main issue is whether Credito Italiano, the recently-privatised bank that initiated a takeover battle for Rolo, will raise the stakes. Credito has already improved its original offer, but it is still 18 per cent below that of Cariplo.</p>

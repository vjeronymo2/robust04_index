			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FDA BANS CHINESE MUSHROOMS AFTER FOOD POISONINGS;  </P> <P> HEALTH: U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THEY BELIEVE CONTAMINATION "MAY BE WIDESPREAD" IN  THE ASIAN  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that it will indefinitely ban  all shipments of canned mushrooms from China following what the FDA called "a  significant and alarming" series of outbreaks of severe food poisoning.  </P> <P> FDA officials said they believed that contamination with staphylococcal  enterotoxin "may be widespread" throughout the mushroom processing industry in  China, and the ban will continue "until satisfactory sanitation control  measures" are implemented in China.  </P> <P> In 1987 -- the latest figures available -- the United States imported 158  million pounds of mushrooms in containers, 41% of which came from China,  according to the Assn. of Food Industries, a major importer of processed foods.  </P> <P> "If prices were the same as they were in 1987, they've lost $41.5 million in  trade," said Richard Sullivan, a spokesman for the importers' association.  "That's a pretty significant loss in trade dollars for China."  </P> <P> Sullivan estimated that Chinese mushrooms accounted for about 25% of the canned  mushrooms consumed in the United States last year. A statement from the Chinese  Embassy in Washington said that the problem was confined to a few cases, and  that effective corrective measures have already been taken. "This will not  benefit China-U.S. trade," the statement said.  </P> <P> The FDA action represents a major expansion of a ban that began last May with  institutional-size cans following four outbreaks of illness in which about 100  people became sick. No one died, but 16 people were hospitalized.  </P> <P> Since then, the FDA said, inspectors have identified contamination in  additional smaller sizes of cans produced by 10 plants in China. Also, the  agency said, the FDA has reason to believe that two processing plants in China  that have not been approved by the United States may have used the codes of  other, approved plants to try to export their products illegally.  </P> <P> "The results of our investigation give us no reason to have confidence in the  safety of any style or any size can of mushrooms processed in the PRC (People's  Republic of China)," said Ronald G. Chessmore, the FDA's acting associate  commissioner for regulatory affairs, in a letter to Chinese officials here.  </P> <P> Thus far, all of the illnesses have been linked to mushrooms shipped in  68-ounce or No. 10 institutional-size cans. "This is not the size a consumer  would be expected to buy," said Chris Lecos, a spokesman for the FDA. Last  spring, Lecos said, the agency notified all state health and other regulatory  officials responsible for retail food markets, as well as all major trade  associations responsible for the distribution of these products, alerting them  to potential contamination.  </P> <P> Since then, however, the FDA has found toxin in size 5.5 and 16-ounce cans,  which consumers can purchase in retail outlets.  </P> <P> "We cannot rule out the possibility that smaller size cans may have ended up on  the retail food shelf and in someone's home," Lecos said.  </P> <P> However, he said, "any product produced by the PRC, from any one of the  processing plants, would be so identified. It would be very clear that this  product came from the PRC. It has to be labeled. That's one of the  requirements."  </P> <P> Lecos said that products shipped from now on either will remain at the port of  entry or returned to China. Brined mushrooms, which are customarily shipped in  bulk to U.S. plants for canning under a U.S. company's label, will have to be  tested privately by importers before the FDA will allow their release, the  agency said.  </P> <P> Lecos said that "the burden is on the Chinese" to prove their processing plants  are safe and sanitary and the FDA will not allow mushrooms into the United  States until it is satisfied that this has been accomplished.  </P> <P> The FDA said that 62 mushroom processing plants in China are currently  registered with the FDA, as required of both domestic and foreign manufacturers  of low-acid canned foods.  </P> <P> "In all our previous dealings with representatives of the Chinese government we  have not been satisfied with the information we have received," Lecos said. He  said the agency has offered to send an FDA team to China but "it is up to the  Chinese" to allow them to come.  </P> <P> He added: "This is a very serious problem that is widespread. Obviously China  has a lot of work to do."  </P> <P> Symptoms of food poisoning involving staphylococcal toxins can develop rapidly  after eating a contaminated product, and include nausea, vomiting, retching,  abdominal cramping and prostration. In more severe cases, headaches, muscle  cramping and changes in blood pressure and pulse rate can also occur, the FDA  said. In most cases, those stricken recover in two or three days.  </P></p>

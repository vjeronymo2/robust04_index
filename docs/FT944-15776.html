			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Arts: Lighting up the Wigmore - Nash Ensemble The Nash Ensemble, which over the last three decades has established itself as one of Britain's foremost chamber groups, invests so much in its performances that each concert becomes a special occasion. So much so, that Saturday's programme at the Wigmore Hall celebrating its 30th anniversary needed no 'gala' trappings: it was imaginatively put together and no less imaginatively played. The Nash musicians are almost legendary for being great communicators: they play with an obvious sense of enjoyment, balanced by that seriousness of approach that makes them such polished and stimulating performers. They are dedicated to exploring the byways of the repertory  - the group's make-up gives it versatility - with a special commitment to new music. They are equally noted for their interpretations of French music. Indeed, Saturday's programme, the first in a series of six entitled A Golden Age of Parisian Music, was the start of a long birthday celebration. Between now and March, the Nash players will be covering the work of 13 composers from Saint-Saens to Poulenc, and providing audiences with many a rare treat. We heard four composers on Saturday, beginning with Albert Roussel's busy Divertissement for piano and wind quintet. It made a piquant curtain-raiser, a complete contrast to the Ravel Trois Poemes de Stephane Mallarme that followed, with Sarah Walker the consummate soloist. She projected the poet's lines with intensity against the shimmering accompaniment of the two flutes, two clarinets, string quartet and piano. Saint-Saens's Septet drew the audience back a musical generation to a more robust idiom and very different sonorities. It is not top-drawer Saint-Saens - the melodies are unadventurous, often unmemorable - but the Nash's smiling, spirited performance made good its shortcomings. The second half of the evening was devoted to two works by Ernest Chausson: the Chanson perpetuelle, one of his last works, also exists in the version with piano quintet accompaniment performed here. Once again, Sarah Walker floated her mezzo with a perfect balance of ardour and lyricism. A ravishing performance of Chausson's Concerto for violin, piano and string quartet rounded off the evening, with Ian Brown the virtuosic piano soloist, and the violinist Marcia Crayford alert to the work's deeply-felt emotion. This was music-making that brought a reminder of how the Nash Ensemble has enhanced the London music scene, and it whetted the appetite for more.</p>

The resignation of the high-ranking official of the Health  and Social Action Ministry was based on the fact that "he stated  that he had carried out the administrative mission he had been  charged with."    Borgonovo, who had been under secretary under Secretary  General of the Presidency Eduardo Bauza [when he was interior  minister], will once again work with Bauza as an adviser.    Some political sources have interpreted Borgonovo's  resignation as a step toward an upcoming replacement of Health  Minister Alberto Mazza.    Moreover, a high-ranking government source denied this  possibility and stressed that Mazza will continue in his post  and that Borgonovo's leaving was due simply to the fact that "he  had concluded his internal administrative mission."    Fornes is an accountant who for a long time worked within  the  private sector in Mendoza Province, mainly with the Nazar  Construction Enterprise, whose owner is linked to the radicals.    Borgonovo's replacement was named by Mazza and he is  considered to be a man who is close to Bauza's political faction  in Mendoza.</p>

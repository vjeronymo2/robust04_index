The Australian airline company Flight West,  which intended to purchase four planes, now has decided to  purchase two planes and place two firm options to purchase two  more planes. The contract's cost has been estimated at $60  million. The contract was signed by Flight West Chairman Dennis  Buchanan. Flight West has been operating both [EMB-110]  Bandeirante and Brasilia planes for many years.    The EMB-145 is Embraer's most daring project and is still in  its development stage. The EMB-145's initial flight has been  scheduled for April 1995. Budgeted at $300 million, this  project has a potential $1 billion market in the next 15 years.  Each plane is sold for $13 million. Fourteen customers from  eight countries have confirmed 136 purchase orders.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo declines Nervousness crept into Glaxo shares on findings from a US health panel that could be damaging to Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer drug and biggest selling treatment. Zantac works by blocking acid formation and the health panel tentatively concluded that some patients should be treated with antibiotics as well as acid-blocking drugs. The news saw Glaxo shares decline 10 to 662p in spite of the potentially beneficial effect of a stronger dollar and the launch of a big call warrant by BZW on leading pharmaceuticals stocks. Dealers said a US press conference, scheduled to take place after the London market closed, could hit the stock again today. SmithKline Beecham, which also has an ulcer treatment, Tagamet, but also represents part of the BZW warrant, firmed a penny in the 'A's to 418p. Tagamet comes off patent in May and analysts said the potential loss of revenue was already in the share price. Buying ahead of figures today saw BP improve 5 1/2 to 390 1/2 p on one of the heaviest turnovers in the FT-SE 100 Index - 13m shares. The stock ignored the effect of a weaker oil price and responded instead to a stronger US currency and a smattering of pre-results recommendations. The range of forecasts is enormous, with analysts looking for historic net income of between Pounds 670m and Pounds 1bn and replacement cost profits of between Pounds 757m and Pounds 1.1bn. However, Credit Lyonnais Laing was confidently predicting that the share price would hit 500p by the end of the year, while James Capel, Lehman Brothers and NatWest Securities were also continuing to offer support. Aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce moved strongly against a weak market trend as speculation that it is to merge with its US rival Pratt &amp; Whitney returned. The shares gained 8 at 183p in average trade of 4.7m. The talk about a merger between the two groups first surfaced at the end of last year, but then faded. However, one analyst dismissed yesterday's rumours, saying: 'I cannot rule it out, but the rationalisation costs for the two rival engine programmes would be very high indeed.' Consideration of results from Lloyds Abbey Life saw its share price slip 15 to 447p. Analysts said the headline figure of Pounds 323.6m was in line with expectations but the group, which is the insurance arm of Lloyds Bank, had not included any provisions for the mis-selling of pensions. Mr Roger Harvey of Kleinwort Benson reduced his 1994 forecast for Lloyds Abbey by Pounds 23m to Pounds 359m. Lloyds Bank, which reports tomorrow, advanced 7 to 613p. Analysts are looking for profits of up to Pounds 1.05bn, compared with Pounds 801m previously. Leading bank stocks fell sharply in early trading in response to weaker gilts prices. However, most recovered by the close, with two-way business prompting very heavy turnover. Barclays ended 2 lower at 587p on turnover of 13m and NatWest 3 off at 539p, also with 13m traded. In a weak telecoms sector, Cable and Wireless attracted attention as BZW issued a buy recommendation, arguing that the company's investment in Australian telecoms group Optus was now worth an estimated Pounds 500m. The broker reckons that Optus has snatched a 10 per cent share of the Australian long distance market in only its second year of business. Together with its other telecoms operations, BZW calaculates Optus's value at Pounds 2bn. C&amp;W has a 24.5 per cent stake in the venture and could reap further dividends should it be floated, a prospect deemed likely in the medium term. Turnover in C&amp;W hit a busy 7m, but the shares fell after an initial gain, losing 9 at 509p. Holiday operator Owners Abroad was the star performer of an otherwise lacklustre leisure sector as it delivered satisfactory results and an upbeat trading statement. The shares shot forward, closing 20 ahead at 120p on turnover of 6m. Mr Bruce Jones of Smith New Court said the company's claim of a 15 per cent market share demonstrated its renewed competitiveness and there was relief that the results contained no nasty surprises. He added: 'Owners are now on the same rating as Airtours, but if Owners get it right there is more upside potential.' Airtours shares added 2 at 586p. A domestic court case over the issue of tied pubs and a downbeat presentation from Vaux were said to have combined to depress drinks stocks. Vaux slipped 8 to 288p. Kleinwort Benson used the opportunity to reiterate its negative stance on the stock. Wilton Group saw very heavy two-way business after news that the group is to team up with Shaw Media Corporation to launch a Chinese-language satellite channel in Europe. The shares held at 3 3/4 p with 36m traded. Profit forecast upgrades following well-received figures on Tuesday helped Reuters Holdings climb 47 to 2018p. Marks and Spencer, muted in recent sessions on rumours of flagging sales, stabilised and closed 1 1/2 firmer at 427p. Financial software concern Coda Group made a successful market debut, the shares coming to the market at 235p and closing yesterday at 265p. Property stocks were weak, although Hammerson moved forward 3 to 422p on talk of an imminent deal.</p>

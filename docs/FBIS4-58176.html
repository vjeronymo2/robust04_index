			<p>BFN     [Text] Riyadh, April 30 (AFP) -- Yemen's Planning Minister  'Abd- al-Karim al-Iryani arrived here Saturday [30 April] with a  message for King Fahd dealing with the situation in Yemen and a  bilateral border dispute, officials said.    Al-Iryani's visit came amid reports of fresh clashes between  rival northern and southern Yemeni troops in the 'Imran region,  60 kilometers (36 miles) north of Sanaa.    The minister told AFP the message, from President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, was a response to a message Salih received from  the king 10 days ago.    Al-Iryani refused to comment on the conflict between forces  loyal to Salih and those backing the president's southern rival  'Ali Salim al-Bid.    A southern military spokesman in Aden said elite northern  Republican Guards "resumed criminal actions against elements of  the (southern) third armoured brigade."    Ferocious tank battles in the same area Wednesday and  Thursday left nearly 200 dead and dozens of others wounded,  according to journalists.    The Saudi-Yemeni border dispute centres on the provinces of  'Asir, Najran and Jizan, which were handed to Saudi Arabia under  an agreement signed in 1934. Yemen, which claims the provinces,  says the accord expired in 1992.    Saudi-Yemeni relations soured following Iraq's August 1990  invasion of Kuwait, when Yemeni leaders voiced support for Iraqi  President Saddam Husayn.    Al-Iryani said the next round of bilateral talks on the  border problem would be held in Riyadh around May 20.</p>

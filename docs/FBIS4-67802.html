			<p>BFN     [Text] The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, says  supply of F-16 aircraft by the United States to Pakistan cannot  be linked with its peaceful nuclear program. In an interview  with BBC, he said the supply of the aircraft is a commercial  commitment of the American Administration for which Pakistan has  already made payments. As for the American proposals relating  to nuclear nonproliferation presented both to Pakistan and  India, he said multilateral aspect of these proposals is quite  interesting. Pakistan has agreed to move forward with some  amendment in these proposals. He said we need to know about the  American Administration's mind on the issue. The foreign  minister said there is now a definite change in the thinking of  the American Administration which is now prepared to look at  Pakistan's position more reasonably. If this kind of confidence  continues to develop, they would find answers to their problems  without compromising their principles.</p>

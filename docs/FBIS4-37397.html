			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maher Chmaytelli] </F>   [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 21 (AFP) -- Besieging northern  forces showered Aden's suburbs with katyusha rockets in a  night-time bombardment which killed at least two civilians and  wounded 17, hospital officials said Tuesday [21 June].    Several rockets slammed into the Al-Qahirah and al-Mansurah  areas in the north of the city and another six hit nearby  hillsides, said injured civilians at Al-Jumhuriyah hospital.    The northern and southern forces were also trading artillery  fire along the war fronts some 20 kilometres (12 miles) from  Aden, while shells hit the city airport throwing up clouds of  dust and sand.    Hospital officials said almost 90 people have been killed  since northern forces loyal to President 'Ali Abdallah Salih  began a systematic bombardment of this southern bastion on  Thursday.    Terrified townspeople have said they are praying for their  lives, as there are few places in bomb shelters for the city's  500,000 inhabitants.    Southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid broadcast an appeal on  television late Monday for the United Nations, the Arab League  and the rest of the international community to "stop the savage  bombardments on Aden and its vital installations, which have  killed and wounded hundreds".    He also asked Arab and friendly countries to recognise the  breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic (YDR), declared by the south  on May 21 but not yet recognised by any country.    Al-Bid's appeal followed the failure of UN special envoy  Lakhdar Brahimi to broker a ceasefire in the war. Brahimi left  Cairo on Monday after the collapse of talks with northern and  southern delegations there on Sunday.    Al-Bid pleaded for a "total (northern) retreat from the  international frontiers of the YDR and demanded "damages from  the Sanaa regime for destruction caused by its aggression".    He also asked for direct international food and medical aid  for people living in parts of south Yemen occupied by northern  troops.    The southern chief, who is based in the eastern port of  al-Mukalla, also published a decree on Tuesday announcing  compensation for families of the victims.    Relatives of those killed would receive 50,000 riyals while  wounded would be given 25,000. A dollar is officially worth 12  riyals, but trades on the black market at almost 80 riyals.    War broke out between northern and southern forces on May 5  after four years of troubled union between the former North and  South Yemens.</p>

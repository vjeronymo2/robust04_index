			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with V. Zhirinovskiy, leader of the LDPR, by N. </F> Leontyev of PODMOSKOVNYYE IZVESTIYA on 2 February 1994 at LDPR  Headquarters: "`Third Force' En Route to Power"]    [Text] Facts and fables concerning Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  leader of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], are  making the rounds of almost all periodical publications.... What  does this politician, whose party is amassing ever greater  authority in society, represent? The recent elections were  graphic confirmation that a "third force" confidently putting  the squeeze on the communists and the democrats has appeared on  Russia's political horizon. What kind of force is this?    Our correspondent met with V.V. Zhirinovskiy at LDPR  Headquarters and asked him to answer a number of questions.    [Leontyev] Vladimir Volfovich, how do you evaluate the  political situation that has taken shape in the country since  the elections?    [Zhirinovskiy] Things are bad for the people: As a  consequence of revolutions, wars, perestroykas we are becoming  destitute and dying before our time. For us as a political party  this situation is very beneficial because the communists and  Russia's Choice undermined their authority in 1991 and 1993.  They have shown conclusively what they are worth. Voting by  party slate, the electorate gave them 10-20 percent of the vote.  The alignment of forces is in our favor, therefore. We are  content and we believe that we are on the way to power, but we  are not gloating.    [Leontyev] What, in your opinion, is the apportionment of  forces in parliament?    [Zhirinovskiy] It consists of three parts: the forces of the  left--the members of the Agrarian Party, the communists and  those associating with them, and the radical democrats--Russia's  Choice--Yavlinskiy, Shakhray, and others, and ourselves. The  LDPR is a party of a patriotic plane, in the main. The democrats  will be the fewest. The communists could muster more, they have  considerable influence in the country. And ourselves. This is as  yet. But the future elections will make our victory irreversible.    [Leontyev] With which parties and blocs do you intend to  cooperate?    [Zhirinovskiy] With none. We are a third force. Let others  cooperate with us. We will support all sensible decisions, if  they correspond to Russia's interests, from wherever they come.  We do not have party interests or a desire to knock down some  party. If the matter under discussion is right for everyone, it  is immaterial who sponsored it. But we could never form a bloc  with anyone because there are no kindred forces. We are not  communists and not radical democrats.    [Leontyev] The makeup of the government. How do you see it?  Will members of the LDPR be a part of it?    [Zhirinovskiy] This will be decided by the president. He  will  form the government according to the new constitution. We are  for its replacement.... Shumeyko has gone, Poltoranin has gone,  Gaydar has gone. Consequently, there remain of that team  Kozyrev, Chubays.... They must go, and then there will be a  normal government. And the replacement should be people from the  factions which obtained the majority. The LDPR could hold four  positions, say. This would be a good version of a coalition  government.    [Leontyev] Your first steps in the State Duma?    [Zhirinovskiy] We have prepared a draft decree on a general  political and economic amnesty in respect to all events and  cases as of 15 April 1985 in order to close "perestroyka." None  of the persons who were accused of political or economic crimes  were guilty. Everything is now clear. We need to release  everyone from prison and terminate the proceedings in the courts  and investigating authorities.    [Leontyev] A few international questions: Russia has as of  late abruptly changed its priorities and directions in its  foreign policy in the Near East. Is this to Russia's advantage?    [Zhirinovskiy] In the sense of having turned its back on the  Arabs? This is bad. This undermines our authority, military  potential, and the economy. Here within everything is falling  apart, and we are pulling apart foreign policy.    [Leontyev] You said that in the future you would cooperate  with Iraq. Would this not cause a rupture with other countries?    [Zhirinovskiy] No. We should have normal relations with the  whole world. But there are priorities. Iraq owes us $10 billion.  It would make sense for us to take this into consideration when  we make a decision on the question of the blockade of Iraq. This  would be to our advantage. Iraq is our strategic ally on the  southern flank.    [Leontyev] You write in your book that the war in the Near  East is not over and that it could ultimately become the cause  of World War III. How do you evaluate the process of a peace  settlement currently under way there?    [Zhirinovskiy] Let them attempt to negotiate. God grant that  everyone negotiate an end to conflicts. But this will not end  because Israel, as a state, has not for 1,000 years been part of  this region, where 100 million Arabs live and where there are  many contemporary problems. There will be enmity, of course....  Unfortunately. Thank God, the war in Vietnam ended, and,  perhaps, Korea will one day unite. Germany has united. But the  Near East knot is the most complex. There is here the  geopolitical factor, and the national and religious and economic  factors play a part. It is the center of the Earth. For this  reason this conflict will be more protracted, unfortunately.    [Leontyev] Could the Near East subsequently become the scene  of a clash of Russian and American geopolitical interests, in  your opinion?    [Zhirinovskiy] This need not happen. We have enough of our  own oil and gas. Let the Americans and Japanese purchase it in  tranquillity there. There is no point us sticking our noses in  there. Our interests will be confined to Turkey, Iran,  Afghanistan, which lack the oil and gas the West would like to  obtain. The borders of the Arab world are the borders of our  economic interests. And Iran and Syria, if they gravitate toward  us in a geopolitical sense, this would be to our advantage.    [Leontyev] You write in your book that it would be to the  benefit of the majority of mankind were the Muslim world to be  anatomized, that we need to exclude the Muslim danger. Would  this not lead to clashes in interethnic soil?    [Zhirinovskiy] They are occurring now. They need to be  averted. Unless there are cohesive Christian and Muslim worlds  (there is a Christian world also in Latin America and Australia,  the Muslim world is concentrated in North Africa, Asia Minor,  and Central Asia), there will be no peace. This concentration  needs to be cut through, then there will be no possibilities of  the concentrated offensives of extremist forces, of  pan-Islamism. As formerly the Crusades subjugated people by the  sword and blood, converting them to the Christian faith.    [Leontyev] Let us return, however, to our problems: Is a  repetition of the opposition of the legislature and the  executive possible, in your opinion?    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, on the part of Russia's Choice. No one  would any longer be in opposition. Russia's Choice would very  much like this Duma to be broken up also. This is a group of  adventurers that has no future, and for this reason they would  like in the final phase of the conflict to dash out of the  country or to ensure their security by way of the establishment  of dictatorship. They have two options: either leaving the  country or dictatorship, normal work would threaten them with  having to leave the government, then a new procuracy and a new  government would institute criminal proceedings against them.  Fear in the face of their liability would push them toward  confrontation. But they are the minority, and we hope,  therefore, that this will not happen.    [Leontyev] And the final question, perhaps it is the first  also: What, in your opinion, was the reason for the failure of  Russia's Choice?    [Zhirinovskiy] It is not a party. A purely technical  failure.  A party wins. But if on the eve of elections you form some team  and give it a stupid name--Russia's Choice.... What does this  mean? What is its political orientation? It is not known....  And, second: Those who are to blame for all our troubles were  assembled there.... They should have gone into hiding, left, put  up neutral persons, but they are all there in a bunch: Burbulis,  Gaydar, Yakunin.... They all assembled in this crowd, which has  bungled so much.... They do not understand tactics: They should  have left for other structures, moved into the background, and  made Russia's Choice neutral--some new organization--they might,  perhaps, have fooled some people, but they could not get their  bearings even here, and they all barged their way through....  And they are still abusing one another in the Kremlin over  ministerial portfolios and physically coming to blows. They are  not simply insulting and criticizing, a showdown is under way,  as among street toughs. That is your grouping. This why they  lost.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Anis Yahya, "speaker of the </F> parliament of the Democratic Republic of Yemen" by 'Adil  al-Jawjari in Cairo; date not given]    [Text] Anis Yahya, speaker of the parliament in the  "Democratic Republic of Yemen" has accused Iran, Iraq, and Sudan  of providing military assistance to the northern Yemeni forces.    In an exclusive interview with AL-BILAD, Yahya said Iran had  recently concluded a deal with Sanaa to provide it with Sukhoi  planes. The planes arrived aboard a Yemeni-flagged commercial  ship, which unloaded its shipment in the port of al-Hudaydah.    Yahya also said Sanaa was receiving Sudanese air assistance.  He noted that Iraqi military experts are doing their bit in  overseeing battles from an operations room that was created in  the southern region of Abyan, under the control of northern  forces.    Anis Yahya denied reports about Saudi and Kuwaiti military  support for the southern forces, saying: What has been rumored  about a Saudi military buildup on the southern Yemeni border  represents northern allegations and fabrications. He said the  weapons that arrived during the battles to southern Yemen from  Asian and east European nations are part of a previous program  to arm the southern army.    On the Sudanese and Iraqi prisoners which Aden said it had  captured during the battles with the northern forces, the  speaker of the southern parliament said: We are keeping them in  a safe place, and we will show them at the right time to the  international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi or any other envoy from the  Arab League or the Islamic Conference Organization. He said the  southern forces have seven non-Yemeni officer and soldier  prisoners, five of them Iraqis, one Eritrean, and one Sudanese.  He said the prisoners made full confessions about the presence  of Iraqi forces and Sudanese and Eritrean volunteers with the  northern forces.    On the course of battles in Yemen and the possibility of the  northern forces breaking into Aden, Yahya said: There are  50,000 southern fighters, supported by 30,000 tribal fighters to  defend Aden by all means. There will be massacres if the  northern troops enter Aden. He noted that more than 3,000  people have been either killed or injured in Aden alone since  the battles erupted.    Anis Yahya visited Cairo heading a southern parliamentary  delegation that includes four deputies as part of an Arab and  international tour. A rumor spread within the circles of  Yemenis living in Cairo that the speaker of the southern  parliament fled to Cairo after the northern leadership had  sanctioned his killing, along with 13 others of the leaders of  the Yemeni Socialist Party. Yahya replied to the rumors by  saying: It is a northern rumor launched by the supporters of  the northern General People's Congress who live in Cairo. I  arrived in Cairo alone. My children are still living in the  south. We are on a mission to expose the reasons that prompt  Sanaa to continue the fighting.    [Al-Jawjari] In your opinion, what are the reasons?    [Yahya] Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the  "northern" parliament, the ally of President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, wants to control the oil sources and refineries in the  south to establish a state that will dominate the southern part  of the Arabian Peninsula, and that will enter into an alliance  with Sudan and Iraq to form an axis that threatens the security  of the Gulf countries and Egypt.    [Al-Jawjari] If such a plan is real and not the figment of  imagination, then when did you discover it?    [Yahya] Iraq was the first country to support unity. It gave  united Yemen financial and material assistance. We used to  believe that they were doing this because of their Ba'thist  ideology. But, we found out that Presidents Saddam and Salih  had made a deal under which Saddam would support Yemeni unity  and Salih the Iraqi entry into Kuwait. This is what took place.    [Al-Jawjari] This means that the present conflict in Yemen  is  one of the chapters of the Gulf crisis?    [Yahya] Yes. We are now reaping the fruits of the policy of  hegemony and imposition of influence under the pretext of unity.    [Al-Jawjari] But many in the Arab homeland do not believe  that such a plan exists?    [Yahya] And who thought Iraq would enter Kuwait? We are  living in an era where secret schemes suddenly materialize.    [Al-Jawjari] President Salih says that the YSP leaders are  the ones who violate the cease-fire decisions?    [Al-Jawjari] Our reply is simply to refer to facts.  President Salih exploited the cease-fire to bring in  reinforcements to the battlefronts from the tribes and the  Presidential Guard totalling some 100,000 troops over the past  weeks. The northern forces received weapons and spare parts  from Iran, Iraq, and Sudan to upgrade the effiency of the war  machine on all fronts. From our side, we are eager to cease  fire to reoperate the water and power plants in Aden which faces  an environmental disaster.    [Al-Jawjari] There are reports that a vessel from Pakistan  has recently unloaded its cargo in the southern Al-Mukalla Port.  The cargo comprises 40 Russian tanks and 100 missiles. The  question is from where have these come and who paid for them?    [Yahya] I was in Cairo when this report was published. I can  neither confirm nor deny it. However, what I can say is that  there are arms deals we have contracted a while ago. As you  know, weapons are not delivered on the day the contract is  signed, but later. Thus, I can affirm that no one finances arms  deals for the south.    [Al-Jawjari] President Salih invited you five times to hold  a dialogue. Why did you turn down the invitations?    [Yahya] Because there were conditions attached. Sanaa  proposed certain names, and the nature of the topics to be  discussed was still a subject of dispute.    [Al-Jawjari] Will you please give us some details?    [Yahya] Sanaa rejects the participation of 13 members of the  YSP Political Bureau, including 'Ali Salim al-Bid, al-'Attas,  the defense minister, myself, and others, in the dialogue. This  is an unacceptable condition. Sanaa also set a condition that  the dialogue be held within the framework of unity and the  so-called constitutional legitimacy. This is rejected too  because we represent an independent state and we are not part of  the Republic of Yemen.    [Al-Jawjari] Your decision to secede was not supported by  any  state.    [Yahya] This is a question of time, and most probably 12  Arab  and non-Arab countries will support a decision to establish the  Democratic Republic of Yemen when circumstances are appropriate.    [Al-Jawjari] Including the United States?    [Yahya] No comment.    [Al-Jawjari] And including the Gulf states, except Qatar?    [Yahya] No comment.    [Al-Jawjari] But Egypt voices its support for unity on  condition that it is not imposed by force.    [Yahya] We, in the south, respect the role and the position  of the Egyptian leadership.    [Al-Jawjari] Jordan also supports unity and calls for a  cease- fire.    [Yahya] His Majesty King Husayn exerted extraordinary effort  to prevent the conflict and infighting but the president and his  allies have foiled Jordan's reconciliatory initiative.  Jordanian military experts, who took part in the military  committee, also say that it is the northern leaders who have  aborted attempts to solve the problem.    [Al-Jawjari] You too aborted these efforts by insisting on  the withdrawal of the northern forces from the south and the  withdrawal of the southern forces from the north. This meant  division.    [Yahya] We knew the dimensions of a plot to relocate certain  units, which were outside the agreement and which could easily  be struck if war erupted. This is what exactly happened when  the 5th Infantry Brigade and the 3rd Brigade in 'Imran were  destroyed and when the Ba Suhayb Brigade was besieged, after  which war erupted.    [Al-Jawjari] What is the solution?    [Yahya] Cease-fire, disengagement of forces, and recognition  of the independent southern state.    [Al-Jawjari] Sanaa's support for the secession seems to be  impossible.    [Yahya] The continuation of unity in the previous way is  also  impossible.</p>

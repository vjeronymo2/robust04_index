			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / DTI accused of 'going soft' over policy on competition Senior officials at the Office of Fair Trading, the competition watchdog, are increasingly concerned that Mr Michael Heseltine's Department of Trade and Industry is softening its stance on competition policy. The growing frustration among senior competition policy officials is reflected at Westminster, where several influential backbenchers are setting up a lobby group, The Competitive Forum, to press for a tougher consumer-oriented competition policy. The advocates of a stricter policy believe the DTI and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission have relaxed policy to help create strong UK champions capable of competing in global markets, an approach advocated by Mr Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. The approach has been taken up by Mr Graeme Odgers, the former businessman appointed MMC chairman a year ago, say the critics. They argue that the MMC is operating a competition policy tailored to the needs of business rather than the consumer. Further evidence of the lower priority the DTI is giving to competition policy is the sharp fall in the number of cases referred to the MMC, say consumer groups and competition lawyers. Of the 112 mergers examined by the OFT since May last year, only three were referred to the MMC by Mr Heseltine. He was expected to underline the policy shift in his long-awaited competitiveness white paper originally due out today. It has been postponed until next week, out of respect for Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who died last Thursday. Concerns that the MMC has gone soft on abuses of market power, which surfaced after the 1992 report on the supply of new cars, have been rekindled by recent reports on leading perfumes and ice cream, which left market positions intact. Competition officials' fears that the MMC is increasingly putting the interests of industry ahead of those of the consumer, are likely to be reinforced next month, when the MMC report on the price of compact discs is expected to clear the record industry of price-fixing. Mr Stephen Locke, the Consumers' Association director of policy, says the MMC's recent reports mean 'the UK is now regarded as being a soft touch when it comes to abuses of market power and anti-competitive agreements'. Mr John Watts, Conservative MP for Slough and chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, is launching The Competitive Forum. Mr Odgers denies that the MMC has become soft on competition. But he does admit he is 'four-square' with Mr Heseltine's views on privatisation, competitiveness and deregulation. Editorial Comment, Page 15 Hanson raises investment pay-back time, Page 17</p>

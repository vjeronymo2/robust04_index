			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Alhaji Koromah, the Mandingo leader of the ULIMO  [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction in  Liberia, has responded fiercely to allegations made on this  program yesterday by his Krahn rival, Roosevelt Johnson.  Johnson claimed to have driven Koromah's supporters out of  their stronghold at Tubmanburg. It is the latest chapter in the  squabble between the two men which held up the formation of the  Liberian Transitional Council. Johnson and the NPFL [National  Patriotic Front of Liberia] leader, Charles Taylor, have been  accused of joining forces in order to oust Alhaji Koromah. Both  have denied the accusation and Roosevelt Johnson even claims  that members of his family have been killed. Last night, Alhaji  Koromah, who is visiting Guinea, responded with a completely  different version of events. From Conakry, Foday Fofona,  telexed this report. [read by announcer]    Alhaji Koromah vigorously denied claims by Roosevelt Johnson  that forces loyal to him captured Tubmanburg, headquarters of  ULIMO, over the weekend. Speaking at his home in Conakry last  night, Koromah told me that he was thoroughly embarrassed that  Roosevelt Johnson was using ULIMO fighters to kill each other.  Koromah said that Roosevelt Johnson had been amassing arms and  ammunition for some time and had moved his wife and children  from Tubmanburg to Monrovia for safety. He said: It is a big  lie that his mother had been killed. As of yesterday afternoon,  his mother was very much alive in a town called Lofa Bridge.  Visibly worried, Koromah told me: It is unfortunate that  Johnson has become an agent of Charles Taylor and tried to use  the Krahn tribe as a cover for his connections with the NPFL.</p>

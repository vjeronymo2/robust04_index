			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ferrochrome producers try to repair damage SOUTH AFRICAN ferrochrome producers, who between them account for about 45 per cent of world production, have announced plans to slash output to little more than 10 per cent of capacity in response to continuing weakness in demand from the stainless steel industry, which consumes 80 per cent of ferrochrome production. Although the industry's predicament is in large measure a function of sluggish growth in the world economy, there is also an element of self-inflicted damage. The 6 per cent rise in the ferrochrome price to 52 cents a lb that South African producers insisted upon last December has met with fierce resistance from customers who have turned to alternative sources of supply for their metal. Samancor of South Africa, the world's largest producer, with capacity of about 1m tonnes per annum, announced on Friday that it would be ceasing ferrochrome production as of February 20 for at least three months. Consolidated Metallurgical Industries, the second largest producer, said last week that it was operating at only 60 per cent of its 330,000 tonnes-a-year capacity while Chromecorp Technology, South Africa's third biggest producer, announced last month it was shutting down its 180,000 tonne a year furnaces for two to three months. Mr Allan Kuhnert, marketing director of CMI, said last week that the combination of a price rise with weakening demand had had 'a fairly devastating effect on our ability to sell'. This view, however, is not shared by Mr Hans Smith, managing director of Samancor. 'There are just not volumes to be had out there,' he comments, denying that the price rise caused the weakening in demand. He notes that ferrochrome could be purchased a month ago for Dollars 670 a tonne, or 37 cents a lb, in the scrap market and says that stainless steel companies were obviously going to go this route rather than pay 52 cents for South African metal. With the price in the scrap market now having risen to more than Dollars 900 a tonne, however, he believes the supply of scrap has largely gone. Samancor is now operating at about 75 per cent of capacity. A three-month closure is thus likely to result in about 200,000 tonnes of production being lost. Despite the closures, Mr Smith says, Samancor will have no problem in meeting all its contractual commitments. Indeed, he forecasts that the company will still have two and a half months stocks left at the end of the financial year in June. Mr Smith says Samancor's stock-rich position is the result of last September's merger with Middelburg Steel and Alloys, then the world's second largest producer, which brought together considerable stockpiles. He notes that the group also took advantage of cheap power rates in December to run its furnaces at full capacity. Samancor's decision to cease production for three months was cash-flow driven, Mr Smith says. He admits that he is 'not too happy' with net cash levels down to R100m (Pounds 19.5m) from R392m a year previously and believes ceasing production will help generate cash to restore funds. He concedes that the company is surrendering profits in favour of cash-flow. Although the outlook for producers remains poor until there is an upturn in world economic growth, CMI maintains that its regular customers are already returning to them and 'by the second quarter they will be back into the South African fold'.</p>

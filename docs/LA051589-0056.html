			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFIANT SOVIET VOTERS GO TO POLLS AGAIN;  </P> <P> UP TO 34 CANDIDATES FILE FOR SINGLE SEAT AS CHOICE IS WIDENED  </P> <P> Some of the country's most defiant voters, who previously protested a lack of  choice by resolutely crossing their candidates' names off the ballot, headed to  the polls Sunday for another round of elections with a fresh set of nominees.  </P> <P> A number of seats were expected to remain unfilled, however, even after  Sunday's runoff balloting. This is because in many cases no single candidate is  likely to win a majority due to the large number of nominees -- an average of  six per seat, with as many as 34 running in a single district.  </P> <P> In districts where no candidate wins a majority, another runoff election will  be held between the two candidates winning the largest number of votes, the  news agency Tass said.  </P> <P> But it was not clear whether such a vote could be held before the new  Parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies, convenes for its first session  May 25. The Congress may have to meet without all of its 2,250 seats filled.  </P> <P> The Congress, the center of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts at political reform,  is expected to give Gorbachev its approval as president and, more importantly,  elect a new, more active 542-member Supreme Soviet.  </P> <P> Results for most seats in Sunday's tallying are expected today or Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stormy Sessions  </P> <P> The lengthy election procedure began with sometimes stormy nominating sessions  in the winter, followed by campaigning and initial balloting in March, when  most voters had a choice for the first time in their lives.  </P> <P> The often chaotic process "clearly shows there is some confusion, and they are  trying to figure this out as they go," one senior Western diplomat commented.  </P> <P> "But the number of elections and runoff elections is not as important as what  happens next -- how much power the Congress of People's Deputies is really  given," the diplomat added.  </P> <P> Among the candidates already elected to the Congress are a handful of prominent  reformers including human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, who was once  exiled to the Soviet city of Gorky for his views and permitted by Gorbachev to  return to Moscow, and maverick former Moscow party boss Boris N. Yeltsin, who  was forced off the Politburo after criticizing the slow pace of reform.  </P> <P> Most of the districts where candidates were running Sunday previously had only  one person on the ballot -- often the leading local Communist Party official.  Nevertheless, unopposed candidates were rejected when either more than half the  voters crossed the candidates' name off the ballot or, in a few cases, less  than 50% of the eligible voters went to the polls.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 34 for Leningrad Seat  </P> <P> This time, in an effort to give the voters a choice, officials permitted 1,216  candidates to run for 198 seats. As many as 34 candidates were running for a  single seat in Leningrad and 33 in Kiev.  </P> <P> The Communist Party daily Pravda, in a front-page editorial, said campaigning  was often more heated than for the earlier balloting, particularly in  Leningrad, where a dozen party bosses were roundly defeated in March. It  criticized the nominating process as confusing and suggested it be reformed.  </P> <P> Among those defeated in the March balloting in the Soviet Union's  second-largest city was Yuri F. Solovyev, Leningrad party chief and a member of  the Politburo, who was running uncontested. Party bosses were also defeated in  Kiev and Armenia.  </P> <P> The defeats, especially those in districts where only the party leader was  running, were an embarrassing blow to the Communist Party. Gorbachev said they  showed that the people support greater democracy but are frustrated by local  officials who are slow to enact reforms.  </P> <P> This time, virtually everyone who wanted to run was allowed a place on the  ballot -- not just in Leningrad but across the nation.  </P> <P> Of those on the ballot Sunday, Tass reported, 85% were Communist Party members  and 91% were men.  </P> <P> Among those running was Vitaly A. Korotich, reformist editor of Ogonyok  magazine, whose name was put in nomination in the Ukrainian city of Kharkov. He  previously was denied a spot on the ballot for a Moscow district.  </P> <P> Other candidates included special prosecutor Nikolai Ivanov, an anti-corruption  crusader, who sought a seat in Leningrad, and Olympic weightlifting champion  Yuri Vlasov, who was running in Moscow.  </P> <P> Ivanov is under fire by the official Soviet media for, in a campaign statement  Friday, saying top Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev had ordered a halt to an  investigation into high-level corruption. In his two-minute television  statement, he did not elaborate.  </P></p>

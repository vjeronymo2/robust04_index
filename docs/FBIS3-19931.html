The six-person sub-committee on foreign affairs of South  Africa's Transitional Executive Council (TEC) spent three days  here discussing their country's post-apartheid relations with  the EU.    "We sensed a very warm spirit of welcome. The EU is willing  to do business with us," committee member Stella Sigcau said.    Heading the agenda in meetings with EU officials was South  Africa's request for a preferential relationship with the  community following its first all-race elections next month.    The EU is to negotiate a comprehensive system of political,  trade and economic links with South Africa after the elections,  to replace the frosty relations of the apartheid decades.    The South African authorities, including the African  National  Congress, the election's likely winners, have been pressing for  a special relationship in order to speed up the repair of the  post-apartheid economy.    But EU officials want to place the Union's links with South  Africa in a wider regional context which includes neighbouring  African countries, so that the benefits of development aid can  be more widely spread.    A spokesman for EU Development Commissioner Manuel Marin  said  it was up to South Africa to decide whether and how it wanted to  join regional groupings.    These include the Southern African Development Community,  originally formed to counter the economic muscle of apartheid  South Africa, and the 69-nation African-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP)  group linked to the EU through the Lome trade-and-aid convention.    "But we believe that whatever the final decision, it will  still be important to stimulate regional development," he said.    South African Manpower Minister Leon Wessels, a member of  the  delegation, said: "There has been a greater convergence of  ideas. We feel ourselves closer to the heartbeat of southern  African."    South African Ambassador to the EU Neil van Heerden spoke of  an "emerging consensus" about EU-South African relations, and  said he was confident that agreement could be reached "on a fast  track" after next month's elections.</p>

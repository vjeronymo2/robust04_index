			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HUNGARY;  </P> <P> REFERENDUM OKD ON PRESIDENTIAL POST  </P> <P> Hungary's Parliament voted to hold a national referendum on when and how to  elect someone to fill the new post of president. The lawmakers voted to hold  the referendum Nov. 26, the date that had tentatively been chosen for a popular  vote to select a president under an agreement signed by the ruling Socialist  Party and most of the major opposition groups. Two opposition groups had  opposed that agreement, however, and collected more than 200,000 signatures  calling for a referendum on the method and timing of such elections. The groups  want the president chosen by Parliament after the general elections, which are  to be held by next June. If Hungarians vote in favor of electing a president  before the parliamentary elections, the presidential balloting would be  conducted Jan. 7.  </P></p>

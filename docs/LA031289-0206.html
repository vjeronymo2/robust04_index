			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: A STRATEGY FOR PEACE HUMAN VALUES AND THE THREAT OF WAR BY  SISSELA BOK (PANTHEON: $17.95; 196 PP.)  </P> <P> Sissela Bok, a professor of philosophy at Brandeis University, goes out of her  way in these pages to make hers a practical strategy, acknowledging key  arguments likely to be raised by cynics, pragmatists and hawks and steering  clear of fuzzy-headed liberalism, from old calls for unilateral disarmament to  New Age heralds of world unity under Gaia. "Nuclear weapons cannot be  disinvented," Bok writes. "The reasons for mutual fear and distrust are real  enough and powerful enough to keep nations from reducing the threat decisively,  let alone wiping it out entirely."  </P> <P> Pacifists are likely to criticize this initial argument for being circular --  the surfeit of weapons makes it too dangerous to eliminate weapons -- but Bok  is by no means justifying proliferation. She argues, rather, that before we can  begin to eliminate arms, we must find ways of diminishing dangerous forms of  distrust between nations. We can begin, she suggests, by distinguishing more  carefully between "rational distrust" -- a healthy attitude leading to mutually  beneficial agreements, such as those for on-site inspection -- and "irrational  distrust," a pathological form of behavior that only "intensifies distrust on  the part of one's adversary." "It will be necessary," Bok writes, "to reexamine  . . . the world-spanning smog of disinformation, the surreptitious and overt  moves to cheat on international treaties, human rights violations, the support  of regional wars, and the encouragement of terrorism."  </P> <P> Bok's strategy is often less than practical, castigating ignoble behavior  rather than examining the social, political and economic tensions that  encourage it. She reaffirms lofty principles, such as the Golden Rule, while  criticizing "primitive societies" for "wounding and killing outsiders" out of  "indifference" and "pride." But she doesn't suggest how we can reduce the sense  of cultural instability many nations feel when they are exposed to the  relativism of an increasingly interdependent world. Nor does she explore  practical ways to reduce the threat perceived by Third World nations, who see  themselves in an economic free-fall behind the First World.  </P> <P> "A Strategy for Peace" is successful, however, as a warning about the dangerous  "inertia" of despair and complacency. While pragmatic, it is far from an  apologia for current nuclear strategy. By pointing out the wildly irresponsible  thinking of John F. Kennedy's advisers during the Cuban Missile Crisis, for  instance, Bok makes it clear that government leaders alone cannot be trusted to  ensure nuclear peace. If any one of six of these advisers had been President  during the crisis, Robert Kennedy told an interviewer, "I think the world would  have blown up."  </P></p>

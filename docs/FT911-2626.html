			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / ECU Bonds: Offshore freedoms bring responsibility DURING the first quarter of the year the Ecu international bond sector completed its transformation from a niche area into a flourishing offshore government bond market. However, offshore freedom also brings responsibilities, a point made last week by the European Commission. The Commission is concerned that unregulated supply of Ecu bond issues by governments could lead to a glut of paper on the market. The Ecu8.75bn of bonds launched in the first two weeks of February had a debilitating effect. Spain's Ecu1bn issue last week was the first substantial deal in the sector in nearly two months. The Commission itself was the last big borrower to tap the market, raising Ecu1bn to finance a loan to Greece. The Commission's concern may partly stem from the fact that its two Ecu500m deals launched on February 26 were poorly received in a market awash with unplaced paper. However, as any watcher of the gilts market will testify, the threat of oversupply is not a unique problem. Despite its sometimes unruly nature, the Ecu bond market has turned in a creditable performance over the past year. At the end of 1989, 10-year Ecu bonds offered a yield spread of 180 basis points over comparable German government bonds. By the end of 1990, the yield spread had fallen to 126 basis points and had narrowed to about 70 basis points. Indeed, the price performance of Ecu bonds has confounded theoretical models which calculate the 'correct' price of Ecu bonds from the performance of the underlying national bond markets. At the start of this year benchmark 10-year Ecu bonds, such as the French government's 10 per cent Ecu-denominated OAT maturing 2001, were yielding 40 basis points less than theories suggested, moving to more than 70 basis points by mid-February. But since then Ecu bonds have generally underperformed the underlying national bond markets - in part due to the volume of new issues. Future advances may depend on the pace of progress towards European monetary union. For example, if German proposals for a 'hardened' single European currency were accepted, the basket Ecu would no longer be vulnerable to devaluation against the strongest currency in the exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark. 'As a result, yields on Ecu bonds would collapse to about the level of the lowest running yield in the system, which is currently that on bunds, rather than moving in line with a weighted average of European bond yields,' said Mr Gavyn Davies and Mr Jeremy Hale of Goldman Sachs in a recent research paper. 'In other words, the spread between Ecu bonds and bunds would be entirely eliminated.'</p>

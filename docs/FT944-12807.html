			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Arts: A night off for the intellect - Opera / Romeo et Juliette Writing in this paper the week before last, the Director of the Royal Opera put up a spirited defence of the company's new Ring cycle. Among his arguments was the need for variety in a healthy opera company, the immediate instance at Covent Garden being the juxtaposition of that Ring with an imminent new production of Romeo et Juliette. The Gounod has now arrived. And different it certainly is. Whereas the Ring set minds whirling on a wild roundabout of ideas, rousing its audiences to cheers of enthusiasm and outraged booing, this miserably unimaginative production of a far from probing opera gives the thinking opera-goer's intellect the night off. To spend time and money on this Romeo et Juliette one needs a good reason and the Royal Opera - fortunately - musters two. They are a Romeo and a Juliet who look as if they were born to play their roles. A wicked photo in the programme reminds us of how things used to be, capturing Gounod's original Juliet, Marie Caroline Carvalho, looking portly and frumpish, 'posing a problem for the corset manufacturers' as the caption naughtily describes her. At a time when even politicians are expected to have telegenic appeal, that is clearly no longer good enough. Today's Romeo is the young and personable Roberto Alagna, who made such a fine impression in La Boheme two years ago. For a tenor born in France of Sicilian parents, this opera, combining a passionate Italian love story with music of Gallic elegance, would seem to be the ideal choice. Alagna declares his challenge to Tybalt with steel in the voice, and wraps his farewell to Juliet softly in whispers. Forceful but tender, his Romeo is a vivid personality vocally, even if his acting is vague. At the balcony window he is answered by the touchingly fragile, dark-eyed Juliet of Leontina Vaduva. As we know from her previous appearances at Covent Garden, Vaduva is a singer who paces herself carefully. This means that the early scenes are tentatively sung, the famous Waltz Song, beloved by Melba, barely getting into its stride. But taking Friar Laurence's potion stimulates her to give more from there to the end - a stylish performance, if less securely in her voice than the recent Manon. It is fortunate that they make the balcony scene so believable, as neither Gounod nor the production does much to help. Turning Shakespeare into opera is work for a genius, as the only two indisputable successes (both of them by Verdi) show. It is almost painful to think back to the poetry that Shakespeare puts into Romeo's mouth as he gazes up at Juliet and then compare that to Gounod's prosaic music, which turns a literary marvel into workaday crotchets and quavers. Interviewed on television last week about his new opera at Glyndebourne, Harrison Birtwistle said he did not believe in just setting a story to music. In Romeo et Juliette, Gounod offers some memorable numbers - the two well-known arias and the Act 4 sunrise duet - but they are purple passages in an opera which takes simply telling the story as its highest objective. All of Shakespeare's main characters are here. Sarah Walker manages to suggest something of the Nurse's fussiness, though Gounod leaves little of her character intact. Despite having to wear a tonsure that looks like a tea cosy, Robert Lloyd has the quietly-spoken authority for Friar Laurence. Anna Maria Panzarella makes a bright interlude of her little scene as Stephano. Francois le Roux's Mercutio, elegant and dynamic, is in his vocal prime and Paul Charles Clarke makes a fearsome Tybalt. The fight scenes have splendid dash under Charles Mackerras, who remains as vivid an opera conductor in all repertoire as ever. As for the production, what can one say? When English National Opera put on Romeo et Juliette they cannibalised an old set for Britten's Queen Elizabeth I opera, Gloriana (right for Shakespeare, if not 14th-century Verona). But even that looked better than what the Royal Opera has acquired here. A few building blocks, miserably lit, have to serve as monastery, palace and piazza. Whichever way one looks at them - as colour, as shape, as acting spaces - they are devoid of imagination and atmosphere. This non-production, by producer Nicolas Joel and designer Carlo Tommasi, originated in Toulouse. At a time when the UK still has a trade deficit with France, it was hardly a sensible import. Production sponsored by Goldman Sachs. Performance continue until November 17</p>

The proposed exemption will permit the temporary removal of a steel missile door which provides missile protection for the No. 21 EDG, which will be out-of-service to allow for modifications which will increase its load capacity, and also provides missile protection to portions of the support systems for EDGs Nos. 11 and 12. EDGs Nos. 11 and 12 are required to be operable to support the operation of Unit 1 (Modes 1, 2, or 3). In addition, EDG No. 12 is a swing EDG and is required to be operable for Unit 2 when the unit is shutdown or in refueling (Mode 5 or 6). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The upgrading of the Unit 2 EDG will be performed during the upcoming Unit 2 refueling outage (RFO&hyph;10). RFO&hyph;10 is scheduled to commence on March 17, 1995, and be completed in late May 1995. The steel missile door will be required to be removed about four times during the outage. The licensee estimates that each of the removals will last for about 24 hours, which will result in a total removal time of about 100 hours during the scheduled 65 day RFO&hyph;10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed temporary exemption is needed to permit the completion of highly desirable upgrade to the Unit 2 EDG No. 21 without requiring a dual unit shutdown. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed exemption does not involve any measurable environmental impact during normal operation of Unit 1 or the shutdown/refueling of Unit 2 since the plant configuration is changed only minimally for short periods of time when the missile door will be removed and overall plant operation is not changed. The likelihood of tornado-generated or other high wind-generated missile damage during the time the exemption would be in effect and which could affect equipment required to be operable to avoid radiological impact is low. Also, the licensee indicates that the missile door will be reinstalled whenever severe weather conditions arise. Thus, the proposed temporary exemption would not significantly affect the probability or consequences of potential reactor accidents and would not otherwise affect radiological plant effluents. Consequently, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological impacts associated with the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption involves features located entirely within the owner-controlled area defined in 10 CFR Part 20. The EDG upgrade project activities do not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the staff concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal alternative to requesting the temporary exemption for implementation of the EDG upgrade would be to comply with the restrictive requirements of GDC&hyph;2. However, this alternative would not significantly enhance the protection of the environment, and would result in a significant loss of power generation since a dual outage would be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternate Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the April 1973 Final Environmental Statements for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff consulted the State of Maryland, Department of Natural Resources, regarding the environmental impact of this proposed action. The State of Maryland had no comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment and has determined, therefore, not to prepare and environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application dated August 4, 1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at Calvert County Library, Prince Frederick, Maryland 20678. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 17th day of October 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ledyard B.

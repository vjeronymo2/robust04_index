			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> U.S. SEEKS DUAL ROLE FOR BORDER CHECKS  </P> <P> Federal officials are seeking court authority to use two major U.S. Border  Patrol checkpoints in Southern California for the "dual purpose" of immigration  and drug checks, a government prosecutor said. The proposal, which critics see  as a significant expansion of the traditional immigration-law role of the  checkpoints, has drawn fire from civil libertarians and others concerned about  a violation of 4th Amendment safeguards against unreasonable searches and  seizures.  </P> <P> Critics say the "dual purpose" designation, if authorized, could have  far-reaching implications at immigration checkpoints throughout the U.S.-Mexico  border area, and, possibly, at law enforcement checkpoints elsewhere in the  United States. But Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick K. O'Toole argued that the  "dual purpose" designation is necessary to combat the ever-expanding volume of  drug traffic from Mexico through San Diego County.  </P></p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Arts: Graves's 'Carmen' - Maggio musicale Though she has been singing Carmen for only a couple of years, the young American mezzo Denyce Graves has staked a firm claim to the role. Her recent appearances at the Teatro Comunale in Florence confirmed her affinity with Bizet's heroine and, at the same time, enlivened what has been a fairly lacklustre Maggio musicale, the 56th festival in the series. Denyce Graves looks the part: slim and sexy, dark-skinned, she has a dazzling, seductive smile, mobile expression (insofar as the disastrous lighting of the production allowed her face to be seen), a feline grace, and an impressive ability to dance. She can sing, too. The voice is not over-opulent, but it has warmth, extension, and a broad range of colours. At times, she can sound almost adolescent, as she proclaims - and demonstrates - Carmen's sincerity; then, when she asserts her need for freedom, she is commanding, even frightening. While remaining always in the part, she never sacrifices the music to the drama. The notes are given their proper value. After enduring far too many 'singing actresses' exaggerate chest notes and parlando, it was a welcome relief to hear such straightforward singing. Though Luis Lima does not have a great, or even an attractive voice, he has understandably become the leading interpreter of Don Jose'; for his total identification with the unhappy soldier, his intensity and - in the final act - his crazed desperation make him entirely convincing and moving. He was the ideal partner for Denyce Graves; it was a pity that the infelicitous staging of Nuria Espert (imported from Covent Garden) did not fully exploit the possibilities of the two personable and gifted stars. When they were not obscured by Albert Faura's lighting (no, wrong word: by his 'darkening'), the main characters were concealed in the clumsily-handled chorus. Graves and Lima triumphed in spite of their producer. They also received little support from their conductor. Zubin Mehta imposed an unimaginative reading: the tempi were often rigid, Bizet's subtle shifts of mood, the little surges of hope, the brief plunges into desperation, were all smoothed out. Micaela's scene (Cecilia Gasdia was in poor form) dragged on endlessly, a whining dirge. Justino Diaz has never been a really satisfactory Escamillo, except visually; at this point in his career, he is not enjoyable to hear. The Mercedes and, even more, the Frasquita were simply inadequate; Morales, Dancaire and Remendado were no better. In the delicate 'smoking' scene of Act I (dully handled by Mehta), the thinned voices of the chorus sounded strained. Often, in the case of Carmen we are obliged to hear an opera without a protagonist; on this occasion, we heard a protagonist who had been largely deprived of her opera.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Muhammad Sharaf: "Is There a Cure to the </F> Pains of a Slow but Jittery Peace Process?"]    [Text] Escalation in Palestinian-Israeli violence over the  past few weeks and the clear defiance with which both sides  greeted security measures and precautions are, undeniably, a  consequence of the Hebron massacre. Defiance of security  measures and precautions was noticeable in both the Palestinian  and Israeli sides.    Two bus attacks in Israel--the most recent one yesterday,  left six dead and many wounded--may give fodder to the  pro-Israeli propaganda machine. Despite that, a careful  analysis of the consequences of the Hebron massacre reveals a  worrying fact. Extremists on both sides are currently trying to  take the law in their own hands and impose their antipeace  agenda on everyone else.    The escalation in violence and bloodshed may at first glance  appear to be a direct consequence of the Hebron massacre. But a  deeper and more worrying reason is in play. The peace process  has had a rough ride, not least because of the lack of  commitment to the dates stipulated in the Declaration of  Principles and the Gaza- Jericho agreement.    It is no secret to anyone following the scene closely that  the Declaration of Principles and the Gaza-Jericho agreement  failed to satisfy a significant segment of Palestinian and Arab  public opinion, due to their failure to satisfy some Palestinian  demands.    Still, we have to remember that the existing agreement was  just a starting point and that what matters is what follows this  agreement in terms of comprehensive self-rule and the final  status of the occupied territories.    The Israeli side has introduced certain complications that  resulted in the failure to meet the proposed date of full  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho: Wednesday 13 April, yesterday.  It came and went without the withdrawal having even begun.    This and other factors combined to produce the recent  deterioration in the situation and to endanger the entire peace  process. The peace process is in danger. Its jitters are due  partly to the slow pace with which it is proceeding and partly  to the fact that doubts about Israel's intentions are reaching a  higher and more worrying plateau.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres promised, after the distressing bus attack in  Israel two days ago, that they will not allow such incidents to  hinder the peace process. Earlier, Prime Minister Rabin made a  statement to the effect that no dateline is sacred concerning  the practical steps involved in the peace process.    At a time when matters have come to a head, it would be  wrong  to question the integrity of either side. But recent events,  the general climate of the peace process, and the differences  facing the implementation of the existing agreements are a cause  for doubts, justified or imagined.    Despite that, there are other statements by the Israeli  prime  minister disseminated in the media today. These statements are  extremely important and give cause for some optimism amid the  discouragement created by the recent acts of mutual violence and  fomented by the slow and unsure pace of Palestinian-Israeli  talks. Most important of the Israeli prime minister's remarks,  which he made in a press interview, is his expression of  willingness to remove the Israeli settlements in the occupied  territories in return for a final agreement with the  Palestinians. Rabin, however, pointed out that the security of  the settlements should be guaranteed during the self-rule period.    This Israeli statement leaves one question unanswered,  however. Can guarantees for the security of the settlements be  reconciled with the Palestinians' exercise of the self-rule  authority in the commonly accepted sense of the word?    Having said all this, we wish to make it clear that there is  a dire need for a faster pace, a stronger commitment, and  clearer positions on all tracks of the peace process.</p>

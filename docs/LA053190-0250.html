			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> RINGLING BURIAL AT MUSEUM OKD  </P> <P> A state appeals court has cleared the way for the remains of circus magnate  John Ringling and his wife, Mabel, to be buried on the grounds of the Sarasota  art museum that bears their name.  </P> <P> The 2nd District Court of Appeal in Lakeland upheld an order Wednesday that was  made last year by Sarasota Circuit Judge Stephen Dakan allowing the burials.  </P> <P> "It means we're prepared to move forward with the appropriate memorial," said  lawyer Lamar Matthews.  </P> <P> Matthews represents John Ringling's nephew, Henry Ringling North, in his quest  to have the couple buried at the museum alongside John Ringling's sister, Ida  North.  </P> <P> Pat Buck, a grandniece of Ringling, had opposed burying Ida North with the  Ringlings because Ida had nothing to do with the circus. Henry North had the  Ringlings' bodies moved in 1987 from receiving vaults in Fairview, N.J., to  unmarked crypts at a Port Charlotte cemetery. Mabel Ringling died in 1929 and  John died in 1936. Ida North's body has been stored at a Sarasota funeral home  since her death in 1950.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 24 (TASS) -- A draft resolution of  the State Duma on declaring an amnesty for some categories of  prisoners not creating any special danger for society will be  discussed by the parliamentary committee for legislation and the  reform of the judicial-legal system, First Deputy Chairman of  the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly Mikhail Mityukov told  ITAR-TASS.    The draft resolution is being submitted to the State Duma by  President Boris Yeltsin.    Mityukov pointed out that the draft resolution had not yet  come to the State Duma and explained that, in accordance with  Article 103 of the Russian Constitution, the declaration of an  amnesty is the prerogatve of the State Duma. "Naturally, the  president has the right to initiate an amnesty act, which means  that he has the right to submit a draft resolution on this issue  for the consideration of the parliament's chamber," he said.    Mityukov described the mechanism of the discussion of the  document by the State Duma: after the committee for legislation  and the reform of the judicial-legal system gives its  conclusion, the draft resolution will be submitted to the  chamber's council and after that it will be discussed at a  plenary session of the State Duma.    "It is difficult to forecast the results of the examination  of the draft resolution by the State Duma, but I think we cannot  do without a discussion. Important events in the life of the  country, such as the adoption of a new constitution and major  anniversaries, have always been accompanied by the declaration  of an amnesty. The question arises, however, what will be the  limits of the amnesty," he said.    In the opinion of Mityukov, "maximum caution should be  displayed in such situations, especially taking into  consideration the current crime situation in conditions of the  weakened law and order in the country."</p>

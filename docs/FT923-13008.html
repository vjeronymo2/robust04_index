			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Japan's corporate bankruptcies grow JAPAN'S mainstream manufacturing and service industries saw a sharp rise in bankruptcies during June in a reflection of the broad slowdown of the Japanese economy, the Teikoku Data Bank reported yesterday. The total debt of bankrupt companies, at Y375.2bn (Pounds 1.6bn), was none the less the smallest figure this year, owing to the absence of large property-related collapses. The number of property-related bankruptcies fell from 104 a year ago to 86, registering the first year-on-year decline in nearly two years. Property companies were first to be in distress last year when a period of high interest rates led to a sharp decline in asset prices. Last month's figures, however, show that corporate difficulties have now spread broadly through the economy. The total number of corporate bankruptcies during June rose to 1,171, the highest in nearly seven years. Bankruptcies in construction rose year-on-year by 33 per cent to 236 cases; in manufacturing by 36 per cent to 155; in wholesaling by 36.5 per cent to 284 cases. Similar increases were reported in retailing, transportation and communications, and in other service industries. Teikoku said that the high rate of bankruptcies was expected to continue in the months ahead. Private sector machinery orders in May plunged by 23 per cent from a year ago, the Economic Planning Agency said, making it the seventh consecutive month of year-on-year declines. The agency said that orders from big users in the automobile, chemical and machinery industries have yet to show signs of recovery. Public sector orders increased by 11 per cent, and are expected to accelerate later in the year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Semih D. Idiz: "Refah's Foreign Policy Outlook"] </F>   [Text] As the success of Refah (the Welfare Party-RP)  following Sunday's [27 March] local elections sent shock waves  around the country, arousing fears among the overwhelmingly  secular majority of the electorate which had split its 80  percent of votes among the various secular parties contesting  the election, foreign diplomats in Ankara were busily trying to  interpret what this startling victory by such an intensely  pro-Islamic -- if not outright fundamentalist -- party meant in  terms of Turkey's future.    Asked during his press conference in Ankara, the day after  it  became certain that his party had taken the mayoral posts in  Istanbul and the Turkish capital, about how the West should view  his party's victory, RP leader Necmettin Erbakan said very  openly that the fact that his party was coming to power was "a  very important event for the whole world."    "We believe that Westerners are clever enough to consider  what is to their own interests. No one should act in a  prejudicial manner... a bankrupt Turkey will constitute a weight  for the West. But a strong and economically sound Turkey is good  for the West as well" he said.    "But compared to relations today our government will have  one  difference. The West, which today sees Turkey as a servant and  issues its orders over the phone will have to think, what will  Turkey say? when it is about to take any decision while we are  in power" Erbakan added.    Concealed in these words may have been an attempt at trying  to reassure the West that it could have normal relations with a  Turkey run by the pro-Islamic RP, provided it restrained its  prejudices and treated Turkey with the respect that Erbakan  believes it is not receiving today.    But despite this attempt at reassurance, a defiance aimed at  the West is, nevertheless, clearly and unmistakably discernible  in the RP leader's words.    Of course the RP is not in power today or anywhere close to  it at the present time although it has expanded its popular base  in these local elections. There are over two and a half years  to go to the next general elections -- provided early elections  are not announced -- which are due to be held in the fall of  1996, and the parties that lost out in Sunday's local elections  have time to recover if they opt for sensible policies and leave  behind the policies that have alienated them from the masses.    There can be no doubt, however, that the RP will work day in  and day out until those elections in order to build on its  victory at these local elections which have indicated that it  can command nearly 20 percent of the overall nationwide vote at  the present time. Neither can there be any doubt that Sunday's  results have placed this party firmly on Turkey's political  panorama with an influence that it has not had in the past  although it has been around since the late 1960's under one name  or another.    Given this fact it appears necessary to try and piece  together what we know of the RP's outlook on relations with the  outside world.    Firstly there can be no doubt that it is intensely anti-West  in its general outlook even though Erbakan is a German educated  engineer.    It has made this clear in the most open terms at every  occasion that it has grabbed, and if it is now appearing to use  seemingly conciliatory words of reassurance this is only the  result of an unavoidable pragmatism dictated by circumstance.    Thus, for example, Necmettin Erbakan has consistently been a  strong opponent of the idea of Turkey ever becoming a member of  the European Union. He opposed this idea when it was the  European Economic Community, he opposed it when it was the  European Community, and he opposes it now when it is the EU  [European Union]. Neither has he wasted any opportunity to rub  in what he terms "The West's refusal to admit Turkey in its  midst after Ankara's full application to the EC and the "avis"  [opinion] this received from Brussels. [no end quotation mark as  published]    Thus every time there is a rebuffing of Turkey by the West  the RP has been delighted and has used it against the  government. But this opposition to the West by the RP has  nothing to do with intense nationalistic sympathies as might be  assumed. It is has to do with the overall Christian character  of Europe, a character which is seen as being at odds with the  islamic world in an irreconcilable way.    It must be kept in mind that what is predominant for the  type of Islam that the RP ultimately represents -- although it  is not convenient for its followers to admit this at the present  time -- is not nationalism as such but the "Ummar," i.e., the  "Islamic collective" which recognized no boundaries within its  own borders.    This makes the RP see its relations with other Islamic  countries, especially those run by the all encapsulating Islamic  judicial code, the Shari'ah -- as in the case of the oil rich  Gulf states -- in a completely different light to relations with  the Christian West.    To accuse it of hypocrisy for criticising the current  secular  and Kemalist regime in Turkey of being attached to an un-Turkish  Western lifestyle, while it itself is so attached to the  "un-Turkish East" is in this sense irrelevant for the RP. It is  irrelevant because for its followers the "Islamic East" is not  "outside" or "abroad" in the way that the Christian West is. It  is only an "extension" of Islamic Turkey -- or Islamic Turkey is  an extension of the Islamic East.    Another characteristic of the RP is that it is intensely  anti- Jewish and anti-Zionist, but not in a racist anti-Semitic  way.    It sees the Jews, "with their seditious Zionism," and their  state of Israel as "an instrument of the West which is like a  piercing and sharp dagger stuck in the belly of the Islamic  Ummah."    As a phenomenon which is considered to have proved its  "hellish enmity to Islam" in the pain and suffering it is said  to be meting out to the Palestinians, the Jewish state is seen  by many RP followers as something that must be eradicated at all  costs because it is the embodiment of evil.    Baruch Goldstein, who massacred praying Palestinians in  Hebron, has in one sense done the Islamic ideologues in Turkey  something of a service during their critical election campaign.  Even where some Arab countries have come around to seeking  means of a rapprochement with Israel, the RP will have none of  this, seeing the recent accord between the Jewish state and the  Palestinian Liberation Organization as a sell out of the  Palestinian people.    Considering PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat a traitor and an  instrument of Israel, the RP is closer to the Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] movement that it admires as a "people's  movement" which it sees itself as also being.    All this does not, however, cover some of the RP's  contradictions in terms of its relations with the outside world  and other countries.    For example it will not have anything bad said about Saudi  Arabia, from where it receives massive amounts of material and  moral support, even though this country allowed itself to be  converted into a massive aircraft carrier for the West during  the Gulf War against Iraq, with the infidel male and female  soldiers trotting up and down holy lands and doing Allah only  knows what...    Neither will Erbakan have anything bad said about Germany  even if this is a country where there is a resurgence of  xenophobia and fatal violence against God fearing Moslem Turks.  In both cases the lowest common denominator, leading the RP  leader to taking such a docile stance even though his basic  Islamic philosophy should make him scream with anger, appears to  be money.    While he is known to harbour a secret admiration for  Germany,  where he studied as a young man and even worked as an engineer  in Krupps, he knows this country is also a major source of  income for his party from Turkish sympathizers working and  living there. This is something that he would hardly want to  endanger. Like Germany, Saudi Arabia is also a source of income  which merits a blind eye to some inconsistencies such as this  country's extremely close ties with the United States.    Now that it has felt its strength based on popular support  there is no doubt that the RP will want to make its views on a  large number of issues known more vocally in the coming period.  Its views on a host of foreign policy questions should also  become more clear as it does so.    What is certain is that everything it says to this end will  be noted down fervently by all in a general attempt to  understand where Turkey might head if the RP really did come to  power one day.</p>

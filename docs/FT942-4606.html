			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Reform protest poses threat to Thai coalition Thailand's coalition government was last night struggling to deal with a protest in favour of constitutional reform that threatens to blow up into a political crisis. A marginal political figure, Mr Chalard Vorachat, a former MP, has projected himself into the forefront of national political debate with a two-week hunger strike to demand the scrapping of the constitution, drafted in the aftermath of a 1991 military coup. About 3,000 people rallied outside the Thai parliament yesterday in his support, echoing protests that eventually brought down a military-dominated government in May 1992. The government has rejected his demands saying there are no legal provisions for scrapping the constitution and any changes must be made by amending the present one. Compromise appeared to have been reached on Tuesday when officials from Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's Democrat party expressed support for a proposal from Mr Chalard for a special committee to study ways to draft a new constitution. But hours later Democrat officials denied that support and expressed firm opposition to a new constitution. The switch raised the political temperature on Wednesday and posed questions about the stability of the coalition. There remains the danger that the coalition's Palang Dharma (Buddhist way) party, led by the unpredictable former mayor of Bangkok Mr Chamlong Srimuang who has taken Mr Chalard's side, may put pressure on Mr Chuan so he has to replace Palang Dharma with a right-wing party or dissolve parliament. The opposition, which recently combined with the military-dominated Senate to throw out the government's own attempt at reforming the constitution, have performed a classic political U-turn to support Mr Chalard. Dr Weng Tochirakarn, a member of the newly-created Organisation for Political Reform, said 'I am not happy. The tension has now increased and it could lead to serious consequences.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Oxygenate and Blending Costs of the Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The renewable oxygenate program is projected to add $4 million to $60 million in cost to the RFG program annually prior to the year 2000 and $16 million to $60 million in cost to the RFG program annually in 2000 and beyond. These costs involve three major components: the cost of renewable oxygenates relative to nonrenewable oxygenates, transportation and blending costs, and toxics compliance costs. The cost estimates include the impact of this rule on fuel economy. These costs also assume that ethanol is blended at a concentration of 6.04 volume percent (2.1 weight percent oxygen); to the extent that ethanol is blended at higher concentrations, costs (particularly the toxics compliance costs) would be reduced. In addition, the renewable oxygenate program is projected to add one-time costs of $17.6 million for additional tankage, storage, and blending capacity. The derivation of the various components of the cost for the renewable oxygenate program are described below and in more detail in section IV of the Regulatory Impact Analysis for this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before estimating the costs for the renewable oxygenate program, however, it is necessary to estimate how much additional ethanol will be used in RFG compared to the amount of ethanol that would have been used in the absence of today's rule. Only those costs resulting from the new ethanol demand required by the renewable oxygenate program alone are included in the cost estimates determined here. Deriving estimates for that amount of ethanol that would have been used under the RFG program in the absence of the renewables requirement is extremely difficult. However, the amount of new ethanol capacity planned or under construction prior to the December proposal, combined with the ethanol currently blended in the winter months in RFG areas would have enabled ethanol to be used in up to 15 percent of the RFG oxygenate market without displacing ethanol from existing markets. Based on this information, EPA estimates that today's rule is likely to increase ethanol's share of the total oxygenate market by approximately 15 percentage points, which amounts to 335 million gallons of ethanol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the first component of the cost analysis, renewable oxygenate costs, ethanol used in winter RFG is projected to be the low-cost oxygenate on a per unit oxygen basis (based on EPA's cost analysis for the RFG final rule and excluding any additional transportation and blending costs as discussed below). Hence EPA expects that if winter ethanol is used to meet the the renewable oxygenate requirement, today's rule will not impose additional direct costs for oxygenates on the RFG program. In fact, assuming 335 million gallons of new ethanol demand, today's rule will reduce direct oxygenate costs by $22&hyph;72 million annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

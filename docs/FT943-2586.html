			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Haiti: Carter, world troubleshooter extraordinaire - The man who was catapulted into Haiti at the eleventh hour Even by his own standards, this was not exactly a normal weekend in the extremely busy life of former President Jimmy Carter. Mr Carter himself was in Port-au-Prince at the head of the US delegation seeking a last minute solution to prevent the fully-fledged invasion of Haiti. From the other side of world, the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, came word that Kim Jong-il was seeking his services to arrange a summit between himself and President Kim Young-sam of South Korea. The list of the former president's international mediation over the last five years is quite extraordinary, beginning in 1989, when he helped broker the settlement in Ethiopia that led to the independence of Eritrea. In 1990, he led international monitoring teams covering the elections in both halves of the island of Hispaniola - the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It was during the latter that he established a relationship with Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, then in charge of security for the elections and nine months later leader of the coup that removed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The two have remained in touch in recent weeks. In 1991, he was a principal monitor of the elections in Zambia, in 1992 Guyana and in 1993 Paraguay. Earlier this summer, in Pyongyang, he managed to persuade Kim Il-sung, the late North Korean dictator, to reopen negotiations with the US that, for the moment, have defused tensions over the nuclear question. These are merely the most visible of his activities, along with his domestic good works, mostly centred on building affordable public housing for the poor. As a result, Mr Carter, buried under the Reagan landslide of 1980 after one term in office, has re-established himself as one of the most respected Americans of this generation. His public standing is now far higher than that of former President Reagan. He has not always been a predictable envoy. Administration officials were concerned that, in his North Korean mission, he did not always appear to represent US government policy accurately. But they could not deny that his efforts certainly bore fruit. Like the other leading members of his Haitian delegation - Senator Sam Nunn, the Democrat from Georgia who heads the armed services committee, and former General Colin Powell, previous head of the joint chiefs of staff - he has never publicly endorsed an invasion. Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, said yesterday that the composition of the team was decided between President Clinton and Mr Carter. But the combination of Mr Carter's stature, his knowledge of Haiti and his independent streak called into question the White House's insistence that his mission to Port-au-Prince is limited only to the matter of arranging the departure of the junta, as demanded by Mr Clinton. There was, for example, some surprise in Washington that the Carter delegation should have talked over the weekend with Mr Emil Jounaissant, installed by the junta as acting president. This gave rise to speculation that more wide-ranging discussions were under way. With his latest mission, Mr Carter has built his stocks of credit even higher. There is some doubt, however, whether the president will be so lucky.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Waddington to become governor of Bermuda LORD WADDINGTON, who left the cabinet at the weekend, is to become governor of Bermuda, Downing Street announced yesterday. The former leader of the House of Lords, who made way for Mr John Wakeham, the former energy secretary and election campaign 'fixer', will take up his new post late in the summer. The governorship carries an annual salary equivalent to Dollars 115,000 (Pounds 65,280). Mr John Major, the prime minister, spent some time yesterday consulting Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, about the reshuffle of junior ministers. Most of those changes will be announced today. Other senior colleagues were consulted on Saturday when the cabinet posts were allocated. There are about 40 places to be filled. The middle ranks of ministers have been depleted, both by promotions to the cabinet and by those who have lost their seats, including Mr Francis Maude, Mr John Maples, Mrs Lynda Chalker and Mr Michael Fallon. Among ministers tipped for advancement are Mr Stephen Dorrell, the junior health minister, Sir George Young, the housing minister, and Mr John Redwood, the corporate affairs minister. In the Lords, Baroness Blatch, the environment minister, may also receive promotion. Of those who are in the whips' office or are parliamentary private secretaries - the first rung on the ministerial ladder - candidates for office include Mr William Hague, parliamentary private secretary to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr David Davis, a whip. Although the new intake of Tory MPs contains many who have already been associated with the government, such as Mrs Judith Chaplin, who was Mr Major's political secretary, and Mr David Willetts, who was director of the Centre for Policy Studies, the rightwing think tank, it is unlikely that any of those entering the Commons for the first time would be given office immediately.</p>

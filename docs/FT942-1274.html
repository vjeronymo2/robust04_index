			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (3): This year looks rosier - Manuela Saragosa looks at foreign investment After years of hearing complaints about restrictions on foreign investment, the government has at last greatly reduced the limits, in order to increase the flow of funds into the country. At the beginning of June the government decided to scrap rules stipulating that foreign companies must reduce their stakes in joint ventures to a minority shareholding after 20 years of operation. Moreover, it announced that it would open up sectors as diverse as telecommunications, civil aviation, nuclear power, electricity, and seaports to partial foreign ownership - all previously barred. It was necessary. With 2.5m people a year entering the Indonesian workforce, to say nothing of a 46 per cent rise in the minimum wage at the beginning of this year, and increased competition for foreign funds from neighbouring Asian countries, Indonesia had to take action to improve its investment climate. Deregulation had assumed a sense of urgency. Many Japanese investors have been operating in Indonesia since the mid-1970s; their investment licences were coming up for renewal. Under the old regulations they faced becoming minority shareholders. Officials say that some Japanese companies were threatening to pull out of Indonesia altogether. The latest deregulation package 'was very, very big news for us,' says Mr Yohsuke Udaka, director of PT Teijin Indonesia Fiber. He says it will increase Indonesia's appeal to foreign investors and also strengthen his company's argument to expand their activities in Indonesia. Nevertheless, the five-year tax holidays which are offered to foreign companies setting up shop in China, together with Indonesia's high interest rates and bureaucratic hold-ups, may continue to convince some investors that they should move elsewhere. 'We realise we have competitors,' says Mr Asril Noer, director of overseas promotion at the Investment Co-ordinating Board (BKPM). 'Developing countries have to compete for foreign investment. Many are trying to make their investment climate more attractive than others. But so are we.' The latest deregulation package, however, had to tackle some stiff opposition. Ministers initially decreed that the media sector would be open to foreigners - but that decision was quickly squashed after an outcry from Mr Harmoko, the minister of information, who complained that opening up the media to foreign ownership threatened the country's national integrity. President Suharto assured Mr Harmoko that any foreign ownership of the media sector would be illegal. The event demonstrated that nationalism is still an effective instrument in thwarting attempts at deregulation. But it neither surprised nor disappointed investors, who say that any benefits derived from investing in Indonesian media are outweighed by the risks. Meanwhile, foreign investors are still digesting other points in the latest deregulation package which so far have remained uncontested. They include extending foreign companies' operating licences to 30 years from 20 years, and abolishing regional restrictions and a minimum capital requirement of Dollars 50m on full foreign ownership. All have been hailed as important breakthroughs - at the right time. Last year foreign direct investment in Indonesia, excluding oil and gas exploration, showed an unexpected drop to Dollars 8.4 bn from Dollars 10.3 bn a year earlier. Mr Noer at the Investment Co-ordinating Board blames last year's drop on the recession in Japan, Indonesia's largest foreign investor. But things look rosier this year. According to the latest statistics from the Investment Co-ordinating Board, foreign direct investment totalled a healthy Dollars 5.03bn by mid-May. But the figures must be treated with caution, because historically only about half of approved foreign projects by value are implemented. Companies complain about the bureaucratic obstacles they bump into when doing business in Indonesia. They protest that the country's legal system does not provide adequate protection, especially in anti-dumping legislation. Getting approval for an investment project is long and arduous, although steps have been taken to speed up the process. Once that is overcome, some investors complain that they have problems getting raw materials into the country because customs officials hold them to ransom. And they find it impossible to work the tax rebate system. 'The problem is that the bureaucracy tends to divert the good intentions of ministers,' says a disenchanted investor. Mr Noer at the Investment Co-ordinating Board points out that despite complaints, applications keep rolling in. Ministers, meanwhile, have indicated that they will not become complacent. 'We are discussing the next deregulation package,' says Mr Saleh Afiff, co-ordinating minister for economic and financial affairs. 'Many other things have to be done.'</p>

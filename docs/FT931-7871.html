			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (7): Budget hopes for diesel - Why British drivers are now more interested IN 10 years, the diesel car has changed from being a curiosity into the logical choice for the driver who has some regard for fuel economy and environmental protection. At least, it has in Britain. In many mainland European countries the diesel's ability to cut the cost of motoring has been well-known for a long time. While diesel's share of annual UK registrations has risen from 1 per cent in 1982 to 12.6 per cent last year (200,835 cars), there is still a long way to go before penetration matches that of France. There, with both horsepower-based annual tax and fuel duty favouring diesel cars, they have routinely been chosen by high mileage drivers and now account for more than 40 per cent of registrations. Until recently, fuel economy, long engine life and reliability had been the strongest cards in the diesel car's suit. Typically, a diesel will achieve a year-round fuel consumption between 20 and 30 per cent less than that of a comparable petrol-engined car. Higher economy gains are achieved in heavy traffic rather than motorway driving as the diesel engine performs best when producing less than full power. Equally, a diesel car shines when used continuously on short journeys involving many cold starts. Because it burns little more fuel when warming up than it does when running at normal working temperature, its consumption may be only half that of a similar petrol car during the first 10km of a winter journey after starting from cold. This benefit is not fully reflected in the official Department of Transport fuel consumption figures. These are obtained by simulating traffic driving, as well as 90 kmh (56 mph) and 120 kmh (75 mph) constant-speed cruising, with the engine at full working temperature. Life is much harder in the real world where diesels can show more than 30 per cent greater economy when used mainly in stop-start, fairly low speed conditions. Smoke-belching, ill- maintained and often overloaded lorries do nothing for the diesel engine's image as an environmentally acceptable power unit. Many believe a diesel car is inherently dirtier than a petrol car, especially one with a catalytic converter. That is not so. A diesel produces only a fraction of the amount of poisonous carbon monoxide created by a petrol engine. Its output of carbon dioxide - the so-called greenhouse gas believed to be the cause of global warming  - is lower because it burns less fuel. Less energy is used to produce diesel than petrol at the refinery. Although its emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide are worse than a petrol engine's, overall a diesel is less damaging to the environment than the average petrol engine with an exhaust catalyser. Now that many car diesels are being fitted with simple oxidation catalysers, the balance of advantage is tilting further in their favour. But by itself, the environmental argument would cut little ice with business drivers and fleet managers if diesel cars were significantly less pleasant to drive than petrol cars. They used to be slower, noisier and generally harsher to drive than their petrol engine counterparts but a great deal has happened over the last decade. Turbocharging and intercooling have significantly raised output and, by way of a spin-off, made the car diesel engine smoother and more refined. Engine design changes have improved the combustion process, reducing particulate emissions (in other words, smoke) at source. Two-stage injectors have reduced the diesel engine's disagreeable knocking immediately after cold-starting and almost eliminated it when idling. The fleet manager and, for that matter, the executive user-chooser deciding to go diesel are now faced with an embarrassment of choice. The days when only a handful of manufacturers offered viable diesel options have long gone. Almost every make of car from supermini to senior businessman's saloon is now available with a diesel (and often turbo-diesel) engine. Peugeot-Citroen (PSA) is the acknowledged leader in small automotive diesel design and production. Its engines are used in a wide range of cars of its own and other makes, from the small Citroen AX, Peugeot 106 and Rover Metro to the medium-sized Peugeot 405 and Citroen BX, which is soon to be replaced by the Xantia. At present, the 12-valve, 4-cylinder, 2.1-litre PSA diesel is exclusive to the Citroen XM and Peugeot 605. Indeed, the best of the modern diesel cars, such as the Citroen ZX turbo-diesel, actually outperform some petrol-engined cars of comparable size and price while returning around 50 mpg (5.65 1/100 km). Among other diesels that perform exuberantly but quietly enough to be used as police patrol cars are the Vauxhall Nova (Opel Corsa) and Astra, powered by engines supplied by General Motors' Japanese partner, Isuzu. In Britain, most of the growth in diesel car registrations has been at the lower end of the market with engines of under two litres capacity. Current Inland Revenue rules impose a heavy tax penalty on drivers of over two-litre diesel cars. (The rules ignore the fact that a diesel engine needs more cylinder capacity than a petrol engine to produce a given amount of power). However, the disincentive of tax banding based on engine size to the use of executive-class diesels will probably be swept away when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, presents his next budget. EC tax harmonisation proposals may also lead to a greater price differential between unleaded petrol and diesel. The threat of a carbon tax can only increase the longer-term appeal of executive-class diesel, especially as it uses less fuel. Despite the tax disadvantage, UK sales of upmarket diesels went up last year. Mercedes-Benz sold 33 per cent more 190D saloons and 45 per cent more 300D and 300TD diesels in 1992 than the year before. More startling was VW-Audi's 286 per cent and Vauxhall's 307 per cent year-on-year increase in diesel car sales last October though this was mainly due to their introducing greatly improved models. Diesel executive car sales will be boosted later this year when BMW belatedly enters the UK market with its super-smooth 6-cylinder engined cars. These, and Audi's powerful yet frugal direct-injection 80 and 100 turbo-diesels, will give quality and image-conscious business diesel car drivers an alternative to Mercedes-Benz, whose diesels are still unmatched for silence and urbanity. And exceptionally, Mercedes-Benz offers automatic transmission on every one of its diesel models. Few others do, though Citroen (the XM) and Vauxhall (the Carlton) are notable exceptions.</p>

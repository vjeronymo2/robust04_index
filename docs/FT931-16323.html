			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Transformed Flextech Pounds 3m in loss A DEPARTURE from the oil services business left USM-quoted Flextech showing pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.9m for the half year to September 30. For the opening half of the previous year the company returned profits of Pounds 3.9m. The announcement prompted a 5p fall in the shares to 81p. However, they had risen sharply since January 1 following speculation on an imminent deal with BSkyB for paid subscription of The Children's Channel, which is indirectly 51 per cent owned by Flextech. No deal was announced, although it has been reported that an agreement has been signed. Flextech, which in recent years has been shedding its oil investments, has been transformed into a company with interests in cable and satellite television. In July it concluded the sale of Expro, its last oil services subsidiary, to management for Pounds 55m. The sharp decline in turnover from Pounds 27.9m to Pounds 2.14m and the lapse into losses reflects the disposal. Mr Roger Luard, a director, was enthusiastic about the future despite continued losses at The Children's Channel. This incurred a deficit of more than Pounds 3m for the whole of last year. The number of cable and satellite users in the UK alone had grown by 70 and 40 per cent respectively from October 1991 to October 1992, Mr Luard said. TCC had benefited from the increase with a 30 per cent rise in overall revenues. However, the improved performance had been offset by the increased costs of renting an extra satellite for better and wider transmission. Mr Luard said the need for an extra satellite, and therefore the additional costs, would soon be eliminated by the transfer to an alternative Astra facility. Flextech's other investments - IVS, which operates local cable franchises, and HIT, which distributes children's programming - had turned in encouraging results, Mr Luard said. The group also announced it intended to change its year-end from end-March to December 31. It would also review its dividend policy in the light of the altered business. Losses per share worked through at 5.86p (earnings 6.34p).</p>

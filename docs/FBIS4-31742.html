			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zarko Rakovic: "From Vardar to Triglav?"] </F>   [Text] The communists in Yugoslavia have obtained  successors; they founded the Yugoslav Revolutionary Youth  Organization in Belgrade; by "Yugoslavia," they mean the one of  Tito's time.    Belgrade (from our associate)--Communism in Yugoslavia has  not yet died; it has only turned into a vampire. In the building  of the former Central Committee of the League of Communists of  Yugoslavia [CC LCY], at the confluence of the Sava and the  Danube, the Yugoslav Revolutionary Youth Organization [JRM], or,  as its leaders call it, the Communist Youth of Yugoslavia, held  its founding assembly. By "Yugoslavia" they do not mean the  present mini-Yugoslavia, but rather the one from Broz's time,  which reached from Triglav to Vardar. The JRM's first activities  have already begun. Fourteen years after Tito's death, one can  see on Belgrade streets posters saying "We are Tito's--Tito is  ours," and one can hear the anthem "Hey, Slavs."    That circus of communist offspring would not merit any  attention if it did not have its base in the building of the  former CC LCY, which is controlled and managed by Milosevic's  Socialist Party of Serbia. The JRM has guaranteed spaces there  and the best opportunities to operate, which means that the  ruling Serbian regime is backing it. Who are those young people  and where are they from (actually they are not really young,  since none of them is under 25) is hard to find out. It is even  harder to explain their harsh slogans, uttered with a fist  raised high: "We will restore Yugoslavia," "Hope is on the  left," "Fraternity and unity again," "Socialism is democracy,"  "The five-pointed star is our shrine...."    The residents of Belgrade who have seen that communist  offspring of Yugoslavia did not realize immediately what was  going on. At first they thought that some sort of film was being  taped. Recently, in fact, a splendid impersonator of Josip Broz,  known as Micko, on instructions from director Zelimir Zilnik,  walked along Belgrade streets and spoke with astonished  bystanders. Skillfully disguised and dressed in a marshal's  uniform, he asked Belgrade residents whether they missed him at  all. Most of them answered that they regretted that he was no  longer with them, and that he was in their hearts forever.    Forever?    The establishment of the JRM obviously indicates that people  in the present Yugoslavia also think so.</p>

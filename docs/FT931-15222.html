			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Registrar to probe BA data allegation THE GOVERNMENT'S data protection registrar has launched an investigation into allegations that British Airways illegally gained access to Virgin Atlantic's computer system. Mr Eric Howe, data protection registrar, confirmed yesterday that he had written to Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin, requesting further details. 'We are trying to find out the facts,' he said. His inquiry was prompted by newspaper reports of claims by Mr Branson that BA had examined Virgin's computer data as part of a series of activities 'beyond any limits of commercially acceptable practice'. Under the 1984 Data Protection Act, anyone storing data about individuals on computer is required to register, stating the purpose and those to whom the data can be given. It is a criminal offence to fail to register, and use the data for other purposes or give it to unauthorised users 'knowingly or recklessly'. That is punishable by fines of up to Pounds 5,000 in the magistrates courts or unlimited levels in the High Court. The Data Protection Registrar confirmed last night that it had one registration for Virgin, 11 for BA and one for BA Enterprises. The registrar can also issue enforcement acts against breaches of guidelines, for instance if data has not been obtained fairly and lawfully, or is not held securely and is not accurate or relevant. The administrators to Air Europe, the charter group that collapsed in March 1991, were co-operating with Virgin in the period before the settlement against BA, it has emerged.</p>

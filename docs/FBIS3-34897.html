			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" Program] </F>   [Text] The Congolese authorities' plans to restore security  in the capital after months of bloody communal clashes have hit  another obstacle, and it is all because of an Israeli  connection. The Knesset is due to debate the sending of dozens  of Israeli soldiers to Congo on the invitation of President  Lissouba's government but the idea has not gone down too well  particularly because it is being put together by a private  company. From Jerusalem, John David reports:    [Begin recording] [David] Leftwing Israeli politicians were  alerted to the affair when parents complained that their sons  were being sent to Africa to a conflict they knew nothing about.  A private Israeli company, Levdan, has been recruiting some 60  former Israeli servicemen to go to Congo. Their leader is said  to be a retired brigadier general who was commander of the  Israeli forces in Southern Lebanon.    Twenty-five Israelis are already said to be in Congo with a  further 40 due to join them later this week. Some Israeli  weaponry may be included in the deal as well. When politicians  investigated the matter they were assured that Levdan had been  given all the correct permits by the Israeli Foreign and Defense  Ministries. The permits are apparently only given if Israelis  are working for the host government and won't be directly  involved in combat.    Naomi Hazan of the leftist center Meretz Party, which is in  the ruling coalition, is not happy with the way the matter is  being handled. Ms. Hazan said Israel should not become  embroiled in the domestic affairs of other states, especially on  the side of potentially unstable governments. If Israel wants  to undertake military cooperation, she said, it should be done  formally and not through a private company. Ms. Hazan believes  that the permits were issued through what she described as the  old boy network with the main incentives being economics.    Other politicians belonging to the Meretz Party have  objected  that Israeli foreign policy should be driven by financial  instead of political objectives. Even the critics are avoiding  branding the former Israeli servicemen mercenaries. They seem  to have accepted the government's assurances that they won't be  involved in combat. Israel is particularly sensitive to  accusations that it is supporting mercenaries. In the 1980's,  so-called Israeli security companies were accused of supplying  mercenaries to help train Colombian death squads on behalf of  drug dealers. [end recording]</p>

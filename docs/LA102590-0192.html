			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXXON PROFIT FLAT; UNOCAL INCOME UP 53% IN PERIOD;  </P> <P> ENERGY: RISING CRUDE PRICES WERE A BIG FACTOR AT BOTH COMPANIES.  </P> <P> Exxon Corp., the nation's largest oil company, posted flat third-quarter  earnings Wednesday and said rising crude oil prices from the Persian Gulf  crisis caused its refining and marketing operations to lose money.  </P> <P> While revenue rose 23% from a year earlier to $29.0 billion, Exxon said net  income was unchanged at $1.08 billion.  </P> <P> The losses in refining and marketing were offset by increased income from oil  exploration and production.  </P> <P> "In the two-month period following the beginning of the current crisis in the  Middle East, refining and marketing in the U.S. operated at a loss because  marketplace competition prevented full recovery of crude price increases,"  Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> Other oil companies in recent days have also said earnings were hurt because  they were unable to pass through to consumers the entire increase in crude oil  prices.  </P> <P> While the higher oil prices since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait has  generally helped oil producers, companies such as Exxon and Mobil with large  refining and marketing operations have not benefited as much.  </P> <P> Separately, Unocal Corp. reported a 53% rise in earnings that it attributed  largely to the higher prices for crude oil, which helped its production  business.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based company posted net earnings for the third quarter of $121  million on revenue that climbed 9% to $3.07 billion.  </P></p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Things can be done: Hand-wringing over the James Bulger case is misplaced It is a common human desire to seek a reason behind apparently irrational happenings. This has been well illustrated in the response to the conviction this week of two 11-year-old boys for the killing of Liverpool toddler James Bulger. In the UK, most newspapers and television stations have analysed in great detail the events which led to the abduction and brutal murder of the 2 1/2  year-old. Experts have proffered their explanations. The case has led news bulletins across the world. The search for a reason has ranged widely. Horror videos have been blamed, because of similarities between what happened to James Bulger and the events in Child's Play 3, a video borrowed by the father of one of the boys less than a month before the murder. Also blamed have been the witnesses who testified at the trial to having seen the boys leading the abducted toddler on his 2 1/2 -mile via dolorosa through Liverpool streets to the place where he was killed. Their failure to intervene effectively has been seen as symptomatic of an uncaring society in which stepping by on the other side is regarded as prudent behaviour. Society has also come in for criticism for creating a 'lost generation of children', the offspring of an urban underclass trapped in a cycle of poverty, violence and deprivation. Finally, there is the question of evil. Such events encourage those who see the old Adam reappearing, a return of the blacker side of human nature. Yet there is nothing new in the ability of humans to inflict suffering on others. In civil wars from Cambodia to Somalia, young children have become involved in vicious fighting and atrocities. Children who kill other children are rare outside the circumstances of war - but they are not unknown in countries such as the US and UK. The most notorious UK case until the James Bulger murder was that of Mary Bell, the 11-year-old from Newcastle upon Tyne accused in 1968 of strangling two boys aged three and four. She was found guilty of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility after being acquitted of murder. As in 1993, the baleful influence of television was cited as a cause of violent behaviour. Mary Bell said that she learnt that squeezing the throat led to death from The Saint, a TV series based on Leslie Charteris's detective novels. It would be foolish to deny a link between television (or video, or film) and criminal acts. Those who spend millions of pounds on advertising believe with justification that visual images can affect individuals' behaviour. There will be some impressionable individuals who will copy what they see. But it would be hard to prove such people would not behave violently if access to such images was denied. In any case, there are other factors surrounding the Bulger case which are more readily susceptible to policy initiatives that would prevent young people developing a violent bent. Chief among these are the circumstances within which the two boys broke free of parental authority and slipped through the normal framework of social control which might have restrained them. In one family, the mother - separated from her husband - was prone to marching her son into the local police station for chastisement because she was unable to discipline him. In the other, violence was routinely perpetrated on younger children by older ones - and by the father until his departure. One child in the family was in care and another had asked for the same treatment. Here, clearly, were children in need of help. Support for the family could have been offered within their existing homes if that was appropriate. With families completely unable to cope it might be better to give the children a secure environment outside the home. Both boys also appeared to have escaped the authority of their school, the other fixed point of their lives. One child had missed more than half the sessions in the two months before the murder. Both were seen as difficult to teach. Much more could be done to stop truanting and ensure that children are not allowed to become outlaws before reaching the age of 10. Schools which have tackled truancy have found that assigning staff to chasing up absent pupils promptly can make real inroads into the problem. Truancy league tables - published by the government for the first time last week - could be used as a lever to encourage other schools to follow suit. Once in school, children from especially deprived homes have special needs which may require very much greater resources than are presently offered. Such measures would not be cheap - especially if the help were to be of the quality which most people would aspire to offer their own children. Keeping a child in residential care can cost from Pounds 15,000 a year upwards - much more in difficult cases. Dealing effectively with special needs may require one teacher per pupil. Intervention would have to be applied with more sensitivity than has been shown in some recent childcare cases. The actions of social workers in recent cases of alleged child abuse have been unacceptably heavy-handed and intrusive. But that should not undermine the basic premise of social work: that intervention can, literally, save lives. Such policies offer some prospect of breaking the downward spiral of lost parental authority, failure at school and criminal behaviour. If society is not prepared to pay the cost of such measures, then there is nothing else to do but to wring our hands.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OPERA SAYS PICKETS WON'T STOP HORNE PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> The performance of mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne will go on as scheduled Saturday  despite apparent commitments from electricians and stagehands to honor a picket  line by disaffected wig makers and makeup artists, the San Diego Opera Company  said Tuesday. But if orchestra musicians refuse to cross the picket line, the  following weekend's production of "Madama Butterfly" may be in jeopardy.  </P> <P> "We are not going to cancel the Horne recital," opera spokeswoman Brenda Hughes  said. "No matter what happens, we will do it. There are ways we can do it with  or without a backstage crew."  </P> <P> The picket line outside the Civic Theatre by the International Alliance of  Theatrical and Stage Employees Local 706, wig makers and makeup artists, will  be honored by stagehands and electricians for its duration, said William McLure  of IATSE Local 122, stagehands and electricians.  </P> <P> Members of the stagehands local are responsible for raising the curtain, moving  the piano on stage and operating the theater's lights.  </P> <P> "They need a crew to set (the recital) up, of course," said McLure, business  manager of Local 122. "As long as those pickets from hair and makeup are there,  we're going to honor them. We're not going halfway. It is indeed a bona fide  picket line. . . . In our contract with the opera, there is a clause that  allows us to honor pickets of this nature. We know we're doing the right  thing."  </P> <P> Joe Pallazola, president of Local 325, American Federation of Musicians, said  it is up to the discretion of individual opera musicians whether or not to  honor the picket lines, but added "We think they will."  </P> <P> This weekend's performance by Horne requires only piano accompaniment while  "Madama Butterly" requires a full orchestra. The first orchestra rehearsal for  "Madama Butterfly" is scheduled for Friday.  </P> <P> The wig makers and make-up artists, who began picketing Monday, are protesting  the withdrawal Dec. 15 of contracts for the 1989 season. An  unfair-labor-practices petition has been filed with the National Labor  Relations Board.  </P> <P> McLure and Howard Smit, business manager of the wig makers and makeup artists  local, met Monday with Gregory Hirsch, the opera's director of productions, and  said they were close to an agreement before the talks disintegrated.  </P> <P> Because stagehands refused to cross the picket line Monday, the opera could not  unload the scenery for its production of "Madama Butterfly," scheduled to open  April 15.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, members of Local 905, wardrobe attendants, also refused to cross  the picket line to do costume work for "Madama Butterfly." A spokesman for  Local 325 of the American Federation of Musicians said his union was studying  whether it would also honor the picket line for Friday's first "Madama  Butterfly" rehearsal with the orchestra.  </P> <P> "If all those people are going to honor it, it's a big problem for the opera,"  the spokesman said.  </P></p>

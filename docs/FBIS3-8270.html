			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (TANJUG)--Apart from expelling  Serbs from its territory, Germany is gathering Moslem refugees  to organize their departure for the ex-Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina to join the Bosnian Moslem Army.    Citing Bosnian Serb military sources, the news agency of the  Bosnian Serb Republic (RS)--SRNA, says that the German  authorities are in this way getting rid of the Moslem refugees  and, at the same time, enabling the Moslem side to take better  military positions in the almost two-year civil war in Bosnia.    It is clear, a Bosnian Serb military statement said, that  the  entire action was completely agreed by Bonn and the Moslem  authorities in Sarajevo and is carried out in synchronization  with Bonn's and Washington's efforts to re-establish the  Moslem-Croat military and diplomatic coalition with unconcealed  anti-Serb intentions.    The Bosnian Croats and Moslems, former allies against the  Bosnian Serbs, clashed a year ago over territories with a mixed  population.    Last week the two sides met in Washington, at the insistence  of the United States, and signed a draft agreement on setting up  a joint federation in Bosnia and a subsequent confederation with  neighbouring Croatia.    On Monday Germany announced it would begin expelling 100,000  people with Yugoslav passports who are illegally in Germany.</p>

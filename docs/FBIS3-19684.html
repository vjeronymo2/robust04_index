			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "FDP Fighting Over Coalition </F> Statement"]    [Text] Bonn -- A week after the defeat in the Lower Saxony  Landtag elections, a controversy has erupted within the Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] over its coalition statement  for the Bundestag elections. At the weekend, several leading  FDP politicians demanded that the party make a quick statement  in favor of its current coalition partner, the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU].    At the Hesse FDP party conference in Melsungen, land  Chairman  Wolfgang Gerhardt warned his party not to "behave like a flock  of chickens and ask about a new coalition," following the  party's failure to pass the 5-percent hurdle in the Lower Saxony  elections. The FDP cannot make politics with the "old Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]." Bundestag Group Chairman  Hermann-Otto Solms also spoke out clearly against an alliance  with the SPD. Speaking to DIE WELT, Solms said he cannot  imagine any other coalition than the existing one. This is  clearly the position of the majority within the FDP. A final  decision can, however, only be made by the party conference in  September.    Juergen Moellemann, chairman of the biggest FDP land  organization in North Rhine-Westphalia, on the other hand,  called upon his party to free itself from the "downward trend of  the CDU/CSU." The FDP will have to sharpen its own profile over  the next few months. The former economics minister said that  stopping the "soaring public indebtedness" must have top  priority at the moment. FDP presidential candidate Hildegard  Hamm-Bruecher made a statement to similar effect. Speaking on  Deutschlandfunk radio, she warned against a "complete"  commitment for an alliance with the CDU/CSU. The FDP must not  "get itself into a cul-de-sac." If the election results are  accordingly, the Bonn coalition should be continued. But the FDP  must also take responsibility in the event of other  constellations, be it as opposition or in a coalition with a  different partner.    FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel demanded an end to the coalition  debate. The party must not let itself be driven into an early  commitment. Yet, in the upcoming election campaigns, the FDP  will have to draw a more distinct line to its partner in  government.    CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble has  urged  the FDP to make a quick coalition statement in favor of the  CDU/CSU. The Lower Saxony land parliament elections have shown  that an unclear position about its future course has disastrous  effects on the FDP, Schaeuble said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- The main opposition  Democratic Party [DP], deciding Friday to suspend the  parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae scandal, called on  the government and the ruling party to change their attitude  toward the probe into allegations of political fund abuse.    Depending on whether the government and the Democratic  Liberal Party [DLP] change their stance, the DP said it would  publicly condemn, or bring suits against, those involved in the  scandal.    The opposition party also threatened to publish the records  of investigations by the prosecution or the military as  newspaper advertisements, taking the case directly to the people.    The decision was made at a meeting of the party's supreme  council presided over by Chairman Yi Ki-taek Friday morning.    The meeting concluded it was meaningless to pursue the  National Assembly investigation into the scam because of the  government's and the DLP's non-cooperative attitude, especially  in checking out official documents and tracing checks, sources  said.    Consequently, the parliamentary investigation that started  May 21 was suspended nine days early. The National Assembly had  originally decided to conduct the probe until June 19.    The DP had demanded the investigation, claiming that a  construction company owned by Cho Ki-hyon created a slush fund  out of profits it made from a defense contract. The opposition  party alleges that part of the fund was funnelled into the  ruling party during the 1992 presidential election.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the rapid growth rule was not mandated by any statute, the history of the present brokered deposit regulation involves two statutes, FIRREA and FDICIA. In 1989, FIRREA amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), prohibiting an undercapitalized institution from accepting funds obtained, directly or indirectly, by or through any deposit broker for deposit into one or more deposit accounts except upon specific application to, and waiver of the prohibition by, the FDIC. Section 224 of FIRREA, adding section 29 to the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831f. In addition to deposits obtained through the mediation of third-party brokers, the definition of ``brokered deposits'' included deposits on which an institution offers or has agreed to pay rates of interest that are ``significantly'' higher than the prevailing rates of interest offered by other depository institutions with the same type of charter in the first institution's normal market area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two years later, the FDI Act was amended again. This time, FDICIA rewrote section 29 of the Act to restrict the acceptance of brokered deposits by certain institutions on the basis of their capital levels. Section 301 of FDICIA, amending section 29 of the FDI Act and adding section 29A thereto, 12 U.S.C. 1831f, 1831f-1. According to FDICIA and the brokered deposit regulation implementing it, 12 CFR 337.6, undercapitalized institutions may not accept brokered deposits at all, and adequately capitalized institutions must obtain a waiver from the FDIC before they can accept brokered deposits. Further, FDICIA limits the interest rates which adequately capitalized institutions can pay on brokered deposits. Well-capitalized insured depository institutions, however, can accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits without first obtaining a waiver from the FDIC, and without being limited in the interest rates they can pay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to these restrictions on brokered deposits, FDICIA also established a comprehensive regulatory scheme for insured depository institutions based on their capital levels. Section 131 of FDICIA, adding section 38 to the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831o. Under the ``prompt corrective action'' provisions of FDICIA, the statute places severe constraints on what undercapitalized institutions can do, including severe restrictions on asset growth. As explained in the regulation which implements section 131 of FDICIA, 12 CFR 308.200 ff. and 325.101 ff., and which took effect on December 19, 1992, as soon as a bank receives notice, or is deemed to have received notice, that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, the bank must restrict the growth of its assets as set forth in section 38(e)(3) of the FDI Act. That section of the Act states that an undercapitalized insured depository institution shall not permit its average total assets during any calendar quarter to exceed its average total assets during the preceding calendar quarter unless: (1) The appropriate Federal banking agency has accepted the institution's capital restoration plan; (2) any increase in total assets is consistent with the plan; and (3) the institution's ratio of tangible equity to assets increases during the calendar quarter at a rate sufficient to enable the institution to become adequately capitalized within a reasonable time. 12 U.S.C. 1831o(e)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the above statutes and regulations, the FDIC is considering whether there is a continuing need for the rapid growth rule. Under the rule, the FDIC, upon being informed by a bank that it is about to undergo rapid growth, can engage the institution in a dialog as to whether such growth would be prudent and should be pursued. Under the brokered deposit and prompt corrective action regulations, restrictions on brokered deposits and rapid growth attach automatically to certain banks having an insufficient capital level. Thus, although the rapid growth rule operates somewhat differently from the brokered deposit and prompt corrective action regulations, the rapid growth rule may no longer be necessary given the existence of those other two regulations. For this reason, the FDIC is proposing that the rapid growth rule be rescinded. This action will ease the regulatory burden on those institutions now subject to all three rules. (If the FDIC rescinds the rapid growth rule, 12 CFR 304.6, it will also rescind the line on the table in 12 CFR 304.7, which pertains to the Office of Management and Budget's Control Number for the rapid growth rule.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the rapid growth rule overlaps the brokered deposit regulation and the prompt corrective action regulation, this overlap is only partial. For instance, rescinding the rapid growth rule would mean that an insured bank would no longer have to notify the FDIC before it either solicited fully insured deposits outside its normal trade area, or when it acquired secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements, if one or a combination of both of these activities were designed to increase the bank's assets by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month period. And while a well-capitalized bank planning to accept brokered deposits on a large scale would no longer have to inform the FDIC of this fact in advance once the rapid growth rule was rescinded, that bank still must report the amount of brokered money it has accepted after the fact in its quarterly Report of Condition and Income (``call report''). Also, deposit brokers must continue to register with the FDIC, and, if requested, could be required to provide data on the extent of a given bank's brokered deposit activities, under the brokered deposit regulation. If the rapid growth rule were rescinded, some of the rapid growth resulting from rapid growth rule activities would continue to be detected by the FDIC's Growth Monitoring System (a system administered by the FDIC's Division of Supervision which identifies rapid growth over a single quarter in assets or loans and long-term securities and any related deterioration in key performance ratios), some rapid growth would be controlled or prohibited by the brokered deposit rule, and some would be prohibited by the regulation on prompt corrective action, but a small part of rapid growth might not be controlled or detected at all. Thus, comment is sought on whether the rescission of the rapid growth rule would create a regulatory gap that would have harmful effects on banking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Leading Article: More rubbish Recycling household rubbish may be environmentally damaging. It can also be very expensive. Those are the clear messages of yesterday's report by the UK parliamentary select committee on the environment. They are long overdue and need a response. Recycling is one of the UK government's most popular environmental policies. People love to be told that their efforts can save the planet. Children, inspired by school projects and television programmes, insist their parents take bottles to the bottle bank rather than sneaking them into the bin. The case for recycling metals, particularly aluminium, is well established, according to the waste industry. Metals can be easily extracted from rubbish tips with magnets and melted down. But some recycling may well consume more natural resources, particularly energy, than it saves. The virtues of recycling glass and paper are not always clear cut. The case for recycling plastics, despite technological improvements, is hotly disputed. Such calculations are complex. They depend partly on assumptions about energy consumed in collecting waste. They also depend on the value assigned to conserving resources, be they renewable, like trees, or not. Such estimates should still be made. If there is no environmental benefit, there is no reason to pay the considerable costs of some recycling schemes. In the government's attempt to devise a policy on waste disposal, it has failed to make thorough comparisons of the environmental merits of the rival methods: recycling, landfill, and incineration. Nor, in urging people to minimise waste, has it estimated the costs of doing so. It is in danger of adding an expensive - and quite probably counter-productive - strand to its environmental policy.</p>

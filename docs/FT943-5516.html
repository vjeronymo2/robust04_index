			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Ferry ban 'may cost farmers Pounds 200m' British farmers could face lost sales of up to Pounds 200m a year as ferry companies impose a ban on carrying live animals destined for slaughter to the Continent, according to Mr Richard Beale, chairman of the Association of Livestock Exporters. He said: 'If the trade doesn't continue, we really are in a terrible pickle.' A ban by Stena Sealink on live animal exports came into force on Thursday. Brittany Ferries had already said it would stop transporting animals to Continental slaughter houses and Peninsular and Oriental said it would impose a ban on October 1. There is no alternative to shipping - livestock is banned from the Channel tunnel. Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, will hold urgent talks with the ferry companies on Monday to try to avert the ban. The livestock industry is negotiating a new code of practice for transporting animals, and farmers hope that will defuse the situation. The effects of the ferry companies' action are already being felt in the livestock markets. Mr John Astley, a sheep farmer on Anglesey in north Wales, said he tried to sell 50 lambs yesterday in his local market of Gaerwen, but could only sell 30. He said: 'It's the first time in the season when I've found no buyers.' September and October are the peak sales months for many hill and marginal farmers, who sell their lambs for further fattening before they are slaughtered. About 20 per cent of these lambs, or 20m sheep a year, would usually be exported live to France and Spain. But public complaints about the way animals are treated en route have led to the ferry companies's curbs. Mr Tim Bennett, a Welsh farmer who chairs the hill farmers' committee at the NFU, said: 'This has come at the worst possible time of year. If farmers lose their ability to move large numbers of stock now it will have a considerable effect on the domestic market price.' Mr Astley said that prices at his local market had already fallen 15p a kilogramme to 80p for lambs. 'That's getting to a serious level, below that it doesn't really pay to market the lambs,' he said. Farmers are trying to develop trade in animal carcasses to compensate for live animal deliveries, but French consumers are keen to buy fresh meat slaughtered locally. British farmers fear that if they are prevented from filling orders animals from eastern European or elsewhere will fill the gap. Sir David urged caution on farmers who threatened to blockade ferry ports. He said: 'Confrontational action of this sort will only alienate public support.'</p>

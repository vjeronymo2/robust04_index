			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Observer: Has-been Latest word on the Topic screen from Alliance Resources, the small US oil and gas producer, whose flotation on the London stock market has been more turbulent than most. 'The word 'been' was omitted from line two of yesterday's announcement: Alliance Resources wishes to announce that John O'Brien has been resigned as a director and chairman of the company as of 12.10.92. Alliance is in the process of seeking a qualified non-executive director as chairman.' Presumably one who can speak English properly as well.</p>

Will your  commission make a statement about this at the next session of  Parliament?    [Natadze] The views of our commission have indeed been  ignored during the process of negotiations concerning the  Abkhazian conflict. As we are unable to participate in the work  of the Georgian delegation, it is natural that we will not be  able to have any influence on the results of the negotiations.  As regards making a statement in Parliament, the commission has  specific plans but a statement will be made not on behalf of the  commission but by ordinary parliamentarians.    [Kurdovanidze] Batono Nodar, your attitude to this document  is well known. Could you comment briefly?    [Natadze] Our defeat in Abkhazia is possibly a double  defeat: first de facto, second de jure. De facto, everything  that could have been lost has already been lost except for the  upper part of the Dali gorge. We gain nothing from a  cease-fire; only in the Kodori gorge can there be a temporary  cease-fire. Yet, this will also not be a victory because  signing the treaty will not prevent the opposing side from  engaging in warfare. As for the legal side, up to now, we had  not lost; however, with this document, we have lost badly. Its  signature means that the Georgian state is capitulating not only  on the military front but also from the legal standpoint. It  surrenders the most important defense barrier that we have in  this sphere.    [Kurdovanidze] Batono Nodar, this document was preceded by  eight agreements that were signed by the Georgian delegation.  Is not the agreement of 14 May the logical result of that  policy that has been conducted by the Georgian authorities over  the last two years?    [Natadze] Of course. This is the logical escalation of our  policy of capitulation. However, I wish to emphasize that the  deterioration of our position and the development of the  scenario do not come to an end with the signing of this  document. The scenario embraces the following stages: When the  Russian Army arrives on the left and right banks of the Enguri  River and occupies a zone stretching approximately 20  kilometers, they will be given the chance to work on the  citizens in the way they want. It is clear in what way this  will be. They will try to activate those people who are  dissatisfied with the government's policy and form an armed  opposition, which will lead, if not to a civil war, then to  civil strife and slaughter. Then, they will succeed in  spreading tension to Poti. As soon as this happens, at the  invitation of the authorities or even without it, they will  enter Poti and occupy it. The whole scenario is developing in  such a way that the Russians will occupy Poti. Why are they  interested in doing this? Because, by taking Poti, they will  cut off not only Georgia but also Armenia and Azerebaijan and  the whole of Central Asia beyond the Caucasus from the ocean.  In this way, the plan to create a West-East corridor will be  thwarted for some time. Russia, on the other hand, will  continue to exert total influence upon both the Caucasus and the  whole of Central Asia. I do not exclude that, as early as two  years ago, before the war in Abkhazia had begun, the wholly  despicable campaign in Zugdidi and Tsalenjikha had been aimed at  preparing the psychological ground for the future experiment  with Poti.    The arguments presented by E. Shevardnadze that we need this  document because Russia is powerful and we cannot resolve this  problem without it, does not signify in any way that the problem  will be solved following its intervention. It is possible that,  on this occasion also, Russia will deceive us. The head of  state likewise does not exclude this. Then, what is the point  of trying something for the sixth time that has been attempted  five times before? It turns out that Shevardnadze expects the  Russians to go against what is written in the document.  However, I view this to be naive.    [Kurdovanidze] That is to say, you believe that the  government's and E. Shevardnadze's policy toward the Abkhazian  problem cannot stand up to any criticism. Do you not think that  one way of recovering Abkhazia is for the head of state to  resign?    [Natadze] Shevardnadze is unable to govern Georgia. First  of all, he cannot control the internal situation. He is unable  to combat the wave of criminal gangs [bandokratia] and the  economic collapse against which a struggle could be launched and  is unable to create an army, which could be done very well. E.  Shevardnadze is able to resolve diplomatic and political  problems better than others and, therefore, his departure from  the political arena would not be advantageous. Shevardnadze is  of such value to us that we can pay a high price for him, but  not any price. Consequently, it is necessary to limit  considerably his powers. As regards the internal government of  the country, these functions should be transferred to more than  one person. The Georgian Government's policy toward Russia has  been one of capitulation from beginning to end and, in reality,  disadvantageous to us. It is necessary for Russia to have a  Georgian leader who is sympathetically disposed toward it and a  government that is willing to please. Therefore, they will do  everything to ensure that Georgia has a pro-Russian government.    [Kurdovanidze] Batono Nodar, does the parliamentary minority  have a concrete plan of action regarding this question?    [Natadze] Today, in Parliament, there is no longer so much  importance attached to how much support this or that position  receives or to what extend it is well argued and how sound it is  in essence because, in a crisis situation, support mechanisms  change and, in the end, the greater part of the deputies in  Parliament will adopt that position that it considers expedient.  The session held on 13 May clearly showed us that Shevardnadze's  position is extremely weak. As soon as it was demonstrated that  the head of state was unable to hold the views that he used to,  his blind followers began to abandon their positions like rats  fleeing a sinking ship. For example, a meeting of the Union of  Georgia's Citizens (I would call it the Union of Slaves) was  held on Sunday that was designed from the start to be an  extravagant congress, but few people turned up. I would call  this meeting "Walpurgis morning" as the witches gathered in the  morning instead of at night. Thus, we can use the following  words to characterize Shevardnadze's policy -- collaborationist  and puppet-like in its status.</p>

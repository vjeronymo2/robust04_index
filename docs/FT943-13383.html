			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Most charities to benefit from eased accounts rules Most charities will face lighter accounting requirements under proposals of a voluntary sector deregulation taskforce which were accepted by the government yesterday. Charities with an annual income of less than Pounds 10,000 will in future satisfy their legal obligations by producing simplified trustees' annual reports and accounts in line with Charity Commission guidance. More than 90 per cent of charity income goes to the biggest 10 per cent of charities, and some two-thirds of the sector will benefit from being able to produce simpler reports and accounts. Ministers have also agreed in principle that the income threshold at which bigger charities' accounts must be audited rather than independently examined should rise from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000. The government has fully or partially accepted 72 of 189 recommendations in the taskforce's report. A further 60 are under review. Recommendations accepted cover a wide range of issues, from easing restrictions on obtaining permits for charitable collections to agreeing to clarify the application of health and safety legislation to village halls and community centres. Ministers intend to extend the small-business litmus test - under which the likely impact on small businesses is taken into account before new regulations are framed - to include the effect on charities. Britain's voluntary sector has a turnover of about Pounds 16bn a year and faces many of the same regulation issues as business. The government wants charities to play a growing role in delivering services under contract to public authorities, and hopes that the changes accepted yesterday will lead to increased efficiency. There will however be disappointment in the sector about recommendations the government has rejected. A call to lessen the restrictions on trustees' scope to invest funds has been turned down, although the Treasury said it is 'considering the case for reform'. Charities made little progress in their efforts to to raise the problems faced from a Pounds 335m annual bill for irrecoverable value added tax.</p>

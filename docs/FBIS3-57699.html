			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No 18 (508) for </F> 27 January 1994]    [Text] Ukraine will take every step to preserve its  territorial integrity if the new Crimean president attempts to  redraw the borders and violate the Helsinki agreements, head of  the Ukrainian president's service for domestic policy Nikolay  Mikhalechenko told Interfax.    "If the law on the president of Crimea goes against the  constitutions of Ukraine and Crimea -- too bad for this law," he  said. He also stated that the provisions of this law must be  brought in accordance with Ukrainian and Crimean legislation.  "Otherwise, this law will be considered anti-constitutional," he  said.    According to the law on the president of Crimea, the  president shall have the right to appoint the prosecutor  general, chairman of the security service and interior minister,  and control the operations of the Ukrainian army in Crimea.    To quote Mikhalechenko, the law on the delimitation of  powers  between the Ukrainian and Crimean bodies of state authority  envisages consultations on the Ukrainian policy in Crimea, and  on the appointment of the prosecutor general, the head of the  security service and the commander of the national guard.  "Consultations with the parliament, not the president," he said.    He described Russia's approach to the Crimean problems as  "carefully weighed-out and realistic." "If a realistic policy  is implemented, we shall solve the problem of the Black Sea  Fleet, and Russian citizens will be able to spend their holidays  in Crimea," he said.    Candidate to the post of Crimean president and leader of the  Crimean Republican Party Yuriy Meshkov told a press conference  in Sevastopol that the results of the first round of elections  (during which he scored 38.5% of the votes -- Interfax) "are the  choice of the people who have lost hope and for whom Russia is  the only source of inspiration." "This is not a manifestation  of nationalism," he said.    Meshkov believes that the simultaneous holding of the second  round of presidential elections in the Crimea, the referendum on  the Crimea's status, and the parliamentary elections in Ukraine  and Crimea should be held simultaneously on March 27 to save  expenses. As we have reported already, the second round of  presidential elections in Crimea is scheduled for January 30.    Meshkov also said that there would be no complications  between Ukraine and Crimea. "The idea of the referendum does  not imply Crimea's secession from Ukraine. Neither does it  imply any redrawing of the borders between Ukraine and Russia,"  he continued. What is actually meant here is the right to take  decisions in the sphere of Crimea's economic and cultural  relations with Russia, Ukraine and other countries  independently, he said. "It is extremely dangerous to adhere to  the old policy of Crimea's rigid dependence on Ukraine. We can  tackle many of our problems on our own," he said.    To quote Meshkov, measures are taken to establish contacts  with the Kiev authorities. "Our representative has already met  with the Ukrainian leaders," he said.    He pointed out that Russia treated the developments in  Crimea  normally. "A hostile attitude to Crimea on the part of Boris  Yeltsin is absolutely ruled out. Time will show what his normal  attitude will be like," he said.    He noted that he shared the position of the Kuchma-Grinyov  bloc because it advocated normal relations between Ukraine and  Russia.</p>

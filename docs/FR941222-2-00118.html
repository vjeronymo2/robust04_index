L. 103&hyph;325 (12 U.S.C. 4806) (the Act), which was signed into law on September 23, 1994, requires the OCC, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Board (Federal banking agencies) and the National Credit Union Administration to establish an independent internal appellate process. This process must be available to review material supervisory determinations made at insured depository institutions or credit unions that the agency supervises. Section 309(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 4806(c)) requires that each Federal banking agency must provide public notice and opportunity for comment on its proposed guidelines for this appellate process by December 22, 1994, and establish this process by March 22, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act defines ``independent appellate process'' in section 309(f)(2) (12 U.S.C. 4806(f)(2)) as a review by an agency official who does not directly or indirectly report to the agency official who made the material supervisory determination under review. In addition, this Act defines ``material supervisory determinations'' in section 309(f)(1) (12 U.S.C. 4806(f)(1)) to include determinations relating to (1) examination ratings, (2) the adequacy of loan loss reserve provisions, and (3) loan classifications on loans that are significant to an institution. This definition expressly excludes determinations to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution or a decision to take prompt corrective action pursuant to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) (12 U.S.C. 1831o).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 309(g) (12 U.S.C. 4806(g)) expressly provides that the Act's requirement to establish an appeals process does not affect the authority of the banking agencies to take enforcement or supervisory actions against an institution. Finally, section 309(b) (12 U.S.C. 4906(b)) of the Act requires that appeals be heard and decided expeditiously and that appropriate safeguards exist for protecting the appellant from retaliation by agency examiners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Existing OCC Appeals Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OCC's existing procedures for national banks to appeal agency decisions and actions were published in Banking Circular No. 272, dated June 11, 1993. These procedures have been modified and clarified in the proposed guidelines to be consistent with the requirements of the Act. Until these guidelines are published in final form in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the current OCC appeals policy as set forth in Banking Circular No. 272 remains in effect. The OCC's appeals policy does not supersede any existing appeals procedures available under current law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

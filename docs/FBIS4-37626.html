			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>   [Excerpts] There has been a warming in relations between  Israel and the Muslim countries of southeast Asia. Foreign  Ministry officials from Bangladesh and Pakistan secretly visited  Israel several weeks ago. Sources at the Israeli Foreign  Ministry, however, do not expect the imminent establishment of  diplomatic relations. Our political correspondent Imanu'el  Rosen reports:    Bangladesh, a calamity-stricken Islamic country in southeast  Asia, is one of the poorest countries in the world. Several  weeks ago, an economic delegation from Bangladesh held a secret  visit to Israel. This came a short time after a visit by a  senior foreign ministry official from Dacca. Senior Israeli  foreign ministry officials have expressed the assessment that  Bangladesh, out of all the Islamic countries in southeast Asia,  is the closest to establishing ties, perhaps even diplomatic  relations, with Israel. However, even Prime Minister Khaleda  Zia's government prefers to move slowly and cautiously while  maintaining clandestine ties.    Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, cooled  off relations with Israel after the public meeting between  President Suharto and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Although  the two countries have economic and other ties, these activities  remain covert.    Despite the fact that Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto  still refuses to meet Israeli leaders in public, she permitted a  senior foreign ministry official from Karachi to visit Jerusalem  several weeks ago and meet with the prime minister and foreign  minister. [passage omitted]    Even Afghanistan is in the picture; however, meetings  between  its representatives and Israeli officials have been limited to  the United Nations building until now.    Back in Jerusalem, foreign ministry officials assert that  all  the meetings so far have been with low-level officials, not with  ministers or heads of state. Nevertheless, Muslim southeast  Asia is moving closer to Israel.</p>

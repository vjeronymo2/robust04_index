			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Low-cost pensions firm suspended Investors interested in the low cost fee-based pensions service, Discount Pensions, offered by independent advisers Campbell Financial Services will be perturbed to hear than the company was this week suspended from doing investment business by Fimbra. The reason for the suspension is technical; the company failed to demonstrate that it had the required financial resources for its category. The company sprung into prominence when it offered a cheap Pounds 199 service to arrange pensions using a Freephone number, at the expense of in-depth advice and on-going service. But this novel move brought a sharp reaction from other advisers, with the police being brought in to deal with abusive telephone calls to the company. A statement last night from chairman David Cramer stated that the companies had been in discussion with Fimbra over its accounts. These were now being recast to meet Fimbra's requirements. He expected the suspension to be lifted shortly, but meanwhile the Freephone service has been suspended. Since the company is not authorised to handle client's money, investors should have made out any cheques to the life company and so there is no concern over lost money.</p>

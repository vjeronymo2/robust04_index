The minister does not have the  feeling that he could move around freely in that country,  explained his spokesman.    Pronk had intended to travel from southern Sudan to  resistance groups in the Nuba Mountains, but he was denied  permission to land there in a light aircraft. Last year, Pronk  visited the Nuba Mountains, but on that occasion the journey was  under government control. When he returned to the Netherlands,  Pronk let it be known that the human rights situation in the  Nuba Mountains had improved.    Quite a different conclusion was reached by a Hungarian  rapporteur for the UN Committee on Human Rights, Mr. Gaspar Biro  [name as published]. The Sudanese Government is furious about  the report, which was discussed this week in the UN Committee  and is accusing Biro of blasphemy, but the European Union  praised his sound, impartial report. Pronk informed the  Sudanese ambassador this week that the Netherlands also  supported the Biro report.    Already during his last visit, Pronk had asked whether he  himself might come into contact with the leaders of the various  parties to the conflict in the south. This morning, Pronk  informed Sudanese Ambassador Siddiq of his decision to call off  the trip. During their conversation, the minister said he would  not give up in his attempts to act as a mediator in the civil  war.</p>

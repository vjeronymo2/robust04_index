			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: UAL backs latest workers bid The latest bid by workers at United Airlines to take a majority stake in the US carrier cleared its biggest hurdle when the company's board voted to back the deal. The board decided late on Tuesday to accept an offer for between 53 per cent and 63 per cent of the company in return for wage cuts and changes in working practices which it valued at more than Dollars 4.5bn. An earlier union proposal was rejected by the UAL board a month ago. CS First Boston, financial adviser, estimated that offer at Dollars 140 a share and said it did not provide adequate value to shareholders. The sweetened offer was judged fair by financial advisers, First Boston and Lazard Freres, the company said. It has been valued at Dollars 173 a share by the unions, but UAL has not put a value to it. Mr Stephen Wolf, UAL chairman and chief executive, said: 'For the first time, majority interest in a global air carrier will rest with its employees. United's employees will share in the company's success and will have substantial incentive to ensure that UAL remains a global aviation leader.' Mr Wolf, and Mr John Pope, president and chief operating officer, are due to step down once the deal is completed. The deal needs the approval of the two unions with which it was negotiated, as well as UAL's shareholders.</p>

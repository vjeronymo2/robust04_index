			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Zurich Sandoz, which acquired the Gerber baby foods group earlier this year, reports maiden half-year profit figures on Thursday. The US pharmaceuticals subsidiary of the chemicals, drugs and nutrition combine withdrew voluntarily the lactation-suppression indication of its drug, Parlodel, last week to end what the group called 'unwarranted criticism'. Swiss brokers are looking for a 10 per cent rise in net profits to around SFr940m. They say that turnover has been flat in Swiss franc terms but that Sandoz had a SFr100m extraordinaries item at this stage last year.</p>

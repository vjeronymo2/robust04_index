			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Air France - a revenue problem Sir, While I agree with much of your editorial, 'Flight plan for Air France' (July 25), I believe some factors need more emphasis. The wise men's report indicated that costs and staff productivity at Air France were similar to those at British Airways, although some suspect that the latter's costs are also higher than they should be. An earlier report to the Commission showed Air France's air crew as 12 per cent more productive, and its recovery plan includes a reduction of 1,300 flying staff. Figures for 1992, published by the Association of European Airlines, show that, if Air France had secured the same revenue rate on its domestic network as did British Airways, it would have earned Dollars 828m more. Many of the French domestic routes are unprofitable, often because the traffic is very low. Where government considers they are vital to the regional economies, they should be subsidised separately, after the lowest bidder has been selected. Good domestic air links are a vital factor in securing foreign investment in the regions, a point overlooked in the UK as domestic air links to Heathrow are run down. On the London-Paris route between 1990 and 1993, the sterling on-demand fare rose 32.5 per cent, whereas the franc fare rose 13 per cent. British Airways' highly sophisticated yield control computers also enabled it to secure a much larger share of the passengers paying the higher fares. The Air France recovery plan includes 'a performance yield management system', and this is the vital tool to extort the maximum possible amount from the on-demand passengers in particular. Generally, I suspect, the problems are as much on the revenue as the cost side. And in making profitability comparisons, one should not overlook the advantage conferred by the low rents paid by BA for the nearly 6m sq ft of premises at Heathrow, which were set out in the January 1987 prospectus. For example, until 2005, the annual rent for the 629,500 sq ft cargo centre is Pounds 239,710, that is 38p per sq ft. Net of services, similar nearby buildings are priced at about Pounds 15 per sq ft. A J Lucking, 20/17 Broad Court, London WC2B 5QN</p>

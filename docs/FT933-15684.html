			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / British Gas admits pipeline price rises may be too high BRITISH GAS admitted yesterday that it could have got its pipeline charges wrong and withdrew increases of up to 30 per cent proposed only a month ago. The admission marks a spectacular U-turn for the company just three weeks before the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is due to report on the future of the UK gas industry. British Gas recently defended the price rises, which ranged from 2 per cent to 30 per cent and were to be levied on rival suppliers which send gas through the group's pipelines to industrial customers. The change of tone has been seen as evidence by some industry observers that the company is worried about the commission's likely verdict on the gas industry. The commission could suggest British Gas lose its monopoly over household gas supply and propose that the group hive off its pipeline operations. The commission is also due to recommend a rate of return on the pipeline operations which will affect charges. The government, which must decide whether to implement any of the commission's recommendations, is believed to favour the introduction of competition unless there are very strong arguments against. It also wants British Gas to make the links between its pipelines division and its marketing operations clearer. This could be achieved by dividing them into distinct subsidiaries within the group or by setting them up as separate concerns. British Gas said yesterday that it would delay the implementation of the proposed price rises until October next year while it examines the potential for cutting them. Mr Harry Moulson, who takes over next Tuesday as managing director of British Gas's transportation business, said the group was responding to pressure from rivals. 'I looked at these price increases and said I don't believe I can live and fight in this marketplace on this basis,' he said. He said British Gas would talk with rival suppliers, after which it could revise the proposed rises. However, it will go ahead with an increase in October of 3.5 per cent, which is based on inflation and other considerations. Mr Norman Ellis, managing director at Kinetica, one of British Gas's main rivals, said: 'The increases are completely unacceptable whether they are implemented now or later.' Mr Ellis has made a formal complaint about the charges to Ofgas, the industry regulator which has challenged the basis of the price increases and asked the group to justify them. British Gas said it would publish additional information on its cost base to justify the price rises.</p>

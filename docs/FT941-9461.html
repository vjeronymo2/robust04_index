			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Post-graduates 'underused' by industry Industry is being held back in the fast-changing areas of science and technology by its low employment of post-graduate engineers and scientists, a report said yesterday. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research compared British and German companies and said that British employers were concerned that post-graduates were too specialised and less likely than first-degree graduates to acquire commercial and practical skills. UK companies' limited use of post-graduates was also a result of 'the relatively slow growth, by international standards, in British manufacturing investment in research and development'. The institute also warned that under-employment of highly qualified personnel by many British companies put them at a disadvantage against foreign rivals. It pointed out, however, that a strength of the British higher education system - in contrast to Germany - was its production of young first-degree graduates whose abilities (although not academic standards) were often the equal of older German graduates. The institute looked at the chemicals and engineering sectors. In engineering, it identified close links between the German industry's greater employment of technical post-graduates and its superior performance in product and process innovations, with benefits for the country's export competitiveness. The German advantage, it said, is particularly marked in the high-speed machinery sector but less so in chemicals.

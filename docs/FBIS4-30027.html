			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on 30 May interview with Deputy Prime Minister Tran </F> Duc Luong by QUAN DOI NHAN DAN correspondents Thuy Chi and Hong  Ky in Hanoi]    [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong met with  newsmen on 30 May in Hanoi after his 10-day visit to the United  States from 18 to 28 May. He answered many questions from our  correspondents:    [Correspondent] Dear Deputy Prime Minister, how do U.S.  businessmen view the opportunities for doing business and  investing in Vietnam?    [Tran Duc Luong] The U.S. business circle has admitted that  Vietnam, with a population of more than 72 million, is a large  market. The country also has a favorable position as a country  in a fast developing economic region. During previous years,  the U.S. business community took the lead in demanding that the  U.S. Government normalize relations with Vietnam. At present,  U.S. companies are continuing to request the government to  normalize relations with Vietnam as soon as possible and to  grant it the most favored nation status so that they can have  favorable conditions for doing business in Vietnam.    [Correspondent] Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, could you  elaborate on the areas of great potential in cooperation between  the U.S. and Vietnam?    [Tran Duc Luong] The U.S. companies are paying keen interest  in all projects to which Vietnam wants to attract foreign  investment, especially projects related to oil and gas,  telecommunications, and electronic and computer items. While  U.S. industrial companies are paying keen interest in the  Vietnamese market, various prestigious financial and banking  agencies in the U.S. say they will send representatives to  Vietnam soon.    The eight Vietnamese businessmen who accompanied me had  separate meetings with their U.S. counterparts and have reached  initial agreement on some areas, including plans to export a  large amount of rice to the U.S., the exploitation of oil and  gas in Vietnam, and the opening of direct flights between the  two countries.    [Correspondent] Is the U.S. business sector raising any  obstacles at all regarding doing business and investing in  Vietnam?    [Tran Duc Luong] In our meeting with U.S. businessmen, we  presented both sides of our situation. We not only told them  about the potential and prospects in the Vietnamese markets, but  also frankly briefed them on the difficulties and restrictions  in doing business in our country. For example, our  infrastructure is poor, our legal system is not yet perfect, and  our economic cadres and state management mechanism are not  effective because we have not yet firmly grasped the functions  and activities of the market economy. U.S. businessmen who have  visited Vietnam understand the difficulties currently faced by  our country. They said that these are immediate difficulties  that Vietnam can overcome and then step by step improve and  perfect the business and investment situation in the country.    [Correspondent] What is your appraisal of the potential of  Vietnam-U.S. relations?    [Tran Duc Luong] In the past, the U.S. Government drew a  road  map for the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations and the U.S.  Government has affirmed that it will continue with this road  map. During our meetings with authorized U.S. officials, we  asked whether the U.S. has a new road map or timetable for the  normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations, to which they answered  that the two countries are advancing on the road to normal  relations and toward the direction of building a good  relationship and mutual understanding. I think that,  strategically, both countries have realized that it is essential  to establish normal relations so as to advance toward building a  sincere friendship and cooperation in a constructive spirit.  This is the unswerving and principled stand of both sides. In  addition, both sides will hold more meetings in the near future  to resolve various outstanding problems.    [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

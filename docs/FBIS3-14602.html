In a statement to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY, Hakam Bal'awi  said that his visit to Amman reaffirms the close relations  between the Jordanian and Palestinian people, which has crossed  the stage of cooperation and coordination to the stage of joint  cohesion between the two peoples in the present and the future  to face outside challenges.    He added that he is carrying the visions and ideas of the  Palestinian leadership toward the peace process, noting that it  is concerned about briefing Jordan on all its moves in order to  achieve a just, comprehensive, and durable peace that responds  to the ambitions of the Palestinians people and the Arab nation.    He said that he will brief the Jordanian leadership on the  circumstances that preceded and followed UN Security Council  Resolution 904, especially in terms of the PLO's concern about  protecting the Palestinian people and maintaining the Islamic  and Christian holy places in Jerusalem, the capital of the  Palestinian state.</p>

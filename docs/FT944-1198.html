			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Two borrowers brave subdued conditions The Christmas slowdown in the eurobond market continued yesterday, with only two borrowers braving the subdued market conditions with highly structured deals. SMM, a special purpose vehicle backed by debt and equity assets, launched a five-tranche multi-currency offering via J. P. Morgan. The issue, which included fixed-rate and floating-rate dollar tranches and sterling, D-Mark and Swiss franc floating-rate tranches, was targeted at specific investor groups, a syndicate official at J. P. Morgan said. The offering met with interest from institutional accounts, with a number of large block purchases in continental Europe, he said. The main Dollars 719m tranche of two-year floating-rate notes offered a coupon of 12 1/2 basis points over three-month Libor. Nippon Credit launched a Dollars 150m issue of five-year credit enhanced performance bonds for a separate special purpose vehicle. The offering found demand from institutional investors worldwide, Nippon Credit said. The Canadian province of Alberta has established a Dollars 1.5bn medium term note programme, Merrill Lynch, which arranged the deal, said in a statement. The programme will allow for the distribution of notes into the US, the euromarkets and the Canadian market. The notes can be denominated in a variety of currencies with a maturity of up to 15-years, Merrill Lynch said. In a similar move, Credit Suisse announced a Dollars 1.5bn multi-currency medium-term note programme. Elsewhere, the devaluation of the Mexican peso had little impact on spreads on Mexican eurobonds, analysts said. The effect on confidence was greater in the more liquid Brady bond market where bond prices fell by about  3/4 point before recovering slightly. Unibanco Leasing launched a Dollars 50m issue of three-year FRNs offering 330 basis points over six-month Libor.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O, HAPPY DAYS!  </P> <P> The "Mid-Century Memoirs," by Karen Lansky, about how wonderful it was growing  up in Los Angeles in the '40s and '50s, were almost all sentimental and  nostalgic -- with very little mention of the era's underbelly. One of my most  vivid memories of the late '40s was of an apartment-building sign that I used  to stare at every morning while waiting for a bus to work: "No dogs, no  peddlers, no Jews." What hit me hardest was not the bigotry of the building's  owner, but that such a sign was even permitted.  </P> <P> DAVID R. MOSS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

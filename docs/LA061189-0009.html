			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TED TURNER  </P> <P> Regarding "The Man Hollywood Loves to Hate," by Stephen Farber (April 30): As  an avid film buff, I heartily support Ted Turner for colorizing the film  greats. Watching their revitalized images is like seeing the films for the  first time. Turner should be applauded for preserving the old films that  otherwise we may not have gotten a chance to see again.  </P> <P> STEVE BELK  </P> <P> Sun Valley  </P></p>

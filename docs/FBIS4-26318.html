			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan's economy is  expected to grow 6.26 percent in the second half of this year,  compared with an estimated 5.52 percent for the first half year,  the Taiwan Institute for Economic Research reported Tuesday [21  June].    A host of factors, including stronger exports, the  depreciation of the new Taiwan dollar, lower bank lending rates,  and ongoing public-development projects, will push up the  overall economic growth in the second half of the year, leading  to a growth rate for the year of 5.9 percent, institute  researchers said. An even brighter picture is predicted for  1995 if growth in exports and private investment, among other  sectors, continues, the researchers said. The institute also  said that the private sectors will fare much better economically  than the government in coming months.    The growth in private consumption is expected to increase  7.4  percent in the second half year, compared with a drop of 0.56  percent for the government. Private investment should jump by  12.65 percent, while public investment financed by the  government will grow a mere 1.73 percent during the same period.  Meanwhile, service and merchandise exports are expected to  increase 7.38 percent while imports should jump 7.34 percent,  the institute said.    The institute also predicted that Taiwan's consumer and  wholesale prices will surge 3.77 percent and 1.93 percent,  respectively, in the second half of the year.</p>

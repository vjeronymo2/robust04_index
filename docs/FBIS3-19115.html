Solana spoke out against Greek Foreign  Minister Theodhoros Pangalos, about whom he went so far as to  say that his remarks lack common sense. At a Congress [of  Deputies] plenary session, Solana received the People's Party's  qualified support for the firmness shown by the government in  the negotiation to admit Norway to the Brussels club.    He arrived home from Brussels at 0600, slept for just a few  hours, and at 1400 held a press conference with Jose Manuel  Durao Barroso -- his Portuguese counterpart. Perhaps it was the  lack of sleep, but the fact is that Solana responded to the  European partners' criticisms with unusual harshness.    Pangalos is not in the habit of beating about the bush. At a  press conference which he held after the abortive round of  negotiations, he reviewed the concessions made by each  delegation, and finally emphasized that only the Spanish  delegation remained inflexible, for reasons which he could not  understand.    Solana stated that he was unaware of the remarks by the  Greek  [EU] Council of Ministers president, but he pointed out that he  had heard him on many other occasions since he has been heading  the EU. "His remarks," he commented, "do not always impress me.  They sometimes lack common sense."    Greece's stance has caused some disappointment in the  Spanish  delegation. It was known that Athens, currently holding the  presidency, would not behave as the Mediterranean ally which it  has been on many occasions. "However, we were not expecting  that the presidency would put us against the ropes," a diplomat  remarked.    Greece's conduct is all the more incomprehensible inasmuch  as  Spain has been one of the four EU countries which have hitherto  refused to take the step of establishing diplomatic relations  with Macedonia -- Greece's northern neighbor. Athens refuses to  recognize it until it obtains guarantees of its renunciation of  its alleged territorial claims to northern Greece.    Nevertheless, the Spanish foreign minister denied that Spain  has refused to strengthen ties with Skopje -- Macedonia's  capital -- in the hope of receiving favorable treatment from the  Greek presidency. "Only yesterday, I told Pangalos," Solana  stated: "Spain is not a country for bartering. This is not a  case of logrolling. We did not refrain from doing so in the  hope of some kind of gratitude." He also responded to the  criticisms of Spain by Klaus Kinkel -- his German counterpart --  but did so much more cautiously. His statements asking him for  greater flexibility seemed to him "reasonable in the framework  of a negotiating process such as this."  <H5>  Isolation </H5>   In Spanish and even in English, Solana reiterated once more  the Spanish stance demanding of Norway greater access to its  fishing grounds -- Oslo is offering only 3,700 tonnes of cod per  year -- and refusing to accept that the blocking minority in the  Council of Ministers should rise from 23 to 27 votes, as a  result of which the Mediterranean countries would be left in a  minority. He strove to prove that Spain is not alone.    Although Pangalos praised the Portuguese concessions  yesterday, Durao Barroso expressed his complete solidarity with  Spain in its struggle to regain access to the Norwegian fishing  grounds, which also interest Portugal. However, the Portuguese  minister distanced himself from the Spanish approach in the  institutional sphere.    Colleagues of the minister acknowledged that not enough  efforts were made to explain why a country such as Spain,  anxious to deepen European building, upheld a stance which, if  it succeeded, would hamper decisionmaking in the Council of  Ministers. "The ideal thing would have been to carry out a  major institutional reform," one of them lamented, "but France  ultimately did not venture to give battle, and we could not do  so, either, on our own."    At the Congress plenary session in the afternoon, People's  Party deputy Jose Maria Robles Fraga urged the government to  hold its ground in the negotiation. "If you block," he stated,  "do not do so in the darkness and solitude to which you have  accustomed us. Do not give in, Mr. Minister; you are not alone  in Brussels," because you have the support of public opinion and  of the parliamentary forces. "If they tell you: `Not one more  fish or one more vote,' you will have to tell them: `Or one  more country.' I am very glad to know that the People's Party  is behind the government," Solana replied.</p>

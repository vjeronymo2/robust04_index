			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 11 Jun--The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]  parliamentary floor group today submitted a motion to the Sejm  Presidium for "postponing the first reading of the bill on the  ratification of the concordat between the Holy See and the  Polish Republic until after a new constitution of the Polish  Republic comes into force," group Chairman Aleksander  Kwasniewski told journalists. Earlier it was said at the Sejm  that the debate on the concordat would be held on 2 July.    Kwasniewski said that this step was not directed against the  church or the believers, and it was not aiming at stirring up a  war over outlooks on life. He added that it intended to lead to  the situation when the concordat "will be freed from public  doubts, also expressed during the campaign before the 19  September general election."</p>

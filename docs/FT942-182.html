			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / LBS sees growth falling to 2.3% Economic growth will slow and inflation will rise in 1995, according to the latest forecast by the London Business School. Prepared by Mr David Currie, a member of the Treasury's panel of independent forecasters, and Mr Andrew Sentance, a former member, it is rather less sanguine about 1995 than the Treasury forecast on Tuesday. While the Treasury predicted 2.75 per cent gross domestic product growth in 1994 and 1995, LBS forecasts that growth will be 3.0 per cent this year, slowing next year to 2.3 per cent. Tax increases will slow the recovery and investment and exports will take up the running from consumer demand. LBS predicts that interest rates will have to climb to combat an increase in underlying inflation, which it expects to pick up to 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1995 (the Treasury forecast is 2.75 per cent). Base rates will start to rise early next year and will peak at 7.5 per cent in early 1996, according to LBS, before falling ahead of the general election. In an essay accompanying the forecast, Mr Currie and Mr Sentance argue that one way in which the chancellor could avoid another 'boom and bust' cycle in the UK is to give full responsibility for monetary policy to the Bank of England. Meanwhile, the forecasting group of the Society of Business Economists also predicts that underlying inflation will rise in 1995 - to 3.6 per cent, near the top of the government's target range of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent. Headline inflation, which includes mortgage interest payments, will hit 4.3 per cent next year, according to the society. On economic growth, the society predicts that GDP will rise by 2.8 per cent this year and by 2.5 per cent in 1995.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Bugged by the system - Computing I THOUGHT that the age of people putting too much trust in computers was over. It seems this is not so - at least, not in the realms of local councils. On opening my mail the other morning, I had a shock. It was a letter from the local council saying that I would have to pay the new council tax on an unoccupied property. A property I had never heard of, let alone owned. I rang the council offices. 'Yes, under the council tax we are required by law to collect taxes on the property.' 'But I don't own the property.' 'Our computer says that you do. If you don't own the property why haven't you given this information before?' 'I didn't know you wanted the information.' 'You must have known.' She was getting angry by now. 'We have written to you many times before concerning this property. You just see fit not to answer the correspondence.' 'I have not received your previous letters,' I pleaded. 'Look, Mr Brooker, I can understand one letter going missing, but not with the regularity we have tried to contact you. You just don't reply]' I could tell by her tone that the computer screen in front of her was giving her the dates of all the letters sent. 'Where did you send the letters?' I parried. 'To you, Mr Brooker, at your address.' I decided I would take on a condescending tone to match hers. 'To which address?' She gave me the address of the property that was causing the concern. It still had not registered that if I did not own the property and did not live in the property, I was unlikely to have received any correspondence. She still spoke with the same haughty tone. She had given up listening by now. 'I don't own the property,' I told her, very clearly. 'I have never owned the property. I have never lived at that address.' 'If, as you say, you don't own the property, then you will have to inform us who does own it,' she replied. I was getting tired of this conversation by now. 'I don't own a crystal ball either,' I remarked. I hit a nerve. 'There is no need for that kind of remark. I have all the details in front of me on the computer. If you have sold the property then you must tell us who you have sold it to.' 'I don't own the property. I have never owned the property. I cannot sell a property I don't own. Please] Just alter the information on the computer.' 'I cannot alter the information on the computer just on your say so, Mr Brooker. If you care to write to us we will deal with your correspondence in due course.' The conversation was ended. I sat down at my computer and drafted a letter. As I was steaming mad I made a few errors - which I corrected. There is an old adage in computer terminology: if you put garbage in, you get garbage out. If there is one group of council workers which understands garbage, it is the refuse collectors. Perhaps it is these workers who should be operating the computers within the Town Halls . . .</p>

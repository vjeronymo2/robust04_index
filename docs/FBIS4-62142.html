			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 12, BNS -- The broadcasting bill that  passed Wednesday [11 May] the second reading in the parliament  allows the state-owned Estonian Radio and Estonian Television to  include advertising in their broadcasts.    Under the bill, advertisements may amount to five percent of  the daily broadcasts over one Estonian-language and one  Russian-language radio channel.    Private radio and TV stations are allowed to spend 20  percent  of their airtime on advertising. Tiit Sinissaar, chairman of  the Pro Patria parliamentary faction, therefore voiced the  opinion that granting state radio and TV permission to  advertising broadcasts does not affect the activity of private  stations.    The legislators carried Wednesday a motion stipulating that  Estonian Radio and Estonian Television are independent legal  persons which jointly administer the radio and TV broadcasting  center. The motion put forward by the Liberal faction, under  which the radio, the television and the broadcasting center  would form one single organization, found no support in the  parliament.    The motion to include a "principle of political balance" in  the broadcasting law was also rejected. According to the  proposal, a radio or TV station, which allows airtime to a  political party, should give other parties at their request the  same amount of time on the air.    Sinissaar told reporters it would at present be impossible  to  observe such a principle of balance.    "We have about a score of competing political parties and if  this principle was implemented dividing airtime between parties  would be the principal occupation of the radio and TV stations,"  he said.</p>

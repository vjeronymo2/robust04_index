Because of this, the  total amount of government bonds for fiscal 1993 will reach the  record high of some 16 trillion yen. Moreover, the reliance  rate of the general account on national bonds will exceed 20  percent for the first time in the past seven years or since  fiscal 1986.    Expenditures in the third supplementary budget will be  allocated mainly for public works projects, facilities and  additional investments -- including Small Business Finance  Corporation and the People's Finance Corporation -- which are  accompanied by an increase in guidance policy financing. The  amount of government bonds issued by the second supplementary  budget reached 13.992 trillion yen. About 2 trillion yen will be  added to that amount.    The Finance Ministry issued 14.172 trillion yen's worth of  government bonds in fiscal 1980. It was the largest amount (of  which about 7.2 trillion yen was for deficit-covering bonds) in  the past. In fiscal 1993, the total amount of government bonds  will exceed 14.172 trillion yen. Moreover, due to the decision  to issue additional bonds, the general account's reliance rate  on national bonds will be well over 20 percent. It will be the  highest-level reliance rate since fiscal 1986, when the rate was  21 percent. While the government promoted rehabilitation of  public finance, the reliance rate was going down in the  eighties. Although it dropped to 9.5 percent in fiscal 1991,  however, the rate suddenly rose again.</p>

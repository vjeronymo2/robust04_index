			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tianjin, February 4 (XINHUA) -- North China's  industrial city of Tianjin plans to complete the technical  upgrading of all its state-owned industrial enterprises in eight  years by using overseas funds.    Last year the city's industrial enterprises signed 197  contracts on setting up foreign-funded firms, with a total  investment of 596 million U.S. dollars -- 83 percent and 88  percent increases, respectively, over the previous year. Of the  total investment, 200 million U.S. dollars came from foreign  investors.    Some 66 foreign-funded firms went into operation last year.    By the end of 1993 Tianjin had registered a total of 674  foreign-funded industrial firms with a total investment of 2.36  billion U.S. dollars.    Their registered capital came to 1.74 billion U.S. dollars,  of which some 873 million U.S. dollars came from foreign  investors.    The city now has 187 foreign-funded firms in operation. They  have 43,000 employees.    In 1993 Tianjin's foreign-funded enterprises recorded an  industrial production value of 7.33 billion yuan (about 900  million U.S. dollars) and profits of 750 million yuan, and  handed over taxes of one billion yuan.    By the end of last year 227 enterprises had started  technical  upgrading programs by using a total of 590 million U.S. dollars  in overseas funds.    The technical upgrading programs have helped enterprises  improve product quality, technology and management.    At the same time, the city has paid special attention to  strengthening cooperation with international big-name  corporations.    In the past two years Tianjin has encouraged a number of its  major electronics, motorcycle, refrigerator, washing machine and  detergent firms to seek cooperation with big foreign companies,  such as Hankel of Germany, Samsung of the Republic of Korea,  Honda of Japan and ZEC of Italy.    So far, the city has set up joint ventures with more than  100  such companies, 18 of which have an annual production value of  over 100 million yuan each and annual profits exceeding 10  million yuan each.</p>

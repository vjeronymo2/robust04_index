			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sana' al-Imam dispatch from Damascus; from the "Panorama" </F> program]    [Text] In an exclusive statement to Radio Monte Carlo  following his meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad, Russian  presidential envoy Igor Ivanov has said that the new Russian  initiative is based on holding a second conference in Madrid.  Ivanov said: Despite all the difficulties, the negotiating  process will lead to tangible results. Holding another  conference in Madrid will give everyone the opportunity to  evaluate what has been realized and define the future outlines  and formulas. However, this conference does not constitute an  alternative to current negotiations.    The Russian envoy said: Those who understood our initiative,  as I have explained it, supported it and those who understood it  to be an alternative to the negotiations rejected it. However,  I do not believe that the initiative is categorically rejected  although it needs time.    Ivanov counseled alertness and vigilance to avoid  undermining  the negotiating process. He emphasized Syria's readiness to  continue pursuing an active and effective role to reach a just  peace. He said President Hafiz al-Asad welcomes such a role.    On the two countries' bilateral relations, the Russian envoy  said that an agreement has been reached with President al-Asad,  who is held in high esteem in Russia, as he put it, to give a  new push to bilateral relations in all fields. As for the  Syrian debts to Russia, agreement has been reached to hold a  meeting of experts from both sides to study the various options  in light of the legitimate interests of both sides.    On Russia's views regarding the limited international  observers [in Hebron] and whether such a number is sufficient to  protect a city of more than 120,000 Palestinians, Ivanov said  that this is more a question of the efficiency rather than  number of observers.    Concerning the absence of the Russian role and its  reemergence recently following the Hebron massacre, the Russian  envoy said that this role did not disappear in order to  reemerge, but that it is continuing without clamor unless the  situation warrants otherwise.</p>

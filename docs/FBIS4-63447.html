			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia and Georgia have concentrated on settling  border and customs problems. Chairman of Georgia's Border  Department Viktor Lordkipanidze told Interfax that a special  Georgian commission was set up to demarcate the border between  Russia and Georgia.    He also announced that the economic border with customs  offices was to be defined next week. The Georgian customs  office will be located in Gantiadi and the Russian one in Adler.  The motorway customs offices will be located in Gantiadi, Roki,  Mamisoni and Kazbegi (Georgia) and in Adler, Nizhni Zaramag and  Verkhny Lars (Russia).    Lordkipanidze also said that talks were underway on the  demarcation of the state border. The final variant will be  chosen with due account taken of both countries' interests, he  said.    He said that the customs offices would be opened in the near  future, perhaps earlier than a political decision on the issue  would be taken.</p>

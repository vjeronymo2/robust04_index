The hospital  declined to identify the victims.  </P> <P> Police Sgt. Nate Caplan said the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m. in the  parking lot of Huffman's Barbecue, 5039 Imperial Ave.  </P> <P> He said the victims were shot as a cream-color car drove slowly through the  parking lot and its occupants opened fire on the group of people standing  there. He said one witness followed the car after it sped away, and later led  police to a pistol discarded by the suspects.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu said Tuesday that North Korea is still  subjected to all the obligations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty (NPT) because there has been no official notification by  North Korea to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    In a press conference at the Foreign Correspondents Club,  Minister Han also said "IAEA inspectors are still in North Korea  and they should continue to be there to do their job."    Han said that the doors are still open to dialogues,  although  "the possibility seems much less now than several weeks ago."    "We still hope that North Korea would come to talks with  South Korea, the IAEA and the United States. At the moment,  North Koreans alone can ask that," said Han. "But North Korea  should provide due grounds to have such dialogues."    On the question of possible military strike against the  North  being mentioned by U.S. medias, Han said that "nobody is  discussing military strikes at this time."    Asked about the reports of the imminency of war or military  confrontation, Han said, "We are making sure destruction does  not take place. We take necessary measures. Despite war talks,  there is no reason to worry about the outbreak of hostilities."    Han dismissed the North's words of threat, saying "That's  just a scare tactics. We cannot base our response on the very  irresponsible threat the very irresponsible country is making."    Minister Han said, however, that the resolution to be  adopted  by the U.N. Security Council should be more than symbolic one,  adding "stronger resolution is needed" to make the North to  comply with the international demands for complete inspection.    On the role of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in the  nuclear standoff, Han hoped Carter would let the North Koreans  know how seriously does the international community regard the  situation.    "He did not tell me what he would tell the North Koreans.  But I think he would tell the North how the world would react  to the nuclear issue. I expect him to have very serious  discussions with North Korean leaders," he said.    The very existence of any nuclear weapons in the North could  be a threat in itself because of the possibility of their use  and also because it may start proliferation in this region, said  Han, adding "it would be a clear danger to us."    On the report that China would support the North in the  event  of war, Han said that he could not give credibility to such  report.    Stressing that China has been playing a constructive role in  the nuclear issue, Han said "Obviously, we do not know what the  Chinese attitude will be," adding that he believes it would  depend on how the North Koreans would respond to the whole  process.    Rejecting any attempt to justify the North's possession of  nuclear arms as an equalizer, Han said "You cannot disregard the  danger of nuclear weapons and the cost of holding on to it will  continue to rise."    Minister Han also said that his government would continue to  honor the denuclearization declaration which he said the North  has already violated, adding "We have no intention to give up  the declaration."</p>

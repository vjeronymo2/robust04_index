			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity If the mooted five-year deal to supply coal to the UK power generators is eventually signed, the electricity and coal industries will be free of a large measure of uncertainty. The electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, will have secured around a half of their requirements at attractive prices. And while the direct cost savings of the deal will be passed on to consumers, the generators will be able to buy more cheap coal from abroad. With the additional benefits of separate rationalisation programmes, profits should move ahead strongly over the next few years despite falling electricity sales. This might be taken to support the case for valuing the generators on their earnings prospects, rather than by the traditional yield measure used for regulated utilities. Given that annual earnings growth might be 5-10 per cent until 1997, and that the companies have dividend cover of over three times, an earnings multiple only 60 per cent of the market average looks much too low. However, the regulatory risk has not disappeared: the generators may yet be sucked into a war of attrition with the authorities like that which has befallen British Gas. On that basis, a yield below the market average would leave the companies looking vulnerable were it not for a dividend cover which allows scope for a generous increase in payouts. At the very least the generators should thus be able to regard their recent outperformance as a move to a new trading range. The regional electricity companies should also benefit from the deal. Lower electricity prices will ease the regulatory pressure, but given their recent strong performance, the shares may have already discounted that. Poor British Coal can hardly share the optimism. The government seems to have decided that even a five-year deal which subsidised coal would not be enough to persuade the market to accept the company as it currently stands. So British Coal would be forced to face the harsh capacity realities sooner rather than later.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOAX OR NOT, BOOK ON GARBO TO BE PUBLISHED  </P> <P> A press-ready memoir of Greta Garbo that had been locked in a vault for 14  years will be released in a matter of weeks, Simon &amp; Schuster announced  Friday.  </P> <P> The biography, entitled "Garbo" and written by the late Polish emigre author  Antoni Gronowicz, had been branded a hoax by the actress in 1978. At the time,  Gronowicz said Garbo didn't want the book published out of fear it would damage  her reputation because it contained details of her sexual encounters with some  of the world's most famous personalities. "She is trying to destroy me," he  declared.  </P> <P> The publishing house made no mention of the decade-old literary controversy on  Friday. Simon &amp; Schuster's said "much" of the book being published in June  is "told in her (Garbo's) own words as she talked to Gronowicz in the course of  their long and intimate friendship."  </P> <P> Gronowicz, who died in 1985, had said that he had known Garbo since 1938 and  had had "many" interviews with her.  </P> <P> Simon &amp; Schuster said it acquired the book in 1976 "on the understanding  that it would not be published during the actress' lifetime. Simon &amp;  Schuster insisted on this condition out of respect for Miss Garbo and her  wishes."  </P> <P> The actress, who died a week ago, had issued a sworn affadavit through her  lawyer in 1978 stating "categorically" that she had never authorized or  collaborated with Gronowicz on the account of her life.  </P> <P> Richard E. Snyder, the president of Simon &amp; Schuster, responded at the time  that his company would not publish the book "if we learn (it) is not what it  purports to be. But we won't be denied the right to publish a literary work  about a public personality because that person wants to be left alone."  </P> <P> The Gronowicz book will beat by more than a year two other books in the works  on Garbo: a biography by Barry Paris for Alfred E. Knopf and a remembrance by  Ray Daum for Harper &amp; Row.  </P> <P> According to the publisher, the memoir describes in detail Garbo's childhood in  Sweden, her memories of movie stardom and her love life. Among the people  discussed are her discoverer, mentor and lover Mauritz Stiller, actors John  Gilbert, Robert Montgomery, Robert Taylor, Charles Boyer and Melvyn Douglas as  well as conductor Leopold Stokowski, millionaire George Schlee, diet guru  Gayelord Hauser and photographer Cecil Beaton.  </P> <P> "In the book, Gronowicz also recalls Miss Garbo talking about the often rumored  fact that 'women pursued (her) more often and more persistently' than did men,"  according to a Simon &amp; Schuster statement released Friday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad -- Within twenty four hours of the  resignation of Attorney General [AG] Fakhruddin G Ibrahim,  Deputy Attorney General Mumtaz Ali Mirza too has submitted his  resignation to President Farooq Leghari.    "I don't want to say anything other than that I have  resigned," the rather cautious Mumtaz Ali remarked when asked  about reasons of resignation.    The move of the Deputy AG, viewed as a setback to the  government, comes at a time when serious efforts are being  apparently made by the top government officials to persuade  Fakhruddin G. Ibrahim to withdraw his previous decision.    In his resignation letter, sent to the President, Mirza  says,  "I regret to say that it is no longer possible for me to  continue as Deputy AG. Accordingly, I tender my resignation.  You are informed." Government circles refused to comment on  the resignation.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Management: Mist at the end of the tunnel - A look at Eurotunnel's preparations for turning itself into a railway operator You can picture the scene. It is an autumn morning in 1993 and the first Eurotunnel shuttles ever to pass under the Channel in public service are about to set off from the terminals on the British and French coasts, jammed to the gunwhales with dignitaries. At precisely 11.00, the starting signal is given, the train doors whoosh shut, the crowds let out a cheer, and . . . nothing happens. There has been a points failure somewhere in the tunnel, the signals have turned to red, and the shuttle trains are left stuck in the platforms as the embarrassment remorselessly mounts. Of course, it will never happen. And yet . . . could it? What is to say that Eurotunnel will turn out to be any good at running trains if and when the tunnel opens, as scheduled, late next year? If anything, the odds look stacked against it. After all, Eurotunnel's main purpose until now has been financing and managing one of the world's biggest construction projects. The management skills appropriate to that task appear to have little in common with those needed to run a railway. Sometime between now and the tunnel's opening the company must undergo an extraordinary transformation. Eurotunnel, inevitably, sees things rather differently. It is wrong, it says, to imagine a day when the project team finishes its work, walks out the gates, and hands over the keys to a bunch of newly-recruited railway operatives with a cheery: 'Bonne chance, mes braves.' In fact, transport already forms one of the three prongs of Eurotunnel's organisational structure, alongside project management and finance. In staffing terms, it is also very large, accounting for nearly half the company's 1,000 employees. Head of transport is Alain Bertrand, managing director, operations. Formerly manager of the south-east region of SNCF, the French national railway, he joined Eurotunnel in January 1987. Bertrand's first task was to form a small group of people with transport experience to advise the project team on the suitability of the transport systems they were devising, both from an operational and a commercial point of view. Since then, as the tunnel's opening date has grown nearer, so has the need to recruit the people who are going to manage the operation of the shuttle trains, the terminals, the signalling and the tracks; and in parallel, those who are going to market the shuttle services to the public. Like Bertrand, many of the most senior transport managers - half of them English, half French - come directly from the transport industry. Peter Dyke, operations director, comes from BAA, the former British Airports Authority; Andre Pascal, engineering director, comes from RATP, the Paris transport authority; and Christopher Garnett, commercial director, comes from Sealink Stena Line, the cross-Channel ferry operator. Below them, the recruitment sources vary. Some people are coming from outside, but others - for example, signal engineers, track engineers, cable engineers and communications engineers - are transferring from Eurotunnel's project team, where they are currently overseeing the installation of the transport systems by Transmanche-Link, the contractors. One obvious benefit of recruiting from this source is that the people who install the systems know them inside out. As Bertrand puts it, if he has any trouble with his signalling system, he will turn to his chief signalling engineer and say: 'Look, you procured this thing. Now sort it out.' Other recruits are coming from TML itself. For example, many of the highly-skilled mechanical and electrical engineers formerly employed on TML's tunnel-boring machines have transferred to Eurotunnel's transport division. And when work on the tunnel is finished, a large proportion of Eurotunnel's 300 shuttle train drivers will be recruited from among the drivers of TML's works trains. So a good deal of expertise has been lined up for the transport team. Even so, there is still a long way to go before recruitment is complete. By the time the transport system opens next year, some 2,000 people will be needed to operate it, maintain it and sell its services. 'What we have here,' says Bertrand, 'is a nucleus of operators - the people who will start the commissioning and testing of the systems. As for the rank and file - the people who will take your money at the toll booths, the train crews and so on - it would be completely silly to recruit them now. But their supervisors are here, because they are the ones who are drafting the procedures, who are familiarising themselves with the equipment and with the method of operation; and they will recruit their people when the time comes.' The trick for Eurotunnel is to get the timing right. It has to be sure that enough fully-trained people are in place to run the system when it opens; but on the other hand, it does not want people standing idle in the run-up to the opening. According to Bertrand, this need not happen. The build-up to the full complement will be a gradual process. As more people are taken on, they will be fully employed learning procedures and undergoing training (in use of the French language, as well as technical matters). As the opening date draws closer and delivery of the shuttle trains begins, they will start testing and commissioning the equipment. By the time the tunnel opens to the public, it will have been tested for months, with employees running the shuttles as ghost trains or acting as surrogate passengers. Theoretically, at least, most of the technical faults should by then have been eradicated. In any event, the pressure will be relatively light at first because delays to the opening of the tunnel have pushed the opening date into the low season. The danger is that once the tunnel has gone smoothly into public service, the skilled people will become bored and wander off. Bertrand plays down the risk: there will be enough people like himself, he says, who have witnessed the project's birth and want to see it through its years of infancy. And what of Eurotunnel's chief executive, Sir Alastair Morton? He says it will be down to Bertrand to run the transport operation. 'I'm neither a retailer nor a transportation operator nor a service company manager,' he says. 'I've undertaken to see the tunnel through any start-up difficulties before I go, but only as the chairman of the executive committee of the board: in other words, in a full-time executive role, but in the boardroom rather than in day-to-day management.' Once the tunnel is over its start-up difficulties, he says - in 1994 or 1995  -he envisages stepping down to a non-executive role. And after that: 'I'll be taking a very long holiday - if I live that long.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz, 23 May -- Mobile groups of Russian  troops have stepped up control over the safety strip between  North Ossetia and Ingushetia. ITAR-TASS learned on Monday that  this had been done in line with an instruction by Vladimir  Lozovoy, the head of the interim administration.    In the meantime, a wide-scale "transport" operation aimed to  strengthen the state of emergency regime is under way in the  zone where the regime is in force. It envisages thorough  check-ups of vehicles, trains, train stations, and airports. It  was reported that dozens of fire-arms, hand-grenades, various  rounds of ammunition, and drugs had been confiscated from  passengers over the past three days.    Information obtained by ITAR-TASS from military sources  makes  it possible to conclude that the situation in the North Ossetian  rayons where the state of emergency regime is in force until 31  May remains relatively calm. No night shellings or attacks on  army or militia posts or interethnic conflicts have been  registered here in the past 24 hours.</p>

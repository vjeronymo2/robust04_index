			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- A majority of South  Korean scholars with doctoral degrees believe that North Korea  has brought on the nuclear dispute in order to wiggle out of its  economic difficulties.    In a survey conducted by the Seoul Research Center, more  than  half (50.5 percent) of 182 scholars polled said Pyongyang  started the nuclear row to obtain U.S. economic aid.    Some 20.3 percent said North Korean leaders caused the  nuclear standoff to quell economic and social instability in  their country.    The survey was conducted May 14-15 on sociologists,  political  scientists, nuclear and other scientists. The margin of error  was not disclosed.    According to 10.4 percent of the pollees, Pyongyang raised  the nuclear issue as a means of defending itself against the  joint U.S.- South Korean annual military exercise "Team Spirit."  Some 17 percent viewed the nuclear row as preparations for war.    Asked about their sense of danger, 27.4 percent said they  felt none at all, 32.4 percent said a little and 23.6 percent  replied they felt more or less in peril and worried about the  situation.    Some 11.5 percent said they felt at considerable danger but  there was no way of preparing while only 4.9 percent said they  sensed a lot of danger and were preparing for it.    Meanwhile, 56.5 percent said they believe North Korea  already  has nuclear bombs and will make more while 41.7 percent think  Pyongyang has the capability but has not yet made any.    Commenting on former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit to  Pyongyang, 39.5 percent expect a temporary effect, 27.4 percent  said Carter could not make any strong demands of North Korean  President Kim Il-song because he is visiting in a private  capacity, and 22.5 percent expected a slight achievement from  carter's visit although they felt it was undesirable for a  former American leader to get involved.    Only 5.4 percent said they thought Carter's visit would be  an  effective method of resolving the issue and 4.9 percent said  there would be no result at all.    With regard to North Korea's withdrawal from the  International Atomic Energy Agency, 43.9 percent said it was a  North Korean plot to induce U.S. economic aid while hiding its  nuclear capability under a shroud.    However, 28.5 percent said Pyongyang decided to quit the  IAEA  as a result of the international community's bid to impose  sanctions on it. That's why the United States should withdraw a  draft resolution on sanctions and induce Pyongyang back to the  negotiating table, they said.</p>

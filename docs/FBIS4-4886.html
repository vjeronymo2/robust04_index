			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 2 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- An  emergency meeting was held in Tokyo on March 28 with regard to  the situation of the Korean peninsula.    Present at the meeting were Secretary General of the Japan  Committee for Supporting the Independent and Peaceful  Reunification of Korea Hiroshi Wakabayashi, chairman of the  Japan-Korea Association of Scientific and Educational exchange  Kiyoo Nakakoji, honorary professor of Rikkyo University  Yasusaburo Hoshino and other Japanese figures and Tokyo  citizens, more than 200 in all.    In his lecture at the meeting, Prof. Yashuhiro Maeda of  Kitakyushu University said the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea did not want a war and dealt with the United States on an  independent principle. He charged that the United States was  encouraging the Japanese and South Korean authorities to  intensify the moves to isolate the DPRK.    A resolution was adopted at the meeting.    Noting that the demand of the International Atomic Energy  Agency in the course of its recent inspection was a deliberate  interference in socialist Korea, it said it resulted in creating  a touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula which might  lead to a war any time.    It stressed that as long as the United States sought "world  supremacy by strength," an anachronistic design, military  tensions would be increased and the danger of a war would  persist in the world. It urged the United States to renounce  "the policy of strength."    The resolution demanded that the Hosokawa government,  instead  of following the United States, make an apology for Japan's  colonial domination and war of aggression, renounce its hostile  policy toward the DPRK, show all sincerity in liquidating the  consequences of its colonial domination and make efforts for  the resumption of the Japan-DPRK negotiation for the progress of  the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two  countries on the basis of the joint declaration signed by the  Workers' Party of Korea, the Liberal Democratic Party and the  Social-Democratic Party of Japan.</p>

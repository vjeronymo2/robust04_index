			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's authority to recall engines which do not comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards in use provides an important incentive to on-highway manufacturers to design and build durable engines and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles. However, at this time, EPA has limited data by which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to propose in-use standards for small SI engines under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 213(d) of the CAA, subjecting nonroad engine manufacturers to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of section 207(c) of the CAA. Because EPA is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to establish in-use emission standards in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking, it is necessary to require that manufacturers test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use engines to gain important knowledge about the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deterioration of their engines and report the results to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA expects that this knowledge will be critical to developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more durable emission control systems and achieving better in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with Phase 2 engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An auxiliary outcome of this Phase 1 testing program would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be that manufacturers, by working closely with EPA to evaluate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use emissions and identify solutions to problems, would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparing for the Phase 2 in-use compliance program. This Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1 testing program would permit issues associated with a variety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of maintenance and use conditions to be identified and resolved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to Phase 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated previously, EPA is concerned that these goals may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be as fully achieved with joint testing programs involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several manufacturers and their respective organizations. By  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring direct communication with EPA, manufacturers would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to individually provide test data showing in-use performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's experience has been that aggregate data (sorted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations and stripped of engine identification) is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective in identifying specific in-use problems. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated Phase 1 in-use data would improve estimates of in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions, thereby enhancing the basis for emission inventories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to support the State Implementation Plan (SIP) development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the critical feedback the in-use testing program would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide, EPA believes it is compelled to ensure the fulfillment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the obligation to perform in-use testing. For engine families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where in-use testing would be required, certification is proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be conditioned upon the completion of a number of in-use tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as agreed upon by EPA and the manufacturer at the time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification. Completion of the number of valid in-use tests as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreed, regardless of the test results, would satisfy this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this proposal, a manufacturer's failure to fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> execute the in-use tests would be considered a failure to satisfy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the conditions under which the certificate was issued. An engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be considered to be covered by the certificate only if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer fulfilled the conditions upon which the certificate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was issued. Thus, failure to satisfy the conditions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate could subject a manufacturer to the imposition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil penalties. However, EPA recognizes that a manufacturer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notwithstanding its best efforts, might fail to perform the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required testing due to circumstances beyond its control. Thus EPA would consider all relevant factors when determining whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to view an engine as not being covered by a certificate based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure of a manufacturer to fully execute the test program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of the certificate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comment on the proposed in-use testing program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

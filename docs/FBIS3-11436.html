			<p>Language: <F P=105> Creole </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Evans Paul, a member of the National Front for  Change and Democracy [FNCD] and one of its spokesmen, thinks the  parliamentarians' plan is realistic but that even if the plan is  approved by the Haitian Senate, to implement it will be  extremely difficult because President Aristide is hostile to it.    [Begin Paul recording] I still support the FNCD proposal. I  think it is a realistic one. It is realistic because when we  asked for the amnesty law to be passed, we felt there would be  many advantages to passing it: First, it would set the stage for  General Cedras' early retirment, in compliance with the promise  he made in the Governors Island agreement.    Second, it would meet conditions that would enable President  Aristide to appoint a prime minister once Gen. Cedras had gone  into early retirement as promised.    My concern regarding the plan is what would happen  afterwards, even if the Senate managed to pass this same plan  via a resolution -- because I had a conversation recently with  President Aristide, who told me that he is maintaining his  position, and that he will not budge an inch as long as those  who staged the coup d'etat...[rephrases] Gen. Cedras does not  step down as head of the Army in compliance with the promise he  made on Governors Island. [end recording]    That was a statement by Evans Paul, mayor of Port-au-Prince  and FNCD spokesman.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Yeltsin delays Tokyo visit A PLANNED visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Japan this month has been put off until later in the year, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Sergei Svistunov, a presidential spokesman, said yesterday: 'The visit has been postponed by mutual agreement.' Mr Yeltsin caused a political storm in Japan last year by postponing a visit just four days before it was due to start. The president had been expected to visit Japan at the end of May. Interfax news agency said the trip could be rescheduled for September or October. Japanese newspapers on Tuesday said Mr Yeltsin might call off the trip because of a territorial row between the two countries and political tensions at home.</p>

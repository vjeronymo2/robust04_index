			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary: "Austerity Program for Cambodia"] </F>   [Text] Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the  world with an average annual income of only $250. Because of  this appalling poverty, the royal government cannot escape  criticism that it has been squandering the national budget on  certain superfluous enterprises that do not benefit either  national reconstruction or national defense, but is spent on  extravagant entertainment.    His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman of the Kingdom of  Cambodia recently expressed a strong opinion about this. In a  message to the heads of the royal government earlier this week,  the king appealed for an austerity program to be observed by  Cambodia. It can be understood easily that the austerity program  urged by the king is a program of thrift and frugality in the  face of the reckless, unnecessary spending currently seen by  impoverished Cambodia.    Of course, some would say that "thrift and frugality" are  preached especially by communists. The truth, however, is that  thrift and frugality in general belong to the most elementary  economic concept that everybody, whether he is red, blue, or  pink, must espouse.    Through his initiative, the king of Cambodia has forced the  royal government to realize that Cambodia, which is strapped  with serious budget constraints, must cut spending on costly  decorations and entertainment from all public ceremonies, a step  seen as part of the "austerity" program. The king pointed out  that the royal government should stop such activities as  fireworks displays, conducting parades and processions, and  holding beauty contests. These events were especially brazen  during the celebration of the latest Cambodian traditional new  year. While suggesting that there should not be parades,  processions, floats, and fireworks during independence day  celebrations, the king proposed that a traditional dance show  and just one or two musical bands would suffice for public  entertainment. Besides, the king also suggested that the number  of delegations abroad and the length of their stay in each  foreign country should also be limited to the minimum.    It is true that "the people will surely be pleased with this  kind of austerity program." However, the royal government must  not consider only the belt-tightening measures initiated by the  king. It must work out its own austerity policy. In the current  situation in which poverty is widespread, the royal government  must never allow its ministers to remain extravagant. Or does  it wish to preserve a tradition of extreme lavishness with each  minister being accorded a monthly telephone bill of over  $10,000; electricity consumption of 30,000 to 40,000  kilowatt-hours; and two, three, or even four official cars at  his disposal?</p>

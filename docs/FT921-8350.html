			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (10): Tide is coming in - Industry JUDGED by the number of quoted companies with their headquarters in north-east England, Tyne and Wear's economy could be thought to be going backwards. There are only 25 - and only 10 of these are survivors from 1982, when there were seven more in total. Moreover, an analysis by Price Waterhouse, the accountants, shows that the top five by turnover - Northumbrian Water, Northern Electric, Barratt, Vaux and Cowie - accounted for 75 per cent of turnover and 59 per cent of employees. On the face of it, this is not good news: the best regional economies have a wide mix of locally-headquartered companies by size and type. West Yorkshire, for example has about 80. But the nature of the 'quoteds' does not tell the story - any more than the depth of water at half-tide tells whether the sea is coming in or going out. In Tyne and Wear, a sea change has occurred in the past 12 years and the tide is now quite obviously coming in. There is even evidence in the numbers of quoted companies, for the shares of six of them are quoted on the Unlisted Securities Market, the way to go public for medium-sized or smaller companies with potential for growth. Other evidence can be found at Price Waterhouse's Newcastle office block in the shape of the practice itself. As Mr Bill Teasdale, a partner through 12 years of change, puts it: 'In 1980 we had a typical audit-based practice with 100 people. Tyneside had a very narrow economic base.' Price Waterhouse now has nearly 250 people in Newcastle and 19 local partners, compared with six partners 10 years ago. There is still an insolvency department, but it has not grown further. The firm has a small but busy corporate finance section. Other accountancy practices in Newcastle, such as KPMG Peat Marwick's, have also grown and become much more pro-active. Wise Speke, the region's biggest stockbroker, has become a strong exporter from the region of financial services to corporate clients - notably competitively-priced share dealing and related counselling and advisory services for employees. It was bought by the London-based Sturge group in 1987 but is master of its northern destiny with 130 of its 230 staff in Newcastle - up a third in five years - as it has developed from its strong private client base into niche corporate markets. Growth in financial and professional services does not come out of thin air. Local demand has been growing. Mr David Williams, who heads the Newcastle office of 3i, the investment capital provider, says: 'In the five years to March 1991 we invested Pounds 60m in northern business, much of it on Tyneside. It has been growth rather than buyouts, which have never been a strong business here. 'I feel more optimistic now than for some time. Nearly all our investments are healthy. Most are not at full capacity because of the recession, but they are not in distress. Since September 1990 our failures have been less than 2 per cent in numbers and less than 1 per cent in terms of our total investment in about 200 companies. The fact that 3i has such a healthy business is evidence of local strength. It also reflects that many people here had a big dose of reality in the early 1980s. They are better managers now and plan their businesses well.' While this suggests a strengthening diversification at the smaller end of the industrial and commercial spectrum, Tyne and Wear nevertheless needs healthy big businesses to provide the main economic building blocks. Evidence of health is also strong here, in spite of recent job losses because of recession in some sectors. Press Offshore, soon to be renamed Amec Offshore, currently has a Pounds 300m order book. On Agip's Tiffany contract, said to be the biggest single turnkey project in offshore construction history, it is the lead contractor. Because of the contract's tight timescale, Press is dovetailing work on the engineering, construction and hook-up phases, an innovation which it hopes will give it an edge in competition for future orders. Pallion Engineering - an unusual combination of Anglo-Greek investors, former shipyard shop stewards, businessmen, Mr Bob Clay, the left-wing Labour party MP for Sunderland North, and the Church of England - announced in December it had clinched its first contract: steel fabrication work for a flue gas desulphurisation project. The consortium fought for more than two years to prevent the demolition of Sunderland's last shipyards and create new demand for local shipyard workers' skills. It bought the former Pallion shipyard from British Shipbuilders in mid-1991 for Pounds 2m. One reason why numbers of 'local quoteds' declined was the merger into the Rolls-Royce group of NEI, now renamed the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group. Management by Mr Terry Harrison is as local as ever and 7,500 Tyne and Wear employees are a considerable source of local spending power. Mr Gerry James, spokesman for the business, says: 'Unless recession is truly international, it doesn't have much effect on us. We help to insulate the regional Tyne and Wear economy because most of our sales are exported.' Tyneside is also surviving the peace dividend. Swan Hunter has several years' work and is employing 3,900 people at present, while the 850-strong workforce of Vickers Defence Systems have five years' work for battle tanks and recovery and infantry combat vehicles - and a successful Gulf war to prove to export markets that its products do the job. Of long-term significance, however, is that investment levels have been kept up by such mainstays of the local economy, with the former NEI, Vickers and Swan Hunter companies channelling resources into high technology to stay competitive.</p>

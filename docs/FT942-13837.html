			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Westinghouse income falls to Dollars 36m Net income at Westinghouse Electric, the troubled US conglomerate, fell to Dollars 36m in the first quarter from the previous year's Dollars 59m before accounting changes, the company reported yesterday. The decline came in spite of a one-time gain of Dollars 10m before tax from the sale of two radio stations. But the company had warned in January that the figures would be much lower, and the shares put on Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 11 1/2 . Sales were down to Dollars 1.74bn from Dollars 2.02bn last time and operating profits were down to Dollars 65m from Dollars 146m. Earnings per share were 7 cents, down from 14 cents before accounting changes. The figures were hit by increased pension costs of Dollars 33m and reduced licensee income of Dollars 15m. The previous year benefited from a Dollars 25m change in accounting for nuclear fuel revenues. Mr Mike Jordan, chairman and chief executive, said progress was made on a number of strategic initiatives. Its financial structure had been strengthened through last month's Dollars 520m preferred equity issue, and the company had received Dollars 1.4bn from the sale of its distribution and control business and the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company. Net debt was down to Dollars 3.3bn at the end of the quarter from Dollars 5.1bn at the beginning. Broadcasting, government and environmental services, Thermo King and WCI Communities improved financial contributions. Electronic systems and energy systems made lower contributions while power generation, The Knoll Group and other businesses increased their losses.</p>

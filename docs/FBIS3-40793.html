			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shafiq al-Asadi in Abu Dhabi] </F>   [Text] Eight Arab and regional development funds began  meeting in Abu Dhabi yesterday to coordinate their future  development operations.    Sources in the meeting confirmed that the study would focus  on unifying their participation in these funds in development  operations in Gaza and Jericho, in light of the experience of  the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development [AFESD] in its  development efforts in Palestine. These sources told AL-HAYAH  that the meeting, held at the technical office and director of  operations levels in these funds, would discuss the enacting of  a working plan to publicize their role in development operations  globally and in the Arab world. They confirmed that the plan  included the issuing of various courses and the production of a  television program and intense media campaigns explaining the  role of these institutions in Arab development work as well as  on the level of developing countries. The sources indicated that  this plan was essential after the Gulf war, when these funds'  activities were conducted without seeking attention.    The sources told AL-HAYAH that the directors of operations  would conduct a comprehensive assessment of the results of the  operations of these funds in the Arab countries and other  developing countries and put new conditions on the funds' loans.  These would include disbursing them directly to the  developmental operations for which they were granted. Director  general of the Abu Dhabi Development Fund, Khalifah Muhammad  al-Muhayri, confirmed the new business that will be discussed in  this meeting.    He said that "the huge scale of these institutions' activity  makes it incumbent on us to monitor the extent of the developing  countries' benefit from the aid and loans we give them, as well  as the extent to which those countries comply with the rules and  measures of our institutions, which are aimed at the best choice  of projects for us to fund, and guarantee the soundest  implementation at the lowest cost and promptest time, to serve  development and achieve the goal for which the loan was made."    Al-Muhayri explained in his keynote speech to the 35th  meeting of the coordination group of the national and regional  Arab development institutions his belief in the need for the  coordination group to study the effects of recent global changes  on the political, economic, and geographic fronts, along with  the accompanying results and the extent to which these results  are reflected in the group's institutions, in order to be able  to plan policies in line with these changes in the contemporary  world, and to prepare for all future eventualities.    Al-Muhayri reaffirmed the need to intensify efforts and  support the existing cooperation between these institutions with  their interests and the interests of development in the  developing countries. Al-Muhayri also reaffirmed the need for  the collective funding of projects in cases where there is ample  will for funding in the relevant country, thus helping to  respect the terms and rules in effect for the action of these  institutions, especially when there is plenty of early  coordination between them. The director general of the Abu Dhabi  Development Fund said that the volume of Arab development aid  from 1970 through 1992 amounted to nearly $94 billion, of which  nearly $36.5 billion had been provided by the eight funds taking  part in the meeting. One hundred and five Arab and developing  countries benefited from this aid, which went to implement 2,665  funding operations. Al-Muhayri disclosed, in his remarks, the  existence of the problem of arrears in the debts of countries  receiving development aid from the institutions. He asserted the  need to make an effort to try to find suitable methods for  solving this problem and for prodding countries which are slow  to pay their debts and commitments. This would strengthen the  institutions' ability to offer more loans and aid, to move the  development process forward, and help the developing countries  to overcome the difficulties they face in the development  process.    Informed sources told AL-HAYAH that the volume of arrears  owed to the eight funds had amounted to nearly $2.101 billion at  the end of 1992, representing 5.88 percent of the volume of the  development aid they had offered.    The greatest volume of arrears are owed to the Arab Monetary  Fund, with $622.5 million, representing 25.38 percent of its  total loans, worth $2.457 billion, followed by the Saudi Fund,  whose arrears amounted to $357.995 million, representing 6.14  percent of its $5.826 billion in loans; and the Kuwaiti Fund,  with $292 million in arrears, or 4.03 percent of its $7.240  billion in loans. The OPEC Fund had $196.6 million in arrears,  or 7.03 percent of its $2.798 billion in loans, followed by the  AFESD with $188.46 million in arrears, or 3.32 percent of its  nearly $5.672 billion in loans; the Arab Bank for Economic  Development in Africa, with $181.5 million in arrears, or 16.41  percent of its $1.106 billion in loans; followed, lastly, by the  Islamic Development Bank, with $178.8 million in arrears, or  1.97 percent of its $9.09 billion in loans.    Sources in the developmental institutions' coordination  group  said that the arrears problem had not limited their activity in  carrying out their role in offering development aid to the  developing countries.    Dr. Badr Malallah, the official in charge of these  developmental institutions, said that they had provided nearly  $1.245 billion in the first half of 1993 to participate in the  funding of 133 development operations benefiting 49 developing  countries in addition to several groups, organizations, and  other agencies.    These funds were distributed among 23 loans worth $1.027  billion in various service and production sectors, $2.3 million  to fund foreign trade, and $15 million to fund numerous  activities in the field of research and the preparation of  feasibility, teaching, training, and health studies. Dr.  Malallah said that the distribution of the aid according to the  funding sources was 33.6 percent from the Arab Fund, 28.5  percent from the Kuwaiti Fund, 19.7 percent from the Islamic  Bank, 44 percent from the Abu Dhabi Development Fund, 4.8  percent from the OPEC Fund, 3 percent from the Saudi Fund, 4.9  percent from the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa,  and 1.1 percent from the Arab Monetary Fund.</p>

With a military parade, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe  (Christian Democratic Union) welcomed the last soldiers  returning from the East African country at the Cologne/Bonn  airport and officially dissolved the "Somalia Support Committee."    The minister praised the Bundeswehr for the skill it showed  in the Somalia operation. He stressed the "masterly military  achievements" of all those involved in supporting the UN blue  helmet forces. "Punctually like a German Intercity train, the  German contingents were are the disposal of the United Nations  in Beledweynne," the minister stated, addressing 197 soldiers  who had returned aboard a Bundeswehr plane from Djibouti a  little while earlier. Ruehe particularly stressed the "excellent  leadership" of the Somalia unit -- of Colonels Harf and  Kammerhoff. He awarded them the Federal Service Cross on behalf  of the federal president.    As clear as Ruehe's praise for his troops was his criticism  of the shortcomings of the United Nations -- the main reason the  German contingent was not able to supply a 4,500-men strong  Indian brigade with water, foodstuffs, and other goods, as  originally planned. Ruehe spoke of "quickly changing UN plans"  and of an "apparently not optimal cooperation between Mogadishu  and New York." He also pointed out that the United Nations had  "no solid political concept" for the peace process in Somalia.  [passage omitted]</p>

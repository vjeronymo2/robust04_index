			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT By the supercharged standards of recent media bids, Granada's offer for LWT does not appear wildly generous, representing a multiple of a mere 27 times historic earnings. LWT is trading strongly. There is a natural desire not to sell out successful management. A higher bid is always possible, especially if the rules regulating cross-ownership of the media are changed. Such thinking may yet tempt LWT shareholders to reject Granada's bid. Stand back from the fray and it is not clear that ITV contractors have a particularly rosy future. In response to the Broadcasting Act, the cossetted television industry woke up to commercial reality and cut costs with a vengeance, fuelling the sector's striking share price gains. But that process is exhausting itself. Growth will now be harder won through more advertising and programming sales. Yet ITV contractors are facing increasingly stiff competition for advertising from Channel 4 as well as cable and satellite operators. Their fixed-term franchises represent a depreciating asset. A secondary market for their television programmes has not yet developed. There is an over-capacity of production facilities. Mature television companies would be unlikely to sustain current valuations in the absence of takeover frenzy. The current wave of bids is being driven by the consolidation that occurs in any industry when regulation is relaxed. In that process, insiders can invariably afford to pay more than others due to the cost savings that can be achieved. No other bidder has emerged to match Granada's terms. That is perhaps not surprising, given Granada is offering twice the price LWT's shares were trading at before the bidder took its stake. The real issue is whether Granada is offering too, much rather than too little. LWT shareholders should be grateful for its generosity.</p>

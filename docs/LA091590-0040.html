			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQIS RAID ENVOYS' QUARTERS IN KUWAIT; 5 CONSULS DETAINED;  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS: AMERICAN DIPLOMAT WAS QUESTIONED WHEN FRENCH, CANADIAN AND BELGIAN  DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS WERE INVADED. PRESIDENT BUSH HINTS AT POSSIBLE U.S.  RESPONSE.  </P> <P> Iraqi soldiers stormed the French, Canadian and Belgian diplomatic quarters in  Kuwait on Friday, briefly detaining a U.S. consul and several other diplomats.  President Bush declared the crackdown "outrageous" and hinted at a possible  U.S. response.  </P> <P> The Iraqi troops held five Western consuls for several hours and arrested  French citizens as the occupying forces stepped up the pressure on holdout  embassies to close their doors in Kuwait city. The U.S. Embassy was not  involved in the incidents, but the U.S. consul from Baghdad was detained while  visiting at the Canadian ambassador's quarters.  </P> <P> In a stern warning, Bush said he drew no distinction between the raids on the  embassies of American allies and an attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound  itself.  </P> <P> The incidents "underscore the brutal behavior of Iraq" and "add up to clear  violations of international law," the President said.  </P> <P> "They do raise tensions; they clearly do," he added.  </P> <P> The escalation of the six-week-old confrontation interrupted a brief lull  marked by diplomatic efforts by both sides to gather allies. It was the first  time that foreign diplomatic compounds in Kuwait had been forcibly entered,  although they have been under siege and denied supplies for a month.  </P> <P> The Iraqi raids on foreign compounds appeared to be coordinated and aimed at  breaking the will of Western diplomats to hold out amid worsening conditions.  The U.S. and major European embassies have been denied water and electricity  supplies for three weeks, and Iraqi troops stationed outside their walls have  prevented anyone from entering or leaving.  </P> <P> French Foreign Ministry officials in Paris said Iraqi soldiers forced their way  into the ambassador's residence at 7 a.m., taking the military attache, Col.  Edouard Crespin, and three French civilians to an undisclosed location. Crespin  was later released, but the whereabouts of the civilians were not known, the  officials said.  </P> <P> The ambassador was out of the country when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and  the embassy has been under the command of the charge d'affaires.  </P> <P> French President Francois Mitterrand, whose country was the main Western arms  supplier to Baghdad during Iraq's 1980-88 war with Iran, called the Iraqi raid  "aggression." Speaking with reporters in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, during a  state visit, he vowed: "We will respond to it."  </P> <P> French officials said the government would announce its response after an  emergency Cabinet meeting today in Paris.  </P> <P> At the Canadian ambassador's residence in Kuwait, Iraqi troops forced their way  in before dawn, according to a Canadian diplomat in Paris. The troops detained  the Canadian consul and his counterparts from the United States, Ireland,  Britain and Australia, along with six Irish private citizens who had taken  refuge there.  </P> <P> The Canadian government said the officials were released two hours later, after  their identities as diplomats stationed in Baghdad were established. However,  there was no word about the fate of the Irish citizens.  </P> <P> State Department officials said the U.S. consul, whom they refused to identify,  had visited Kuwait frequently in recent days to arrange flights home for  American women and children. About eight Kuwait-based American diplomats,  including Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell III, remain confined to the embassy  there.  </P> <P> Despite the disruption, another flight left Kuwait on Friday, carrying about  300 American women and children aboard a U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways 747 jumbo  jet. The group was expected to reach the United States today. A U.S. Embassy  official in Baghdad said about 1,500 Americans remain trapped in Kuwait.  </P> <P> In the third incident, Belgian officials said three Iraqi soldiers entered  Brussels' diplomatic compound and tried to force its two remaining  representatives to abandon the embassy. The diplomats fled into the  ambassador's residence adjoining the embassy building.  </P> <P> In the Netherlands, meanwhile, the government disclosed that Iraqi troops had  forced their way into the home of its ambassador to Kuwait, Joop Veling,  earlier this week. No details were available.  </P> <P> The official Iraqi news agency in Baghdad denied the reports without further  comment.  </P> <P> In Paris, Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Razzak el Hashimi was summoned to the ministry  to explain the incidents in Kuwait. He denied that the 1961 Vienna Convention,  governing diplomatic relations, had been violated.  </P> <P> "There is no government of Kuwait," Razzak said. "There is no state of Kuwait.  So the Vienna Convention does not apply. . . . These people in Kuwait are no  longer diplomats because there are no longer embassies there."  </P> <P> Two weeks after invading Kuwait, President Saddam Hussein's regime ordered the  more than 60 foreign embassies there to shut down by Aug. 24 and to move their  staffs to Baghdad. Iraq insists that Kuwait no longer exists as a sovereign  state, that it is now Iraq's 19th province and that all diplomatic  representation must be based in Baghdad.  </P> <P> In the month since the order was issued, more than 40 countries have complied,  almost all under protest. The U.S. Embassy and 16 others are continuing to  resist Iraqi pressure despite meager supplies of food and water. At last  report, U.S. Ambassador Howell and nine of his officers were holding out by  drinking purified water from the embassy swimming pool.  </P> <P> The most recent embassy to give up was that of Egypt, two days ago. Like other  nations that have withdrawn their diplomats from Kuwait, Egypt has said the  embassy remained operational in principle and that Cairo still recognizes  Kuwait as an independent country.  </P> <P> From Washington, Bush spoke by telephone with Mitterrand. The President said he  told Mitterrand the matter is "of grave concern" and promised to support  whatever action the French president takes.  </P> <P> Asked if the raids on the embassies would prompt an escalation, Bush said:  "When an escalation is required from me, Saddam Hussein will know it.  </P> <P> "I'm not rattling sabers. . . . When I rattle a saber, the man will know it,"  the President added.  </P> <P> At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher denounced the Iraqi  intrusions as "another example of Iraq's blatant disregard" of a U.N. Security  Council resolution instructing Iraq to respect diplomatic missions in Kuwait.  </P> <P> The spokesman noted that Friday's incidents were "only the latest in what is a  growing number of violations of diplomatic missions in Kuwait by Iraqi  occupation forces."  </P> <P> Boucher said the U.S. deputy chief of mission in Iraq, John Wilson, had  protested the incident to the Foreign Ministry in Baghdad.  </P> <P> Similarly, in London, British Deputy Foreign Secretary William Waldegrave said  angrily: "It's another fairly grave threat. It's consistent with the illegal  position the Iraqis have taken throughout."  </P> <P> But he said it was not clear whether the Iraqi troops involved were renegades  or were acting on instructions. He said the nations of the European Community  have all agreed to assume responsibility for each other's nationals if it comes  to the point that their embassies can no longer hold out.  </P> <P> By moving against the French, the Iraqis attacked a potential moderating force  in the gulf conflict. Although the French military deployment is the  second-largest in the region after America's, France has opposed offensive  military action against Iraq.  </P> <P> But Iraq is known to feel betrayed by France, which was an important weapons  supplier during Iraq's eight-year war with Iran. In much the same way that the  United States once depended on Iran as a crucial anchor in the Middle East,  France depended on Iraq. The relationship began to fade after Iraq fell behind  in payments on $4.5 billion it owed France, mostly for weapons.  </P> <P> In a recent interview on French television, Hussein was sharply critical of  France.  </P> <P> "The only blame we have is against France," he said. "We don't directly blame  the United States or Great Britain because they were never objective. They were  never our friends."  </P> <P> Williams reported from Nicosia and Gerstenzang from Washington. Staff writers  Rone Tempest in Paris, Douglas Jehl in Washington and Mark Fineman in London  contributed to this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More on Gulf Crisis  </P> <P> ARAB SOLUTION -- Secretary of State Baker and Syrian President Assad agreed  that Arabs should take the lead in solving crisis.

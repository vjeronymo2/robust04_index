			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (2): Growth target set at 6% - The economy Most countries would have been happy with South Korea's GNP growth rate of 4.7 per cent last year. But South Koreans regarded the performance as being close to disastrous because it marked a 12-year low in economic growth. Small wonder, then, that Mr Kim Young-sam, in an attempt to gain popularity during his first month as the country's new president, announced in March a stimulative package to show he was rapidly tackling economic problems. The government has set a 1993 growth target of 6 per cent. The main cause of the economic slowdown last year was sluggish demand for Korean exports in its main overseas markets - the US, the EC and Japan - which were in the middle of a recession. At home, a tight monetary policy, which had been imposed to cool the overheated economy, dampened domestic demand. The quick-fix economic plan proposed by Mr Kim included providing subsidised loans to small and medium-sized companies, which suffered a record number of bankruptcies in 1992. Administrative rules hampering business investment were eased. A cut of 0.5-1 per cent in regulated interest rates, which caused commercial rates to fall below 10 per cent, was meant to boost fixed investments, which contracted by 5.3 per cent last year. The government also brought forward planned spending on infrastructure projects. Mr Cho Soon, a strong advocate of the tight money policy, was dismissed as governor of the central bank and replaced by Mr Kim Myung-ho, who supported the government's decision to increase the money supply this year. Critics, however, dismissed the plan as a panic reaction which would do little to solve the structural problems that are hampering the country's economic development. The central problem confronting Korea's export-led economy is the loss of international competitiveness due to the rise in labour and production costs that followed the introduction of democracy and the growth of the trade union movement. Productivity growth has not matched wage increases. This development has coincided with increased trade competition from low-cost producers, such as China and the south-east Asia countries. Korea needs to increase the development of higher value-added products, while reducing its dependence on labour-intensive light industries. But the necessary industrial restructuring is being blocked by an ossified and government-dominated financial system which is causing distortions in capital allocation. Mr Kim's announcement that he was delaying proposed financial liberalisation measures - including interest rate deregulation, because it could adversely affect economic growth this year - increased doubts about the new administration's commitment to economic reform. Instead, the new government appeared to be falling into the same 'stop-and-go' pattern of economic policy that characterised the previous administration of President Roh Tae-woo, which boosted growth through state intervention when the economy grew sluggish and then applied the monetary brakes when the economy overheated in reaction to the stimulation measures. 'The number one priority of the new government is economic recovery. They are reluctant to do anything that would hurt that recovery,' said Mr Lee Hahn-koo, president of the Daewoo Research Institute. But some economists argue that the government should have given the stabilisation policy another six months or a year to work. They fear that loosening credit controls now will rekindle inflation just as it is about to be brought under control. Inflation fell from 9.3 per cent in 1991 to 6.2 per cent in 1992. The government, however, argues that inflation will remain low because of proposed limits on prices and wages. Salaries for state employees have been frozen, along with charges for government services. The Korea Federation of Trade Unions has tentatively agreed to accept a guideline on wage growth of 5-9 per cent this year against 16 per cent in 1992. The nation's big conglomerates have promised to limit price increases on consumer products. However, restrictions on wages could undermine the government's effort to stimulate the economy, which has relied heavily on domestic demand for growth during the past few years. Low wage growth this year is believed likely to encourage consumers to save rather than spend, particularly when the economic outlook remains uncertain. Growth in private consumption has already fallen from 11.5 per cent in 1990 to 6.4 per cent in 1992. The government hopes to revive industrial investment as a means to boost growth, but that tactic also looks uncertain. Many industries have cut back on investments because they are already burdened with excess production capacity after a feverish expansion of facilities between 1986 and 1991. One indication of weak corporate investment demand is that the banks are finding it difficult to lend money to creditworthy borrowers for the first time in a decade despite falling interest rates. There are worries, however, that companies may take advantage of the improved credit environment to expand into new business areas rather than make sound investments in facilities and research and development. Instead of business diversification, 'companies will need to become more efficient in order to regain their international competitiveness,' according to the Seoul office of Barclays de Zeote Wedd. 'The one risk is that the government's loose monetary policy may lead to. . . delaying the pain which many companies need in order to establish a sound business base.' Many private economists estimate GNP growth will reach only about 5 per cent this year because domestic demand will not significantly improve. One bright spot, however, is the growth in exports. This is primarily the result of the Korean won's depreciation against the Japanese yen, which has boosted sales of vehicles, petrochemicals, semiconductors and ships. But rising exports also reflect the willingness of Korean producers to accept marginal profits on overseas sales to reduce the excess stock that has built up due to faltering domestic demand.</p>

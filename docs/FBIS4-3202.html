			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Chen Hua (7115 5478) and XINHUA </F> reporter Jin Xiaoming (6855 1420 2494)]    [Text] Chengdu, 17 Apr (XINHUA) -- The eighth annual  meeting of the Chinese Workers' Ideological and Political Work  Society was held in Sichuan's Deyang city today. All  representatives to the meeting reached a consensus that  enterprises' ideological and political work should be  subordinated to and serve the whole party's overall work, which  is guided by the principle of "seizing the opportunity,  deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and  maintaining stability."    Attending the five-day annual meeting were representatives  of  30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities as well as  relevant ministries and commissions. Also attending were more  than 100 representatives from enterprises. They will study and  exchange ideas, practices, and experiences concerning how to  further strengthen and improve enterprises' ideological and  political work under the new situation of building a socialist  market economy. They will also amend the society's charter and  elect directors for the new term to form a new leading organ.    Xu Weicheng, deputy executive head of the Propaganda  Department, presided over today's meeting.    Yuan Baohua, chairman of the Chinese Workers' Ideological  and  Political Work Society, gave a report at the meeting. He said:  Exploring new ways to promote enterprises' ideological and  political work is of very important significance in ensuring the  smooth progress of enterprises' reform and the coordinated  construction of material and spiritual civilizations.    Yuan Baohua continued: As far as enterprises' ideological  and political work is concerned, the current situation provides  both opportunity and challenge. During the course of carrying  out this year's reform, which is wide in scope and great in  difficulty, some unexpected problems and some confused thinking  might crop up. It is imperative for us to knuckle down to our  ideological and political work, with a clear objective in mind.  The publication of Volume Three of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping has provided us with most effective weapons  for carrying out this task.    Yuan Baohua emphatically said: The primary objective of this  year's work is to ensure that enterprises will carry out the  tasks of arming the whole party with the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is necessary to  follow the mass line, carry out enterprises' democratic  management, carry forward a hard working spirit, and combat  negative and corruptive phenomena. Meanwhile, in the light of  workers' ideological realities, we should try to find new ways  to carry out this work under the new situation. To carry out our  work in the new period, it is necessary to pay attention to  spiritual civilization construction by fostering a correct  outlook on life and sense of value among workers. Meanwhile,  during the course in which state-owned enterprises are  establishing and improving their leadership and making it  consistent with the modern enterprise system, the party,  government, and trade unions should focus on improving  production and management and try to knuckle down to our  ideological and political work in all aspects.    While talking about the ideological and political work in  our  drive to change enterprises' management mechanisms, Chen  Qingtai, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade  Commission, said: The drive to change the management mechanism  requires us to use ideological and political work to stir  workers' enthusiasm in participating in reform and to correctly  handle the relationship between the concept of invigorating  enterprises and that of straightening out their internal  management, between the concept of workers becoming the master  of the country and that of becoming good workers, between the  concept of some people becoming prosperous first and that of  achieving common prosperity, as well as between the concept of  increasing labor productivity and that of increasing workers'  incomes. He urged that enterprises' ideological and political  work should be applied to the whole process of production and  management. Self-education in various forms should be conducted  among workers. In addition, ideological and political work  should be institutionalized.    In his speech, Xue Zhaoyun, vice chairman of the All-China  Federation of Trade Unions, said: The All-China Federation of  Trade Unions should concentrate on routine mass ideological and  political work. At present, we should focus on two things:  First, it is necessary to help workers enhance their  understanding and adaptability to reform policies and methods.  Second, we should solve contradictions in a timely fashion and  help workers adjust various personal relations on the basis of  mutual concern, understanding, and respect.</p>

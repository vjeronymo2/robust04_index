			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia expects bigger coconut crop WORLD COCONUT production is expected to rise by 3.4 per cent this year, leading to an increase in the exports of coconut products such as oil, copra meal and copra, according to the Asian and Pacific Coconut Community. The APCC, whose members account for over 80 per cent of the world crop, estimate 1993 production at 9.2m tonnes copra equivalent, up from 8.9m tonnes last year. Indonesia is expected to remain the largest producer with a crop this year of 2.4m tonnes copra equivalent, followed by the Philippines with 2.2m tonnes and India with 1.5m tonnes. World exports of coconut oil are forecast to rise less than 2 per cent this year to 1.5m tonnes, although much depends on how Indonesian producers react to the decline in the world price, which fell 26 per cent last year to end 1992 at Dollars 470 a tonne. Indonesia exported an estimated 300,000 tonnes of coconut oil in 1992, up from 197,633 tonnes in 1991 but, industry officials say, producers can switch back to the domestic market, which consumes up to 800,000 tonnes a year. APCC officials say the world price of coconut oil will also depend on world production of palm kernel oil, its main competitor, which has risen steadily from 1m tonnes in 1987 to 1.48m tonnes by 1991. World exports of copra meal, used for animal feed, are forecast to reach 1m tonnes this year, up from 952,000 in 1992. APCC officials say European Community toxin regulations have curtailed EC imports of copra meal and the world price of copra meal fell 10 per cent last year to Dollars 143 a tonne. World exports of copra are forecast to rise 14 per cent to 255,500 tonnes this year, whilst those of desiccated coconut are expected to reach 203,000 tonnes, up 3 per cent on last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Today, the press  service of the Russian president released the text of Boris  Yeltsin's statement. In particular, it says:    "The Russian Federation is pursuing a consistent course of  normalizing its relations with the Latvian Republic and moving  them onto a footing of good-neighborliness and equal mutually  advantageous cooperation with a steadfast observance of human  rights.    I believe that the agreements on military matters, which  were  initialled this March, create a contractual and legal basis for  the completion of the withdrawal of Russian troops from the  territory of Latvia, and for a civilized solution to the issues  connected with it. They have become possible as a result of  sensible compromises and responsible approaches and meet the  true and long-term interests of not merely the peoples of our  countries, but of the region and Europe as a whole.    In this connection, I especially stress that we were not  going and are not going to create military bases on the  territory of Latvia. It is a matter only of the temporary  functioning of one Russian military establishment under civilian  control -- the radar station in the town of Skrunda.    I believe that in the very near future my meeting with  President G. Ulmanis will take place, during it a package of  initialled agreements will be signed, and this will become a  turning point in relations between our countries."</p>

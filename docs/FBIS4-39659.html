			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk stated that  following the withdrawal of nuclear weapons, the Ukrainian army  will be equipped with high-precision weapons, which are not  weapons of mass destruction.    He told the cadets of the Zhitomir military school that  Ukraine, Russia, the U.S. and other countries were working on  this type of weapon.    The acquisition of high-precision weapons is provided for in  the Ukrainian military doctrine, approved by the Ukrainian  parliament in November 1993.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Uncertainty again keeps dealers on the sidelines New issuance in the Eurobond market got off to a slow start yesterday as continuing uncertainty in the financial markets kept investors and issuers at the sidelines. However, syndicate managers reported that there were several deals in the pipeline. The National Bank of Hungary has awarded the mandate for its first global offering to Salomon Brothers and the deal could be launched towards the end of next week. The issue is expected to raise between Dollars 500m and Dollars 750m, have a maturity of 10 years and be priced to yield between 225 and 250 basis points over 10-year US treasuries. World Bank officials are due in London today to give details of its forthcoming Dollars 5bn global multi-currency note programme. The facility, which is expected to be signed in the next two weeks, is designed to facilitate the launch of structured products. Among yesterday's sparse offerings, Credit Local de France raised CDollars 250m through an offering of 12-year Eurobonds. An official at lead manager Paribas acknowledged that the bonds were tightly priced at 20 basis points over the yield on 10-year Canadian government bonds, giving a spread of 15 basis points over the interpolated 12-year yield curve. However, he noted that the issuer had been less aggressive than usual in obtaining longer-dated funding and had missed its funding targets by between five to 10 basis points. The issuer was believed to have swapped the proceeds of the issue into floating-rate dollars. The official added that the bonds were attractive to investors who felt that the yield differential between 10-year Canadian government bonds and US treasuries would narrow to around 50 basis points from 70 basis points currently. When Credit Local's bonds were freed to trade they were quoted at 98.70 bid, down from their re-offer price of 99.125, which reflected the weak opening in Canadian government bonds. Credito Italiano and ABB raised L200bn each through offerings of five-year floating-rate notes and 10-year Eurobonds respectively. Both issuers took advantage of the recent strength in the Italian government bond market and investor demand for yield. Credito Italiano's deal, the first FRN offering denominated in lira to be issued by an Italian bank, was targeted mainly at Italian investors who were seeking the protection of a floating-rate instrument in the run-up to the general election in March, an official at Credito Italiano said. Late in the day, the Republic of Colombia launched its first offering in the Yankee market - the US domestic market for foreign issuers. The Dollars 250m, 10-year offering, via Merrill Lynch, is due to be priced today to yield around 150 basis points over US treasuries.</p>

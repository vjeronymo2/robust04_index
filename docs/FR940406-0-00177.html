Safety Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, NHTSA has evaluated several safety rulemakings for their potential impacts on light truck fuel economy in MYs 1996&hyph;97. These include revisions to FMVSS Nos. 208,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Occupant Crash Protection;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 214,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Side Impact Protection;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 216,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Roof Crush Resistance;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 108,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and 201,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Occupant Protection in Interior Impacts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the agency is considering whether to propose a safety standard to improve rollover protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. FMVSS 208  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 26, 1991, NHTSA published (56 FR 12472) a final rule requiring automatic restraints on trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8500 pounds or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 5500 pounds or less. These requirements phase in at the following rate for each manufacturer: 20 percent of light trucks manufactured from September 1, 1994 to August 31, 1995; 50 percent of light trucks manufactured from September 1, 1995 to August 31, 1996; 90 percent of light trucks manufactured from September 1, 1996 to August 31, 1997; and all light trucks manufactured on or after September 1, 1997. Thus, the requirement will affect 50 percent of MY 1996 light trucks and 90 percent of MY 1997 light trucks. Although light truck manufacturers may comply, as passenger car manufacturers have in the past, with the automatic restraint requirements by using automatic belts or air bags, NHTSA expects that essentially all light truck manufacturers will comply by using air bags.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To encourage the use of more innovative automatic restraint systems (primarily air bags) in light trucks, during the first four years of the phase-in (i.e., through MY 1998) manufacturers may count each light truck equipped with such a restraint system for the driver's position, and a dynamically tested manual safety belt for the right-front passenger's position, as a vehicle complying with the automatic restraint requirements. Beginning with MY 1999, however, all light trucks are required to provide automatic restraints for both the driver and right-front passenger positions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title II of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required NHTSA to amend its automatic restraint requirements to mandate that 80 percent of MY 1998, and all MY 1999 light trucks be equipped with driver and passenger-side air bags. On September 2, 1993, NHTSA published a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 46551) to implement this requirement. Since NHTSA expects that essentially all manufacturers will rely on air bags for compliance with the light truck automatic restraints requirements, this provision should have a negligible substantive impact, and will not affect MYs 1996&hyph;97 fuel economy capabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Since the Paris peace agreement on Cambodia, China  and some Western countries have withdrawn all support from the  Khmer Rouge [KR]. However, the communist guerrillas are  continuing their war against the elected government in Phnom  Penh.    The Khmer Rouge actually possesses millions of dollars and  an  arms arsenal that, in the opinion of Western intelligence  services, "is more than enough for another five years of  fighting." The Marxists, who tried to turn the country into a  peasant state under their terror regime from 1975 to the end of  1978, have become capitalists.    "The Khmer Rouge are plundering our country's natural  resources in order to be able to continue their war," Phnom  Penh's Information Minister Ieng Muli complained to FOCUS.  Their main source of income is from the exploitation of  precious stones in Pailin. The city, about 40 km from the Thai  border, is in the fourth of the country controlled by the Khmer  Rouge. "The Khmer Rouge's monthly income from granting licenses  for the exploitation of sapphires and rubies is about $10  million a month," Muli stated.    Cambodian Government troops are planning a major attack on  Pailin. This strategic base should be conquered by the end of  the dry season in June, a high-ranking officer in Phnom Penh  predicts. Against the background of the continuing guerrilla  warfare, Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk has called for  reconciliation between the Khmer Rouge and the government. If  the fighting is not brought to an end, it will mean "the death  of Cambodia."    The Marxists earn another $2 million a month with wood. The  illegally felled timber, mainly fine wood from the north of  Cambodia, crosses the border to Thailand on secret paths.  Japanese firms have built sawmills in the land of the Khmer.    The business is hard to prevent on the Thai side.  High-ranking army officers have shares in the companies. If  vigorous action is taken against them, Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai can expect a new putsch.</p>

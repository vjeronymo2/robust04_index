			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE VET: TENACITY NEEDED IN TREATING FELINE ACNE  </P> <P> Q: My question is about a condition my cat has on her chin, namely little brown  flakes. This started during the flea season last September. I just assumed the  condition was caused by fleas. I was told it had to do with the hair follicles,  too much oil.  </P> <P> She was given an antibiotic and the following treatment prescribed: shampoo the  area twice a day with Pyoben Gel shampoo, soak for 10 minutes, rinse thoroughly  with fresh water, towel dry and then swab with rubbing alcohol. The treatment  started Sept. 29 and continued through Oct. 6. The condition improved somewhat.  </P> <P> I was told to continue the treatment once a day, which I have done every day  since Oct. 6 and am continuing to do so. There is some improvement, some days  no flakes and then they come back again.  </P> <P> Is there a treatment you can recommend for this condition other than the above?  Also, I was told plastic dishes can be the source of this condition. My cat has  never used plastic dishes, only stainless steel. Her food is Science Diet  Feline Maintenance for the past two years, and she is an indoor cat.  </P> <P> Henriette King, San Clemente  </P> <P> A: I certainly admire your tenacity and thoroughness in treating your cat's  condition.  </P> <P> Such a condition is commonly called feline acne, although it is not related to  the human condition. There are generally comedones or "black heads" on the chin  and lower lips. The cause of the syndrome is not completely understood and  varies from chronic skin disease to contact with irritants, such as a plastic  bowl.  </P> <P> Treatment of uncomplicated cases is exactly as you describe, cleaning the area  with a keratolytic shampoo and the use of astringents such as benzoyl peroxide.  Alcohol can become very irritating to the skin with long-term use. If the  comedones become secondarily infected, antibiotics and hot packing of the area  may help.  </P> <P> It is unfortunate the recurrence of the acne is most common and such  maintenance treatment is necessary. It would be beneficial to do some skin  scrapings to rule out the possibility of a dermal parasite. A skin biopsy may  be helpful in locating any secondary conditions or causes for the problem.  </P> <P> Q: In the past two months, my cat has been vomiting his food within a few hours  of eating. He tends to vomit the canned food more than the dry.  </P> <P> I have tried several varieties of canned food, but he still seems to have  problems keeping it down. The dry food doesn't seem to bother him as much.  </P> <P> Should I stop the canned food and feed him only dry? Is there any medicine I  can give him to help keep him from vomiting?  </P> <P> Loren Baccus, Santa Ana  </P> <P> A: Your cat is apparently sensitive to the canned food, and medication may not  help improve this situation. Canned foods may be too "rich" for him or he may  have some difficulty in digesting the fats.  </P> <P> You might try to make a list of canned foods that he is able to eat without too  much difficulty and feed these in lesser amount with his dry food. It may be  helpful to switch your cat to a prescription diet such as C/D or K/D from your  veterinarian.  </P> <P> If your cat continues to vomit with the above changes, an examination will be  necessary to make sure there are no other gastrointestinal problems.  </P></p>

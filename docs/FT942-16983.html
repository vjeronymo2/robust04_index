			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Swedish forester abandons Pounds 230m French expansion plan SCA, Sweden's second largest forestry group, yesterday tore up a FFr2bn (Pounds 230m) plan to buy 89.8 per cent of Otor Holding, one of France's biggest packaging companies. It also scrapped plans for a SKr1bn share issue to foreign investors, which would have partially funded the purchase. The company said: 'SCA and the principal shareholders of Otor have not been able to agree on final terms for the acquisition of Otor by SCA.' It declined to elaborate. However, it appears the Swedish group became disenchanted with the deal after Stora, its leading domestic rival, claimed to have first refusal on the stake. Stora holds 10.2 per cent of Otor. SCA said that Otor's main owners, Mr Jean-Yves Bacques and family, had presented documents showing that the pre-emption rights did not exist, but Stora was sticking by its position yesterday. SCA stressed that it was not blaming Stora for the collapse of the deal, noting that it had had a 'constructive dialogue' with the company. Stora insisted it had not planned to exercise its first refusal option and said it had been willing to sell its existing stake to its rival. SCA announced the preliminary agreement to buy Otor less than three weeks ago. The move would have increased its share of the European packaging market in products such as corrugated board from 9 to to 11 per cent, assisting its wider ambition of building a 15 per cent market position. It would have become the second largest packaging company in France, with its market share rising from 4.5 to nearly 17 per cent. The group maintains its expansion strategy will continue. However, analysts interpreted the announcement as a setback. 'This means that they will not be nearly as strong as they had hoped to be in the French market,' said Mr Denis Christie, paper and packaging analyst with James Capel in London. Under the deal, SCA would have paid FFr1.77bn initially. Mr Bacques and family would have subscribed to SKr300m of the share issue, with the balance going to international investors.</p>

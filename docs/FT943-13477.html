			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Mainly muted response to company news Wall Street US equities improved slightly yesterday in a quiet session highlighted by a fresh batch of corporate results, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.62 higher at 3,755.43, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.06 firmer at 455.22. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 1.04 ahead at 432.59 and the Nasdaq composite added 1.26 at 722.62. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 227m shares. The opening was weak, following a pattern which is typical of Monday mornings which follow 'double witching' rallies. Yesterday, the Dow tumbled about 15 points in the first minutes of activity, wiping out most of the expiration-related gains struck in the final minutes of trading last week. Apart from the technical considerations, the restrained tone reflected anticipation of tomorrow's semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan. The Federal Reserve Board chief will brief a Senate committee on the state of the economy, and investors were hoping for hints on the timing of the next move to raise interest rates. As the day progressed, market indices managed to climb off the session's lows, pushing into positive territory by mid-afternoon. An absence of fresh economic news, and benign trends on the bond and currency markets, provided an uncluttered vantage point from which to scrutinise the second-quarter performances of several market bellwethers. For better or worse, the reaction to the results was generally muted. Chase Manhattan posted net income of Dollars 307m in the second three months of 1994, well ahead of its 1993 result of Dollars 233m, but the stock finished unchanged at Dollars 38 3/4 . Nationsbank also beat the forecasts of analysts, publishing a 42 per cent improvement in earnings, but its share price nudged only Dollars 5/8 ahead to Dollars 55 1/8 . In pharmaceuticals, Upjohn issued a strong earnings report but the reaction of investors was tepid. The stock added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 30 1/2 . US West, near the top of the NYSE's most active list, dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 40 3/8 in volume of 2.8m shares. The regional telephone group's earnings showed no improvement from the previous year, but the downturn in its share price was more a reflection of a decision to purchase two Atlanta cable television operations and a downgrading by Goldman Sachs. On the Nasdaq, Microsoft was marked up Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 50 1/2 after settling a four-year federal antitrust lawsuit. Analysts played down the impact of the agreement on the company's domination of the computer software industry. Synergen plunged Dollars 4 3/8 , or nearly 50 per cent, to Dollars 4 1/2 after announcing that its leading drug prospect had performed poorly in recent clinical trials. Canada The Toronto market was also a shade higher following a session of low turnover. The TSE 300 composite index added 6.4 at 4,199.8 after spending most of the day little changed from Friday's closing level. Advances outnumbered declines by 369 to 342 after volume of 33.9m shares, well below Friday's 53.2m. Trading value was CDollars 276.4m. The 14 stock groups were evenly divided between winners and losers. Real estate recorded the day's biggest change, rising 1.85 per cent. Industrial products and mining gained 1.15 and 1.07 per cent.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Scandal forces Gonzalez to cancel trip Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, yesterday cancelled an official trip he was due to start today to Romania and Bulgaria because of the growing political storm over corruption and illicit gains in the country. Mr Antoni Asuncion, the interior minister, submitted his resignation at the weekend in a move which reflected acute embarrassment in the socialist government over the disappearance of Mr Luis Roldan, former head of the paramilitary Civil Guard, wanted for questioning by an examining magistrate. Mr Gonzalez postponed accepting Mr Asuncion's resignation, telling him to step up the search for Mr Roldan. The Madrid daily newspaper El Mundo is expected today to publish an interview with Mr Roldan at a secret location, in which he threatens to make damaging revelations. Before he disappeared, Mr Roldan said he would reveal information that would harm the Socialists. The affair, along with allegations of tax evasion by Mr Mariano Rubio, former Bank of Spain governor, increasingly risks jeopardising the future of Mr Gonzalez's minority government. Mr Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalan nationalist party on which the Socialists depend for a parliamentary majority, raised the possibility of a snap election if Mr Gonzalez fails to bring the situation under control. The conservative opposition Popular party has issued fresh calls for Mr Gonzalez to resign. Mr Asuncion, a former director of prisons, was appointed only five months ago. His predecessor, Mr Jose Luis Corcuera, resigned when a law including new search powers was ruled unconstitutional. The latter has also come under attack because of the Roldan affair. Hundreds of police and army personnel are engaged in the search for Mr Roldan, who faces arrest over alleged tax and other offences. A parliamentary committee has heard evidence that he received millions of dollars in commissions for building works.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 4 May (EFE) -- Today, Chilean President  Eduardo Frei met with Inter-American Press Association [IAPA]  President Raul E. Kraiselburd, who is an Argentine citizen, and  with other members of the IAPA executive board.    The IAPA representatives reiterated to Frei their rejection  of the requirement that every journalist have a university  degree to be able to practice journalism in Chile. The  requirement is included in the new press law proposal the  executive branch has submitted to Congress.    IAPA, which represents owners of 1,300 print media  organizations in the continent, has repeatedly criticized the  above requirement through resolutions issued during its  assemblies.    Kraiselburd handed Frei a copy of the Chapultepec  Declaration, which outlines the IAPA position on freedom of  expression adopted in a continental meeting held recently in  Mexico.    Attending the meeting with Frei were IAPA directors Andres  Garcia Lavin of Mexico, Roberto Pulido of Chile, Danilo Arbilla  of Uruguay, Oliver Clark of Jamaica, and IAPA executive director  Julio E. Munoz.    The IAPA directors are attending an international seminar on  "Development of Mass Media and Democracy in Latin America and  the Caribbean." It opened in Santiago on 2 May and is scheduled  to conclude on 6 May.</p>

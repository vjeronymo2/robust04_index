			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Deutsche Bank does not need any lessons Sir, Your coverage of the news that Deutsche Bank is to move its non-D-Mark investment banking operation to London, and further integrate Morgan Grenfell, seemed to smack of a little football-terrace xenophobia and jingoism (Survey of Germany, November 21). As an independent observer unconnected with either house, the message I received from the FT was of a British victory of a sophisticated investment bank showing the way to a vast banking Euro-bureaucrat. When it comes down to who is benefiting from whose investment banking expertise, I feel that you have got it the wrong way round - unless you believe that a small domestically-focused mergers and acquisitions bank which made a hash of its equity securities operation can teach a great deal about non-M&amp;A investment banking to a parent that has topped Eurobond league tables, has figured heavily in international equity issues, and runs a thriving range of capital markets operations (including gilts and derivatives). Your articles informed me on at least two occasions that investment banking is an 'Anglo-Saxon culture' business, whatever that ghastly Americanism may mean. I am no geographer, but I would imagine that such great names as Warburg, Lehman, Samuel, Schroder, Salomon, Rothschild, Goldman, Hambro and Kleinwort have at least part of their roots rather closer to Frankfurt than London. Put another way, maybe the Saxons will triumph over the Anglos, as Germany's pre-eminent position in industrial Europe is mirrored in the world of investment banking.

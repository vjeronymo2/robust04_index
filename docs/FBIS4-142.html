			<p>BFN     [Text] Mogadishu, April 4 (AFP) -- An American Doctor  working for the International Committee of the Red Cross  abducted by Somali gunmen last last week has been released,  relief agency sources said Monday [4 April].    Alfred Petters, 39, a cholera expert, was kidnapped on  Thursday as he drove from Benaadir Hospital, south of Mogadishu,  to the Red Cross headquarters a short distance away. No further  details were immediately available about circumstances of the  release.    Fifteen gunmen in three cars described by an eyewitness "as  very aggressive" ambushed the Red Cross cars, ordered everyone  out, shot dead a Somali guard and drove away with Petters.    Petters, who was on his second tour of duty in this  war-ravaged east African country was the first Red Cross worker  to be kidnapped in Somalia.</p>

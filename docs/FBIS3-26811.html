On the morning of 8 February, Director Chen joyfully got  together with personnel of the Nagqu prefectural party committee  Propaganda Department. He extended New Year and Spring Festival  greetings to them on behalf of the regional party committee and  its Propaganda Department. [passage omitted]    Chen Hanchang said: The situation on the nation's propaganda  front has entered another high tide since the founding of the  PRC. We must remain sober-headed and maintain a sense of trials  and tribulations [you huan yi shi]. Although China has broken  the Western economic blockade and sanctions, Western countries  have stepped up activities to Westernize and divide us. In our  region, the struggle against separatism will continue to be a  long-term task. We must act in line with the central  authorities' demands, step up propaganda and ideological work,  and educate and train well our next generation to turn it into a  new generation of qualified personnel who will span this and  next century.    Director Chen said: Along with the deepening of reform and  opening up, China's economy has entered a phase of vigorous  development. While recognizing the current excellent situation,  we must also realize where the region lacks. After the  promulgation of the region's economic reform measures, we must  subordinate ourselves to and serve the needs of the region's  overall interests. The responsibility of the propaganda  departments will hence become even heavier. We must immerse  ourselves in the grass roots to do a good job of propaganda and  guidance to ensure smooth implementation of reform measures.    Director Chen urged propaganda personnel to learn to pluck  up  their spirits constantly and work in a down-to-earth manner and  with a stronger faith to score new success and raise propaganda  and ideological work to a higher level in the New Year.

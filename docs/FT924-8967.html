			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (5): The FT Top 100 resorts - Arnold Wilson's guide to the most perfect pistes ALTA Even all the blood once spilt in countless bar-room brawls and shoot-outs (eg at the Bucket Of Blood Saloon) could not soak up Alta's 'greatest snow on earth.' Once a lawless Utah mining town destroyed by fire and avalanche, Alta's reputation is now whiter-than-white. When the snow - sometimes as dry as talcum powder after crossing the US West Coast deserts - falls deep, Alta is a mecca for ski-bums. It is criss-crossed with chutes and bowls and secret powder caches within hiking distance of Wildcat, Supreme, Westward Ho and Eagles Nest. But there is plenty of good skiing for beginners and intermediates too, and it has one of the cheapest lift passes in the Rockies. Heights: Resort 8,500 ft. Skiing: 10,550 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 25% Intermediate 40% Advanced 35%. Transfer: 32 miles from Salt Lake City airport. LES ARCS Les Arcs is a great ski area posing as merely a good one. It is probably France's most innovative resort, known principally for its Flying Kilometre Olympic course, which recreational skiers can try from a half-way stage, and  -at the other end of the scale - the ski evolutif short-ski learning programme, which the resort pioneered. In the middle ground, Les Arcs has dozens of fast cruising runs and its off-piste is virtually limitless. The long run down to Villaroger is one of the classic off-piste descents in the alps, and its focal mountain - the Aiguille Rouge - has superb off-piste runs off both shoulders. One of the classic purpose-built resorts, Les Arcs is built on three levels: 1,600, 1,800 and 2,000. Heights: Resort 5,904 ft Skiing 10,580 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 17 per cent Intermediate 49 per cent Advanced 34 per cent ALPE D'HUEZ The Dauphine region is not as well known as the Tarentaise resorts, but Alpe d'Huez and its neighbour Les Deux Alpes are unquestionably major ski resorts. Alpe d'Huez is a large, sunny, many-splendoured expanse of enormously varied skiing with half a dozen different areas containing everything from dramatic off-piste, long, steep black runs, swooping motorway skiing, and gentle nursery slopes. The focal point is the Pic Blanc, from which gloriously long off piste itineraries right down to the village can be attempted. There are also off-piste of unusual quality right down to the villages of Oz en Oisans and Vaujany. The Pic Blanc is the starting point for some of the longest black runs in the alps including the Sarenne, which ten miles long. La Combe du Loup is another tough, long black run with an even tougher variant, the Chateau Noir. The Signal area - linked with Villard-Reculas - will excite intermediates who want to bomb in wide open spaces. Heights: Resort 6,100 ft Skiing 10,998 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 65 per cent, Intermediate 23 per cent, Advanced 12 per cent. ST ANTON Most Austrian resorts are moderate in size and big on Alpine charm. St Anton is not typical. Austria's No 1 resort spirals alongside the mainline route from Switzerland to Italy (you can travel home from the slopes on the Venice-Simplon Orient Express) and although far from charmless it is too towny to be quintessential picture postcard material, although its near neighbour and tiny satellite St Christoph is as delicate and pretty as St Anton is big and bustling. There are compensations however. The skiing and scenery are outstanding. Of the four main areas, the most sought-after is the Valuga, which is networked with meaty red runs and testing blacks. And for those with nerves of steel there is a little known route down to Zurs via the North Face which is accessed by a small yellow cable car in which you can only travel if accompanied by a qualified high-mountain guide. Some of the lifts in St Anton - such as the Schindlerspitze - seem to have been constructed in mind-bogglingly difficult but awe-inspiringly beautiful terrain. Heights: Resort 4,210 ft. Skiing: 9,222 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 30% Intermediate 52% Advanced 18%. Transfer: 3+ hours from Zurich. Mainline station in St Anton. (606 miles from Calais). ARGENTIERE/CHAMONIX Is this famous French area the greatest show on ice? Many keen skiers regard Argentiere's Grands Montets as the best ski mountain in Europe, particularly in powder. For slightly less intrepid skiers, one of the many other ski areas dotted around the spectacular Chamonix Valley - such as Brevent, Flegere and Les Houches - is bound to offer appropriate terrain. Much of Argentiere is off-piste. If you ski the top section you are on the glacier and there is a danger from crevasses. If you plan to ski it properly, a guide will considerably enhance your chances of pleasure - and survival. One of the highlights is the possibility of venturing - at your guide's discretion - into the edge of the Argentiere Glacier. There are places near the Point de Vue where you can ski a little way through the surreal, dreamlike ice-scape of seracs - a sort of petrified forest of ice-blocs. The challenging Pas de chevre (Goat's Hop) is one of Europe's classics, leading down to the Mer de Glace, a dramatic glacier that forms a border between the skiing at Argentiere and the Vallee Blanche, Chamonix's best known run. This is a spectacular and quite gruelling off-piste descent although the skiing itself is not difficult. It enables intermediates to enjoy one of the longest (13 miles) and most scenic off-piste adventures without having to worry too much about technique. A guide is essential because of crevasse danger. Heights: Resort 4,067 ft. Skiing: 12,431 ft. Difficulty of runs: On piste: Beginner 10% Intermediate 70% Advanced 20%. Off-piste: 100% intermediate/advanced. Transfer: 1+ hours from Geneva. Train station in Chamonix (562 miles from Calais). ARABBA Although not a large resort - the population is only around 350 and tourist beds are scarce - Arabba is perhaps the best of the rest (after Selva and Cortina) of the huge collection of ski resorts that form the central crown of the Italian Dolomites, the Sella Ronda. Arabba, at the base of the spectacular Sella Massif, is linked with the Passo Pordoi (with good off-piste opportunities on the Gruppo Sella) and Alta Badia. The resort is one of the main calling points for skiers doing the Sella circuit, and its north-facing mountain provides a number of long and quite breathtaking runs. Heights: Resort 5,254 ft. Skiing: 9,676 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 41 % Intermediate 45% Advanced 14%. Transfer: Approx 4 hours from Verona, 6 hours from Milan, Munich or Treviso. (766 miles from Calais). THE ASPENS For all the American glitz and hype, Aspen is difficult to hate and easy to love. It can't help its starry image and it is trying to get rid of it rather than scare jetless mortals away with its perceived 'don't bother to come unless you're rich or famous' attitudes. These days Aspen is trying to return just a little to its humble roots - or at least take itself a little less seriously. It was tatty and ramshackle enough when the early miners shivered in the camp that was once called Ute City. Even its location - in Roaring Fork Valley - sounds more like a TV soap opera than real life. But do go. The skiing is great, the atmosphere is fun, the town is pretty and the natives are actually quite friendly. They have to be if Aspen isn't to miss the bus. With 'upstart' resorts like Breckenridge and Vail doing so well, Aspen has had to own up to more than a touch of 'fat cat' arrogance in the past that has alienated some of its clients - something even Aspen can ill-afford during a recession. There's only one town - with almost 100 restaurants offering every kind of cuisine - but four separate resorts. The skiing at Aspen itself is on Aspen Mountain - also known as Ajax. At the bottom of the mountain is Little Nell's hotel, whose sundeck is the location for the nightly gathering of skiers relaxing with their apres-ski drinks to the sound of heavy metal as the sun goes down after a day of excitement on Ajax. Seventy five picturesque trails are squeezed and cut into a fairly steep forested mountain served by a fast, modern gondola, the Silver Queen. Many are fast cruising runs like Copper Bowl, Spar Gulch and the exhilarating Ruthie's: others are short, steep double-diamond (extra-difficult) mogul chutes, like Zaugg Dump and Last Dollar, some of which were made by miners shovelling debris down the slopes as they tunnelled into the mountain. The next resort along - Aspen Highlands - is the maverick resort of the four, the only one which is not controlled by the Aspen Ski Company. It's hard-up, with old fashioned lifts, but it has the highest skiing - some would say even the best, and with its view of the stunning Maroon Bells range, the best scenery. The chutes, moguls and tree skiing on both sides of the ridge around Steeplechase, (like Snyders Ridge and Sodbuster) and Olympic Bowl are outstanding, and one steep trail, that gets steeper: Deception. A cut-price lift pass is proving a big attraction. The next resort is Tiehack-Buttermilk, a mountain tailor-made for beginners but with secret powder caches where you might find a few wise skiers who have drifted across surreptitiously from Aspen. Aspen's powder tends to get 'skied out' on the day it falls. If you know where to look at Tiehack, you can find powder days after a snowfall. Last of the four is Snowmass, a big all-round ski resort that is a lot less fashionable and more recent than its famous neighbour, but now has more ski visitors than the other three resorts put together. Known fundamentally as a vast intermediate playground, Snowmass is famous for its Big Burn area, which comprises several parallel runs (Whispering Jesse, Wineskin, Mick's Gulley, Dallas Freeway, etc) which virtually merge to form one huge trail as much as a mile across in places. It also has some severe chutes off The Cirque and steep tree skiing in the Hanging Valley Glades. Unlike Aspen, Snowmass also has some excellent nursery slopes. Aspen: Heights: Resort 7,945 ft.

AVORIAZ purpose-built resorts, Avoriaz, with its space-age architecture, is arguably the most exciting. In good weather it has a colourful Riviera flavour, but during its not infrequent and rather spooky white-outs the mist-shrouded tower blocks of of its apartments pierce the heavens like some Martian film set, giving it a sinister and surrealistic quality. Avoriaz is the jewel in the crown of the vast Portes du Soleil region, a circuit which takes in more than a dozen resorts along the French-Swiss border. It is also the location for one of the classic decents - the Chavanette, or Swiss wall, down into Les Crosets. The wall has a fairly fearful reputation. It is in fact a very unforgiving long and steep mogul field, where it is easy to fall, but not normally terribly dangerous except for the problem of falling skiers crashing into others making better progress. It is usually closed when conditions are seriously unpleasant. Avoriaz and the rest of the Portes du Soleil provide endless terrain for average-to-good skiers and the opportunity to enjoy the supreme satisfaction of skiing endlessly from one resort to another. Conversely, off-piste enthusiasts who might prefer quality to quantity will have a treat if they can find the secret powder fields off the Ripaille above Chambery's Grand Paradis area. Heights: Resort 5,904 ft. Skiing: 7,743 ft. Beginner 18% Intermediate 64% Advanced 18%. Transfer: 2+ hours from Geneva. (555 miles from Calais). BAQUEIRA BERET Roughly mid-way between the pounding Atlantic Ocean and the calmer waters of the Mediterranean, locked in right against the French border in the remote and rugged Valle de Aran in the Spanish Pyrenees is the resort of Baqueira-Beret. Although purpose-built, the ski area - two villages separated by five miles - is Spain's answer to Cortina, and the biggest in the Pyrenees. it is also the most upmarket, complete with the obligatory furs and Ferraris, and is not a cheap place to ski in. But being on the northern side of the mountains - almost cut off from the rest of Spain but with easy if spectacularly scenic access to France it does have one of the best snow records in the region, plus made-made snow. There is some engrossing skiing for all grades, mostly west-facing, but some facing north. A new detachable quad chair, the Mirador Express, has been installed. The ski area is in two halves, and both have a good assortment of runs. The restaurants are excellent. Heights: Resort 4,920 ft. Skiing: 8,235 ft. Runs: Easy 43% Intermediate 47% Advanced 10%. Transfer: Nearest international airport: Tarbes. BARILOCHE Bariloche's ski area at Gran Catedral is South America's biggest and oldest mechanised ski resort. (According to Chris Lizza's informative new South American Ski Guide, the first cable-car bound for its slopes went down with a cargo boat which was sunk in the Atlantic on its way from Italy in 1939.) Half way down the vast length of the magnificent Andes, close to Lake Nahuel Huapi, the city of San Carlos de Bariloche has a decidedly cosmopolitan feel about it. Although the season normally runs from early June until early October, Bariloche's snow record is not outstanding, either for quantity or quality. With a maximum elevation of 6,725 feet and a fairly warm winter climate, the slopes tend to experience snow that is heavy and soft. But with 32 lifts and 50 runs, it is a significant resort. Most of the runs are intermediate, but advanced skiers will be able to enjoy high-speed cruising on the upper slopes. The city of Bariloche is 12 miles from the slopes (there is a regular bus service) but there are lodging facilities at the resort base. Bariloche Heights: Resort 3,378 ft. Skiing: 6,725 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 15% Intermediate 65% Advanced 20%. Transfer: 10 miles from Bariloche. 1,048 miles from Buenos Aires. BEAVER CREEK Even newer and more up-market than its big Colorado sister, Vail, Beaver Creek is like a scaled-down version of its neighbour - nine miles away - without the bowls. It is a fairly straightforward, slightly sanitised resort, with uncomplicated fast skiing on superbly-groomed slopes. The toughest runs are the so-called Birds Of Prey, with trail names like Golden Eagle, Peregrine and Goshawk. Last winter the resort added 100 acres of intermediate/advanced skiing on Grouse Mountain, served by a new high-speed quad chair. Further expansion is in the pipeline. Like Vail, Beaver Creek has an entire area devoted to special runs for children. Children and adults get a complimentary cup of hot chocolate to start the day. Other highlights are the restaurant where they enquire 'may we choreograph your meal now?' at Beano's Cabin which is reached after dark by snowcat-driven sleighs, and Trapper's - a small, luxurious and expensive cabin where you can dine on such delicacies as buffalo and rattlesnake meat, soak yourself in a hot whirlpool under the stars and spend the night in splendid isolation without the distraction of television or telephone. Heights: Resort 8,100 ft. Skiing: 11,440 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 23% Intermediate 43% Advanced 34%. Transfer: 110 miles from Denver. Avon Stolport 1 mile. BORMIO Bormio is an unpretentious but interesting old spa resort at the foot of the Stelvio pass in a remote corner of Lombardy. It has a considerable amount of honest-to-goodness intermediate slopes in a sunny, sheltered bowl, with some unusually long runs - including an enjoyable off-piste descent to neighbouring Santa Caterina - and some excellent summer skiing terrain. Oddly, perhaps, the Which? Good Skiing Guide claims Bormio is short of both easy runs and tough runs: that the 'easy' runs are a bit tough for skiers just off the nursery slopes, and the more difficult ones are only a challenge when they become icy. They have a point, but many people have learned to ski quite happily in Bormio, and it gets considerable repeat business among an affectionate clientele. Facilities - particularly lifts and snowmaking - were spruced up for the 1985 World Championships. Most of the important skiing takes place on Monte Vallecetta, where the top of the cable car at Cima Bianca is known as Bormio 3000. (The middle stage is Bormio 2000.) The run from top to bottom is 14 kilometres long. As well as Santa Caterina, the even more remote resort of Livigno is also on the lift pass, and you can also have a day's excursion across the Swiss border into St Mortiz. The old village centre, with its cobbled streets, is delightful. Heights: Resort 4,018 ft. Skiing: 9,095 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 38% Intermediate 50% Advanced 12%. Transfer: 4+ hours from Milan. (Other airports: Verona, Bergamo). (716 miles from Calais). BRECKENRIDGE How British skiers relish American trail names in the Rockies] In Breckenridge, strong skiers can ski Devil's Crotch and Mineshaft on Peak 9, Goodbye Girl and Psychopath on Peak 8 and Blackhawk and Mustang on Peak 10. There are many more Britons here than there were native Americans during the post gold-rush days when the population was reduced to just seven people and it became a ghost town. The British are - or certainly were until the sterling crisis - buying up condominiums here faster than any other non-US nations. Breckenridge, Colorado, is the focal point of the Ski The Summit area that takes in Copper Mountain, Keystone and Arapahoe Basin on the same lift pass. Its three mountains have well over 100 trails between them. A blueprint for a fourth, Peak 7 is on the drawing board. Peak 8, the first mountain to open, offers a good mix of terrain, plus the highest resort skiing in America - at a couple of feet below 13,000 feet - in the newly opened up Imperial Bowl. Peak 9 tends to be easier and 10, with some good tree-skiing in The Burn, more difficult. Breckenridge also has a charmingly renovated mainstreet. Stop Press; Breckenridge is up for sale. Heights: Resort 9,603 ft. Skiing: Just under 13,000 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 21% Intermediate 32% Advanced 47%. Transfer: 85 miles from Denver. CERVINIA Cervinia is a rather bleak, not terribly pretty Italian resort that most people know about because of skiing excursions from Zermatt, just across the Swiss border. Unfortunately it is not a mirror image of Zermatt. The celebrated Matterhorn, or Mont Cervin, from which the resort takes its name, is 'built the wrong way round' and looks pretty uninspiring compared with the 'real thing.' The lift system is somewhat antiquated and there can be an irritating amount of queueing. However, Cervinia has some long, sunny slopes ('such marvellous geriatric skiing' was one reader's comment). And of course just as skiers in Zermatt can reach the resort (unless bad weather interferes with the connection) via Europe's highest cable-car on the Klein Matterhorn or the Theodul Glacier, the whole expedition can be done in reverse. And perhaps surprisingly - mountain restaurant prices in Cervinia are sometimes so steep that lunch in Zermatt can actually be cheaper. Heights: Resort 6,760 ft. Skiing: 11,500 ft Difficulty of runs: Easy 34% Intermediate 50% Advanced 16%. Transfer: 2+ hours from Turin. (Other airports: Milan, Geneva). (625 miles from Calais). CHATEL Although Chatel/Super Chatel is a good entry point to the vast Portes du Soleil ski area which runs along the borders of France and Switzerland, it is also the circuit's weakest link. When approached in reverse it does not really connect, and you have to walk or take a bus. Chatel, a much expanding old Savoyarde village with some excellent restaurants is, however, a picturesque ski resort. The Linga valley is particularly good. It includes a breathtaking gun-barrel run on which skiers can execute big giant slalom turns all the way down. On the negative side, the homeward runs from Super Chatel, which are south facing, can become very patchy. The town is slightly spoilt by having a fair amount of through traffic, but there's a free navette service to help skiers get about. The other Portes du Soleil resorts are fairly close at hand. Heights: Resort 3,936 ft. Skiing: 6,890 ft. Difficulty of runs throughout Portes du Soleil: Easy 37% Intermediate 49% Advanced 14%. Transfer: 2 hours from Geneva. (525 miles from Calais). COPPER MOUNTAIN Copper Mountain in Colorado - once a copper mining centre - is a rather unattractive purpose-built village: an uninspiring, drab collection of brown brick buildings and the least pretty of the Summit County resorts. But there's some attractive skiing, neatly 'arranged' strategically so that the more difficult of Copper's 76 trails, like Formidable, are on the left, easy slopes like Loverly are on the right and intermediate trails are in the middle. Reasonable skiers can try trails like Copperopolis or Oh No in the middle area, moving left or right depending on whether they want to change up or down. There's also an exciting Extreme Experience area of bowl, glade and tree skiing - once the exclusive haunt of the ski patrol - off the back of Copper Peak. Experts who do not want to take young children down such difficult terrain can leave them at the Belly Button Nursery. Heights: Resort 9,600 ft. Skiing: 12,360 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 25% Intermediate 40% Advanced 35%. Transfer: 75 miles from Denver. COURMAYEUR On a superficial level, Courmayeur in Italy is a smallish resort above an attractive, medium sized town with a big cable car - somewhat lacking in breadth and vertical drop, though there is quite a testing 12 kilometre run down to Dolonne. There are one or two reasonably challenging runs in Checrouit/Cresta d'Arp - and some inspiring scenery. it is the scenery that gives a clue to one big gun the resort has up its sleeve: Mont Blanc. This great hulk of a mountain overlooking Courmayeur's slopes brings all kinds of interesting possibilities into play. The Italian version of France's famous 18-kilometre Vallee Blanche off-piste excursion is achieved by taking another cable car from Entreves. Elsewhere, there is some goodish helicopter skiing to be had at nearby Valgrisensche. Epicurians will be fascinated with a different sort of Entreves challenge - how to consume a 36-course meal at the Maison de Filippo. Courmayeur is good-food country, with excellent restaurants both on and off the slopes. One major snag - you cannot ski back to town. You have to take that giant cable car both ways. Heights: Resort 4,015 ft. Skiing: 9,843 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 44% Intermediate 44% Advanced 12%. Transfer: 2 hours from Geneva or Turin. (575 miles from Calais.). CORTINA It is often said that many people who visit glitzy ski resorts such as Cortina in Italy have not the slightest intention of skiing. Late in the afternoon, as the sun dips behind the Dolomites, you will find the main pedestrian precinct, the Corso Italia, crowded with beautiful people wearing the inevitable jewellery and ubiquitous fur coats - but surprisingly few of them seem to find their way to the slopes the following morning. The skiing is largely intermediate and widely spread out in beautiful surroundings. There are four main ski areas. Faloria, which links with Cristallo/Staunies, an exhilarating, quite steep but wide gulley, is probably the most easily accessible from to the town and therefore one of the most popular. Tofana, Pocol and Socrepes are also linked and can also be reached from town. Some of the more testing skiing is at Cinque Tori and Lagazuoi and the upper section of Cristallo. Cortina is also part of the vast Dolomiti Super Ski area which can be skied with one lift pass. Heights: Resort 4,078 ft. Skiing: 10,543 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner/Early Intermediate 64% Intermediate 20% Advanced. 16% Transfer: 2+ hours from Treviso (other airport: Venice) (834 miles from Calais). CRANS MONTANA Crans Montana is a wonderfully sun-drenched, wide-open picturesque and rather expensive Swiss ski resort perched above the Rhone Valley - roughly mid-way between the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc - where you can ski fast and furiously with great gusto in a giant, largely treeless arena which contains a hundred miles of pistes. However, apart from a handful of black runs, it has rather a lack of seriously testing slopes. One of the most spectacular is the Faverge off-piste run from the very top of the ski area at Plaine Morte (the 9,840 feet glacier from where Arnold Lunn launched the nine-mile long precursor of the Kandahar race) all the way down to the neighbouring resort of Aminona - a vertical drop of almost 5,000 feet. Crans, the posher of the two, with most of the smart boutiques, and Montana, the older and more rustic, have merged and now form what is claimed to be the largest ski resort in Switzerland. The resort is reputed to have more five-star hotels than Gstaad. Heights: Resort 4,920 ft. Skiing: 9,840 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 34% Intermediate 62% Advanced 4%. Transfer: 3 hours from Geneva. (Other airport: Sion) (632 miles from Calais). CRESTED BUTTE A real Jekyll and Hyde resort, although the Hyde section - dramatic terrain called the Extreme Limits - lurks out of harm's way above the normal ski area. Families and intermediates gliding around on much less daunting slopes below need never be aware of the thrills and terrors associated with the dramatic change in the character of the terrain around the North Face and recently opened Headwall. Like Steamboat, Crested Butte (a butte is a solitary mountain) has an attractive old wild-west town - scarcely more than a village - a mile or so from the ski resort. It is colourful and rustic, with quaint old bars hotels and shops all snuggling up together and a delightful frontier town atmosphere. Although you can fly there direct in 20 minutes from Aspen in a light aircraft - past the Maroon Bells and some of the most stunning peaks in Colorado - Crested Butte is in a remote corner of Colorado and winters used to be hard for the miners. Now they are good for skiers. Heights: Resort 9,100 ft. Skiing: 11,400 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 29% Intermediate 53% Advanced 18%. Transfer: 28 miles from Gunnison. 230 miles from Denver. DAVOS Davos - one of quite a few resorts claiming to be the cradle of skiing  - also claims to be the highest ski town in Europe and Switzerland's largest ski resort. Sprawling pleasantly enough along a picturesque valley in Eastern Switzerland, there is little of the cowbell-and-yodelling flavour normally associated with a traditional Swiss ski resort. The five skiing areas, however, are extensive - but considerably spread out. Only the famous Parsenn area and Schatzalp-Strelapass are linked and, as in St Moritz, it is as well to have a car at your disposal, although there are trains and buses. The Parsenn is a huge network of runs almost the size of Manhattan, including one long excursion all the way from the Weissfluhjoch to Kublis, 14 kilometres away. Other pistes lead down to neighbouring Klosters. Two separate mountains, the Jakobshorn and Rinerhorn, provide some good skiing, with some testing off-piste runs on the back of Rinerhorn. Heights: Resort 5,116 ft. Skiing: 9,328 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 29% Intermediate 41% Advanced 30%. Transfer: 3 hours from Zurich. (Other airport: Basle) Rail station in resort. (626 miles from Calais). DEER VALLEY Deer Valley in Utah is Park City's new neighbour (it only opened in 1981) and the villages are like chalk and cheese. Deer Valley is much prettier, with a preponderence of evergreens and far fewer aspens. It is also built to pander: many of its clients are well-heeled and getting on in years. It is not just the two mountains - Bald Mountain and Bald Eagle Mountain - that are going thin on top. A third mountain  - Flagstaff - is available for snowcat skiing. Holidaymakers' skis are collected and returned the following morning by 'ski valets.' But such a product has to be paid for and the lift pass is more expensive than most, having already broken through the Dollars 40 a day barrier last winter. However, it would be wrong to think of Deer Valley as just smooth-as-silk easy skiing. There are a couple of black runs and more than 60 acres of bowl skiing. Good food is one of the few things to lure skiers of the slopes here. America's Bon Appetit magazine said not long ago that 'Deer valley has the best cuisine at any altitude anywhere in this country.' Heights: Resort 7,200 ft. Skiing: 9,400 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 15% Intermediate 50% Advanced 35%. Transfer: 27 miles from Salt Lake City. FLAINE Poor old Flaine. Traditionally it has always borne the brunt of criticism over purpose-built French resorts, with claims that it is 'even uglier' than Tignes, Les Menuires or the worst excesses of La Plagne. But much as La Plagne started doing some years ago, Flaine is now building any fresh accommodation in a much gentler, 'sympa' style - hence the new Le Hameau development just two kilometres away from the original rather charmless concrete village centre at Flaine Foret. Ugly or not, Flaine is a great favourite with British skiers, and the resort is celebrated for its children's facilities. Only 90 minutes or so from Geneva, the Grand Massif area has a lot of honest-to-goodness skiing with some unusually good off-piste (a guide is vital because some of the off-piste areas are honeycombed with pot-holes). Though most of Flaine's skiing is above the tree-line there are some delightful runs through the trees down to the more traditional villages of Samoens and Les Carroz. Heights: Resort 5,250 ft. Skiing: 8,150 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 7% Intermediate 77% Advanced 16%. Transfer: 2 hours from Geneva.( Other airport: Lyon). (548 miles from Calais). FLIMS LAAX Still little known outside Switzerland, Flims Laax is a widely-spread and attractive resort with a lot of quite testing slopes, balanced by a considerable amount of happy-go-lucky skiing and a vertical drop of more than 6,000 feet. Some of its best slopes are at La Siala, in the middle of the joint ski terrain with some scorching long cruising runs. Experts will be drawn to one particular area on the Laax side and another above Flims. There is a classic long black run, Plaun Grond down from the Vorab glacier to Midada Sut, and across the valley at Cassons Grat the cable car opens up a huge, wide-open and exhilarating off-piste area with any number of variations. Flims - the prettier of the two villages - and Laax have formed a slightly uneasy alliance. They still tend to argue over whose name should come first, and have settled for Flims Laax in the winter and Laax Flims in the summer. They are also linked with Falera, a delightfully rustic and picturesque little satellite which is prettier than both of them. Heights: Flims 3,773 ft. Laax 3,346 ft Skiing 9,902 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 36% Intermediate 45% Advanced 19%. Transfer: 3 hours from Zurich. (621 miles from Calais). FORMIGAL Formigal is a rather bleak and windy purpose-built resort high in western region of the Pyrenees above the old village of Sallent de Gallego. Nevertheless, it has some of the best skiing in Spain, both on and off-piste. Spain or not, on a cold day there can be a touch of Ice Station Zebra about the small, one horse-town where apart from eating well and getting drunk (alcohol is cheap) there is very little else to do apart from ski. But when all is bright and beautiful there are magnificent views across the central Pyrenees, stretching across the Midi d'Ossau and Picos del Inferno. The ski fields are wide-open pastures, uninterrupted by obstacles, offering good cruising and some magical off-piste opportunities in numerous gullies, nooks and crannies. Excellent intermediate runs almost five miles long descend from the Pico Tres Hombres. Although small, the ski village has some high quality hotels, especially the Formigal and Tyrolean-style Eguzki-Lore. Heights: Resort 4,920 ft. Skiing: 7,920 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 37% Intermediate 50% Advanced 13%. Transfer: 5 hours from Zaragoza. (626 miles from Calais). THE GASTEIN VALLEY There are so many Gasteins in this beautiful Austrian Salzburgerland valley  -from the pretty village of Dorfgastein at 2,755 feet to the chillier slopes of Sportgastein with skiing up to 8,800 feet on the Kreuzkogel - that it is less confusing just to call it the Gastein Valley. In between Dorf, with its friendly, tree-clad slopes, and Sport are Bad Hofgastein and the most interesting of all, Badgastein, famous as a spa resort for 600 years, clinging to a steep hillside, through which the River Ache bubbles and cascades. The skiing is spread out across wide-open and sunny slopes, with a lot of quite easy off-piste terrain. The toughest runs are off the Stubnerkogel and Kreuzkogel at Sportgastein, and on the wooded slopes of the Graukogel on the other side of the valley above Badgastein. The Schlossalm, a large bowl above the tree line, provides most of Bad Hofgastein's skiing. Heights: Bad Hofgastein 2,853 ft: Badgastein 3,608 ft. Skiing: 8,812 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 24% Intermediate 66% Advanced 10%. Transfer: 1+ hours from Salzburg, 2 hours from Linz or Munich. (763 miles from Calais). GUDAURI Skiing in the Caucasus used to be - and in some resorts probably still is - a fairly primitive affair with ancient lift equipment that frequently broke down and spilt oil on your ski-suit. Gudauri has changed all that. The Austrians built a new hotel complex, and installed a handful of state-of-the-art Doppelmayr lifts. The Georgians added a couple of rather ponderous, unwieldy and ancient ex-military Mir helicopters and the scene was set for an exciting new ski resort, with the options of piste skiing, helicopter skiing and even ski touring into one or two fascinating and remote local villages. Then the problems started. Within a matter of weeks the two helicopters were involved in separate incidents, killing one young Austrian guide and seriously injuring a flight technician and two Austrian tourists. Better helicopters have been introduced, but because of the current unsettled regime in Tbilisi - the gateway to Gudauri - the situation is unpredictable. However, when the dust finally settles in the Georgian capital, Gudauri should go from strength to strength as the showpiece of the Caucasus. Heights: Resort 6,600 ft. Skiing: 10,913 ft (up to 13,200 ft with helicopter). Difficulty of runs: Easy 46% Intermediate 38% Advanced 16%. Plus helicopter skiing: 100% Intermediate/Advanced. Transfer: 2+ hours from Tblisi. GRINDELWALD Just as Zermatt has its Matterhorn, Grindelwald in Switzerland has its Eiger, but if anything the impact of Europe's most famous North Wall is more dramatic because it is so much closer to the village and is also flanked by two more giants - the Jungfrau and Munch (Monk). The local skiing on First is fun but a little limited. Fortunately Grindelwald shares much of its back yard with neighbouring Wengen, so overall there is quite a lot of good, robust but not terribly challenging skiing. To all but the keenest skiers, however, the lack of really testing terrain seems to be a minor consideration when you offset it with such breathtaking scenery, fascinating history concerning the conquest of the mountains by climbers and railway engineers, and quintessential Swiss-ness. Heights: Resort 3,393 ft. Skiing: 8,157 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 33% Intermediate 47% Advanced 20%. Transfer: 3+ hours from Zurich (other airports: Berne, Geneva). (521 miles from Calais.) GSTAAD In Gstaad, it is claimed, 'every guest is a king, but kings are only guests.' Nice thought - but unfortunately skiers here are not kings, and occasionally even paupers. Poor old Gstaad (though hardly poor - or cheap - in cash terms). It is one of the great 'in-places' to ski, yet it has one of the most indifferent local ski areas. There are some quite decent runs on the Wasserngrat, close to the resort's famous Eagle Club - perhaps the most expensive and exclusive luncheon club in the world - and parts of Wispile are testing. But fortunately Gstaad can share the glory of a whole network of satellite resorts in the Gstaad Superski region like Saanenmoser and Videmanette, above Rougemont, and thus convey the illusion that it has better skiing than than in reality it does. Because of its reputation as a trendy place in which to be seen, this is a very fortunate arrangement that spares its blushes as a ski resort. At around 3,500 feet, Gstaad is quite low, but is fortunate to have the Diablerets Glacier reasonably close to hand. Here, at 10,000 feet there is excellent skiing. And when the snow is limited in Gstaad, the glacier can be a godsend, though it is prone to be shut during bad weather. Heights: Resort 3,308 ft. Skiing: 6,461 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 42% Intermediate 45% Advanced 13%. Transfer: 2+ hours from Geneva. Mainline station in resort. (533 miles from Calais). HAPPO ONE This charming and impressive ski resort in the Japan Alps has been chosen to host the 1998 Winter Olympics with Shiga Kogen. Happo One - pronounced 'Happony' - is one of the few resorts in Japan capable of staging a decent Men's Downhill. It is the best of a string of resorts in the spectacular Hakuba Valley. The village - a maze of narrow streets with colourful quasi-European shops and bars - is most attractive, although skiers on foot and two-way traffic causes severe congestion after the lifts have closed. Each resort in the valley has a fire festival, when instructors carrying fiery torches give a breathtaking display of synchronised skiing under floodlights. Some of them leap through blazing hoops, while at the bottom of the mountain the enthralled crowds watch to the accompaniment of hypnotic tribal drumming. Heights: Resort 3,053 ft. Skiing: 6,005 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 30% Intermediate 50% Advanced 20%. Transfer: 4 hours from Tokyo by train. HEAVENLY Of the 15 ski resorts surrounding Lake Tahoe, Heavenly has perhaps the finest views of this magnificent stretch of cobalt blue water. Heavenly is also the only resort that is in both California and Nevada. The border runs along the ridge at the top of Monument Peak from where you look down on the lake to your left and the rather less heavenly but no less inspiring prospect of the Nevada desert to the right. Apart from an entertaining selection of solid intermediate cruising runs on both sides the Nevada side has recently opened up a tougher area, Mott Canyon (for 'super experts') which is a lot of fun. In good powder conditions, Heavenly is celebrated for its magnificent tree skiing, but the snow in California isn't always light enough. Because gambling is only legal in Nevada most of the apres ski action takes place in South Lake Tahoe. Heights: Resort 7,200 ft. Skiing: 10,100 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 25% Intermediate 50% Advanced 25%. Transfer: 70 miles from Reno. Local airport: South Lake Tahoe. INNSBRUCK Although the beautiful Austrian city of Innsbruck itself is not really a ski resort as such, it is surrounded by dramatic mountains and a lot of good skiing - 65 miles of runs altogether, served by 35 lifts. And Innsbruck staged the Winter Olympics in 1964 and in 1976, when Franz Klammer stormed to glory in the downhill at Igls. From the Hungerburg plateau there is a stunning view across the city and a very severe descent back to the outskirts of Innsbruck which should be attempted only by experts. Axamer Lizum, which staged the slalom events and the women's downhill, has 20 miles of skiing, and there are some quite challenging runs at Igls-Patscherkofel. Heights: Resort 1,886 ft. Skiing:7,670ft: Axamer-Lizum. 10,499ft: Stubai Glacier. Difficulty of runs: (Stubai Valley) Easy 55% Intermediate 31% Advanced 14%. Transfer: Flights and ski train direct to Innsbruck. ISCHGL Ischgl in Austria has been described as coming close to having the perfect ingredients for a ski resort, combining the best aspects of French, Austrian and Italian skiing: plenty of long, fast and comparitively undemanding skiing, the kind of snow reliability you normally hope for in Val d'Isere/Tignes, the village charm of Alpbach, and the apres-ski vitality of St Anton, all combined with the drinks prices of Livigno. And what of the Swiss? They have not been missed out, because part of this wonderful, swooping, wide-open ski area (sunny but like most exposed areas, sometimes chilly too) with an exhilarating 4,000 foot vertical drop actually crosses the wooded Swiss border into Samnaun, where duty-free prices really do rival Livigno's. As for charm, the smaller resort of neighbouring Galtur - once a haunt of Ernest Hemingway - has more of the Alpbach flavour, although even Galtur's ski terrain has doubled in size in recent years, and is probably better than Ischgl for nursery slopes and a lack of queueing. Heights: Resort 4,620 ft. Skiing: 9,480 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 19% Intermediate 72% Advanced 9%. Transfer: 100 minutes from Innsbruck. 3+ hours from Munich. ISOLA 2000 Only 56 miles from Nice, and the most southerly of the main French resorts (Isola offers self-catering clients a week's free accommodation next time if the sun doesn't shine for three days) Isola is set high in the Chastillon Valley, and from the top of Sistron at over 8,500 feet, there is a remarkable view stretching from the Mediterranean to Mont Blanc. Isola has a surprisingly good snow record. Another good gimmick comes into play if it fails: there is a daily refund on the lift pass if it is not possible to ski back to the village. With well over 100 kilometres of pistes, Isola has plenty of scope for beginners - who can take advantage of the ski evolutif (short ski) method - with a few more testing runs through the trees at Mont Mene. The adjoining Saint Sauveur area also has some more difficult terrain. Isola  -purpose-built by a British property company and still popular with British family skiers - even has night skiing once a week. Like other purpose-built resorts trying, with hindsight, to limit the damage, Isola has constructed rather prettier areas such as Le Hameau and Les Adrets. A handsome new Chalet Hotel, the Diva, has culinary links with La Gavroche, and Albert Roux makes guest appearances in the kitchen. Heights: Resort 6,560 ft. Skiing: 8,560 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 53% Intermediate 35% Advanced 12%. Transfer: 2 hours from Nice. JACKSON HOLE The moment you reach the remote airport at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, your senses are spellbound by a scene that has stunned generations of trappers and then tourists: the vast, wide open 600 square mile valley floor is punctured by the magnificent Teton mountains which rise like a tidal wave of granite from nowhere. It is these mountains - giant, snow-clad sharks' teeth that glint in the mid-day sun - that make Jackson Hole such a magical place. It may not be the best ski resort in the world (though some would say so) but Jackson is a good candidate for being the most enjoyable, exciting and one of the most beautiful. The skiing is at Teton Village, about 12 miles from the Wild West town of Jackson, with its cowboy bars and wooden sidewalks. Sadly, the slopes are one of the places where you can't really see the Tetons. Rendezvous - a graceful brute of a ski mountain full of gulleys, chutes and couloirs, exhilarating cruising runs and steep untracked powder-fields (do not miss the Hobacks) - is an extension of the range, and all but obscures the Teton peaks. Jackson's most famous couloir is Corbet's, which mesmerises most strong skiers as soon as they glimpse it from the red Tram (cable car) on their way to the top of Rendezvous. Skiers must jump at least 15 feet to enter Corbet's. There is no disgrace in turning back. There is plenty of excitement in Jackson without hurling yourself into Corbet's. And for less ambitious skiers, neighbouring Rendezvous Mountain has a good mixture of nursery slopes and exhilarating but fairly easy cruising runs. Heights: Resort 6,311 ft. Skiing: 10,450 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 10% Intermediate 40% Advanced 50%. Transfer: 24 miles from Jackson Hole airport. 250 miles from Salt Lake City. KEYSTONE For many years Keystone had a reputation for being a slightly tame but fun resort for families and beginners. But it always had a few difficult runs on North Peak and those who wanted to ski steeper terrain could alweays head a little way up the road to Arapahoe Basin, a small but funky satellite with such high skiing that it doesn't close until May or June. Now the recently opened Outback area offers still more interesting terrain for strong skiers, and the resort is seeking permission from the National Forest Service to open up another big new bowl area. Keystone has the biggest night skiing area in North America and probably the world, with more than 300 high-pressure sodium lights illuminating 13 trails like giant glow-worms down a 2,340 foot vertical drop. This means fanatical European skiers can actually travel all the way to Keystone and ski on the same day that they left home. Heights: Resort 10,780 ft. Skiing: 12,450 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 10% Intermediate 50% Advanced 40%. Transfer: 74 miles from Denver. KILLINGTON Killington in Vermont is a snow factory. It starts making it as soon as possible - as early as October - and keeps churning the stuff out in such proportions that each of its six mountains has its own stockpile of snow. The most extraordinary example is Outer Limits, which drops down from the top of Bear Mountain for more than half a mile. The run would be difficult enough to ski normally, but when piled high with artificial snow, it becomes the toughest mogul run in the East. However, of Killington's 77 miles of trails, more than half are classified as easy - although when the weather turns seriously cold, as it does in Vermont, even the easiest slopes can bear more resemblance to skating rinks than ski runs. One of Killington's problems is that it has individual establishments with considerable charm, but the resort itself has no real heart. Among the more intriguing restaurants is Charity's, with its exquisite cherrywood bar and Italian marble pillars, imported from France more than a century ago, when the wooden floor had to be replaced as often as six times a year because of the hobnailed boots worn by lumberjacks. The Wobbly Barn is an infamous nightspot worth at least one visit. Heights: Resort 1,045 ft. Skiing: 4,220 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 45% Intermediate 20% Advanced 35%. Transfer: 150 miles from Boston. 80 Miles from Burlington Airport. KITSBUHEL Kitsbuhel in Austria is a permanently Christmassy ski resort of the Ding-Dong Merrily On Low variety rather than the Silent Night breed. Without people it would be immensely charming: it is a walled, medieval town, with archways, cobbled streets, gabled houses and colour-washed facades, and some quintessential Austrian tea-rooms and coffee shops offering the most deliciously gooey cakes, of which Praxmair's is the most famous. Kitzbuhel also tends to be noisy and boisterous, and its altitude (less than 2,500 feet) means it sometimes struggles for snow. The resort also has some serious queueing problems. There are four main skiing areas which means that with transport (free bus service or own car) one can enter the ski circuit at the Fleckalm, Jochberg or Pass Thurn lifts, thus sometimes avoiding the worst queues and getting better snow conditions. Unfortunately a lot of other people often have the same idea. Gung-ho skiers might want to try the feared Streif run on the Hahnenkamm, but most of the skiing is friendly-intermediate. Heights: Resort 2,624 ft. Skiing: 6,471 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 36% Intermediate 47% Advanced 17%. Transfer: 1+ hours from Salzburg. 2 hours from Munich. Rail station in resort. (706 miles from Calais). KLOSTERS it is difficult to escape the influence of Prince Charles in this pretty but now slightly sprawling Swiss resort. Britain's most famous skier almost got himself killed in an avalanche here. However, with or without the prince, Klosters has a lot to offer. Indeed, the Gotschnawang run - quite close to the scene of the avalanche - is not quite the terror it is made out to be. What makes it dangerous is not the difficulty but its proneness to avalanche  -hence its frequent closure. Klosters has skiing on both sides of the valley. The Gotschnagrat is most famous, and is effectively a major flank of the adjoining Davos skiing area. There are a number of routes down from the famous Parsenn area. Skiers of virtually all grades can make the descent using one route or another, but the most challenging is Drostobel. On the other side are the sunny, wide open slopes of Madrisa with predominantly relaxed skiing. Heights: Resort 3,706 ft. Skiing: 9,328 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 29% Intermediate 41% Advanced 30%. Transfer: 3 hours from Zurich. Rail station in resort. (626 miles from Calais.) LA GRAVE La Grave is a pretty French climbing village perched on the Col de Lautaret, an extraordinarily beautiful steep-sided mountain pass which links Grenoble with Serre Chevalier and Briancon. Towering above the village is a vast expanse of ungroomed glacial wilderness, crowned by the mighty Meije (13,065 feet) and served by five linked gondolas which seem, when viewed from the road, to be journeying in to the very heavens. They were built for climbers, not skiers, but over the years La Grave has attracted skiers enthralled by its breathtaking scenery, savage and remote beauty and huge vertical drop of some 7,000 vertical feet. To all intents and purposes, there are no pistes (there are a handful of easy lifts right at the top to help a rather inconclusive connection with Les Deux Alpes.) You must take a guide, perhaps from Les Deux Alpes or Alpe d'Huez. There are several routes down, all spectacular and all gruelling, though not really extreme. Heights: Resort 4,756 ft. Skiing: 11,703 ft. Difficulty of runs: No grooming below 10,500 feet, where terrain is 100% Higher Intermediate/Advanced. Transfer: 3 hours from Geneva or Lyon. 1+ hours from Grenoble. (583 miles from Calais.) LA PLAGNE La (Grande) Plagne is a vast snowy wilderness dotted with ten villages that between them cover the entire spectrum of traditional and purpose-built French architecture, from genuine farming settlements like Montchavin to pseudo-rustic such as Belle Plagne and brave-(but not beautiful)new-world, of which the most dramatic and controversial is Aime-la-Plagne. The highest of all the villages, Aime resembles a huge ocean-going liner that has gone ashore. This is now generally recognised to be something of a carbuncle, and some of the more recently added satellites have been designed in much more traditional style. Apart from the quite steep piste and off-piste skiing on the Bellecote Galcier, which offers ten-mile-long runs going through a vertical drop of 6,500 feet, La Plagne is a genuine intermediate's paradise, with the vast majority of its 100 or so runs coloured red. Heights: Resort 6,232 ft. Skiing: 10,660 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 67% Intermediate 29% Advanced 4%. Plus Off-piste on Bellecote Glacier Transfer: 4 hours from Lyon. 4+ hours from Geneva. (583 miles from Calais.) LECH/ZURS Zurs in Austria is tiny, remote, bleak and trendy. What there is of it is packed with expensive hotels. Lech is bigger, considerably older, more real  -and also expensive. The two Arlberg villages, five kilometres apart, share some interesting - though largely intermediate  - skiing across three mountains, some excellent off-piste (particularly from the Rufikopf) and attract Austria's glitterati. The shared (clockwise only) circuit is about 20 kilometres long. Zurs skiing is all above the tree line. Although Lech has some higher skiing in its satellite, Oberlech, many of its own slopes are below the tree line, which in bad weather - when the Zurs skiing can become distinctly unpleasant  -can be a godsend. In Lech some of the more challenging slopes are off the Zuger Hochlicht. In Zurs more advanced skiers would enjoy the runs down from the Trittkopf cable car. Heights: Lech 4,756 ft. Zurs 5,641 ft. Skiing: 8,036 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 40% Intermediate 42% Advanced 18%. Transfer: 3+ hours from Zurich. (Other airport: Munich) (606 miles from Calais.) LAS LENAS The Vall de las Lenas in Argentina's Mendoza Province, at the southern end of the Alto Cordillera close to the Chilean border, has slightly grisly connections: it is just ten miles south of the spot where a plane carrying Uruguayan soccer players crashed in the 70s, after which some passengers resorted to cannibalism to stay alive. Developed only a year after the end of the Falklands conflict, it is probably the biggest ski area served by lifts in the Americas. Although Las Lenas means 'firewood' the wood it refers to are in bush form rather than trees and the terrain is wide-open and bleak, with some superb off-piste bowl skiing. Many of the runs are tough, and the weather frequently is too. Winds can be extreme and accompanied by fierce blizzards which bring avalanche danger. Some areas are often closed, so that it is quite rare to be able to ski the entire area even if you had the stamina. Heights: Resort 7,349 ft. Skiing: 11,253 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 25% Intermediate 40% Advanced 35%. Transfer: 1+ hours flight from Buenos Aires. LES DEUX ALPES This is conveyor belt skiing on a grand scale. Lifts whirr and hum like a busy factory but two especially - the Jandry Express 20-person gondola and the recently opened Dome Express funicular - carry thousands of skiers, a substantial number of them British, to the bleak but widely spread slopes on the Glacier du Mont de Lans. As often happens with glacial skiing terrain, the flattest slopes are at the top of the ski area. This makes the resort exciting for novices who can ski on the roof of their world until the last run of the day, when they must either face steep and narrower lower slopes above the village or descend by mechanical means. it is a long way down - the vertical drop of over 7,500 feet is one of the highest in the alps. Les Deux Alps is not in the most attractive ski resort in the world but it is full of good but rather soul-less skiing. The scenery is rugged but it becomes even more dramatic if you make the ten-minute walk to the inter-connecting lifts with the La Grave slopes on the other side of the glacier. This vast, ungroomed glacial area below the awe-inspiring Meije - much steeper than the higher Deux Alpes terrain - should only be attempted with a guide. Heights: Resort 5,445 ft. Skiing: 11,775 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 30% Intermediate 61% Advanced 9%. Transfer: 3 hours from Lyon or Geneva, 1+ hours from Grenoble. (580 miles from Calais). LIVIGNO There are two images that give Livigno a touch of the Ice Station Zebras, but the image is not as bad as it sounds. The journey from Milan is probably the longest transfer in the Alps: Livigno is so remote that it was once a penal colony. Its nickname is Little Tibet. However, once you are there it is a warm, friendly place with quite reasonable skiing and plenty of duty free goods. The village - three villages combined, in fact - is rather narrow, long and straggly. Skiing the south east facing slopes around Lago Salin is easier than the other side of the valley around Mottolino where ice sometimes makes conditions quite testing. Excursions across a 7,500 foot pass to Bormio. Santa Caterina and - more significantly, St Moritz - can be organised with the same lift pass. Predictably there is little to do but drink and visit discos in Livigno apart from skiing. Heights: Resort 5,969 ft. Skiing: 9,184 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 40% Intermediate 50% Advanced 10%. Transfer: Up to 4 hours from Bergamo. 6 hours from Zurich or Milan. (691 miles from Calais.) BANFF/LAKE LOUISE Banff/Lake Louise is the generic name for three quite separate resorts on the border with British Columbia. In Alberta, Banff's local ski 'hill' - also reputedly Canada's oldest resort - is Mount Norquay, known principally for its short steep trails such as The Face and Lone Pine, although more temperate slopes have recently been opened up. Whether skiing at night makes it any easier is debatable, but there is night skiing three nights a week on Prune Pickers, Shenanigan, Temptation and Speculation. Fifteen miles away down the Trans-Canadian Highway is one of Canada's highest and bleakest (in spite of its name) resorts, Sunshine, part of which is in British Columbia. This is fairly intermediate open bowl skiing with so much natural snow that they do not need to make their own. Yet another 30 miles or so away is Lake Louise itself, by far the most important of the three. With sumptuous scenery, Lake Louise has skiing on four mountain faces: a hundred runs or more in all plus some high calibre skiing in Boomerang, Whitehorn, Paradise and East Bowls, which rivals the bowl skiing in Vail and Whistler. The off-piste de la resistance, however, is in Purple Bowl - but it takes skiers an hour to hike up to it. Unlike such resorts as Kirkwood (Lake Tahoe) every single lift in Lake Louise can be ridden by novices. Skiers should not miss a visit to the great railway hotels - the Banff Springs and the Chateau Lake Louise. Heights: Resort 5,400 ft. Skiing: 8,650 ft.

Skiing: 7,000 ft Difficulty of runs: Beginner 35% Intermediate 15% Advanced 50%. Transfer: 75 miles from Calgary. 4 miles from Banff. MAMMOTH Mammoth Mountain rises like a great whale in California's High Sierras. Interlacing the six miles that separate its boundaries are 150 trails of all descriptions and difficulties, although the emphasis is on the more difficult. There are some good nursery slopes, but beginners might prefer neighbouring June Mountain, 30 miles away. Good off-piste skiers in search of a challenge will relish Mammoth's Avalanche Chutes (the Avies.) Those with stamina can attempt the challenge of skiing off every major lift in a single day. This is complicated strategically because the numbers are not consecutive. Consequently Lift 1 is next to 26, and lift 25 is on a separate mountain. The scenery is spectacular, with views of the spikey Minarettes on one side and distant Utah peaks on the other. Heights: Resort 7,953 ft. Skiing: 11,053 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 30% Intermediate 40% Advanced 30%. Transfer: 4 miles from Mammoth Lakes Airport. 300 miles from Los Angeles. MAYRHOFEN Encircled by steep mountains in a delightful setting in the picturesque Zillertal valley, the lively old Tyrolean town of Mayrhofen is - with Niederau - a great British favourite in Austria. Although much more important as a resort for bringing on beginners and lower intermediates  - its ski school has a wonderful reputation - with the introduction of the Zillertal Super Ski pass, stronger skiers need no longer feel that they are being compromised. The local skiing, directly linked with the hamlet of Finckenberg, is on three mountains and much of it includes pleasant, below the tree-line descents. The skiing (and queueing) focuses on the Penken, a large, domed mountain served by a cable car, a gondola, six chairlifts and six drag lifts, and a number of lively mountain restaurants. Penken is connected with the Horberg-Gerent network of lifts by the Larchwald double chair. Heights: Resort 2,066 ft. Skiing: 7,471 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 33% Intermediate 57% Advanced 10%. Transfer: 2+ hours from Salzburg. 3 hours from Munich. 1 hour from Innsbruck. Rail station in resort. (750 miles from Calais). MEGEVE Megeve was once perhaps France's most famous and certainly most chic ski resort before being overshadowed by the wave of huge, purpose-built ski-metropolises built in the 60s. It is still a popular (and expensive) haunt for those skiers with fairly gentle aspirations who prefer the traditional ambiance of this still-fashionable and upmarket resort where 'wood has not yet given way to concrete' to the tower blocks of France's brave new world stations de ski. Much of the local skiing - which is divided among three quite seperate areas  -is pleasant and gentle, down tree-lined pastures, with a sprinkling of quaint and quality resturants dotted around the lower slopes. The area, which is linked with St Gervais and St Nicolas-de-Veroce, is also included on the even more extensive Mont Blanc ski pass which altogether covers 14 resorts with 190 lifts serving 425 miles of pistes. Heights: Resort 3,608 ft. Skiing: 7,708 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner % Intermediate % Advanced %. Transfer: 1+ hours from Geneva. 3 hours from Lyon. (556 miles from Calais). BIG SKY (MONTANA) Montana rarely gets mentioned in skiing circles outside the Rockies, but it has 13 small but often spectacular resorts, including Big Sky. The resort has some dramatic terrain - steep bowls and chutes - and is often used by ski extreme enthusiasts for derring-do videos. Its annual snow record - 400 inches - is also well above average. Now that the resort is starting to be 'discovered' by outsiders it is adding lifts at the rate of almost one a year. One of the latest, a high-speed quad called Ram Charger which speeds you from bottom to top of Andesite Mountain in under five minutes, gives you a fairly unequivocal flavour of the kind of ambiance the resort exudes. Heights: Resort 6,970 ft. Skiing: 10,900 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 20% Intermediate 50% Advanced 30%. Transfer: 45 miles from Bozeman. MONTGENEVRE High on a mountain pass on the French border with Italy, with a good snow record, Montgenevre has a large, mainly intermediate ski area of its own, but is also the starting point for a very scenic (though easy) tour deep into Italy - the Milky Way. This makes it possible to visit - out of curiosity - but not to stay in the much-maligned 'Benidorm-on-Ice' resort of Sauze d'Oulx. En route one skis through Claviere, said to be Italy's oldest ski resort, Cesana, Sansicario and Sestriere. The section between Montgenevre and Claviere is the most stunning visually, with dramatic mountain views. But the skiing for the most part is bland and reasonable intermediates will manage to get all the way to Sauze and back in a day. For a strong beginner, the excitement of skiing to other resorts - especially in a different country - is considerable. Heights: Resort 6,068 ft. Skiing: 8,528 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 24% Intermediate 64% Advanced 12%. Transfer: 2+ hours from Turin. 3 hours from Grenoble. 4 hours from Lyon. (611 miles from Calais). MONT TREMBLANT Mont Tremblant in Canada is a big, cold, double-peaked mountain which, with Mont St Anne, dominates the Laurentians. Although the top of the mountain is only just 3,000 feet, the longest trail is 3.5 miles. Not far away is Mont St Sauveur, renowned not so much for its skiing but its village - one of the prettiest ski villages in the world. Heights: Resort 870 ft. Skiing: 3,001 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 20% Intermediate 46% Advanced 34%. Transfer: 80 miles from Montreal. MORZINE The most urban - though not unattractively so - of the dozen or so Portes du Soleil resorts which thread their way along the Swiss/French border to the south and south east of Lake Geneva, Morzine is a real old Savoyard town with lots of character (in spite of and because of having through traffic) and feels and sounds like a real mountain town should do - although if your hotel room is near the centre, it feels more like being in a metropolis than in the mountains. Morzine is bright, bustling and a touch boisterous, with a lot of quaint old chalets and other buildings - including some excellent restaurants - strung across a picturesque river gorge. It is more attractive than its space-age neighbour Avoriaz, the fulcrum of the Portes du Soleil circuit. Apart from being part of the circuit - in which it is linked with Les Gets - Morzine has its own extensive local ski area. Heights: Resort 3,280 ft. Skiing: 7,788 ft. Difficulty of runs throughout Portes du Soleil: Easy 37% Intermediate 49% Advanced 14%. Transfer: 2 hours from Geneva. (525 miles from Calais). MOUNT BACHELOR Mount Bachelor is in the Cascades, a volcanic range stretching down from St Helens. The cone-shaped mountain, with 360 degree skiing and trails at more than 9,000 feet, is on the Eastern side of the mountains where the snow is lighter and drier than other resorts in the North West. The steepest descent is down through The Pinnacles, a jagged rock formation reached by hiking from the top of the Summit lift. Cow's Face is another testing and exhilarating descent. Mount Bachelor has a healthy vertical drop of more than 3,000 feet, achieved by skiing from the top of Summit down to the Outback. Heights: Resort 6,000 ft. Skiing: 9,060 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 15% Intermediate 25% Advanced 60%. Transfer: 40 miles from Redmond Airport. 165 miles from Portland. MOUNT HUTT One of New Zealand's South Island's most expansive resorts, Mount Hutt - recently bought by the Japanese - is a big open bowl, well above the tree line with impressive views from the Virgin Mile ridge of the Southern Alps and Canterbury Plains and a vertical drop of more than 2,000 feet. Because of its height and exposure it is subject to strong winds, which means some of the terrain is prone to be closed: hence the resort's rather unkind sobriquet, Mount Shut. Conversly, however, when it is open it enjoys the longest season in the whole of Australasia. The resort is also known for its heliskiing. You can try an introductory flight here, giving you 2,500 vertical feet for a mere thirty New Zealand dollars a run. Heights: Resort 5,200 ft. Skiing: 4,601 ft - 6,806 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 25% Intermediate 50% Advanced 25%. Transfer: 105 miles from Christchurch. 25 miles from Methven. MURREN Spiritual home to Sir Arnold Lunn, who set the first modern slalom course on the local slopes, and HQ for the Kandahar Club, Murren is a curate's egg of a resort: very good in parts. Set on a steep high ledge, you realise just how fragile its grip on the cliff-side seems when you fly over it in a helicopter. The quaint, car-free village is very Swiss, very quaint, and very traditional. It has one famous and testing mountain, the Schilthorn, topped by one of the highest revolving restaurants in Europe at Piz Gloria. The Schilthorn, which featured in the Bond Movie On Her Majesty's Secret Service, is also the mightily mogulled and unnerving start of the famous Inferno, the longest amateur skiing race in the world - over eight miles - all the way down to Lauterbrunnen. Apart from some noteworthy exceptions like Kanonenrohr, Murren's other slopes tend not to be terribly eventful, but if you know where to look, or better still hire a guide, it has some excellent off-piste opportunities. Heights: Resort 5,739 ft. Skiing: 9,741 ft. Difficulty of runs in Jungfrau Region:Easy 33% Intermediate 47%. Advanced 20% Transfer: 3+ hours from Zurich (other airports: Berne, Geneva (521 miles from Calais). OBERGURGL Skiers swop sun for snow in this high, narrow and remote valley at the head of the Oetztal close to the Italian frontier: in the depths of winter Obergurgl, Austria's highest parish (described in a 19th century guidebook as 'a hamlet of wretched cowherds' huts') only gets the sun for an hour or so each day, but this means that the quality of the snow remains relatively untampered with. Today it is a cosy, pretty little village whose friendliness and snugness contrasts with its chilling, sometimes arctic surroundings. It can be cold and exposed and blankets are provided for some of the longer, higher chairlifts. But aficionados return year after year to ski the bleak slopes and then shelter snugly in the slightly claustrophobic stuben which sometimes reek of schnapps fumes and the smoke of good cigars, and echo to the sound of live music. As the Berlitz ski guide to Austria points out: 'Some children have inherited the Obergurgl bug from their great grandfathers.' Hochgurgl can be skied on the same lift pass but is not directly linked. Heights: Resort 6,369 ft. Skiing: 10,170 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 40% Intermediate 45% Advanced 15%. Transfer:4+ hours from Munich. 2 hours from Innsbruck. (676 miles from Calais). OBERTAUERN Originally on the old Roman 'salt route' from Salzburg, such is the snow record of Obertauern - built on the very summit of the pass - that the locals could sometimes do with a few tons of industrial salt to keep their footpaths and roads clear. Off-piste skiers are not infrequently greeted with chest-high quantities of powder. On-piste, this is an intermediate glider's paradise, with great cruising runs on both sides of the valley. Apres-ski can start early - while you are still on the slopes. The Edelweisshutte at the top of the Panorama-Dreiersesselbahn has some lively tea-dancing, and I seem to remember being served something called Reindeer Milk there: in reality a fairly potent concoction of hot milk and rum. After such fare, it is helpful to find that Obertauern's lift system is one of the few in Austria to allow ski-in, ski-out chalets and hotels. do not be surprised if your instructor re-appears in the local bar that evening playing the squeeze-box. It is that kind of resort. Heights: Resort 5,742 ft. Skiing: 7,590 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 42% Intermediate 47% Advanced 11%. Transfer: 2 hours from Salzburg. (763 miles from Calais). SAALBACH/HINTERGLEMM Saalbach and Hinterglemm are two villages which have finally sprawled into each other's arms along the Glemm Valley and between them have one of the best all-round circuits in Austria, with a 180 kilometre circuit. Although much of the skiing is fast intermediate cruising, there are good nursery slopes and some testing blacks, such as the Zwolferkogel. Intermediates can ski their hearts out from dawn to dusk the length and breadth of the valley, taking full advantage of the excellent 60-lift system. Later the nightlife is brash and bright and very Tyrolean without becoming off-puttingly boisterous. SERRE CHEVALIER If you drive over the splendidly picturesque Col de Lautaret in the Southern Alps (or take the Frejus tunnel if the col is impassable) you will reach the Alpe de Sud and the unfashionable but not un-charming resort of Serre Chevalier, where you can cruise forever around a seemingly endless collection of picturesque linked villages and hamlets, some old, some new. The ski area revolves around Chantemerle, Villeneuve and Monetier, a small spa town. There is no village called Serre Chevalier as such - the resort takes its name from its loftiest peak at the far end of the system. This is a intermediate paradise: fast cruising runs in open country, often with easy powder slopes through well-spaced larch trees thrown in. (The slopes also unfortunately attract large numbers of snowboarders). Heights: Base: 4,428 - 4,920 ft. Skiing: 9,118 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 42% Intermediate 46% Advanced 12%. Transfer: 3 hours from Lyon. 2+ hours from Chambery or Grenoble. (Other airport: Turin.) (627 miles from Calais). SIERRA NEVADA It may seem a little bizarre to be able to ski in the High Sierras just above Grenada, but the quite substantial bowl area - Europe's most southerly ski resort (Sol y Neive) - is no imposter, as Spain's King Juan Carlos, who often skis here, would testify. On a clear day you can just about see North Africa as you cruise down the rolling plateaux. Like Mount Hutt in New Zealand, Sierra Nevada is prone to high winds which can shut down the lift system. This is usually a good time to pop down to Grenada and explore this fascinating old city only 20 miles from the slopes. Heights: Resort 6,894 ft. Skiing: 10,305 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 50% Intermediate 32% Advanced 18%. Transfer: 3 hours from Malaga. SNOWBIRD Twin Peaks lives] Yes - part of the beautiful alpine backdrop behind this Utah resort's ski area is called Twin Peaks. But what strikes you first about Snowbird is the architecture - it is probably the closest thing to a purpose-built French resort in the Rockies. The ski terrain itself is compact, pretty and exhilarating. Gad Valley and Peruvian Gulch have ideal contours in which to exploit Utah's world-famous powder - steep-sided bowls with a few stunted, blizzard-lashed pine trees to give you a little perspective in the blinding white arena. Snowbird's pride is its Tram (cable car) which whisks 125 skiers up to the top of Hidden Peak (11,000 feet) in eight minutes. From here there is a wonderfully long run to the bottom for modest achievers, called Chip's Run. All the other routes down are more difficult. Heights: Resort 7,900 ft. Skiing: 11,000 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 20% Intermediate 30% Advanced 50%. Transfer: 31 miles from Salt Lake City Airport. SOLL Soll, like Niederau and Mayerhofen, is something of a mecca for British skiers who frequently not only learn here but stay faithful year after year. Apart from an agreeably laid-out ski area which fans out in all directions rather like a vast clock face, Soll has the extra magic of being the starting point for the captivating Skigrossraum circuit. This takes in several other resorts that are all fairly easy to get to (but not so easy to get back from - you must either retrace your steps or get a bus). It is, however, a joy for intermediates to be able to strike out from their base and find themselves drifting triumphantly into the ski terrain of another resort. Heights: Resort 2,296 ft. Skiing: 5,992 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 52% Intermediate 38% Advanced 20%. Transfer: 1+ hours from Salzburg. 2 hours from Munich. (696 miles from Calais). SQUAW VALLEY Squaw Valley in California is a swashbuckling ski resort, with six chunky granite mountains offering 4,000 acres of open-bowl terrain that lends itself to the resort's 'ski wherever the whim takes you' concept. Squaw - famous for the Winter Olympics of 1960 - is the most testing of the 15 or so resorts that circle the picturesque waters of Lake Tahoe. Even their names are stirring: Emigrant, Granite Chief, Squaw Peak, Snow King, Broken Arrow and the most spectacular, KT22: so called because the original owner's wife is reputed to have made 22 kick turns during her epic struggle down its steep face. The Palisades chutes off the shoulder of Squaw Peak are used for videos of extreme skiers, who also hike to the top of Granite Chief. But in spite of some tough terrain, beginners do rather well at Squaw because unlike so many ski resorts, the nursery slopes are up amoung the higher slopes on Emigrant Peak, rather than at the bottom of the mountain. Heights: Resort 6,200 ft. Skiing: 9,050 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 25% Intermediate 45% Advanced 30%. Transfer: 45 miles from Reno. STEAMBOAT This quaint old Colorado wild-west cow town is a particularly good resort for families and intermediate skiers, with one important addition: superlative powder in the aspens and pines. Steamboat has three main mountains: Storm Peak, Sunshine Peak and Mount Werner. The skiing is extensive without being dramatically difficult, with a lot of hugely enjoyable and quite steep roller-coaster trails. Like many American ski resorts it has a recently constructed (and rather soul-less) ski village and a much older, original cosy and picturesque town two or three miles away, Steamboat Springs. Heights: Resort 6,900 ft. Skiing: 10,500 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 15% Intermediate 54% Advanced 31%. Transfer: 22 miles from Yampa Valley Airport. 157 miles from Denver. Local Stolport, 3 miles. ST MORITZ/PONTRESINA You would never guess that Europe's most famous ski resort was once a tatty mountain hamlet. What changed that were the spa waters which attracted tourists from all over Europe, particularly the British. It was here that Johannes Badrutt, owner of the Kulm Hotel, made his famous wager - or so legend tells us - which started the British habit of holidaying in the mountains in the winter. Traditionally the British took their holidays in the summer, but just as one group was facing the dismal task of returning to the autumnal fog of London, Herr Badrutt asked them if they realised that the mountains were sunny in the winter. He offered them free accommodation if they would stay. They did, and on returning in the spring, they told all their friends. The fashion for winter sports holidays had been conceived. Today, St Moritz's ski areas are scattered on both sides of the valley. It is expensive, but probably no more so than Verbier and Crans Montana. The local ski area is Corviglia, which has warm, fairly undemanding slopes within easy reach of the centre of town. Corvatsch, across the valley, is tougher. The short train journey to Pontresina is gorgeous. If anything Pontresina's architecture is even more attractive than downtown St Moritz. The skiing and scenery, especially at Lagalb and Diavolezza, is outstanding. Heights: Resort 5,904 ft. Skiing: 10,824 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 22% Intermediate 57% Advanced 21%. Transfer: 4 hours from Zurich. (Or local airport). Rail station in resort. (654 miles from Calais). STOWE Sound Of Music or Peyton Place? Perhaps a mixture of both. If only one could combine Stowe's charm with Killington's skiing, one would have manufactured the ultimate New England ski resort. Stowe, where skiing started back in the 1930s, has the archetypal New England village, with 27 country inns, complete with high-spired, white-weatherboard church. The skiing is seven miles away on Mount Mansfield, famous for its so-called 'front four' trails, which are a serious challenge, especially, in icy conditions (if they are open). Goat, Starr, National and Liftline are steep enough to make any skier pause for a moment or two before venturing over the edge. Elsewhere on the mountain, however - apart from International and Nosedive - the skiing is much more relaxed. And there is a separate mountain opposite - Spruce Peak - where the entire terrain is easy-going. Heights: Resort 1,300 ft. Skiing: 3,650 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 19% Intermediate 58% Advanced 23%. Transfer: 40 minutes from Burlington airport. SUN VALLEY Sun Valley was America's most famous ski resort before Aspen was really thought of as a winter resort. In a magnificent but bizarre attempt to recreate an Austrian ski village, to provide an exotic destination for the pre-jet jetset, Averell Harriman, chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad, asked an Austrian count to recreate the Austrian Tyrol in Idaho's remote Sawtooth Mountains. Sun Valley still has some of the best skiing in the Rockies, mainly on Baldy Mountain, where seven or eight bowls allow skiers to drop off into some excellent terrain. There is a second mountain, Dollar, where the skiing is easier. Heights: Resort 5,750 ft. Skiing: 9,140 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 38% Intermediate 45% Advanced 17%. Transfer: 81 miles from Twin Falls. 150 miles from Boise or Idaho Falls. 300 miles from Salt Lake City. TAOS Imagine a Swiss ski village picked up by a tornado and re-assembled in the exotic Sangre De Cristo mountains of New Mexico and you will have some idea of how wonderfully bizarre but beautiful Taos Ski Valley is. It was built by a German-born Swiss, Ernie Blake and he made it a cult resort, with some magnificent steep runs like Sir Arnold Lunn, Inferno, Powderhorn and Walkyries Chute. Al's run, named after Dr Al Rosen, who used to ski with an oxygen tank after suffering a heart attack, is legendary. Some of Taos's best runs - a series of chutes off the Highline Ridge like Thunderbird Trees  -can only be reached on foot. The most exiting and gruelling is the long trek to Kachina Peak, which is rarely open but a glorious red-letter day when it is. Heights: Resort 9,207 ft. Skiing: 11,819 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 24% Intermediate 13% Advanced 63%. Transfer: 147 miles from Albuquerque. 288 miles from Denver. 20 miles from local airport in Taos. TELLURIDE Built at the end of a spectacular box-canyon once held sacred by the Indians, Telluride today is a unique cocktail of slightly-sinister, devil-may-care earthiness and slightly gung-ho, yee-ha American boisterousness. The old town has a lot of traditional Wild West buildings that have not been tarted up like so many old mining towns in the Rockies. Today Telluride claims to be 'the most beautiful place you'll ever ski' and this extravagant label may be only a little short of the truth. The skiing, with runs like Spiral Staircase and The Plunge, is steep and scenic. Heights: Resort 8,725 ft. Skiing: 11,890 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 28% Intermediate 54% Advanced 18%. Transfer: 65 miles from Montrose plus local airport. LES TROIS VALLEES: Courchevel/Meribel/Les Menuires/Val Thorens 'If quaint atmosphere, old world charm and the chance to ski into an Alpine village of ginger-bread houses and steepled churches is the Europe of your ski dreams, under no circumstances book your vacation into Les Trois Vallees' the American author of Ski Europe warns his compatriots. Is he being a little churlish? Although this French region this is the largest ski area in the world, it does not mean there are no picturesque nooks and crannies tucked away in its vast terrain. Admittedly Val Thorens and Les Menuires are no oil-paintings, but there are some delightful endroits in Courchevel, particularly lower down at 1650 and 1350. And Meribel Mottaret, although modern, has been put together with considerable charm. As for the skiing, there is every possible permutation, from the manicured motorways of Courchevel to the manic mogul fields of Menuires. Courchevel, with its network of colourful but aging bubble cars - gradually being replaced - has 86 runs alone and the region as a whole has more than 300 miles of groomed pistes served by almost 200 lifts. Perhaps the best way of getting familiar with the whole area is to stay in Meribel, so that each day - depending on your mood - you can head for the sophistication and variety of Courchevel or in the other direction for the rather more stark lunar landscape of Val Thorens, Europe's highest ski resort, where a giant cable-car takes you up to the Cime de Caron (almost 10,500 feet). Nearby Les Menuires has some powerful and quite testing skiing on La Masse. If you prefer gentler stuff, you could just stay in the middle valley and enjoy Meribel's own skiing (although this too has some tough runs if you chose to ski them). There are also two or three delightful runs down to the new satellite resort of La Tania. Those interested in clocking up ski-miles can sample all three valleys in a day. VAIL Vail in Colorado is Aspen minus history plus powder-bowls. However hard it tries, Vail can never be an Aspen - even if it wanted to be - because it was only invented 30 years ago. It sprang up almost without trace in the middle of nowhere, but rapidly achieved star status without quite managing the cachet of its rival. Like Sun Valley 26 years earlier, Vail modelled itself on a European ski village, and unkind critics labelled it a 'plastic Bavaria.' Vail maintains it is America's largest single-mountain resort and has around 100 beautifully groomed trails (none seriously difficult.) What sets it apart from all other US resorts are its fabulous back-bowls. It has seven: Game Creek, Sun Up, Sun Down, Tea Cup and the recently opened-up China, Siberia and Mongolia Bowls. These bowls are left ungroomed in all weathers. When they are bad they are tough but when they are good they are superb. Vail and Beaver Creek both devote part of their mountain to special ski runs and features for children. This winter Vail/Beaver Creek and Aspen have taken the unprecedented step of burying the hatchet and offering skiers a two-centre ski holiday with a joint lift pass. Heights: Resort 8,150 ft. Skiing: 11,450 ft. Difficulty of runs: Beginner 32% Intermediate 36% Advanced 32%. Transfer: 103 miles from Denver. Eagle airport 30 miles. VALMOREL Perhaps the prettiest of the purpose-built French resorts, Valmorel is a delight for beginners and intermediates with the option of some steeper, challenging bowl skiing for stronger skiers. The resort is ingeniously laid out: the main traffic-free shopping precinct, the cobbled-square of Bourg Morel, is in the heart of the village, within easy-walking or shuttle-lift distance of the little hamlets that make up the village, but far enough away to prevent people staying in the chalets being disturbed by too much noise. Valmorel - linked with St Francois-Lonchamps - is one of the friendliest resorts in the Tarentaise, and has one of the best childrens' clubs. The quaintly-named Saperlipopette teaches smaller children to ski in their own special area, the Jardin des Neiges, where everything is scaled down to children's size. Adults even stand in a dug-out - in the reverse of the Alan Ladd principle - in order not to tower over the children. Not surprisingly, families love coming here. With almost 50 lifts and 100 miles of pistes on both sides of the resort, there is plenty to come back for. Heights: Resort 4,592 ft. Skiing: 8,364 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 28% Intermediate 62% Advanced 10%. Transfer: 4 hours from Geneva. 3+ hours from Lyon. (568 miles from Calais). VAL D'ISERE/TIGNES If there is skiing in heaven, it may well be a replica - nay, the original - of the awe-inspiring snow kingdom of the Espace Killy. Minus, of course, the bleak and carbuncular - but not, to be honest, hellish - town of Tignes. If only they had not drowned the original village under the waters of Lac Chevril] Even without its grim neighbour, Val d'Isere would be one of the great ski resorts in the world. With Tignes, and the joint ski terrain named after France's greatest ski gladiator, Jean-Claude Killy, the area is probably unbeatable. It is a vast network of long and inspiring pistes where many of the red runs would be black elsewhere and many of the blacks are at the extreme end of the anxiety spectrum. Val, as it is often abbreviated, is traditionally the location for the Criterium De La Premiere Neige, the first world cup race of the season in the northern hemisphere. The resort now has two world class downhill courses: the dramatic Face on Bellevarde, which was redesigned for last February's winter Olympics, and the old OK run where you can enjoy a race-training programme with Top Ski, one of the Espace Killy's myriad specialist ski schools. The resorts also have a selection of nerve-jangling couloirs that are as tough as you will find anywhere, plus a veritable white desert of delectable off piste opportunities and tours which would take a resonably good skier weeks to ski in its entirety. Tignes has the extra advantage of skiing 365 days a year on the Grande Motte Glacier, where the opening of the new funicular is eagerly awaited in the later stages of this winter. The disadvantage is that Tignes is fairly universally regarded as one of the ugliest and bleakest of the French purpose-built resorts. Val d'Isere is no picture postcard either, but it is considerably more pleasing to the eye and does at least have an old quarter complete with a 16th century church. One of the most British-influenced ski resorts in the French Alps, Val is a bustling and lively ski town with plenty of good restaurants and a pulsating night life. Dick's T Bar is only the beginning. Heights: Val d'Isere 6,068 ft. Tignes 6,560 ft: Skiing: 11,280 feet. Difficulty of runs: Easier 21% Strong Intermediate 69% Expert 10%. Transfer: 4+ hours from Geneva. (Other airport: Lyon) (600 miles from Calais). VERBIER Rarely do ski resorts inspire so many contradictory emotions as Verbier. This sprawling collection of modern chalets (there are few hotels) built on a sunny shelf beneath some of the most dramatic slopes in Europe has the following qualities: fabulous, exciting skiing. Overtaxed lift systems that can cause horrendous queueing. Avalanche problems that mean some of the best slopes are often closed. And more than a sprinkling of loud, abrasive and rather silly Hooray Henries and Sloane Rangers (although there is a feeling that they are a dying breed). Having said that, Verbier's skiing is so outstanding that these are perhaps minor crosses to bear. Even when bad weather does close the best slopes (Mont Fort, Tortin and Mont Gele) there is still such an ocean of skiing in Verbier's 'four valleys' that for ordinary intermediates it hardly matters. Heights: Resort 4,920 ft. Skiing: 10,915 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easier 39% Intermediate 42% Advanced 19%. Transfer: 2+ hours from Geneva. (623 miles from Calais). WENGEN Europe's highest rack railway, the Jungfraubahn, curls up to the Jungfraujoch, to Europe's highest railway station, in the most dramatic fashion - through the very heart of the Eiger. En route it halts at two stations where passengers are allowed to peer out of the windows on to the mind-numbingly steep North Face. When the Swiss built the railway soon after the turn of the century there were no such things as chairlifts, and the train represented a wonderful new alternative to slogging up the mountainside with sealskins on the bottom of your skis. The triumphant British were able to leap aboard the Jungfraubahn and ski downhill only. This was the birth of The Down Hill Only Club. DHO members come back year after year to this charming, almost traffic-free village and would never venture anywhere else. It may not be the most exciting skiing in the world but there are endless red runs and gorgeous scenery. There are, however, two good off piste runs - the exquisite White Hare, which starts at the bottom of the Eiger, and Oh God. The best of the blacks is Black Rock. Heights: Resort 4,165 ft. Skiing: 9,744 ft. Difficulty of runs in Jungfrau Region:Easy 33% Intermediate 47%. Advanced 20% Transfer: 3+ hours from Zurich (other airports: Berne, Geneva. Station in resort. (521 miles from Calais). WHISTLER/BLACKCOMB It is rare to find two excellent resorts right next door to each other. Whistler and Blackcomb in British Colombia have the highest vertical drop in North America - more than 5,000 feet. Both have a large and richly varied selection of runs, but on the higher slopes each mountain specialises in different terrain. Whistler has six bowls, some of which are so spread out that skiers have been known to be stranded for the night - huddled together for warmth - defeating the attempts of search parties to find them. Blackcomb's big feature is its glaciers and couloirs. Quite recently the Horstman glacier was opened up and with Blackcomb Glacier provides top class powder skiing when conditions are good. There is also a selection of excellent couloirs such as Cougar, Soudan and Pakalolo. The only snag about these resorts is that because of their maritime nature the snow can sometimes be quite wet and heavy, and because of their northern location it gets dark comparitively quickly, so that the runs close as early as 3.30. This means long lunches are a luxury. Often you find that if you have that final drink the lift network is starting to close down around you. Even though the two resorts are run by the same company they are marketed separately - and extremely competitively. The resorts are locked in serious combat: as fast as one resort makes a big improvement, the other tries to outgun it with something even more spectacular. Their conflict can only be the skier's gain. Both resorts are served by Whistler village, an attractive but purpose-built resort dominated by the Chateau Whistler resort, a vast hotel in the style of the great Canadian Pacific hotels built before the war to accommodate train passengers. Heights: Resort 2,200 ft. Skiing: 7,494 ft. (Blackcomb) 7,140 ft (Whistler) Difficulty of runs: Beginner 25% Intermediate 55% Advanced 20%. Transfer: 70 miles from Vancouver. Journey can be made by helicopter. ZERMATT Some people come to Zermatt just for the Matterhorn. Without it Zermatt would still be a great ski resort, but the bewitching mountain is its crowning glory. Even though there is no skiing on it, a handful of brilliant ski extreme specialists, including the legendary Jean Marc Boivin, have skied it. At least one skier has died in the attempt. Almost everywhere you go in Zermatt, the Matterhorn is there watching over you, rather like an alpine Mona Lisa. Zermatt has three main ski areas, two of which - Schwarzsee and the Theodul Glacier - bring you closest to this thrilling slab of granite. Gornergrat/Stockhorm has some of Zermatt's most exciting skiing, including Triftji, and Gornergrat provides some of the most stunning views in the Alps  -across the chain of mountains to the left of the Matterhorn - the Klein Matterhorn, Lyskamm, Breithorn, Castor, Pollux, and the mighty Monte Rosa. The cable car to the base of the Klein Matterhorn Peak - the highest in Europe - gives access to Cervinia, on the Italian side, which can also be reached via the Theodulpass. From Schwarzsee there are two excellent blacks - Tiefbach and Aroleid - plus an exciting and very scenic descent, the Weisse Perle, which takes you swooping past the the pretty villages of Stafelalp and Zmutt, where you will be tempted to call in at cosy piste-side bars and restaurants as you drift back to base. You might as well surrender: by common consensus Zermatt has the best selection of mountain restaurants in Europe. Heights: Resort 5,346 ft. Skiing: 12.610 ft. Difficulty of runs: Easy 27% Intermediate 42% Advanced 31%. Transfer: 4+ hours from Geneva. Rail station in resort. (672 miles from Calais.)</p>

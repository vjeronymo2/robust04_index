			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Baoying (7115 1405 5391), Deputy Director </F> Hong Kong-Macao Research Institute, Hong Kong-Macao Office,  State Council: "Impact on Hong Kong's Economy of Inland China's  Increased Macroeconomic Regulation and Control"]    [Text] Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Shows  Initial Results    Acting in response to tumult in the domestic financial  order,  too much investment and credit, too much issuance of currency,  serious currency inflation, illegal raising of money from the  public, and indiscriminate land development, in early July 1993,  the Chinese Government adopted a series of important measures to  enhance macroeconomic regulation and control. These measures  took reform of the financial system and restructuring of the  financial order as their point of departure in the application  of economic and legal measures, augmented by administrative  measures, to solve problems in economic development. They  included controlling the issuance of currency, raising interest  rates, controlling the total amount of credit, correcting the  breaking of credit regulations, halting various forms of  helter-skelter fund raising, enhancing central bank  macroeconomic regulation and control, improving control over the  issuance of negotiable securities and the size of the securities  market, improving foreign exchange control and stabilizing the  renminbi exchange rate, increasing control over real estate,  controlling the inauguration of new projects, strictly  controlling excessive increase in the purchasing power of social  groups, restricting price increases, and accelerating fiscal,  financial, investment, and social security reforms.    The inauguration of these strengthened macroeconomic  regulation and control measures aroused wide attention both at  home and abroad. Hong Kong, which is closely associated with  inland economic developments, showed particular concern and  sensitivity. Economic, financial, and public opinion sectors  concerned commented constantly. The initial reaction and  perception of some was that this was another round of all-around  retrenchment of the inland economy that would have a seriously  adverse affect on Hong Kong's economy. It was even predicted  that, in consequence, Hong Kong's economic growth rate might  decrease by various percentage points.    Developments during the past two months have changed, or are  in process of changing, some of the mistaken notions of people  abroad. The Central Committee's actions to increase  macroeconomic regulation and control have shown initial results.  In certain regards, they have generated positive effects. These  are manifested largely in the following: Banks' mindless  granting of loans and various kinds of helter-skelter fund  raising have been preliminarily corrected; the renminbi rate of  exchange in allocation markets is tending to stabilize,  development zones have been reined in to a certain extent, and  the real estate craze has abated; the policy of raising interest  rates has shown results, a marked upturn in savings accounts  occurring; prices of the means of production have turned  downward; and a restructuring of securities markets has begun.  Of course, inasmuch as only a short time has passed since  inauguration of applicable macroeconomic regulation and control  measures, full implementation will require a process. The  positive results seen so far are just a beginning, and results  in some areas are difficult to see within a short period,  particularly in some lagging indicators such as the degree of  rise in market prices, which remains fairly high. The industrial  structure is still not sufficiently rational as well. Continued  close implementation of applicable measures is needed.  <H5>  Near Term Effect on Hong Kong's Economy </H5>   A near term and partial view of the possible impact on Hong  Kong's economy of inland China's increased macroeconomic  regulation and control is as follows:    1. Until such time as the positive results and role of  inland  China's increased macroeconomic regulation and control,  restructuring of the financial order, and adjustments and  retrenchments of investment and credit in some fields and in  some areas are fully reflected, these measures will produce some  psychological pressures on Hong Kong investors.    2. Some Hong Kong businessmen who have made primarily short  term investments and who have speculated in inland China real  estate will be hurt by the temporary cooling of the inland China  real estate market. Some medium and small real estate companies  that lack staying power and whose financial resources are  limited will close their doors and go bankrupt, and Hong Kong  parties having a professional association or who are creditors  for these companies will be incriminated.    3. As a result of the rectification of the financial order  and readjustment of the industrial structure, former investment  projects not in keeping with national industrial policy will be  unable to obtain continued support from inland China banks. Hong  Kong businessmen involved in joint investments may consequently  sustain losses.    4. Following cutbacks on credit in inland China, some new  projects will be rigorously examined, and this may, to a certain  extent, correspondingly slow Hong Kong bank credit activities.  It is expected that financing by Chinese financial institutions  during the second half of the year will be less than during the  first half of the year. As a result of the tightening of credit  by inland banks, trading companies will turn to foreign owned  banks in China to seek import financing and letters of  hypothecation. This will be beneficial to foreign owned banks.    5. The effect will be different on commercial and trading  businesses. Those selling mostly in foreign markets will be  little affected, but those selling mostly in the domestic market  will be fairly greatly affected. The effect on trade involving  inland China processing for Hong Kong will be fairly slight;  trade with Hong Kong not related to processing will be reduced  because of inland China's financial retrenchment.    6. The Hong Kong Stock Market reacted extremely sensitively  and rapidly to inland China's increased macroeconomic regulation  and control. Stimulated by good news from talks held in Beijing  between the foreign ministers of China and the United Kingdom,  the Heng Seng Index rose to 7,205 points. Later on, affected by  China's increased macroeconomic regulation and control, the  market declined to about 6,800 points. Share prices of some  listed companies that Chinese-owned companies purchased, or that  market rumors said Chinese owned companies wanted to purchase,  i.e., "red chip shares," also fell greatly. However, now that  inland China's measures for increasing macroeconomic regulation  and control have produced preliminary results, the Hong Kong  Stock Marked has rallied remarkably.    Recently, as a result of the normalization of the inland  China economy and the financial order, the renminbi exchange  rate has become more stable and inflation has been brought under  control. This helps the development of normal economic and trade  relations between inland China and Hong Kong. Therefore,  generally speaking, the near-term effect on Hong Kong's overall  economy is relatively small, and the effect is positive rather  than negative.  <H5>  Long-Range Effect on Hong Kong's Economy </H5>   Over the long term, the Chinese government's strategic  measures for increasing macroeconomic regulation and control  will have far reaching effects on the sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of inland China's economy.    First of all, the present increased macroeconomic regulation  and control differs from the 1988 improvement of the economic  environment and rectification of the economic order. The current  measures are a combination of both increased regulation and  control and reform. They are rooted in reform, reform being used  to solve problems that have come about in the course of moving  ahead. The emphasis of this reform is mostly on macroeconomic  reform including financial, tax, investment and social security  reform, these reforms serving to stimulate steady  intensification of enterprise reform. Reform proceeds from top  to bottom, and is conducted in a coordinated way. Reform methods  are primarily economic and legal in nature, completely  coordinated, and carried out with vigor. The focus of reform is  financing, this reform serving to spur progress in taxation,  investment, and social security reform, as well as enterprise  reform.    Second, the present increase in macroeconomic regulation and  control devotes extremely close attention to the legal system.  It emphasizess the need for vigorous application of legal  methods in conducting rigorous crackdowns on all forms of  behavior in violation of the law and discipline. It truly  achieves the goal of acting according to law and punishing  violations of the law, thereby placing economic construction and  reform and opening to the outside world within the purview of  the legal system with all possible speed, regularizing the  behavior of all economic interest entities.    Third, the present macroeconomic regulation and control is  not an across-the-board retrenchment but rather a readjustment  and an optimization of the structure. The emphasis is on  concentrating funds to ensure procurement of agricultural and  sideline products, to ensure the normal production of key  national enterprises, to ensure procurement and activities  associated with foreign trade, to ease bottlenecks that limit  the development of the economy today, and to ensure key national  construction projects, particularly energy and transportation  projects, and key facilities. It is not intended to make major  cuts in investment projects with arbitrary uniformity.    Fourth, these macroeconomic regulation and control measures  have been inaugurated at a time when economic construction, and  reform and opening to the outside world are entering a new era,  and the overall domestic economic situation is good. This is  manifested in ample supplies of consumer goods, a substantial  rise in the real income of city and countryside residents, a  relatively stable consumption psychology, and maturity and good  sense in buying plans. These measures are not being implemented  in a situation of reduced income, shortages of supply, and a  psychology of fear.    Therefore, China's restructuring of the financial order,  strict enforcement of financial discipline, promotion of  financial reform, and increased macroeconomic regulation and  control are important actions and steps to advance the normal  operation of he socialist market economy and to move the  national economy into a benign cycle. Its goal is to make the  development of China's economy more healthy, more stable, and  better coordinated. This is beneficial for further improvement  of inland China's investment climate, for improving economic  relations and trade between Hong Kong and inland China, and for  the long term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong's economy.  Therefore, inland China's increased macroeconomic regulation and  control is generally understood and welcomed by people both at  home and abroad.</p>

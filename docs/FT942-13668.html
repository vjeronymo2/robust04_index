			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Clinton nominations to Fed may tilt balance to 'inflation doves' President Bill Clinton yesterday put a Democratic stamp on the US Federal Reserve by nominating two pragmatic academic economists to fill vacancies on its seven-member board of governors. Mr Alan Blinder, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, was named as successor to Mr David Mullins as vice-chairman. Ms Janet Yellen, an economist at the University of California, was selected for the governorship recently vacated by Mr Wayne Angell. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr Blinder and Ms Yellen will be the first Democratic appointees to the Fed's board since the Carter presidency. Mr Blinder is regarded as a possible successor to Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, whose second term expires in March 1996. The nominations come at a critical juncture for US monetary policy. Led by Mr Greenspan, a Reagan appointee, the Fed is tightening monetary policy for the first time in five years in an attempt to prevent rapid economic growth putting upward pressure on inflation. This week the Fed signalled its third increase in short-term interest rates in less than 10 weeks. Senior Clinton officials have publicly supported the Fed but are privately worried it may be tightening policy too aggressively. By selecting Mr Blinder and Ms Yellen, academics in the Keynesian tradition, Mr Clinton is likely to tilt the balance of power within the Fed towards 'inflation doves' - policymakers who put more emphasis on creating jobs than on further reductions in inflation. Mr Clinton said Mr Blinder, a former Princeton economist and Business Week columnist, had been 'an economic conscience within my administration'. Mr Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment house, said the nominees were unlikely to affect the thrust of Fed policy in the short term. The recent work of Ms Yellen, a former colleague of Ms Laura Tyson, the chief White House economist, on the economics of gang behaviour might be helpful in the Fed's handling of financial markets, Mr Roach said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wieslaw Debski: "In Line to Diplomatic Corps"] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  MSZ Open to Coalition Members </H5>   Andrzej Olechowski, at a closed meeting of the Sejm  Commission on Foreign Affairs on Thursday, presented some plans  for modernizing the Foreign Affairs Ministry (MSZ).    After the meeting, the minister informed the journalists  that  he was speaking about the problems of coordinating the  activities of Polish diplomacy and the ministry's new cadre  policy. In the law on foreign service, the draft of which is  already prepared, there is mention of the Diplomatic Service  Corps and the political leadership of the ministry. The latter  is to be made up of the minister and his deputy, representing  the groups that form the government. The minister believes they  should have influence on the shaping of the state's foreign  policy.    Olechowski stated that the road to bringing coalition deputy  ministers into the MSZ has been opened up in this way. When  asked by TRYBUNA when, therefore, the shaping of an MSZ  political leadership could be expected, he replied that this  will be one of the more important elements in the first stage of  modernization, which will be completed no later than 1 July 1994.    The commission, for the first time in the present term,  pronounced its opinion on candidates for ambassadorships. It  approved Jerzy Kozminski (deputy minister of foreign affairs) to  the post of ambassador in one of the countries on the American  continent. Favorable opinions were also passed on Ryszard  Stemplowski (former chief of the Sejm Chancellery) and Wictor  Ross (diplomat in the Polish Embassy in Moscow), also being  considered for ambassadorships in European countries.    There was no agreement (one vote was lacking) on extending  the work of the subcommittee on cadre evaluation in the MSZ,  but, as one of the deputies told us, this motion will shortly  return to the commission for deliberation.  <H5>  In Line to Diplomatic Corps </H5>   Personnel matters in Polish diplomacy have always been a hot  topic. The diplomatic service was the "jar of goodies" many  people in authority were eager to reach for. It was charged that  the diplomacy of real socialism was a stepping-stone for the  party aktiv. The diplomacy of the new capitalism, on the other  hand, is being accused of allowing entry only to its "friends  who are on the list." It is not surprising, therefore, that  Minister Andrzej Olechowski suggested, as one of the first  tasks, that new rules of selection for the diplomatic service be  prepared.    Let us mention that, during the first six months of the  MSZ's  work under new leadership, a concept of broad and accelerated  entry into the Western structures (the European Union, on the  one hand, and NATO and WEU on the other) and the assumptions of  Eastern policy were developed. The plan for modernizing the  ministry, whose cadre matters constitute an important element,  is another stage in the formulation of a concept of Polish  foreign policy and how it is to be implemented.    As learned from people participating in the closed meeting  of  the Sejm Committee on Foreign Affairs and in the corridors of  the MSZ building, a four-person group worked on this concept,  enhanced by 17 task forces that prepared five basic courses of  change, covering:     -  External coordination of foreign policy (relationships:  president, MSZ, government, parliament, etc.).    -  The  organizational structure of the Foreign Affairs Ministry (it  seems that a completely new system of departments is being  proposed).    -  Internal coordination (in the MSZ home office, home  office and foreign posts).    -  The shaping of professional cadres in  the ministry.    -  Technical and material infrastructure.    The basis for cadre reform will be the law on foreign  service, the draft of which will shortly be sent to the  government for deliberation and, if accepted, sent to the Sejm.    Therefore, we should soon have a diplomatic service corps, a  group of people who are well trained, suitably prepared, and  proven in practice. It is they who will constitute the main  (some say 90 percent, others 70 percent) group of ministry  employees and diplomats in foreign posts. For this to happen,  clearly defined rules for the acceptance of employees must be  established (e.g., competitive examinations), employees who will  pass a one-year preparatory training and practice course and  then be subjected to a diplomatic-consular examination at the  ministry. In attaining successive levels (grades) of service  (six) and occupying a position appropriate to the grade, the  employee will know what awaits him tomorrow and in a few years,  and not only will he know where he may be sent abroad, but he  will also know what kind of career he can make for himself in  the home office, what kind of positions are waiting for him when  he returns, with what kind of salary and with what scope of  duties. Furthermore, the position he occupies in Poland will  have an influence on the position assigned abroad, and the  reverse.    Rules of rotation (i.e., the filling of foreign posts) will  be clear, taking into account the employee's expectations and  the needs of the ministry. It is said in the MSZ that each year  open positions in the consulates and embassies will be  announced. Every candidate who meets the criteria will be able  to compete for the openings, and the decisions will be made by a  special commission. Furthermore, this will not be a closed  system. The MSZ always made use of people from the outside,  whether they were specialists (on Iran, for example) or to fill  specific posts--e.g., cultural or press counselors. If such a  need arises, the decision will be made by a qualification  commission and the person employed on the basis of a contract  for a specific period of time to perform a clearly defined task.  In this way, in addition to the foreign service corps concept,  another will appear: numbers of foreign service workers.    Thus, the diplomatic cadre will be professional and--permit  me a little idealism here--apolitical. But, along with this,  will be a definition of political positions that are subject to  replacement when the government changes. In first place, of  course, is the minister, followed by the deputy ministers, who  form something on the order of a ministerial political council  because the current work of the diplomatic service will be  conducted by a professional--secretary of state, secretary  general of the ministry, or something on that order. Certain  ambassadorial positions would also be political. The practice of  Western countries varies in this respect: from a 100-percent  professional ambassador corps in Great Britain to a mixed system  in the United States. In Poland, this will be determined by  practice. People from the MSZ and deputies with whom I have  spoken talk about a two-thirds to one-third ratio. But, although  in the MSZ they would like to put the professionals in the first  figure, the deputies would like to see the reverse, which, of  course, is understandable.    At present, Poland employs a total of 3,213 people in its  MSZ, 1,831 of whom are in tenured positions. The home office has  917 employees and the outposts 2,226, of whom 904 are tenured.  There are a total of 904 "merit" employees, 383 of whom are in  the home office and 521 in the outposts.    This entire construction would include clearly defined  criteria for selection (higher education, Polish citizenship,  ability to perform legal duties, high moral qualities) and the  scope of duties and responsibilities. There would be a suitable  training system to improve the qualifications of the cadre, the  basis of which would be a national public administration school  and a new State Institute for International Relations (PISM).  The old PISM, as we know, has been made part of the ministry  structure. The new one would be a center for professional  reports and reflections on international relations, as well as a  place of postgraduate education and training. Consideration is  also being given in the MSZ to a return to the proposal for an  International School of Diplomacy, which was abandoned in 1992.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   This, of course, is not a full concept. The necessary  documents, including the draft law, are still deeply hidden in  the desk drawers of the chiefs of the ministry. But what we  already know appears to be extremely attractive. We would be  closer to a situation never previously encountered in the MSZ,  one in which an employee would owe his position not to  behind-the-scenes intrigues and shenanigans, but to his own  knowledge and experience. Furthermore, clear rules of promotion  and an open decisionmaking process should help to overcome the  atmosphere of suspicion and jealousy now present in this  ministry. In this sense, these rules can be used as a kind of  model for other ministries.    I realize that the method of thinking presented in this  concept is somewhat idealistic and that it will be extremely  difficult to push it through parliament. But I think it is  finally time to rise above parochial, party, and other interests  so as to once and for all introduce some hardfast rules of  operation. These words apply equally to the deputies on the  subcommittee of the Sejm Commission of Foreign Affairs for cadre  review in the MSZ. If they really want to improve the ministry's  cadre policy, they will end, I hope, their disputes about the  past and become the chief advocates of the new concept.</p>

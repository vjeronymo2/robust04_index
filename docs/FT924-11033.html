			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Europe hopes rise for Gatt breakthrough EUROPEAN hopes of a final breakthrough in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks were rekindled last night after the US signalled to the European Community it was prepared to look at new ways to resolve the oilseeds row. Chances of a deal had virtually collapsed at 2am yesterday, after Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, told Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, he could settle the oilseeds row only inside the framework of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) agreed unanimously by the EC this summer. Mr Madigan said this would be insufficient to satisfy the US soyabean lobby, and there was nothing further to discuss. But later Mr Madigan contacted the EC side to indicate US willingness to offer new oilseeds proposals. Mr Madigan and Mr MacSharry are now expected to meet in the US this week to try for political agreement on the Uruguay Round. At the same time, however, Ms Carol Brookins, a US agriculture consultant with close ties to the administration, cautioned that Mr Madigan would not meet Mr MacSharry unless there was a possibility of substantial progress. Yesterday's development offered the first clear sign of a deal. 'We are continuing to negotiate for a solution politically acceptable to both of us,' Mr MacSharry and Mr Madigan stated. Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, was convinced a farm deal was in reach. This would pave the way for reform in the 15 trade sectors that the 108-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) has been negotiating for six years. Failure could unleash a trade war, with the US threatening punitive tariffs on EC food exports and the EC retaliating. Yesterday the US seemed ready to delay sanctions, but Ms Brookins said President George Bush had merely delayed the move until after the US elections because he did not want to be seen as acting just for electoral reasons. The US wants the EC to cut its subsidised oilseeds output to 9m tonnes this year. Mr MacSharry says the EC can deliver only what is in the CAP reform - the price and production cuts now Community law. Ivor Owen, Parliamentary Correspondent, adds: Prime Minister John Major confirmed that in the last few days he had been in close touch with other leaders in the EC and the US to urge early resumption of the Gatt talks. The two sides were in touch and the US was 'holding off from taking trade retaliation', he said.</p>

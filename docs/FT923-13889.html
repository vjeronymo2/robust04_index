			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / 1,200 oil jobs to be cut: Fears for local economy as Highlands yard halves workforce THE biggest private employer in the Highlands yesterday announced it was cutting 1,200 jobs at its oil platform yard in Ardersier, near Inverness. After McDermott Scotland said it was halving its workforce, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development body, warned that the redundancies - believed to be the largest ever jobs loss in the region  - might cost the local economy more than Pounds 30m a year. More than 900 contract workers for the US-owned company will be laid off in August, with 80 salaried staff and 200 employed by subcontractors. Mr Jim Franklin, general manager, said the redundancies were a result of a severe downturn in the fabrication market, coupled with an increase in total fabrication capacity. Mr Jimmy Gray, shop stewards' convener, said workers were 'shattered and stunned'. 'No one expected anything of this magnitude,' he said. 'In this industry we are used to peaks and troughs, but this is the largest single pay-off in the history of onshore construction in the UK.' Highland Regional Council held an emergency session and has demanded an urgent meeting with Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister. There was no comment from Mr Eggar's office yesterday. Sir Russell Johnston MP - in whose Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber constituency the yard is situated - flew with fellow Liberal Democrat Mr Charles Kennedy, MP for neighbouring Ross, Cromarty and Skye, to meet management and unions. Their joint statement said the job losses were 'grim and ominous news'. 'The crucial importance of the oil yards to the entire area cannot be underestimated,' they said. They added it was essential to explore whether a change in the North Sea tax regime might promote development and bring forward orders. Highlands and Islands Enterprise said the job losses would have a significant knock-on effect for many local companies, particularly those supplying goods and services to the McDermott's yard, and shops and businesses catering for the needs of oil industry workers. HIE said it would examine the possibility of retraining and stimulating new businesses. It would also press the government to grant assisted-area development status to Inverness and Nairn, and for Objective One status within the EC, which would make it elegible for special EC funds. Some employees affected are itinerant workers but many live in the Inverness area. McDermott's is one of two oil platform constructors in the region. Highlands Fabricators, further north at Nigg, in Easter Ross, employs about 1,500 people. The job losses highlight the gloomy outlook for the offshore fabrication industry, which is suffering its worst downturn since the 1986 oil-price collapse. As average field sizes in the North Sea grow smaller, the trend towards smaller and fewer platforms, with more use of subsea satellite wells, has taken its toll. So, too, has the small number of developments over the next few years. The Offshore Manufacturers and Constructors Association, which represents the seven leading construction yards in Scotland and north-east England, says the UK's fabrication capacity is 26m man-hours a year. The workload for 1992, however, is estimated at only 23.5m man-hours, and is expected to fall more than 50 per cent to 10.7m man-hours in 1993. Recovery is not expected until the middle of the decade. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, insisted at the Financial Times conference on the North Sea oil and gas industry this week that there would be no change in the North Sea tax regime.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Curbs on US banks may be eased SENATOR Donald Riegle, chairman of the US Senate banking committee, yesterday said he planned to start work in November on legislation extending the right of banks to open branches across state boundaries, George Graham writes from Washington. This follows a comprehensive endorsement by Mr Eugene Ludwig, who as Comptroller of the Currency is the principal bank regulator in the federal government, of the need for banks to be allowed to open branches in other states. Mr Ludwig also argued for banks to be allowed to sell insurance and other financial services. The US has a complicated patchwork of banking laws which broadly prohibit the setting up of nationwide branch networks.</p>

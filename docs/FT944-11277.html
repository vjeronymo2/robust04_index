			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / International Company News: ABN Amro expected to buy ailing Polish bank ABN Amro, the Dutch bank is expected to purchase the Interbank, an ailing Polish private bank, by the end of this month, according to officials at the National Bank of Poland (NBP), the central bank. The successful bid for Interbank, which reported a loss last year and is currently controlled by the NBP, comes against competition from Deutsche Bank, which also wants to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary in Poland. Both banks have chosen the takeover route for entry into Poland under pressure from the NBP, which has said it will not issue licences to new banks but wants investors to buy into existing banks which would thus consolidate the sector. Chase Manhattan, another unsuccessful applicant, has recently been reminded by Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz, head of the NBP, that this policy remains in place. Interbank has two branches and losses worth 104bn zlotys (Dollars 4.5m) at the middle of this year, while its capital is valued at 167.6bn zlotys. ABN Amro is reportedly offering to pay 40 per cent over the nominal Interbank share price of 640,000 zlotys to existing shareholders and to invest Dollars 40m in the bank. The Dutch bank is currently a partner in the International Bank in Poland, a joint venture with two local banks, Credit Lyonnais and Banco Commerciale Italiana. The NBP recently issued a joint banking licence to Dresdner Bank and BNP in recognition of the former's role in negotiating Poland's recent 49 per cent commercial bank debt reduction deal. Commerzbank of Germany has also just been given a permit to purchase up to 21 per cent of the stock in the Export Development Bank. The handful of foreign banks currently present in Poland, including Citibank, Creditanstalt, ING and Raiffeisen, were granted licences before 1992, when policy was tightened.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Russia warned of crisis over hyper-inflation A SENIOR Russian government official yesterday predicted a hyper-inflationary crisis by the end of the year because of the credit policies of the country's central bank. Vast sums, he said, were now being paid to sustain production - while up to 10 per cent of Russia's GNP was being advanced to other former Soviet republics. Mr Sergei Vassiliev, the head of the government's Centre for Economic Reform, said that 'in practice, the leaders of the central bank are acting to discredit not only the government but the entire course of reform'. He admitted that, if there were no change in the Bank's credit policy, it would be impossible to meet the targets agreed between the government and the International Monetary Fund for this year - that is, of a budget deficit of no more than 5 per cent of GNP and inflation at no more than 10 per cent a month. Instead, he said that inflation was now running at a weekly basis of 4.4 per cent, or more than 20 per cent a month, and was expected to accelerate next month. The budget deficit now stood around 7 per cent of GNP, he added. Mr Vassiliev's sombre picture was in sharp contrast to the optimism expressed by Mr Richard Erb, the IMF assistant managing director, on a visit to Moscow last week. Mr Vassiliev's charge is the most serious of a rising chorus of ministerial complaints about the actions of Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the former Soviet State Bank chairman, who was appointed acting chairman of the Russian bank in July. It also foreshadows a clash between the government and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, on one side and the bank and the Russian parliament, to which the bank is responsible, on the other. The Russian parliament begins its new session in a week's time. Mr Vassiliev, introducing the first in a quarterly series of 'Russian Economic Trends', refused to be drawn into what actions would be taken to avoid hyper-inflation - but said that the government would not 'give up'. Parliament will not easily give up control over the bank - while both Mr Yeltsin and government ministers have called in recent days for bringing it under government control, or making it completely independent. His comments are a further signal of a gathering political, as well as economic, showdown between the shifting forces within Russia. Mr Yeltsin, accused of populism in the past, has so far remained strongly in support of the reform cabinet under Mr Yegor Gaidar - whose job as prime minister is, like Mr Gerashchenko's, only an 'acting' title. Mr Vassiliev said that the president had 'no choice but to support the reform - otherwise he would have to rely on conservative forces. He cannot change his political base'. According to Mr Vassiliev, who was supported by Mr Marek Dombrowski, a government adviser who had previously advised the Polish government, credits to enterprises in July had increased to Rbs550bn, with a similar advance expected next month. The Russian Information Agency reported last night that the central bank's Moscow department proposed issuing further credits of between Rbs500bn-Rbs1,000bn to regulate the debts owed by enterprises in the Moscow region.</p>

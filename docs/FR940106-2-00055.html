			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current 1993 fee schedule amounts for code E0607 accurately reflect the average reasonable charges for home blood glucose monitors in 1986, adjusted by 1.7 percent (the percentage increase in the CPI&hyph;U for the 6-month period ending with December 1987) and by the cumulative covered item update factor. The average 1993 fee schedule amount for purchased new home blood glucose monitors, excluding the fee schedule amounts for the Virgin Islands, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, is $178.73. However, as we explain below, due to manufacturers' widespread practice of issuing consumer rebates, the fee schedule amounts substantially exceed the effective purchase amount (the list purchase amount less any rebate) paid by the general public in all localities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have reviewed pricing and rebate information available for the years 1986 through 1993 to become familiar with the home blood glucose monitor market. Our pricing and rebate sources include: mail order catalogs (such as Bruce Medical Supply catalog, St. Louis Medical Supply, and Institutional Products), advertisements listed in newspapers and periodicals (such as Drug Topics and Shopper's Guide), and pharmacy and other retail store fliers. For the purposes of this analysis, we focused on home blood glucose monitor pricing and national rebate programs listed in the Winter 1993 edition of the Bruce Medical Supply catalog (Vol. 15, No. 1), but the pricing and rebate information found in the Bruce catalog is consistent with the pricing and rebate information available in all the other sources we examined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, in our experience, the Bruce catalog listed the largest number of home blood glucose monitors made by the largest number of home blood glucose monitor manufacturers, and reflected the national rebate programs offered by these manufacturers. Six different brands of home blood glucose monitors, manufactured by five different organizations, can be purchased from the Bruce catalog from any location in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands and are covered under Medicare. The monitors listed are: Accu-Chek III, manufactured by Boehringer Mannheim; Checkmate, manufactured by Cascade Medical; ExacTech Companion and ExacTech Pen, manufactured by MediSence; Glucometer 3, manufactured by Miles, Inc.; One Touch II, manufactured by Lifescan; and Tracer II, manufactured by Boehringer Mannheim. We estimate that the six monitors listed in the Bruce catalog account for approximately 90 percent of the market. This estimate is based on marketing information presented in an article that appeared in the Wall Street Journal on November 12, 1992 (Marketing and Media section, B1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are using the Bruce catalog pricing and rebate information because it is a convenient single reference. We believe the catalog is indicative of market pricing for home blood glucose monitors. In addition, the catalog lists the national rebate programs offered by the manufacturers of the monitors. By choosing the Bruce catalog as the source of data for proposing payment limits, we are not recommending that future purchases of home blood glucose monitors by Medicare beneficiaries be made through the Bruce catalog. We are confident that comparable net prices are available in all localities from the various other mail order or retail outlets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the fee schedule base year period (July 1, 1986 through June 30, 1987), retail prices for home blood glucose monitors generally exceeded $150. Since then, several lower priced models have appeared on the market while the older, higher priced models have been phased out. The growth in the home blood glucose monitor market and advances in the technology of producing these monitors have caused the market value of the home blood glucose monitor to decline steadily, so that now this item is readily available at prices below $70. In addition, manufacturers have begun the widespread practice of issuing consumer rebates to promote their products. Mail-in manufacturers' rebates ranging from $20 to $75 have been available over the past several years. The Medicare program does not receive the benefit of many of these rebates because, although suppliers bill for the price of the equipment, the rebates are sent to the beneficiary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The average list price of the six monitors in the Bruce catalog is $65.44. Manufacturer rebates, ranging from $30 to $50, are available for four of these monitors. A fifth monitor, the Checkmate, is listed at a price of $61.90, but can be obtained through the catalog free of charge with the purchase of two boxes of Checkmate test strips, supplies that are essential for the effective use of the Checkmate monitoring system. New home blood glucose monitors are now available to the general public at a net cost that is well below the fee schedule amounts established for code E0607.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our findings are supported by the Office of the Inspector General's (OIG) report ``Durable Medical Equipment_Review of Medicare Payments for Home Blood Glucose Monitors'' (A&hyph;09&hyph;92&hyph;00034)_issued in December of 1992. In this report, the OIG states that excessive Medicare payments have been made for home blood glucose monitors because claims were not adjusted to reflect manufacturers' rebates. The OIG reviewed a sample of 80 Medicare claims for monitors processed by 2 carriers. From this sample, the OIG identified 50 claims for which rebates were available at the time the monitors were purchased. The OIG found that Medicare payment for only 5 of these 50 claims were reduced by the amount of the rebate. The OIG concluded that the fee schedule amounts established for code E0607 based on pre-1987 historic charges are excessive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

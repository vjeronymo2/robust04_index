It also stressed the need to stand firmly against U.S.  positions, which are biased in favor of the Israeli party.    This demand, which is the first of its kind since the Madrid  conference was convened about 20 months ago, came in an urgent  telegram by the council following its meeting yesterday morning  in Jerusalem. In the meeting, the council discussed the assault  against Islamic sanctities and the Palestinian people,  especially the recent massacre perpetrated by Israeli settlers  in Hebron's al-Ibrahimi Mosque.    The council criticized remarks by U.S. President Bill  Clinton  and Israeli officials on the fate of holy Jerusalem, as well as  the U.S. Administration's stance on UN Security Council  Resolution 904. It called on Arab and Islamic countries to  clearly determine their stance on the U.S. Administration in  light of its biased positions toward the Israeli side. [passage  omitted]</p>

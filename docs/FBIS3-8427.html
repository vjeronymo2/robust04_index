			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Civic Alliance for the Republic [GOR] appeals  to the political forces to continue working on fulfilling the  national budget and concluding deals with the creditor banks of  the London Club and the IMF, instead of exploiting Prime  Minister Berov's state of health to increase tension in the  country. According to GOR leader Aleksandur Tomov, the  situation at the moment should not be dramatized, especially  because no one currently wants new elections. Tomov assesses  the recent visit of the GOR delegation to Russia as useful and  timely.</p>

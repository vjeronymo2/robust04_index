			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Arts: The Destiny of Me - Theatre The Italian clothes manufacturer and retailer Benetton is to take its non-product advertising into Aids awareness. Three new images, a male buttock, a female torso and an upper arm are tattooed 'HIV POSITIVE'. Prevention like this works, but the problem for those now dying of Aids is the slowness of the cure. Larry Kramer's play The Destiny of Me at the Leicester Haymarket Theatre presents a man with Aids who asks 'What do you do when you are dying of a disease you need not be dying from?' Kramer has based the action on his remarkable life. At over 3 1/2 hours, The Destiny of Me makes a boring, frustrating play, albeit on two compelling subjects: Aids and Kramer's homosexuality. This is so nearly fine drama, but the issues need to be focussed; they are too important to speak for themselves. At present the play is a combination of Neil Simon's jewish lore (Brighton Beach Memoirs), James Purdy's angry 1980s gay novels and Marvin's Room (now at the Comedy Theatre, Panton St), a play about leukemia by Scott McPherson (who died of Aids at 33 last year). In 1981 Kramer founded Gay Men's Health Crisis, and in 1987 the Aids Coalition To Unleash Power. His writing, especially Faggots, a novel about New York gay life and The Normal Heart, his 1988 Aids play (Public Theatre and The Royal Court), has brought gay health issues into the public domain. Here, Kramer's autobiographical action centres on Ned, an Aids activist now ill in a New York hospital. Outside, demonstrators rail against inadequate government research provision, while inside, Dr Della Vida (nice pun) tries the latest blood transfusions. Ned travels back in time. His family past appears in the clinic, and we see scenes from Ned's childhood. Here are the roots of Ned's homosexuality. His disappointed father, his indulgent mother, his vigorously heterosexual brother make up a dysfunctional family which bore the added burden of anti-semitism in the 1950s. Past and present are intercut. Ned has blood transfusions while his past self picnics with the family; his mother recounts a miscarriage and his father rants 'You were a mistake, I didn't want you, I never wanted you.' Gradually the play takes shape, making more sense of the repetitive familial anguish and disclosure. But Kramer then tries to link complacency in Washington with the advance of a virus in the bloodstream. Dr Della Vida says: 'The President cares. He has a heart. He really wants this disease to go away.' There was laughter in the theatre. Kramer presents gay men like Ned as politically empowered but pathologically passive. Simon Callow (who also directs) finds range and passion in the lead role. James Kennedy as his younger self and Jason Durr as his brother carry off the play's best scene, where Ned 'comes out', and Ned's mother (Ann Mitchell) asks the best question of the evening: 'Is sex what controls your life?' In hospital, Patti Boulaye is underemployed as a nurse, all Upper East side chic and Lower East side mouth; her husband the Doctor (Peter Woodward) personifies the embattled health services. Aids has taxed belief in progress and rationality. Kramer conveys the madness of the alternatives: 'Why do I never stop believing a cure will be found for this plague?' Larry Kramer is HIV positive. In repertory (0533 539797) until 9 October</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Aegon improves 20% to Fl 230m in first quarter AEGON, the Netherlands' second-largest insurance group, said first-quarter net profit rose by nearly 20 per cent to Fl 230m (Dollars 128m) on turnover up 11.4 per cent at Fl 4.93bn. The company, which described the results as a 'promising' start to the year, said the first-quarter performance confirmed its optimism about 1993, adding that it stood by earlier predictions that full-year operating profit would show a slight increase over 1992. Operating profit after tax in the first quarter rose by 6.7 per cent to Fl 200.3m. Aegon's realised profits on investments showed an even stronger rise to Fl 29.6m from Fl 5.3m the year before. The company noted that investment results tended to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Life insurance, Aegon's single largest business, posted a 17.8 per cent increase to Fl 205m.</p>

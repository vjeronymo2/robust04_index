			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / States return to their seats at BIS THE Bank for International Settlements is making a subtle change to the proceedings of its annual meeting in Basle today. The national flags of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia will be flying outside the bank's headquarters in Basle, alongside those of the BIS's other 29 shareholder central banks. The Baltic states are returning to take up their seats in the 'central bankers' bank' for the first time since their annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940. Membership of the central bankers' 'club' represents a landmark in the three states' drive to regain sovereignty. The national banks of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia joined the BIS when it was set up in 1930 to help organise payment of Germany's First World War reparations. They routinely deposited part of their gold reserves with the BIS, which held the bullion in New York. The BIS never recognised the Soviet takeovers, either de facto or de jure. In contrast to Sweden and Britain, which in 1940 and 1968 respectively transferred or sold Baltic gold as part of agreements with the Soviet Union, the BIS maintained the Baltic states' bullion deposits intact during the whole period after 1940 despite repeated Soviet claims that the gold belonged to Moscow. The Baltic assets held with the BIS, along with the three states' other reconstituted pre-war gold holdings, now make up the lion's share of their monetary reserves. Britain and Sweden this year both agreed to pay back to the Baltic states gold deposited in1940. Britain repaid the gold in March, while Sweden will probably make its own restitution soon. The overall importance of the Baltic states' return to the BIS fold is considerably greater than their actual stakes in the institution. Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia own between them a mere 2,200 shares in the BIS - giving them stakes of 0.2, 0.2 and 0.04 per cent respectively. The BIS was not the only bank which succeeded in hanging on to Baltic gold in the post-war era. The Bank of France held small amounts of Baltic gold - 1 tonne for Latvia, and 2.3 tonnes for Lithuania. But the French managed to keep the Baltic gold from both Germany and the Soviet Union during the war because stocks were sent to Africa for safekeeping. In contrast to the Bank of England and the Swedish Riksbank, the Bank of France could point out that it had been a little more successful in conserving customers' deposits during a stormy half- century.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Pay offer of 2.2% for civil servants Members of the CPSA, the biggest civil service union, are being urged by their executive to accept a pay offer worth 2.2 per cent in one of the first negotiated public-sector pay deals this year after the government's pay-bill freeze. The Treasury said the rise for about 100,000 typists, secretaries and clerical workers across the civil service would be wholly funded by efficiency savings in line with government policy. Greater flexibility in pay negotiations has been created by the relaxation of rules preventing departmental cost savings from being carried over from one financial year into the next. Mr Barry Reamsbottom, CPSA general secretary, said: 'Against the background of the government's determination to freeze the public-sector pay bill, this is a remarkable achievement. We have forced the government to make a decent offer.' Most of the rise involves a one-off lump sum payment of 1.8 per cent which will not be consolidated into pay or pensions. The rest comprises performance pay. The deal looks like setting the trend for public-sector settlements this year. Most forecasts give overall rises of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent in the public sector. The union also said that it had recorded its highest membership for a decade in spite of legislation aimed at making it easier for union members to relinquish their memberships.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: LITTON'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE WILL STEP DOWN  </P> <P> Roland O. Peterson will step down as president and chief operating officer of  Litton Industries on Nov. 1 to take an interim position as part of his plan for  early retirement.  </P> <P> The board selected Alton J. Brann, a Litton vice president and group executive,  to succeed Peterson.  </P> <P> Brann, 48, will also be a candidate for director at the annual shareholders  meeting in December, replacing Peterson, who decided not to seek reelection.  The management shift came as a surprise to analysts. Litton said it was made  because Peterson, who will be 59 next January, plans to retire soon. Peterson  wants to retire before he becomes 65, the mandatory retirement age for Litton  executives, said Robert Knapp, a company spokesman.  </P> <P> Peterson will be a senior vice president and group executive of Litton's  Components and Industrial Products business until he retires. The group  includes divisions that produce components for computers and microwaves.  Peterson will also assume the office of chief scientist at Litton, replacing  Charles Bridge, who retired last month.  </P> <P> Peterson has a 30-year history at the Beverly Hills-based firm, which supplies  advanced electronic equipment for the military and manufactures microwave  components and industrial automation systems. He was first elected president in  1988.  </P> <P> "Taking this step toward retirement has allowed the board to select my  successor early, which will result in better management continuity," Peterson  said in a statement.  </P> <P> Brann, who heads the Components and Industrial Products group, joined Litton in  1973. He was formerly president of Litton's Guidance &amp; Control division,  which supplies the military, and was elected a corporate vice president in  1984. GEORGE WHITE  </P></p>

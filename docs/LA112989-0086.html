			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> RUMORS ON BARRY NOT SUBSTATIANTED  </P> <P> The District of Columbia's former police chief, Maurice T. Turner, said  investigators were unable to substantiate a report six years ago that Mayor  Marion Barry was twice hospitalized for cocaine overdoses, the Washington Post  reported. The mayor's spokesman denounced the report of overdoses as  ridiculous. WUSA-TV said Monday that Barry was hospitalized for cocaine  overdoses at Howard University and D.C. General hospitals in 1983, according to  allegations made to police nine months later by Dr. Alyce Gullattee, a Howard  University drug abuse specialist. Turner said he turned the allegations over to  the department's Internal Affairs Division, which was then unable to verify  them.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 9 (CNS) -- Despite efforts made by  the Chinese authorities at various levels to settle the problem  of surplus rural labourers, the urban unemployment rate last  year increased to 2.6 percent, up from 2.4 percent.    An official of the Ministry of Labour estimated that urban  unemployment would reach three percent. Four reasons are seen  as the cause of this rise. First, the supply of labourers  surpasses the demand. Second, the growing number of bankrupt or  closed enterprises, leading to the rising number of unemployed  and the prolonging of unemployment. The unemployed this year  are estimated to reach five million with 1.8 million of them  needing financial relief. Third, surplus rural labourers have  speeded up their migration and are now put at 20 million.  Fourth, difficulties facing settlement of the unemployed have  increased.    Competition and profit-seeking has brought employment  difficulties in forestry, mining, railway labour and the defence  industry.</p>

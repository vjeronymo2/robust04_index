			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the RPT in Lome on 21 February; read by </F> RPT Deputy Secretary General Dahuku Pere]    [Text] The RPT [Rally of the Togolese People] would like to  express its gratitude to the Togolese men and women who have  just consecrated it, at the end of a multiparty election, as the  first party of democratic Togo. The RPT is happy about this  success, which consecrates its service to the nation and the  thorough work of renewal it has accomplished. As the first  party of the new National Assembly, it wants to fully play its  part in the country's government to support the action taken by  the president of the Republic to redress the country. It hopes  that after this long transition, the country will settle down to  work and regain its due position in the comity of nations.    The RPT deplores the fact that certain political party  leaders have tried to disrupt the election through defamation,  violence and fraud. It calls for the immediate prosecution of  the defamers and troublemakers. It notes that in several  constituencies, massive fraud was organized by the Action  Committee for Renewal. It has confidence that the institutions  that will have to handle cases of electoral petitions will  punish the cases of fraud and their authors. Concerned about  national unity, the RPT wishes to collaborate in renewed  fraternity with a broad-based union government consisting of all  those who are ready to contribute their capacities and concern  to serve to work for national redress under the high authority  of the head of state.</p>

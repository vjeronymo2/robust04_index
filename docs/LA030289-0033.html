			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SEQUOIAS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO FELL IN JC STATE FINALS  </P> <P> State championships don't grow on trees, but Valley College women's basketball  Coach Doug Michelson wouldn't be surprised to see one hanging from Sequoias  this Saturday night.  </P> <P> That's as in College of the Sequoias, which has a 33-3 record entering the  eight-team California junior college championships at Valley College and is the  top-seeded team from the northern half of the state.  </P> <P> "I would think going in that Sequoias is the favorite . . . because most teams  do not match up with its size and quickness," Michelson said.  </P> <P> Sequoias routed defending state champion Santa Rosa, 71-44, to reach the  quarterfinals, which begin at 2 this afternoon with Los Angeles Trade Tech  (28-1) meeting American River College (26-4).  </P> <P> Valley, making its second consecutive appearance in the state championships  under Michelson, will play San Mateo at 6 tonight.  </P> <P> The field comprises four teams from each of the Northern and Southern regions.  Valley (29-3), seeded third in the south and fifth in the state, has won 13  games in a row and 19 of its past 20.  </P> <P> "All eight teams are tough and there is a lot of parity in this tournament,"  Michelson said. "We are a very good shooting team and I like our chances."  </P> <P> Michelson said that he expects San Mateo (29-1), the Northern region's No.  2-seeded team, to run a zone defense against the Monarchs, who average 82.2  points a game. Valley has three players who average 10 or more points:  Sophomore center Ruth Aguilar (14.7), freshman forward Sandrine Rocher (12.1)  and freshman guard Tisa Rush (11.5).  </P> <P> San Mateo, the Golden Gate Conference champion, has won 21 games in a row and  has not lost since Dec. 7. Sophomore forward Valencia Hedgebeth is averaging a  team-high 14 points.  </P> <P> Valley, which won the Western State Conference Southern Division title,  advanced to the state championships with a 64-54 victory over Moorpark,  rallying from an 11-point deficit.  </P> <P> If Valley wins tonight, it will advance to the semifinals against the winner of  the Fullerton-Contra Costa game. Fullerton (26-1) has won 15 consecutive games  and is the top-seeded team from the Southern region. Contra Costa (28-8) is  seeded fourth among Northern region teams.  </P> <P> Sequoias will open against Golden West (14-16), the No. 4-seeded team from the  Southern region, at 4 p.m.  </P></p>

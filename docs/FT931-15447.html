			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Power cuts hit aluminium smelters TWO ALUMINIUM smelters on the Pacific west coast of America are cutting output because of power supply problems and the industry expects others to follow. Their supplier, the Bonneville Power Administration, is suffering from the drought in the area and has told smelters it must cut their supplies by 25 per cent until the end of February. Analysts suggest that any smelters that make cuts would not restore production for at least six months because of the cost and complexity of shutting down pot lines. There are 10 aluminium smelters in the area with a total annual capacity of 1.5m tonnes, equivalent to about 10 per cent of the western world's primary aluminium output. However, one, Reynolds Metals' Troutdale smelter, has already been temporarily closed because of low aluminium prices. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, pointed out that, if all the remaining smelters cut production by one quarter for six months it would take 150,000 tonnes out of the market this year. 'That is not enough to sustain a price rally in these markets and at a time when LME (London Metal Exchange) stocks are at record levels.' Mr MacMillan suggested that the possibility of production cuts in the Pacific north west was already 'partly factored into the market price'. On the London Metal Exchange yesterday the price of aluminium for delivery in three months fell by Dollars 5 to Dollars 1,237.50 a tonne. First to react to the power problems was the employee-owned Columbia Aluminium Corporation, which said that by Friday it would shut down 45,000 tonnes of annual capacity at its 180,000-tonnes-a-year Goldendale, Washington, smelter. Amax quickly followed by saying output would be cut by 25 per cent at its 272,000 tonnes-a-year smelter at Ferndale, Washington. Alcoa said it would make a decision today about its 210,000-tonnes-a-year Wenatchee smelter, which obtains half its power supply from the BPA. One option would be closure of a 42,000-tonnes-a-year potline. Kaiser, with two smelters - Mead (200,000 tonnes) and Tacoma (73,000 tonnes)  -supplied by the BPA also said it was 'weighing the options'. The BPA said its own problems were compounded by the recent decision to close the Trojan nuclear power station, in which it has a 30 per cent interest.  ----------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------------- Aluminium    +2,200   to   1,588,825 Copper       -9,425   to     305,475 Lead            +75   to     230,125 Nickel         +816   to      72,846 Zinc         +3,475   to     496,775 Tin          unchgd   at      15,680  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (45): Health dilemma THE developed world, the conventional wisdom runs, faces a growing health-care crisis. Most countries have not managed to halt the growth in the share of national income consumed by health. Most face a sizeable gap between demand for healthcare and the funding available. But before policy analysts throw up their hands in despair, they should read the World Bank's recent World Development Report. The bank's analysis points out that at the root of this healthcare dilemma lies an important success: the increase in the life expectancy of all of the world's citizens. In 1950, a child born in the developing world had a life expectancy of 40 years. Today it is 63 years. The chance of that child dying before the age of five is now three times lower than in 1950. The battle to improve health standards is not over. All regions of the world have seen a rise in life expectancy at birth over the past 40 years. But infant mortality is still 10 times higher in the developing world than in the established market economies. But economic development is the route to closing this gap: the message of the World Bank's report is that there is a 'mutually reinforcing cycle' from improved health standards to higher productivity and stronger economic growth and higher spending on health. Among developed countries, higher spending does not necessarily mean better care. The US spends more than twice as much as the UK as a percentage of GDP but more than 10 per cent of the US population has no assured access to health care. But higher spending certainly helps.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Northern Rock tops league table NORTHERN ROCK, the 11th largest building society, has taken first place in the yearly analysis of the performance of the largest 20 societies carried out by Mr John Wriglesworth, the analyst at UBS Global Research regarded as the industry's leading observer. The performance table, which has attracted some criticism but is closely watched by building society executives, ranks societies according to 12 performance ratios including measures of profitability, capital strength, management expenses, market share and interest margin. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest society, has slipped to second place based on 1992 financial performance. Yorkshire, the 12th largest, has risen to third from fourth in a year when societies were under pressure from high levels of mortgage bad debt. Societies whose ranking was badly affected by high mortgage arrears in the troubled southern housing market included Bristol &amp; West, the 10th biggest by asset size, which slipped seven places to 16th, and Chelsea, the 18th largest society, which fell three places to 19th position. Mr Wriglesworth said a notable feature of last year was the wide variation in societies' financial performance. Although many were affected by bad debt, a quarter of the top 20 managed to raise profits by more than 15 per cent and no society's pre-tax profits fell by more than 50 per cent. He said he did not believe that any of the top 20 societies would need to be 'rescued' by merger with a larger society 'in the foreseeable future'. Abbey National, the second largest mortgage lender after Halifax Building Society, would have ranked ninth behind Derbyshire Building Society in the UBS performance table if it had still been a society. It became a bank in 1989 and reports its interim results today. A separate analysis of bad debt and mortgage arrears in the report finds that Chelsea has the worst proportion of arrears in three of four categories. Its mortgage provision charge as a proportion of mortgage value was 2.52, compared with only 0.10 for Derbyshire, which had the best book. Building Societies Research: The Major Players.

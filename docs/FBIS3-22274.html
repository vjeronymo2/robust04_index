			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of recent  environmental reports monitored from media in FBIS Abidjan  Bureau and EAU coverage areas from 24 January to 7 February.    GHANA    Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in  English  at 2000 GMT on 24 January reports that a four-day international  seminar on forest land use, its conflicts and solutions in Ghana  and Africa, is under way in Kumasi. It is being organized by  the British Council in conjunction with the Ministries of  Environment and Land and Forestry as well as some associations.  According to a world report on environment "17 million hectares  of tropical forests are lost every year, while in Ghana a  considerable amount of the country's forest is lost." This is  due to the continued demand for new agricultural land for food  and cash crops, the excessive logging and the high incidence of  uncontrolable bush fire.    Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in  English  at 2000 GMT on 25 January reports that the Ofinso District  agro-forestry officer recently advised farmers there to take  agro-forestry seriously in order to help prevent soil erosion  and replenish its fertility. The announcer says that the  officer, who was speaking after a training trip organized for 25  farmers, also "advised them to control the spread of bush fires  and to stop the illegal burning of forest." The announcer  further says that at Cape Coast, the Central Regional forestry  officer " called for police protection and cooperation to stop  the illegal felling of trees by some timber contractors and  chainsaw operators in the region."    Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in  English  at 1300 GMT on 2 February reports that about 40 representatives  of member churches of the Christian Council of Ghana have begun  a five-day workshop in Accra to evolve strategies to tackle  issues of development and environment. The workshop will be  followed by another in the north, culminating in a national one  on the role of the Churches in national development. A  consultant to the Christian Council, who opened the workshop  say: "The churches can play a meaning role in development if  they have a sound economic base." The director of development  and environment department of the Christian Council of Ghana  say: "The time has come for the churches to pay greater  attention to environmental degradation."    KENYA    Nairobi KNA in English at 1700 GMT on 1 February in a  Nairobi-datelined item reports the Kenya Government will not  implement the second phase of the Kenya Indigenous Forests  Conservation (KIFCON) program funded by the ODA [expansion  unknown] because three out of the 11 conditions attached to the  renewal of the phase were unacceptable to the government.    Minister John Sambu for environment and natural resources  told a press conference in his office today that the insistance  of KIFCON that forests should be managed by private  organizations and NGOs was contrary to stipulations of the  Forest Act Cap. 385 and the government could not bear with it.    Mr. Sambu said that the government would also not accept a  suggestion that local communities be allowed to cultivate and  graze their livestock in the forests as the activities were  banned by the government in 1988 as a result of misuse.  Restating the government's policy on conservation of forests,  the minister said the government's forest conservation  strategies over the years had been to sensitize the local  community's attachment to the indigenous forest among other  policies.    He maintained that the government welcomed support from  donors with acceptable conditions and left the matter of KIFCON  with ODA to reconsider its stand. Mr. Sambu further disclosed  that out of 50.5 million shillings owed to the government by  forest licencees by December 1992, 29 million shillings had been  recovered by November last year (1993), following the  government's threat to suspend their operations. He denied that  the government intends to write off the debts as reported in the  local press.    MALI    Bamako Radiodiffusion-Television du Mali Radio in French at  2000 GMT on 26 January reports that the council of ministers met  on 26 January and adopted a bill and a draft decree ratifying  the convention on biologic diversity signed in Rio de Janeiro on  12 June 1992.    NIGERIA    Paris AFP in English at 1409 GMT on 1 February in a Lagos-  datelined item reports community representatives from Nigeria's  southern Delta State have told a government committee of their  fears of health risks arising from oil prospection and  production, THE GUARDIAN newspaper reported on 1 February.    The alarm was raised Monday by delegates from the Urhobo,  Isekiri and Ijaw communities at a meeting with a ministerial  team set up by General Sani Abacha's military regime to look  into their grievances.    The people of Delta state, the nation's largest producer of  oil, have become exposed to the hazards of oil exploration and  related activities by local and foreign companies, they said.  The delegates added that most rivers in the region have been  shown to be polluted with mercury and lead. "There is abundant  evidence that the disease pattern of the Urhobo population has  changed from the traditional malaria and pneumonia to diseases  of the respiratory tract, central nervous system as well as  blood system", one community leader stated.    High temperatures associated with gas flaring have killed  local vegetation and rendered land unproductive for crops, they  claimed. The communities have already complained about the  unfair distribution of oil revenues, which contribute more than  90 percent of Nigeria's annual income, the independent newspaper  said.    The government team includes Don Etiebet, Alex Ibru and  Melford Okilo, respectively ministers of petroleum resources,  internal affairs and commerce, who are all from oil-producing  southern states.    In protest at what they consider as political  marginalisation, environmental damage and economic strangulation  some residents of Delta State and neighbouring Rivers State have  stopped some oil companies from operating and destroyed schools,  hospitals and other buildings, a spokesman for one foreign oil  company told AFP.    Dakar PANA in English at 1515 GMT on 7 February in a  Lagos-datelined item reports an international workshop on the  environment and sustainable development opened here on 7  February with participants urging an integrated solution to the  global problem.    In a keynote address, Rasheed Saba, of Nigeria's Federal  Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA), said that poverty, debt  burden, and other problems facing the developing countries must  be addressed for environmental protection to be meaningful.  "Where a people are hungry, homeless and hopeless, you do not  expect them to protect the environment," said Saba.    He called for a "multi-disciplinary process on education and  environmental awareness at all levels", capacity-building in the  developing nations, and a "bottom-up and participatory  approach". The environmental expert warned that sustainable  development should not be left at the mercy of economic  indicators.    He urged the industrialised north to abandon their "wasteful  consumption pattern." According to him, "25 percent of the  world's rich consume close to 85 percent of the resources and  produce some 90 percent of the waste". He said that "southern  governments and their elites are their peoples worst enemies."    Maurice Sheridan of the U.K.-based Foundation for  International Environmental Law and Development, FIELD, said the  global endorsement of the Rio Declaration and other treaties  should be backed by concrete action. The week-long workshop is  being sponsored by the British Council in Nigeria and the  Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies. Topics to be  discussed include "Human Rights and the Environment", "Access to  Environmental Justice", "Environmental Protection and the  Transfer of Technology", and the "Role of NGO's in Achieving  Sustainable Development".    Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English at 0600 GMT on 27  January reports that the Federal Government has announced the  appointment of Dr. Evans Aina as the director general of the  reformed Federal Environmental Protection Agency. A statement  on the appointment was signed by the secretary to the government  of the Federation, Alhaji Aminu Saleh.    Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English at 1800 GMT on 1  February reports that Alhaji Dabo Aliyu, administrator of Yobe  State, has called for pedology assistance in tackling ecological  problems. He made the appeal while receiving a team of military  officers from the Commandant Staff College, Jaji, who were on  study tour of the state. The administrator explained that the  menace of environmental degradation affects the socioeconomic  life of the people, adding that drought, desertification, and  deforestation affect the agricultural production of the  communities in the state. He also said that the damming  activities in Bauchi, Kano, and Jigawa states have cost about 45  percent of the water flow along River Yobe, adding that most of  the lands cultivated for rice, wheat, and irrigation farming has  been dried up.    Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English at 0600 GMT 11  February reports that Lieutenant Colonel Muhammed Onunka,  military administrator of Edo State, has announced guidelines  designed to sustain the exploitation of forest resources. He  said at a meeting with saw millers in Benin-City that  indiscriminate exploitation of forest resources was endangering  the world famous species of trees. He announced that It is now  mandatory for timber contractors to replenish cleared parts of  the forests and to pay royalties directly to affected  communities.    Lagos Voice of Nigeria in English at 1030 GMT 12 February  announces that Alhaji Malam Adamu Ciroma, minister of  agriculture and natural resources, has inaugurated a national  advisory council and a technical committee to oversee the  implementation of the tropical forests action program aimed at  addressing the problems of deforestation in the country.  Speaking at the ceremony in Abuja, Minister Ciroma stated that  the problem of deforestation had become more poignant with the  absence of a plan to replenish the forests. He said that the  council would advise the government on the program, ensure  commitment to its implementation, and establish interministerial  or intersectorial mechanism at field level.    TANZANIA    Dar es Salaam Radio Tanzania Network in Swahili at 1300 GMT  25 January reports John Malecela, the prime minister and first  vice president, has stressed the government's stand that  Tanzania has no agreement and will not enter into any agreement  with any country making it a dump for toxic waste.    Responding to a supplementary question in Parliament,  Malecela assured parliamentarians and citizens in general that  the Government of Tanzania has not allowed and will not permit  the country to be turned into a dump for such toxic waste. He  asserted that to date there was no evidence whatsoever that such  a situation had ever emerged in the country. Malecela said that  if any MP or citizen could procure or had full evidence of entry  of such waste into the country, he could present such claims to  his office, and that it was not necessary to set up a committee  to deal with the issue.    Earlier, it was alleged that a ship called (Felicia) which  had anchored at the port of Dar es Salaam was carrying a cargo  of toxic waste but it was subsequently proved that the ship was  carrying explosives destined for Zambia and Mbeya in the  southern part of the country, for use at the cement factory.    UGANDA    Dakar PANA in English at 1504 GMT on 2 February in a  Kampala-datelined item states: "The water level in Lake  Victoria, Africa's largest, dropped one meter in the month of  January 1994, according to Water Development Department of the  Ugandan Ministry of National Resources. The director of water  development, Patrick Kahangire, attributed the drastic fall to  prolonged droughts saying Uganda has not received enough rains  in the last three years. He said water levels of major lakes in  Uganda have dropped to their lowest for the last 30 years mainly  because of insufficient rainfall.    Other lakes including Lake Kyoga in the middle of the  country  and Lake Wamala in the central region have also lost a lot of  water over the same period. Kahangire was of the opinion that  the current situation could be part of the meteorological cycle  which repeats itself after a certain period characterised by  short periods of heavy rainfall followed by years of drought  during which lakes dry up. The manager of the wetland project,  Paul Mafabi, recalled that Uganda experienced heavy rains in  1923 followed by years of insufficient rains up to 1961. He  said during that time the water levels on Uganda's lakes were  very low until the heavy rains of 1962-63 raised the water  levels. Since 1964, the lakes have been experiencing a downward  trend in water levels, reaching lowest point in January,  Kahangire said. Officials of the water development department  and the Uganda Freshwater Research Organization (UFRO), agree  that the presence of the water hyacinth on Ugandan lakes had  accelerated loss of water from lakes through rapid evaporation.    The volume of water in the rivers flowing into some of the  lakes had tremendously decreased and in some cases the rivers  have dried up, they said. Kahangire said that a further fall in  the water levels could affect Uganda's power generation at Jinja  Dam, 80 kilometers east of Kampala, the berthing of ships and  worsen the concentration of pollutants in the lakes.    Other sources said some water pumping stations in the  country  had started experiencing difficulties in pumping water because  of the receding water line.</p>

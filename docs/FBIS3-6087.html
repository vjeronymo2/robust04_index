It is hoped that concrete  steps will be taken to bring about the consolidation and  retrenchment of U.S. military forces and facilities."    The governor thanked Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and  Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi, saying: "The fact  that issues concerning the consolidation and retrenchment of  U.S. military facilities in Okinawa were taken up at the highest  level of consultations between Japan and the United States  regarding security and other relevant affairs indicates a big  step has been taken in resolving problems related to military  bases, such as the return of U.S. military bases and prevention  of damage caused by military bases."    Governor Ota also expressed some expectations, adding: "As  indicated in such developments as the recent visit to the United  States by Ichiro Yoneyama, director general of the Defense  Facilities Administration Agency, the Japanese and U.S.  Governments have come to understand the importance of military  base issues and have thus decided to come to the negotiating  table. It is very encouraging since this indicates that  prospects are growing brighter toward bringing about a solution  to our problems."</p>

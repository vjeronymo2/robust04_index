			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH : TWO NEW PLAYS PART OF SCR'S '88-89 SEASON; TALKS WITH DIRECTORS,  CHOREOGRAPHERS END  </P> <P> South Coast Repertory's 1989-90 season will include at least two brand-new  plays, one American premiere and one Southern California premiere, artistic  director Martin Benson has announced.  </P> <P> The first productions of Howard Korder's "Search and Destroy" and Richard  Hellesen's "Once in Arden" and the first Southern California staging of Hugh  Whitemore's "Breaking the Code" will be on South Coast's main stage.  </P> <P> On the Second Stage, South Coast will produce the American premiere of Sharman  MacDonald's "When I Was a Girl, I Used to Scream and Shout" and the previously  reported "Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune" by Terrence McNally.  </P> <P> Only five of next season's 11 offerings -- and no dates -- were announced. A  theater spokesman said the rest of the season should be firm within a month.  "We're attempting to give subscribers whatever we can," he said. The theater's  annual subscription campaign has just begun.  </P> <P> Three productions for the 507-seat Mainstage and three for the 161-seat Second  Stage have yet to be decided. For the Mainstage, Benson and producing artistic  director David Emmes are considering Moliere's "The Miser," Noel Coward's  "Design for Living," Bertolt Brecht's "Mother Courage" and, more remotely, Alan  Ayckbourn's "Woman in Mind."  </P> <P> "There are other possibilities as well," Benson said, but he declined to  disclose them.  </P> <P> Korder's "Search and Destroy," which was commissioned by SCR, is about a  Florida businessman who encounters tax troubles and decides to seek meaning in  his life. It was read at SCR earlier this year.  </P> <P> "Once in Arden" is the first script by an Orange County resident to win a berth  on a South Coast subscription season since 1973. Hellesen lives in Fullerton  and teaches at Cal State Fullerton. His play is about Polish-born Helena  Modjeska, the renowned Shakespearean actress who retired to Orange County  around the turn of the century after touring the country for three decades. The  play received a staged reading, starring Nan Martin, earlier this month at  SCR's California Play Festival.  </P> <P> "Breaking the Code" chronicles the life of Alan Turing, the British  mathematician who helped decide the outcome of World War II by cracking the  German secret code "Enigma." It opened in London in 1986 and on Broadway in  1987, both times starring Derek Jacobi.  </P> <P> "When I Was a Girl . . . ," a Scottish play, takes place at the beach and tells  the story of a mother-daughter relationship. It opened in London in 1988.  </P> <P> "Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune" will be a vehicle for two SCR  veteran players, Richard Doyle and Karen Hensel. It was on the Mark Taper Forum  season last fall.  </P> <P> DIRECTORS MAY WALK: The Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers (SSDC)  has broken off contract negotiations with the League of Resident Theatres  (LORT). LORT's final proposal, judged unacceptable by union officials, will be  voted on at an SSDC membership meeting in New York June 12.  </P> <P> If the offer is rejected, the union's members nationwide will be directed not  to work at the 67 theaters that belong to LORT -- which include the Mark Taper  Forum, South Coast Repertory, the Old Globe and La Jolla Playhouse. However,  the union's executive board voted Tuesday to allow work to continue on any  productions that have begun rehearsals by June 12.  </P> <P> Most Southern California LORT members would not be immediately affected by an  exodus of SSDC directors.  </P> <P> The Taper's summer production, "Temptation," went into rehearsals Tuesday.  South Coast's next production, "Sunday in the Park With George," opens next  week. However, South Coast's Benson said an SSDC walkout could alter the  theater's choice of its opening play for next season: "The only thing that will  affect us is the timing, in other words which directors we can approach first  to begin rehearsals. And that could affect which play we open with."  </P> <P> At La Jolla, the season's only shows that won't start rehearsals by June 12  will be directed by the theater's artistic director, Des McAnuff, or the  artistic director of Chicago's Goodman Theatre, Robert Falls; most artistic  directors are expected to side with the theaters rather than with the union.  </P> <P> Similarly, at the Old Globe, two of the three summer productions that haven't  begun rehearsals will be directed by the theater's executive producer Craig  Noel and its artistic director Jack O'Brien. John Hirsch, who will stage the  remaining summer show, "has indicated he would honor his contract with us,"  said Old Globe managing director Thomas R. Hall, who is also the president of  LORT.  </P> <P> An informational meeting for West Coast members of SSDC is scheduled for June  15 at 6 p.m. at the Directors Guild of America headquarters in Hollywood.  </P> <P> MESMERIZING?: The team of Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee ("Inherit the  Wind") has collaborated with Norman Cousins on a new play, "Whisper in the  Mind," about the efforts of hypnotism pioneer Franz Anton Mesmer to convince  1786 Paris of the value of his treatments. It's the first theatrical endeavor  for Cousins, the former editor of Saturday Review and author of books about the  healing powers of the mind.  </P> <P> The play will be read by David Dukes, E. G. Marshall, John Randolph and Mala  Powers at UCLA's Freud Theatre on June 17 at 7:30 p.m. as the first project of  the newly formed Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theatre, which hopes to present four to  six professional play readings a year. Paul Heller and Martha Scott are the  producers.  </P> <P> Admission is free, but reservations are required: call (213) 284-8965.  </P> <P> GROUNDLING RUMBLINGS: Tom Maxwell, director of the Groundlings for the last  decade, has resigned to pursue television and movie ventures. His  responsibilities as artistic director will be assumed by Bill Schreiner, at  least temporarily, while Oren Michaels has been hired to run the business side  of the troupe as executive director.  </P> <P> WHOSE SET IS IT? Nicholas Dorr, credited as set designer for the West End  Playhouse's "Absurd Person Singular" in the program and in a recent Times  review, said he left the production on April 10, before the scheduled April 29  opening, and disclaimed responsibility for the set. David Brown, a spokesman  for the production, replied that Dorr's design was still used, even after he  left, but that his departure had delayed the opening of the show by one week.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Preparation for Implementation of NSMP and ANSMP <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is currently sponsoring a demonstration project to evaluate the optimum use of NSMP as a way for school meals to meet the Dietary Guidelines while ensuring that students also receive needed nutrients and calories. One of the main objectives of this demonstration is to assist the Department in identifying the technical assistance necessary to most efficiently and effectively implement NSMP. This approach shifts the focus from the traditional specifics of a meal pattern to meals containing a combination of foods that meet the nutritional needs of school-age children, by age group, over a school week. Under NSMP and ANSMP, school food authorities will have more flexibility in deciding what other foods will be offered as long as the nutrition standards are met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Flexibility of NSMP and ANSMP <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed menu development and analysis system has a number of advantages over the current meal pattern, and the Department believes the proposed change to adopt NSMP and ANSMP will greatly assist local school food authorities with implementation of the proposed nutrition standards. With NSMP and ANSMP, there is greater flexibility in food selections and portion sizes because meals are not limited to specific types of foods in specified portions. Further, menus with cultural or other special preferences will be easier to design. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSMP and ANSMP would also eliminate the need for cumbersome and often confusing food crediting decisions such as whether taco chips or just taco pieces could be considered as a bread alternate or whether yogurt can be allowed as part of a reimbursable meal. The complex Child Nutrition labeling program, which requires the Department to determine how commercial products are credited as food components under the meal pattern, would be substantially reduced in scope or perhaps even eliminated entirely. More nutrient dense items could be added to menus under NSMP, and the nutritional contributions of all foods offered to the child can be recognized. The Department also wishes to emphasize that all nutrients offered to the child are counted in the analysis, including those in foods such as yogurt and desserts which do not presently count toward a reimbursable meal. Of course, the most important aspect of both NSMP and ANSMP is that school food authorities will have an accurate, practical on-going means of determining if the nutrition standards are being met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Fortification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal does not require school food authorities to distinguish between naturally occurring nutrients and those that are added through fortification. However, the Department is committed to the principle that the preferred source of adequate nutrition is a meal comprised of a variety of conventional foods, as recommended in the Dietary Guidelines, rather than one containing formulated fortified foods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has been unable to develop a practical method for regulating or monitoring fortification. For example, it is virtually impossible to calculate the amounts of nutrients added to food items and those naturally occurring, especially for food items with numerous ingredients. Although a comparison could be made between a fortified item and a similar item that had no added nutrients, there may not be an identical product on which to base the comparison. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes the standards as outlined under NSMP that meals contain adequate calories and that at least three menu items be offered, as well as the higher expense of engineered foods, will inhibit excessive reliance on highly fortified foods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department welcomes commenters to address the use of fortified foods in school meal programs, particularly whether there are practical ways to control over-use of fortification, the degree to which this should be a concern, and potential impacts on the character of school meals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that if NSMP/ANSMP is implemented on a nationwide basis, the current regulatory requirements on the use of alternate foods would no longer be necessary. During the interim and where the meal patterns are still in use, these regulations would remain in force. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Operational Aspects of NSMP and ANSMP <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> National Nutrient Database for the Child Nutrition Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to conduct nutrient analysis, data on the nutrients contained in a wide range of foods must be available. To meet this need, the Department has developed a centralized National Nutrient Database to allow for accurate nutrient analysis of the menus and recipes used in the NSLP and SBP. The National Nutrient Database contains information on the nutritional composition of: (1) Commodities supplied through the Department; (2) standard reference food items which are used in the SBP and NSLP; (3) Quantity Recipes for School Food Service developed by the Department, and; (4) convenience, processed and pre-prepared foods from food manufacturers. The Department is working closely with the food industry to obtain nutrient analysis of many common food products used by schools for inclusion in the database. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The implementation of NSMP, as opposed to ANSMP, is dependent upon the school or school food authority's ability to analyze the nutrient content of foods. Therefore, the Department is proposing to require that the National Nutrient Database be incorporated into all school food service software systems used for menu and recipe analysis under NSMP. Under ANSMP, the database would be used by the entity providing assistance with nutrition analysis. The Department is making the database available free of charge to participating school food authorities and to computer software companies to develop school food service software programs. The database will be regularly maintained and updated to ensure that the information is as accurate and current as possible. School food authorities would be expected to incorporate these updates into their own software as they are made available. It should be noted that a preliminary version of the Department's database is now available. Information on how to obtain it can be secured from the Department's Child Nutrition Database Hotline at (301) 436&hyph;3536. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

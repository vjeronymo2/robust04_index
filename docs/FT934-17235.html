			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Survey of Lanarkshire (4): German linked / Profile of Atlas Hydraulic Loaders THE village of Blackwood, just off the M74 about 10 miles south of Motherwell, is not a well-known manufacturing centre. Yet the former mining village's main employer is the biggest manufacturer of lorry loading cranes in the UK. Blackwood is the UK headquarters of Atlas Hydraulic Loaders, a German-owned company which has been in Lanarkshire for 30 years. It is the only full overseas manufacturing unit of Atlas Weyhausen, a family-owned company with turnover of about DM 800m based near Bremen. At Blackwood, Atlas makes lorry loading cranes - the type of crane that is permanently mounted on a lorry - and manufactures mini-excavators in a plant at nearby Hamilton. Despite the recession, now hitting the German market, it is implementing a Pounds 10m investment programme in its Scottish plants, whose products are designed in Germany. Atlas began manufacturing at Blackwood in 1963 at the suggestion of its Scottish dealer. It has been there ever since. It employs about 250 in Scotland and 70 in its English sales offices. Noemployees come fromGermany. 'The workforce is stable - several of them have worked here for 20 years - and I don't find any difficulties operating here,' says Mr James Hanshaw, the subsidiary's managing director who has worked for US and German companies in Asia, Australia, the US and Europe. He does a daily cross-country drive from his home near Peebles in the Borders. 'The maintenance of the roads could be better,' he says. Atlas's UK sales grew from Pounds 5m in 1980 to Pounds 27m last year and are expected to reach Pounds 35m this year. It has 45 per cent of the UK market for lorry loading cranes (80 per cent of these sales supplied from its Scottish plant) but also exports about 60 per cent of turnover. Much of its output goes to Germany. Atlas Hydraulic Loaders also claims to be the biggest and fastest growing maker of mini-excavators in the UK, with output rising from 400 units last year to nearly 1,000 this year as it begins manufacturing new models. 'We are taking market share from our competitors in the UK thanks partly to very aggressive pricing,' Mr Hanshaw says. 'Quality comes before short term profits. The parent company does not take dividends from the UK subsidiary - all our profits are reinvested. We're going to be here in five or 10 years' time.' The Pounds 10m investment programme at Atlas Hydraulic Loaders which began last year has involved expanding production space by 21 per cent to 150,000 square feet and refurbishing the plants with the latest machinery and computer systems. ' We wanted to bring our manufacturing facilities up to German standards. The world is demanding higher standards,' says Mr Hanshaw. 'Our German customers are particularly conscious of quality, especially with products made in Britain.'</p>

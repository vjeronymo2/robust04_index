			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> GENE FOUND TO SUPPRESS PROSTATE CANCER GROWTH  </P> <P> The retinoblastoma gene, the prototype member of a family of so-called  anti-oncogenes that protect against certain types of cancer, can suppress  growth of prostate cancer cells, UC San Diego researchers reported in Science  last week.  </P> <P> The gene had previously been reported to have the same effect in retinoblastoma  -- a rare tumor of the eye -- breast cancer, bone cancer and small-cell lung  cancer.  </P> <P> The gene's effectiveness in controlling growth of cultured prostate tumor cells  suggests that it and related genes play a major role in protecting humans from  cancer. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. The discovery "gives  us insight into genetic events related to prostate cancer, of which we know  very little," said UCSD molecular biologist Robert Bookstein, who authored the  report along with Wen-Hwa Lee and their colleagues.  </P> <P> The ability of the RB gene to suppress several types of tumor growth suggests  that each of the 100 types of cancer may have a gene equivalent to the RB gene  that protects against it. Researchers hope eventually to be able to insert the  RB gene into tumors to halt their growth.  </P></p>

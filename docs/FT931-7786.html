			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Panel tackles UN funds crisis AN international panel of 'wise men' has recommended reforms aimed at resolving the United Nations' almost permanent financial crisis, which is due largely to member states' failure to pay their contributions on time. The panel, under Sir Brian Urquhart, former UN under-secretary general, says the UN must be assured of the timely availability of funds to meet the growing obligations placed on it by member states. The panel suggests that in future if any of the 180-member states fail to pay dues on time they should face financial penalties. This year, only 1 per cent of the membership met the January 31 deadline. To make it easier for poorer nations, a quarterly instalment system should replace the current lump sum arrangement, the report suggests. However, it opposed a proposal made by former Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar that the UN be allowed to make outside borrowings. The report also calls for the establishment of a Dollars 400m (Pounds 281.6m) revolving fund for peacekeeping, financed by three annual assessments on member states, to assure reliable financing in the start-up phase of peacekeeping. Because the initial phase is usually the most costly and dangerous, financing delays can be crippling, it warns. To streamline the existing process, the report also suggests that the UN consider creating a unified peacekeeping budget, financed by a single annual assessment, in addition to the revolving fund. The report, being released in New York today by the Ford Foundation, notes that while the UN had only some 15,000 peacekeepers deployed two years ago, there are nearly 55,000 today. A doubling of the UN's Dollars 100m Working Capital Fund is recommended. Last increased in 1982, the fund was depleted to offset arrears in member states' dues. The minimal size of the reserve is too small to protect against fluctuations in receipts and expenditures, the panel says. Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, and Mr Shijuro Ogata, retired deputy governor of the Japan Development Bank, served as co-chairmen of the panel.</p>

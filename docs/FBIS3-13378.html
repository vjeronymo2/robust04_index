			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview published in today's issue of  AL-DIYAR, Lebanese Forces Commander Dr. Samir Ja'ja' views the  situation in Ghidras and the recent security measures, arrests,  and house searches.    Dr. Ja'ja' said: The first thing that caught my attention in  the security developments concerning Ghidras and the  headquarters of the Lebanese Forces is that a security source  accused me of cheap public posturing. I would like to ask this  source, in all cordiality, why is he afraid to identify himself?  First of all, who is this security source? Secondly, in what  self-respecting country in the world do security personnel  dabble into political matters and accuse politicians, ministers,  and deputies.    A security man's job is to gather security information and  report them to the legal authorities and political officials,  who may take the necessary action and, if need be, file charges.    Today, for example U.S. President Bill Clinton is facing  accusations. The attorney general, a Washington Court judge,  the secretary of the interior, and the attorney general are the  ones who may comment on whether the President of the United  States is to face charges or not. But things are different  here. I find it totally unacceptable that a security official  should make statements or leak news at will.    The second remark that I found interesting is the claim that  the Lebanese authorities are currently examining the possibility  of liquidating the Lebanese Forces. This is the first time I  have heard of such a thing. I call on the anonymous individual  who spread such rumors to identify himself. For example, is he  the interior minister, who has the legal right to bring up that  matter, or the defense minister, or the president, or the prime  minister, or the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies?    I, for one, have not heard any official proposing the  disbanding of the Lebanese Forces. Not one official has even  come close to expressing such a notion. It is evident that we  have to live according to the country's laws, but we refuse to  live according to the law of the jungle.    Dr. Ja'ja' was asked: Returning to the security source, we  would like answers to the accusations the he made, particularly  the charge that the Lebanese Forces are not interested in  politics, but are an intelligence service that is still in  operation.    Dr. Ja'ja' answered by saying: If I wanted to respond to  some of the points made by anonymous security sources -- for  example, the claim that I do not want to engage in politics -- I  would ask this: What am I involved in, then? I am specifically  involved in politics. It is because I am involved in politics  that they [not further specified] deal with us in the way that  we have seen of late. According to them, we do not want to  participate in political life, but indulge in intelligence work.  This is a serious accusation.    The individual making such allegations is not weighing his  statements carefully. If he has evidence but is still silent,  then he is remiss in his security duties. If he has no evidence  and is not sure of what he is saying, he is committing a serious  offense against political and public freedoms in this country.  No official is entitled to make random accusations against any  political party or individual.    Ja'ja' added: What I do not understand is why every time an  incident occurs, accusations are leveled against us. For two  years or more the authorities have been saying that I detain  people at will. I still remember the uproar that arose after  the Israeli attack last July or August in the south. At that  time, the authorities made large-scale sweeps and searched the  homes of Lebanese Forces' officials. They just use the Lebanese  Forces as a whipping boy.    Ja'ja' said: If an attack happens in the south, it is the  Lebanese Forces. If an explosion happens in the American  University of Beirut, it is the Lebanese Forces. If the  Phalangist Headquarters is blown up, it is the Lebanese Forces.  The bombing in Sayyidat al-Najat Church: The Lebanese Forces.  If a citizen beats up his neighbor in Ba'labakk: The Lebanese  Forces. All these accusations are groundless. It is clear that  we are up against a deliberate smear campaign.    What I want to say is that they have repeatedly made  accusations against the Lebanese Forces. They prejudge us and  then carry out searches and arrests. What good did the arrest  of thousands of young Lebanese Forces' supporters do after the  Israeli attack in the south? The pretext for these campaigns --  if I remember right -- was that there was another Israeli attack  on the home front. Did I call for an Israeli attack against the  south? They claimed to be making preparations to confront  Israeli attacks? Fine. What have they found out?    They have made big accusations, serious accusations. This is  how we see it. They made serious and untrue accusations against  us. Had such charges been made against any other individual or  party in Lebanon, we would have found them unacceptable,  particularly because they were designed to mislead. Underlying  these accusations is a scheme to bully the Lebanese Forces.    Dr. Ja'ja' said: Some people wonder why all this uproar  over the Ghidras issue. The state has two stories it is trying  to propagate. According to a statement issued by the Lebanese  state, the first story is that the recent security measures are  part of the general security plan in Lebanon. If this is the  case, why is the state angry? Is the Army not entitled to set  up roadblocks on any road?    According to the state's second version, there are fugitives  and wanted people; hence they are confusing things. Officials  say that there are fugitives, wanted people, explosives experts,  and suspects, and that all those are in Ghidras. I will respond  to each claim.    As for the first version, Dr. Ja'ja' said: First of all, the  state cannot just level accusations against anyone, because  there is a judiciary in Lebanon. As long as there is a  judiciary system in Lebanon, the current events are  impermissible. Accordingly, why is the state not naming the  defendants, listing all the incidents incriminating the  defendants, and bringing them to trial? As you know, when such  steps are taken, the families of the defendants will appoint a  defense lawyer and the state will appoint a public prosecutor.  This is a procedure applicable throughout the entire world.  Dr. Ja'ja' said that all that the state has said is absolutely  impractical and inconclusive.    As for the second version, Dr. Ja'ja' answered: All the  accusations leveled by the state as a pretext for its security  deployment in Ghidras are, in my opinion, not true. All these  accusations are aimed at curbing the political activities in  Ghidras. Some officials say that there are wanted people in  Ghidras. If, for the sake of argument, we do have wanted people  here, let the state send the police here. How can a wanted  person be told that he is wanted? If the state thinks that I  have wanted people here and if it knows their names, let the  state send me a list of names.    Dr. Ja'ja' added: Nobody has talked to us about this issue.  I dare say that no official, regardless of his level, had  talked to me or to any official in the Lebanese Forces about the  wanted people. Therefore, this issue is not under discussion.    In answer to a question of whether Dr. Ja'ja' believes that  there is both a political authority and a military authority in  Lebanon, he said: I do not want to get involved in such issues.  But the responsibility for the approach the state is currently  taking should be shouldered by the political authority. I  consider this authority responsible for what is taking place in  Ghidras. I urge the interior minister, who is responsible for  internal security, to take charge of this issue. We also demand  that this minister behave as an interior minister should,  because he is directly concerned with the issue. The days of  militias are over and no one is allowed to behave as a  militiaman. Mirhij must behave as an interior minister. He must  tell us what is required, or else we have the right to ask him  about all these measures around Ghidras.    In response to a question about the extent of the current  measures, Dr. Ja'ja' said: I have no idea. But Lebanon will  not remain without political liberties. I urge the state  politicians to understand the magnitude of what happened. I  urge them to resolve it in the best possible way, or else they  will be held historically responsible for Lebanon's decline.    Asked about rumors that Samir Ja'ja' will end up in exile  abroad, he said: No, this is absolutely not true. Our  political stand will not change. There is no reason for anyone  to worry, because the current rumors will backfire on those who  spread them. They may not care about public opinion, but we do  care a lot about it.    To another question of whether he and Patriarch Sfayr share  the same stand and whether he expects that pressures will be  brought to bear on the patriarch, Dr. Ja'ja' said: I hope the  opposite will occur and that no pressures will be put on him. I  also hope that all the pressures on us will end as soon as  possible, because the pressures will destroy Lebanon. Lebanon  will only be built by every word that is expressed under the  canopy of freedom.</p>

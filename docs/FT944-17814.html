			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Bank of Scotland After this week's turmoil in the merchant banking sector, Bank of Scotland's results throw into sharp relief the question of what constitutes quality earnings from banking. While the merchant banks were wrestling with the collapse of returns from securities trading, Bank of Scotland has been making good profits out of old-fashioned lending. Provisions, which were never as high as those of other banks, are coming down; interest income is rising; and first-half pre-tax return on capital is 34 per cent. Yet there must be doubts about how long the bank can keep up its act. After all, there will not be another special dividend from 3i. Margins on mortgage lending will be compressed by higher base rates and the decline in non-performing loans will slow. The chances of Bank of Scotland being able to compensate for this with strong growth in its loan book are slim, which is why its focus on raising its capital ratio through retained earnings looks a little perverse. A more valid point is that even well-managed lending institutions are not immune from the cycle, so a degree of dividend-smoothing makes sense. Bank of Scotland is unlikely to sustain its present return - the slippage of profits from credit cards is a particularly ominous sign of increasing competition. But quality of earnings will be enhanced if the bank resists the temptation to follow the herd in making loans at foolish prices. Having managed prudent balance sheet growth in the recession, the bank should be applauded if it fails to be carried away by the recovery.</p>

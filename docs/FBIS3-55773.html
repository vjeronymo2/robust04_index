			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Uladzimir Hlod: "Stanislav Shushkevich: `Nobody </F> Will Save Us. Except We Ourselves.'"]    [Text] In an exclusive interview with a BELINFORM  correspondent, Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich has  confirmed the agency's report on his upcoming meeting with  Russian President Boris Yeltsin.    According to the legislature speaker, the meeting will be  held in the very near future. The sides are to outline their  positions for the upcoming visit to Moscow by U.S. President  Bill Clinton, and to discuss the main issues of  Belarusian-Russian relations. Stanislav Shushkevich emphasized  that the meeting is not accidental, but conscientiously  prepared. He also said that he will present not his own  viewpoint, but the opinion of the Supreme Soviet Presidium at  the meeting with Boris Yeltsin. The legislature leader refused  to detail the agenda of negotiations, and added that the  following tendency can be seen currently in the republic:  "Before an issue is thoroughly examined, discussed, and  analyzed, we consider it concluded."    Stanislav Shushkevich also stated that he will honestly  report to the Russian president the difficult economic situation  in our republic. He noted that, unfortunately, there are  widespread beliefs that even the best attitude of Russia toward  us cannot change the situation. "I have requested a report on  Minsk enterprises that are standing idle. I am afraid to reveal  the numbers. They are so disastrous that I have asked that they  be further specified. Unfortunately, many people at our finest  enterprises remain jobless through no fault of their own. This  testifies to the fact that our economy is in a critical state.  Therefore, I do not agree with the statements that we will solve  all our problems by introducing the monetary union. This is  concealing the disease. It should be cured, not concealed from  the doctor. We ourselves should find a way of adapting our  economy to market relations. Other economic relations are out  of the question, given our joining the union with Russia.  Should this not occur, the republic will be in danger of a  calamitous collapse. I will repeat it again: The ruble zone  will not save us from everyday hard work," underlined the  Supreme Soviet chairman.    According to Stanislav Shushkevich, the statement issued by  the prime ministers of Russia and Belarus, which has not yet  been ratified by signing appropriate documents that would  specify the mechanism for implementing it, resembles rather a  declaration of intentions.    Speaking about the upcoming visit to Minsk by Bill Clinton,  the leader of the Belarusian legislature noted that the  Belarusian-U.S. negotiations "will be of a consultative nature."  When we conceptually solve such issues as disarmament,  conversion, and the monetary union, the signing of appropriate  documents will be a technical matter, stated the Supreme Soviet  chairman.    Stanislav Shushkevich said that he had been very surprised  by  an INTERFAX report citing [Prime Minister] Vyacheslav Kebich as  saying that "after Russia joins NATO, also Belarus could become  a member of this bloc." The point is, explained the speaker,  that all basic documents of Belarus, including the Constitution,  set the course for neutrality, not for favoring any blocs. We  have a completely different foreign policy focused on  neutrality, stressed Stanislav Shushkevich. He admitted that he  had not yet discussed this issue with Vyacheslav Kebich, but  apparently, it must have been a mistake. Probably, journalists  misunderstood the prime minister, he added.    Additionally, Belarus has never and nowhere stated its  intentions to join NATO at the official level, concluded the  speaker. This statement contradicts the agreement on collective  CIS security, and Vyacheslav Kebich has always supported it.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BLUDGEONED WOMAN'S BODY FOUND IN HOME  </P> <P> Police on Sunday were investigating the death of a woman whose bludgeoned body  was found at her estranged husband's residence near Knott's Berry Farm.  </P> <P> The victim, identified by police as Donna J. Connaty, 34, was found dead of  head injuries inside the couple's house in the 7700 block of Jackson Way, Buena  Park Police Lt. Pat Black said.  </P> <P> Her husband, Richard P. Connaty, 38, spent the weekend in the desert riding  motorcycles with the couple's three children and was unaware of his wife's  death until he came home and found police investigating the homicide, neighbors  said.  </P> <P> Police said that the couple had been separated and that Donna Connaty had been  living with her mother in another house on Jackson Way, about a block from the  house she still jointly owned with her husband in the older, tree-lined  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Investigators at the scene questioned and released Richard Connaty, who works  as a diesel mechanic.  </P> <P> "There are no known suspects at the time," said Black, who declined to  elaborate on the investigation and said he did not know if there was evidence  of forced entry into the house.  </P> <P> Donna Connaty's body was discovered about 11:30 a.m. by her father-in-law,  Ramsay Connaty, who called police, Black said. Reached at his Buena Park home,  Ramsay Connaty declined comment.  </P> <P> The victim was last seen on Saturday at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, where  she worked a double shift as a nursing assistant, police said. Hospital  officials declined comment late Sunday.  </P> <P> Police declined to speculate on why Donna Connaty was at her estranged  husband's home. An autopsy will be performed to determine the time of death,  police said.  </P> <P> According to neighbors who declined to give their names, Donna Connaty had a  stormy relationship with her husband. Several months ago, she moved out of the  couple's house, residents said, but recently was spending more time there,  leading some to believe that she had moved back with her husband. Neighbors  said the couple's children were about ages 6, 8 and 10.  </P> <P> The violent death shocked residents of the normally quiet, residential street  just four blocks from Knott's Berry Farm. "We've never had anything like this  ever happen," said one longtime resident of Jackson Way. "This is kind of  frightening," she said.  </P> <P> Another resident said "it's a great neighborhood" and "everybody is shocked. We  want to get some details about what happened. There are a lot of kids here and  we're all pretty worried."  </P></p>

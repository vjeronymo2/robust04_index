			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 20105 of title 49 of the United States Code, (formerly Section 206 of the Safety Act (45 U.S.C. 435)) provides a mechanism by which a state agency can participate in the subject areas covered by today's regulation. That section provides for state participation in carrying out investigative and surveillance activities in connection with federal railroad safety rules. See also FRA's state participation regulations at 49 C.F.R. Part 212.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section explains that under 49 U.S.C. 20106 (formerly Section 205 of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 434)), issuance of these regulations preempts any State law, rule, regulation, order, or standard covering the same subject matter, except a provision directed at an essentially local safety hazard that is consistent with this part and that does not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 234.5 Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM contained proposals to add three definitions to those terms already defined in the rule. Commenters generally supported the proposed definitions contained in the NPRM. However, some parties suggested changes to two proposed definitions, ``appropriately equipped flagger'' and ``credible report of system malfunction''. No opposition was expressed to the definition of ``warning system malfunction.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``Appropriately equipped flagger.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, the definition of ``appropriately equipped flagger'' means a person other than a train crewmember who is equipped with an orange vest, shirt, or jacket for daytime flagging. For nighttime flagging, similar outside garments shall be retroreflective. The retroreflective material shall be either orange, white (including silver-colored coatings or elements that retroreflect white light), yellow, fluorescent red-orange, or fluorescent yellow-orange and shall be designed to be visible at a minimum distance of 1,000 feet. The design configuration of the retroreflective material shall provide recognition of the wearer as a person and shall be visible through the full range of body motions. Acceptable hand signalling devices for daytime flagging include STOP/SLOW paddles and red flags. For nighttime flagging, a flashlight, lantern, or other lighted signal shall be used. The West Virginia Department of Transportation recommended that flaggers' clothing, devices and training conform to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (``MUTCD'') in all respects. As we stated in the NPRM, we encourage railroads to provide equipment and training in accordance with ``Standards and Guides for Traffic Controls for Street and Highway Construction, Maintenance, Utility and Incident Management Operations'' issued by the Federal Highway Administration as part VI of the MUTCD. However, given the industry-wide cost of equipping in full accordance with the MUTCD and training thousands of employees, FRA is leaving to individual railroads the decision as to the extent of training and equipping beyond the minimum requirements of this rule. The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) commented that a uniformed police officer should be considered to meet the requirements of this section. We agree. As noted in the NPRM, FRA does not intend to impose flagging equipment requirements on police officers, including uniformed railroad police. Police officers are presumably trained and equipped for traffic control functions. There is therefore no need for requiring any additional training or equipment. The American Public Transit Association (APTA) suggested that FRA eliminate the requirement that flaggers carry specific signalling equipment. APTA stated that ``it is important for flaggers to have their hands free to stay in radio contact with the railroad, which may not be possible if the flagger has to carry items such as paddles. In the commuter railroad's experience, once a flagger is at a crossing, motorists will obey the flagger regardless of the flagger's signalling devices.'' We agree that a motorist will obey the flagger, however a motorist must first identify a person as a flagger, and then the motorist must be able to determine the instructions given by the flagger. FRA believes that the proposed requirements provide the motorist with the necessary visual clues. FRA believes that the proposed requirements are the minimum that provide safety for both the highway user  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the flagger and thus are retained in the final rule. Maine DOT also recommended that ``reflective'' be used to describe materials to be worn by flaggers rather than ``retroreflective.'' Retroreflective is used in the latest version of the MUTCD. FRA will retain use of ``retroreflective'' to maintain consistency with the MUTCD. In addition to the minimum standards established by this definition, FRA encourages railroads to provide flagging equipment and training in accordance with ``Traffic Controls for Street and Highway Construction, Maintenance, Utility and Emergency Operations'' issued by the Federal Highway Administration as Part VI of the MUTCD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

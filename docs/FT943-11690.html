			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / US rejects over-counter sales for Tagamet drug Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham's top-selling ulcer drug, should not yet be cleared for non-prescription sales in the US, two advisory committees of the Food and Drug Administration unanimously recommended yesterday. The decision is a blow for the Anglo-American healthcare group, which had been hoping to use over-the-counter sales to offset the expected rapid decline in Tagamet revenues in the US after the expiry of its patents in May. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, had been predicting worldwide non-prescription sales for Tagamet of Pounds 100m by 1997. Tagamet is already available without a prescription in the UK. SmithKline's shares yesterday fell 11 1/2 p to 408p. Another FDA advisory committee refused to recommend Rogaine, Upjohn's baldness treatment, for sale without a prescription. The two rejections reinforce industry concerns that the chances of extending drugs' revenues after patent expiries through non-prescription sales are being jeopardised by the FDA's increasing conservatism. 'This is a substantial setback for SmithKline Beecham. It's really important to be first to the (over-the-counter) market with these new generation drugs. The first (company) could generate annual US sales of Dollars 500m (Pounds 322m) by 1995, the second Dollars 200m and the third Dollars 100m,' said Mr Viren Mehtha of drugs analysts Mehtha &amp; Isalay. This is the second time FDA advisory committees have refused to recommend Tagamet. The committees will today consider whether to recommend Pepcid for sale without a prescription. The drug, marketed by Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US, is one of Tagamet's main rivals. Another rival, Zantac, Glaxo Holdings' top-selling product, is also being developed for non-prescription use. The committees were concerned about possible interactions of Tagamet with two widely prescribed medicines - Upjohn's sleeping pill Halcion and theopylline, an asthma treatment. However, they said their concerns about the effectiveness of Tagamet for heartburn, raised the last time they rejected the drug in September, had been met. Analysts said neither Zantac nor Pepcid had similar interactions with other drugs. SmithKline Beecham said it would conduct additional clinical trials to meet the committees' concerns. The committees voted that the drug could be licensed by the FDA without further intervention by them if their concerns were met. Mr Duncan Moore, pharmaceuticals analyst at brokers Morgan Stanley, said Tagamet could eventually be licensed. London stocks, Page 34</p>

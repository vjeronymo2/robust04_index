			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: High Gothic and lethal women - Video A WEEK ago, the trauma of Halloween. Two days ago, the terror of Guy Fawkes. Forty shopping days hence - Christmas. At this time of year, when we are all at screaming point, entertainment retailers take advantage. Horror is the style of the season and this year the world is turning Gothic even as we speak. A tide of vampire films is being readied for release across the Atlantic. And on video a flood of grand guignol, ancient and modern, laps at our feet in this month's releases. If you like your Gothic strong and self-parodic, you should try The Addams Family (CIC). This is the hit movie of the TV series with Anjelica Huston as 'Morticia', crunching her one-liners like edible bats. The wit is variable, but the sets and gewgaws are irresistible. The film also pinpoints a post-feminist trend. Look at all the modern scream movies in which women are the ghouls or evil genii. The unholy trinity of Final Analysis (Warner), Fatal Attraction (CIC) and Basic Instinct (Guild) makes the point thrice over. Trend-sensitive Hollywood, anxious to tap into all those frayed male nerves in the age of Steinem and Millett and Dworkin, hath no fury more lucrative than a woman scorned. Here they are: Glenn Close wielding a kitchen knife in Fatal Attraction, Kim Basinger a murderous dumb-bell in Final Analysis, Sharon Stone an ice-pick in Basic Instinct. Fatal women, of course, are not new: they merely seem new each time they return to our screens reborn in a new zeitgeist. The cinema's first great slayer-siren was surely Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel, eating up Professor Emil Jannings in the Sternberg masterpiece now reissued by Aikman Archive Video. This company also gives us Fritz Lang's Metropolis, in a 139-minute version claimed as the most complete available. Lang's futurist-Gothic epic, with its spectacular special-effect cityscapes, also has its own sci-fi version of fatal femininity: Brigitte Helm's robot-enchantress, brought to life in the greatest 'mad scientist' scene before Frankenstein. Not all in November is high Gothic and lethal women. Two encouraging areas in which the video market is expanding are art films and wide-screen films. Movies like Bille August's Cannes prize-winning The Best Intentions (Artificial Eye), with its majestic Ingmar Bergman script based on the life of his family, or Jocelyn Moorhouse's witty fable of a blind photographer Proof (Artificial Eye), or Lars Von Trier's eye-boggling essay in Euro-baroque Europa (Electric) bounce from festival to cinema release to video availability in three blinks of an eye. As for widescreen films issued in their proper format - 'letterboxed' for TV's squarer screen - their multiplying availability is music to purist's ears. Tartan Video is a new company fearlessly blacking out the tops and bottoms of screens so that in John Huston's Reflections In A Golden Eye (Taylor and Brando going charismatically mad in the Deep South) or Jerry Schatzberg's Honeysuckle Rose (Willie Nelson in a twangling road musical) or John Milius's Big Wednesday (surfing and rites of passage in modern Malibu), we can enjoy compositions as wide, true and felicitous as a Cheshire Cat's grin. You may of course wish to partake in the odd grin yourself: not an easy request in the comedy-deprived weeks after Halloween. But there is the Charlie Chaplin Collection (Fox). With the cheeky chappie about to bound onto our screens in Richard Attenborough's bio-pic, here is the real cane-twirling, baggy-trousered thing. Four cassettes comprising five films, including The Great Dictator, City Lights and Modern Times: they offer The chance to lock yourself away for six hours from all thoughts of vampires, ghoulies and icepick-wielding ice maidens.</p>

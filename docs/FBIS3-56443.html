			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Everyone has been waiting to hear what Russian  Finance Minister Boris Fedorov has to say in response to Yegor  Gaydar's announcement that he is quitting -- or rather that he  is not accepting -- the job of first deputy prime minister.    Boris Fedorov said today in an interview with the Ekho  Moskvy  radio station that he looks upon Yegor Gaydar's decision with  understanding. Fedorov called this move the beginning of a  turning point.    As far as he himself is concerned, in the finance minister's  words, he has not yet received an offer to enter the new  government. If he does receive one, Fedorov remarked, he will  reach his decision this Monday or Tuesday.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LERNER ON STATUS QUO  </P> <P> After reading Lerner's long discourse on the need for fresh approaches to the  ills of society, there is to my mind one salient feature to his views: He  applies the term socialism to what has long been described in the classic  philosophies as "civic virtue."  </P> <P> Why not use the established classical terminology, with the realization that  the civic virtue involved contemplates the human race as the citizenry, and  planet Earth as the region inhabited? That would certainly be consistent with  the fundamental Jewish hope that all mankind will accept the rule of a  universal God of justice.  </P> <P> LARRY SELK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

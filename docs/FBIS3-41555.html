The draft action plan contains measures to implement  ``Agenda  21,'' which was agreed on at the United Nations Conference on  Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro. The  draft plan cites six priority measures Japan hopes to implement  to ensure a more environment-friendly atmosphere.    According to the draft plan, Japan will make efforts to  build  a society capable of sustainable development while causing  little havoc on the global environment.    Japan intends to actively contribute to the establishment of  an international legal framework on global environmental  conservation and join international efforts to improve a  financial contribution mechanism, including reform of the global  environment facility, for conservation measures, the report said.    Priority will also be placed on contributing to developing  countries to help raise their capability to cope with  environmental problems, according to the draft.    Japan will promote the development of environment-related  technology and technology transfers, and appropriately and  systematically implement official development assistance, the  draft said.    Other priorities include securing international cooperation  for observation, monitoring and investigative research on global  environmental conservation and strengthening effective ties  among the central and local governments, enterprises and  nongovernmental organizations, it said.    The ``Agenda 21'' included suggestions on how each country  should prepare an action plan to implement the measures. The  Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations agreed at the 1992  Munich Summit and the Tokyo Summit meeting last July to draw up  and publish their respective action plans by the year-end.    The government hopes to hear opinions on the draft from the  public and issue a final report by that deadline after  adjustments, the Foreign Ministry said.</p>

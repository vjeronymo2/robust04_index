			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T unveils video/PC system AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph yesterday unveiled a new, inexpensive desktop business video system which allows two personal computer operators to see each other on their computer screens while simultaneously talking and manipulating data. The product is not the first of its kind, but AT&amp;T's marketing muscle could help this multi-media technology become much more widely accepted as a business tool. AT&amp;T yesterday committed its business video products to be based on globally accepted standards for calls over digital phone lines, allowing its products to work with others equipped with the same standards. The company also said the product was one of the first large fruits of collaboration between AT&amp;T's business communications unit, its micro-electronics operation and NCR, the computer company acquired by AT&amp;T in a hostile and controversial 1991 takeover. The system, the first to employ AT&amp;T Microelectronics' AVP 4000 chipset for compressing video images, produces slow motion pictures of about 10 frames per second and operates through special AT&amp;T business switches or a digital telephone line. The cost of a unit starts at Dollars 6,995. Delivery will begin in the US in the autumn and international marketing may follow next year.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER STATE LOTTERY'S NEW GAME TO INCREASE JACKPOTS  </P> <P> Jack M. Tuell's column (commentary, May 19) points out convincingly the damage  being perpetrated upon California's citizenry by the state lottery. We need to  be reminded again that:  </P> <P> * The lottery is a regressive tax on the poor, often robbing families of the  necessities of life.  </P> <P> * Schools obtain only a minuscule percentage of their budgets from lottery  support.  </P> <P> * Promotional publicity for the lottery is misleading since it emphasizes the  drama of winning, playing down the overwhelming odds against any windfall.  </P> <P> * Gambling itself embodies the principle of getting something for nothing --  not a very commendable lesson for our youth.  </P> <P> The manner in which TV, radio and the press glamorize and promote the lottery  is to be soundly condemned. True, a majority voted for it, mesmerized by a  deceptive campaign financed by a lottery-equipment manufacturer, but it must be  remembered that more than 40% of the electorate opposed it.  </P> <P> Tuell's revelations should awaken Californians to the threat of the lottery to  the moral foundations of their common life.  </P> <P> G. MERRILL LENOX, Claremont  </P></p>

			<p>SUMMARY                              Russian President Boris Yeltsin and government officials hailed  the 12-15 January visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton as  demonstrating that U.S.-Russian partnership had reached a new,  more mature phase where everyday, businesslike dealings, rather  than sensational achievements, were to be expected.  Politicians  outside the Russian Government generally had less upbeat  assessments ranging from lukewarm to hostile.  Reaction from the  press ranged predictably across the spectrum, with progovernment  newspapers emphasizing the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement on  nuclear weapons and the Partnership for Peace initiative as  positive achievements and the nationalistic and procommunist  press criticizing U.S. support for Yeltsin and his reform  policies.                          END SUMMARY     Summing up President Bill Clinton's visit as reflecting  "equality, mutual benefit, and accounting for each other's  interests," Russian President Boris Yeltsin hailed the summit as  a new stage in U.S.-Russian partnership (Russian TV, 14 January).  Although Yeltsin cautioned that a "too upbeat" assessment did not  reflect the "nature of the frank and businesslike discussions"  and said that there "were and will be disagreements," he stressed  that the visit had been "very fruitful" and that "most  importantly" there was "goodwill" and "common decisions defined  by partnership."  Listing some of the results of the summit,  Yeltsin echoed the words of the Moscow Declaration signed at the  summit on 14 January in stressing that U.S.-Russian relations  have "finally moved into the phase of mature, strategic, global  partnership in all spheres during these talks."     Russian Government     Other government officials, also highlighting the theme of  partnership, gave similarly high marks to the summit:     -- After the first round of talks, Presidential press spokesman  Vyacheslav Kostikov told journalists that the talks had taken  place "in an atmosphere of genuine partnership" with each side  acting "on the premise that peace and stability in Europe and  worldwide is impossible without Russia and the United States"  (Interfax, ITAR-TASS, 13 January).     -- Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that the "main sensation  of the summit is the absence of a sensation," stressing that the  "we are proceeding to institutional and systematic partnership."  Kozyrev, who singled out the agreement signed on 14 January for  the sale of enriched uranium as a notable result, also stressed  that the summit achieved an economic partnership, stating that  this did not mean "short term credit" or "humanitarian aid" but  "negotiations with a long term perspective and realization that  Russia is a great economic power" (Interfax, 15 January).     -- Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov called the talks "the  most substantive, businesslike, and concrete" of all the summits  he had attended.  He also stressed economic partnership, noting  that President Clinton had put forth a package of "specific  measures" that could help Russia "gain a greater foothold in  world markets" and ease Russia's economic relations with former  Soviet republics (ITAR-TASS, 14 January).     Other Politicians' Assessments     In contrast to the government officials, leaders of several  parties represented in the new Duma gave the summit assessments  ranging from lukewarm to hostile:     -- Speaking before the summit, reformist opposition leader  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy said the meeting would be simply a "pleasant  exchange of opinions" (Interfax, 11 January).  Apparently  disagreeing with Yavlinskiy, from whose electoral bloc he was  elected to the Duma, Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, formerly head of the  Supreme Soviet's international affairs committee, said the visit  was "evidence of U.S. respect for our great country."  He also  expressed hope the president would take advantage of the visit to  "familiarize himself even more deeply with [Russia's] problems"  (ITAR-TASS, 13 January).     -- Centrist Democratic Party leader Nikolay Travkin told Interfax  that he expected little from the summit, saying that the best  thing Washington could do for Russia would be to recognize it as  "an equal partner," and adding that "we do not need any  tips."(Interfax, 11 January).     -- In contrast, Russian Communist Party (CPRF) leader Gennadiy  Zyuganov called the visit "uniquely important and timely as our  political situation has changed" and it is "necessary [for  President Clinton] to get acquainted with it" (ITAR-TASS, 13  January).     -- Reflecting possible pique that he was not invited to meet with  President Clinton, ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy both before and during the  summit described the visit as "useless," "unnecessary," and  "pointless."  He said that the visit discredited the U.S.  President since "Russians are going to see he has come to support  a team of bankers---the Gaydar government."  Zhirinovskiy called  the president's failure to meet him "a mistake."  At the same  time, he contended that, since Russians know that "all this  disarray [in Russia] was organized by the West," he would gain  votes by the snub, adding that it indicates that "I am the only  honest and clean politician" because the leader of the country  "mainly responsible" for helping the democrats "undermine" Russia  "does not want to meet me"(Interfax, 11, 13 January).     Partnership for Peace     Despite their upbeat assessment of the summit as a whole, Yeltsin  and other government officials gave a more nuanced reaction to  the results of the NATO summit and the Partnership for Peace  proposal:     -- Yeltsin told the 14 January press conference that he "actively  supported" the Partnership for Peace initiative as a "good  formula" that ruled out a "country by country" expansion of NATO,  claiming that it contained "a primordial element of Russia-U.S.  joint creative work."  However, Yeltsin appeared to place  conditions on any NATO expansion, saying that if Russia or other  countries at some point joined NATO they should do it all at  once--" precisely together in one package"--to create "security  for everyone."  Yeltsin also stressed his view that the  Partnership for Peace was only one step--although an "important"  one--in "creating a security system from Vancouver to  Vladivostok," noting that Russia would not "forget" the other  collective security systems in Europe, above all "the well-tried  institutions of the UN and CSCE" (Russian TV, 14 January).     -- Kozyrev characterized the Partnership for Peace as an  "important step forward and a serious test of the partnership  between Russia, the United States, and other NATO states."  Emphasizing the "new quality of partnership and not new  membership in NATO," Kozyrev said everyone should "concentrate on  partnership," "fill it with specific content," because now "it is  too early to say how the period of partnership will end."  Kozyrev admitted that one option was to expand NATO, adding that  Moscow "did not rule this out."  However, returning to statements  he has made in the past, he said that other possible options  include creating broader security systems and the consolidation  of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, and he called for  "parallel" efforts to be taken in "all of those directions"  (Interfax, 13 January; ITAR-TASS, 15 January).     -- Kostikov called the Partnership for Peace a "politically  attractive declaration," but said it "needed more substance"  (Interfax, 13 January).     -- Defense Minister Pavel Grachev continued to claim that he did  not "understand" the "aspirations of [Central and East European  states] to defend themselves from Russia by membership in NATO,"  saying that Russia supports a "genuine, all-European system of  security" that would be defined by "collective actions" rather  than by "belonging to blocs."  He stressed, however, that  Russia's relations with NATO should be "richer" and develop  across a "broad range of interaction," adding that in January  Russian defense specialists expect to study a plan for  cooperation with NATO (Radio Rossii, 16 January).     Media Reaction     Press commentary on the summit devoted much attention to the  tripartite agreement on nuclear weapons as well as the  Partnership for Peace initiative.  The progovernment press  generally stressed the maturing of the U.S.-Russian partnership  while the nationalist and communist opposition papers predictably  criticized U.S. support for Yeltsin and reform.  The proreform,  independent Nezavisimaya Gazeta, whose chief editor has often  severely criticized Yeltsin personally, carried favorable  commentary on the summit.     Progovernment Press.  Commentary in the pro-Yeltsin Izvestiya and  the government newspapers Rossiyskiye Vesti and Rossiyskaya  Gazeta focused on the achievements in the nuclear and security  areas.  The Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda was  particularly upbeat in its assessment of these issues:     -- A 15 January report in Rossiyskiye Vesti hailed the advent of  a "phase of mature strategic global partnership in all spheres"  that Moscow and Washington have "now indeed entered."  The  article went on to praise the trilateral accord on Ukrainian  nuclear weapons for imparting "new substance" to U.S.-Russian  cooperation toward "strengthening strategic stability and  security" and lauded the Partnership for Peace initiative as  evidence of "harmony between Russia and the United States," as  refuting "the argument of unequal security," and precluding the  "possibility of new demarcation lines" dividing Europe.     -- Commentary in Izvestiya generally played up the nuclear  agreement and the Partnership for Peace and gave less attention  to bilateral economic issues, although a 15 January article  concluded by saying that the "main attention" of the talks had  been devoted to the "reform program."  In a discordant note,  however, the 12 January Izvestiya carried a report by Melor  Sturua contending that the Partnership for Peace proposal  "essentially," though not by design, is "placating Zhirinovskiy"  and arguing that postponing the admission to NATO of East  European countries "both objectively and subjectively"  strengthens "not the Russian president but his neofascist  opponent" by in effect making a concession out of fear of an  extremist backlash.     -- Although a 12 January Krasnaya Zvezda article did broach the  concern that NATO membership might become an "instrument of  blackmail," noting that there was the temptation to use the power  of "big brother"--a role it said that NATO plays--to attempt to  "pressure" the Russian leadership, in general the Defense  Ministry's paper assessed the summit favorably.  In a 13 January  article, prominent commentator Aleksandr Golts affirmed that the  U.S.-Russian relationship had "indeed reached" a stage of "mature  strategic partnership" where breakthroughs are unnecessary.  Claiming that the United States  and Russia had taken a  "realistic look" at each other and after "sober assessment" had  concluded that they need each other, Golts lauded the Partnership  for Peace plan for being "primarily" concerned with "Russia's  legitimate interests in the security field."     Opposition Press.  Commentary in the nationalistic and  procommunist Pravda and Sovetskaya Rossiya generally followed the  negative tone they set in their coverage of the April 1993  Vancouver summit, minimizing or criticizing the effectiveness of  U.S. aid and hinting that U.S. support for Yeltsin is part of an  anti-Russia plot:     -- An 11 January report in Pravda speculated that the U.S.  delegation's "baggage" would "once again" contain "more advice  and political declarations than specific economic programs or  more, importantly, funds to implement them."  The report  contained a litany of complaints about U.S. aid, grumbling on the  one hand about the "derisorily small" sums involved and on the  other hand that such efforts are misdirected.  The commentary  used U.S. grain sales as an example, saying that these  constituted a "fix like narcotics" that "in the opinion of many  economists" had "shattered the health of Russian agricultural  production."  This approach is similar to that adopted by the  newspaper's commentary on the April 1993 Vancouver summit when it  calculated that the U.S. aid agreed upon at the summit amounted  to only "ten dollars for each Russian."  The 11 January article  also castigated the U.S. reaction to the Russian elections,  claiming that the U.S. desire that Russia should not "put on the  brakes" but "continue the policy of reforms" struck a "discordant  note" against statements by Yeltsin and Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin that the "course and speed of reform" needed to be  "urgently" revised.  The article charged that such discrepancies  "reinforce suspicions" that the reforms are "advantageous to the  U.S. rather than to Russia."     -- A pre-summit article in Sovetskaya Rossiya, which appears  increasingly to reflect the influence of the CPRF, complained  that "it is now totally clear" that America is at best "only  prepared to make gestures involving charitable aid," noting that  "even this is limited to gestures that will yield greater  dividends on the purely propaganda level."  The article cited  U.S. support for Yeltsin prior to the September-October conflict  with the Russia legislature to claim that the U.S. administration  "unconditionally approved" Yeltsin's orders to open fire on the  legislature, hinting that the U.S. administration might have had  more than an "indirect" responsibility for the 3-4 October  government attack on the parliamentary headquarters.  A 15  January article cited statements by U.S. and East European  officials about NATO which it said "cannot fail to elicit  profound alarm."  Claiming that NATO became "totally redundant"  immediately after the elimination of the Warsaw Pact and the  "self-destruction" of the USSR and should have been disbanded  then, the article charged that the Partnership for Peace is only  the "latest phase" in Western policy of "forcing" Russia "out of  its traditional spheres of influence."  The article dismissed the  Moscow summit as mainly an exercise in "diplomatic protocol."     Independent Press.  The reformist newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta,  despite its chief editor's usual antipathy to Yeltsin, gave good  marks to the summit.  Other independent newspapers pointed out  the summit's lack of impact on domestic economic uncertainty, but  some balanced this against the achievements of strategic  cooperation:     -- A 15 January Nezavisimaya Gazeta article said nothing "new" in  U.S.-Russian relations was demonstrated at the summit but  explained this by claiming that bilateral relations are "as good  as they can possibly be."  The article nevertheless went on to  elaborate on the economic results of the summit, saying that the  most outstanding achievement might be the lifting of most of the  "discriminatory economic restrictions" on Russian goods entering  the U.S. market.  The article commended Yeltsin for stressing  that Russia needed collaboration with the West not "humanitarian  aid," and said that by renouncing help from others Russia is  putting itself in "the same rank as developed countries."  Even  chief editor Vitaliy Tretyakov, often a harsh critic of Yeltsin,  claimed that the visit demonstrated that "now matter how"  Russia's role "in the world might be assesses," the summit was  "still a visit by the head of one superpower to the capital of  another superpower" and thus demonstrated "mutual respect,  recognition, and mutual acceptance of . . . parity."     -- A 12 January article in the independent Segodnya similarly  claimed that although U.S. officials "have presumably understood"  that they are "incapable of influencing" the Russian domestic  situation, they "continue to support Yeltsin" in the interest of  "global security."  Although the article noted that the  "strategic partnership" is "far from ideal," it nevertheless  claimed that the "level of confidence" between the U.S. and  Russian leadership "has no precedent."

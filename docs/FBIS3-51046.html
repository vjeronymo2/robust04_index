			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiz Orlando Carneiro; from the "Diplomatic </F> Report" column]    [Text] Brazilian-Argentine relations were affected last  week by Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's remarks  criticizing the quality of Brazilian export products. The  Brazilian Foreign Ministry considered that, taking into account  the political pressure he is enduring, the Argentine minister's  remarks were intended for "domestic consumption." Thus, in  order not to make things worse, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry  chose to only summon the Argentine ambassador in Brasilia to  verbally convey its displeasure to him.    For his part, Brazilian Ambassador to Argentina Marcos  Azambuja contacted the acting economy and foreign ministers in  Buenos Aires (Cavallo and Di Tella were on leave) and  diplomatically lodged with them his protest over Cavallo's  comments.    According to the data supplied by Varig [Rio Grande do Sul  Airline] available at Itamaraty, Argentina is today the leading  foreign market for this airline. From January to December 1993  Varig took 527,000 passengers to and from Argentina. Varig also  carried 11,000 metric tons of cargo during the same period.    These figures are showing why Argentine businessmen, who are  concerned about the Brazilian trade "drive," are now exerting so  much pressure on Cavallo. In 1993 (up until October), Brazilian  exports to Argentina totaled nearly $3 billion. Brazilian  imports from Argentina have, however, markedly increased as  well. By October Brazilian imports from Argentina totaled $2  billion, compared to only $1.3 billion imported during the same  period in 1992.    This is why it has been difficult for Brazilian Government  officials to understand Cavallo, whose reaction has been  described by some diplomats as being overblown.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: KKR offer displays its passion for complexity - The Borden bid has left observers scratching their heads on who stands to gain For connoisseurs of 1980s financial engineering, Monday's Dollars 2bn bid by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for Borden, the US food group, brings a nostalgic tear to the eye. It evokes the high-water mark of 1980s deal-making - KKR's Dollars 26bn purchase of RJR Nabisco, the large food and tobacco group. Five years on, KKR - still the most formidable of the Wall Street buy-out firms - proposes to pay for Borden not with ready money, but with RJR shares. It is a reminder of KKR's passion for complexity. In a deal described by one Wall Street analyst - not without admiration - as 'pure smoke and mirrors', observers are left scratching their heads on who stands to gain. KKR evidently thinks it does. But what about Borden's shareholders, or RJR's? For the average Borden shareholder, KKR's Dollars 14.25 a share offer is nothing to shout about. A year ago the stock stood at more than Dollars 19; two years ago it was double that. And Dollars 2bn is a pitiful price for a leading US food company with sales of Dollars 5.5bn. Campbell Soup, a decently profitable food company which until recently had sales smaller than Borden's, has a market value of about Dollars 10bn. However, no one is betting on a better offer coming along. Borden is in a mess. Its sales have dropped every year in the past five. In the past two years, it has incurred large losses, mostly because of costly restructuring plans which the company admits have proved ineffectual. A year ago it halved its dividend, then halved it again. In spite of sharp cuts in capital spending and inventories, cash flow has continued to dwindle. Until KKR came along, Borden seemed to be heading for the rocks. The mistakes which brought the company to this situation are sadly familiar. In the second half of the 1980s, Borden embarked on an ambitious and badly-managed series of acquisitions. As a result, it neglected its basic business. For example, Borden has been in the dairy business for 140 years, and is America's biggest dairy company. Last year its dairy division lost about Dollars 35m on turnover of about Dollars 1.5bn. The obvious question is what the financial jugglers of KKR can do to set this right. There are some simple answers. If the dairy business, for example, cannot be sold, KKR can afford to close it down, whereas Borden could not. A large part of Borden has nothing to do with food. It is the world's biggest maker of wallpaper and owns Crown in the UK. The non-food businesses made Dollars 172m of operating profit on sales of Dollars 1.8bn last year, while food made only Dollars 23m on sales of Dollars 3.7bn. Since those businesses generate high levels of cash, Borden could ill afford to sell them. But KKR has deeper pockets, and could doubtless make a profit on disposals. The rest of KKR's calculations are murkier. KKR is apparently paying Dollars 2bn for the whole of Borden, payment being in the form of about half KKR's remaining stake in RJR shares. But as soon as the deal is complete, RJR has undertaken to buy 20 per cent of Borden from KKR, at a cost of Dollars 500m  -again, payment being in RJR shares. KKR's net payment for control of Borden is therefore Dollars 1.5bn. More fundamentally, KKR is in effect liquidating half its remaining equity stake in RJR - which has proved a rather dubious investment - so that it can back another horse in the form of Borden. In the process, analysts reckon, it may crystallise a useful tax loss. More important, RJR as a recovery story may be played out. Its food profits have risen sharply in the past three years, and may not have much further to go. Tobacco, meanwhile, is under fire from US legislators and litigants as never before. Borden, by contrast, is a pure recovery play. If things came right, the results could be spectacular. Meanwhile, what about RJR's shareholders? KKR, it must be recalled, does not technically control RJR: its equity holding is only 35 per cent, and is due to fall to half that. But the suspicion must be that KKR calls the shots. It is slightly worrying that the deal envisages the sale of assets by Borden to RJR. Even at the outset, RJR shareholders suffer dilution through the issue of Dollars 500m of new RJR stock to buy 20 per cent of Borden, and RJR has the option to buy a further 10 per cent. On the other hand, there is plainly some scope for putting bits of the two companies together. For example, Borden owns the second biggest snack food business in the US. Like the dairy business, it loses money. But this is a business RJR understands. It owns Planters peanuts, and its Nabisco subsidiary is America's biggest biscuit maker, with the distribution muscle to go with it. In the end, one simple consideration may outweigh all that. KKR has owned and controlled RJR for five years. It knows and understands the business like no one else. For outside shareholders, this raises one simple question. If KKR wants out, why would anyone else want to stay behind?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "African News" program] </F>   [Text] The authorities in Zimbabwe have revealed that the  first white-owned farm seized under controversial legislation to  resettle landless black farmers has instead been leased to a  government minister. Officials said the 3,000-hectare farm was  intended for more than 30 landless peasant families. Instead,  the five-year lease was granted to the former Agriculture  Minister Witness Mangwende who is now the education minister.  The white dominated Commercial Farmers Union has criticized the  allocation of a farm to a minister, saying it is an abuse of the  land reform program. The Agriculture Ministry has defended the  deal, saying it was covered by the Tenant Resettlement Scheme  for the rental of commercial property.</p>

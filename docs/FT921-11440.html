			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Italy increases central bank's independence ITALY'S politicians yesterday approved a long-awaited law granting much greater independence to the central bank regarding monetary policy. The move has been accompanied by the first serious reorganisation of the Treasury since 1889. Together, the two steps form part of an attempt to improve management of economic and monetary policy and bring Italy closer into line with European Community commitments on economic and monetary union. The most obvious symbol of the changes involves the divorce of the Bank of Italy and the Treasury in the setting of the discount rate. The rate was previously determined by the Treasury, but only on the recommendation of the central bank, which retained a powerful voice in interest rate policy. The bank will now be free to set the rate independently. To reinforce its own economics team, the Treasury has appointed five new directors-generals (equivalent to permanent secretaries in the UK civil service) including two outsiders, among them Mr Francesco Giavazzi, a prominent economist from Milan's Bocconi university, who will head a new macroeconomic research department. Mr Mario Draghi, the highly respected ex-IMF official brought into the Treasury as director-general last year, is being promoted, but he will retain his existing title. A 10-man council of permanent advisers to further reinforce the Treasury is also expected to be set up. The developments mark an important attempt to get to grips with Italy's long-standing structural economic problems, notably the massive government budget deficit. However, with a welter of new spending bills up for approval before the dissolution of parliament (expected next week), Italy's politicians have yet to show they have the determination to face the unpalatable choices that curbing the deficit will require. Nor has the government fully completed the divorce of the Treasury and the Bank of Italy. That still needs a law to limit the government's right to run a massive overdraft with the central bank. Mr Guido Carli, treasury minister, has announced plans to bring in legislation to close the account. However, it seems unlikely the step will be taken before parliament is dissolved.</p>

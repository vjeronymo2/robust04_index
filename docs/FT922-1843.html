			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: KIO says it intends to remain in Spain THE Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) has told the Spanish government that it has no plans to withdraw its large industrial investment from the country in spite of the costs of rebuilding Kuwait after the Gulf war and the resignation this month of its long-time partner in Spain, Mr Javier de la Rosa. KIO's new management offered the reassurances to Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, in Madrid on Wednesday. Valuations of KIO's assets in Spain vary between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 7bn, but it is easily the country's biggest private investor, with 25,000 employees. The government has been worried by reports that KIO was considering withdrawing. In particular, the KIO's chemicals group, Ercros, is the mainstay of the domestic chemicals and fertiliser industry and has suffered severe losses in spite of heavy injections of government funds into its fertiliser operations. Ercros lost nearly Pta16bn (Dollars 161.9m) last year, while Grupo Torras, the main KIO holding company, saw profits fall 25 per cent to Pta3bn, according to company filings. It was being suggested in Madrid before the Wednesday meeting that the government planned to insist that KIO reduce the debt - believed to total up to Dollars 1.2bn - of its businesses, or at least provide new funds to stabilise some of the companies. Reports that KIO planned to inject a further Dollars 1bn into its operations in Spain could not be confirmed. Mr de la Rosa, who acted as KIO's point man in Spain for nearly 10 years and created the Torras group largely on his own, resigned as vice-president of Grupo Torras to pursue his own business interests. KIO is currently seeking an investment bank to monitor its investments in Spain, but is also likely to post a Kuwaiti official to Spain for the first time since it began investing here in 1984.</p>

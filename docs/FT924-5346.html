			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Taxing the Monarchy: Confusion reigns over status of royal assets THE MOST complex area for negotiation between palace authorities and the Inland Revenue will be over what the Queen owns as a private person and what she owns as sovereign and head of state, Richard Evans writes. Any properties or assets owned personally could be subject either to capital gains tax when sold or to inheritance tax on death. Some assets - like the royal yacht Britannia - are owned and paid for by the government, others are owned by the sovereign and must be passed on by law to her heirs. Nearly all the official royal residences are owned by the sovereign and are passed on to successors. It is assumed that these assets cannot be subject to inheritance taxes. Two residences, Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk, are owned personally by the sovereign and could technically be sold. They were among the many complications at the time of the abdication of Edward VIII and had to be purchased by his successor, George VI. The assumption is that special arrangements will be made to ensure that they would pass to her heirs rather than be subject to inheritance tax. Virtually all of the Queen's extensive art collection has been amassed over many generations and from gifts. It technically belongs to her, but according to Buckingham Palace 'it is not regarded as being disposable'. The same is true of the crown jewels. A small number of pictures and pieces of jewellery have been purchased privately by the Queen and these are likely to be included in her personal estate and be subject to taxes.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Greyhound's buses near end of the road Like chewing gum, jeans and Coca-Cola, Greyhound Lines is an American icon. For decades its silver and blue buses have criss-crossed the vast open spaces of the US, linking small towns with the big cities and providing an evocative backdrop to scenes of meeting and parting in countless Hollywood movies. The buses, however, may not be around much longer. Greyhound is on its knees: on Wednesday a group of disgruntled creditors filed a petition in a Dallas court seeking to force the loss-battered company into bankruptcy. In one sense Greyhound's troubles are a bit of a puzzle. As the only nationwide provider of long-distance bus services in the US, it enjoys an enviable niche. It serves more than 2,600 destinations with a fleet of 1,987 vehicles, and collected Dollars 666m (Pounds 406m) in revenues last year. But Greyhound has been struggling for years. Even bankruptcy would be nothing new to the company; it only emerged from its last reorganisation in October 1991 after spending a year protected from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. Born in rural Minnesota 80 years ago, Greyhound had its heyday in the 1940s and 1950s, when it accounted for nearly half the journeys made between US cities. But like bus operators all over the developed world, it began to suffer a decline in patronage as levels of car ownership rose. Cheap petrol, making car journeys an economical alternative to bus travel, exacerbated its difficulties. But its problems multiplied in 1978 when the US deregulated its airline industry, introducing an era of fare wars between rival airlines on domestic routes and putting air travel within the means of the less well-off. Under pressure from airline competition, annual passenger mileage slumped from more than 10bn in 1981 to 6bn in 1986. Drivers took a 25 per cent pay cut to help get fares down and keep Greyhound going. But the parent company, since renamed Greyhound Dial, saw no future in the bus business and sold it off to a buy-out team in 1987 for Dollars 350m. The new management turned Greyhound Lines inside out, stripping away layers of management, slashing fares, launching aggressive marketing campaigns and investing heavily in the refurbishment of run-down city centre bus stations. The changes began to pay off, bringing traffic back to 7.5bn passenger miles in 1989. But under continuing pressure to cut costs, the management fell into a wage dispute with its drivers. The dispute was to turn into one of the bitterest and most violent strikes in US labour history. Although Greyhound kept going, using replacement drivers, many of its buses were shot at. This proved unpopular with passengers, and the resulting decline in traffic took Greyhound into bankruptcy in June 1990. The Greyhound that emerged from Chapter 11 protection in October the following year was leaner and fitter. It even made small profits in 1992 and the first half of 1993. But a fresh bout of fare-cutting by airlines and the disastrous introduction of a computer reservation system that did not work sent Greyhound tumbling into losses again. Three months ago Greyhound announced plans for a transformation that would end its traditional role as a nationwide long-distance bus operator and turn it into a regional operator of inter-city services on a small number of busy routes in the south, north-east and the industrial mid-west. But the plan has come too late. The company has run out of cash, and some of its creditors, angered by the terms of a proposed restructuring, are seeking to put it into bankruptcy again rather than swallow what they see as a raw deal. Would Greyhound be missed? Arguably not. Greyhound has always been best loved by those who do not have to use it: its inner city bus stations are reputed to be among the most dangerous places on earth, the buses themselves make few concessions to comfort, and it is a condition of carriage that you have to endure the life story of the person sitting next to you. Even so, if it goes, many will feel a piece of America will go with it.</p>

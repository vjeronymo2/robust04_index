			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Milan Kucan, president of the </F> Republic of Slovenia, by Vlado Zagorac; date and place not  given: "I Will Come To Improve the Political Atmosphere"]    [Text] Milan Kucan, president of the Republic of Slovenia,  should visit Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on Tuesday [7  June]. This will be an unofficial meeting of the two heads of  state, like the one held in Brdo near Kranj in October 1992,  when Mr. Kucan and Mr. Tudjman agreed that it would be useful to  meet at least once a year. Instead of that, it came to a break  which has lasted for almost 20 months now, and during which a  series of unsolved questions between the two states has appeared.    We asked President Kucan to give an interview for VECERNJI  LIST immediately before his visit to Croatia. We asked him to  refer primarily to the relations between Slovenia and Croatia,  but also to other important issues.    [Zagorac] Can you tell us something about the relations  between Slovenia and Croatia during the period in which you have  not met with President Tudjman?    [Kucan] We should in any case go back into the history of  our relations in order to see that they can be divided into two  parts. Our cooperation was excellent during the period when both  Slovenia and Croatia fought for their independence. Although we  knew that the situation in Croatia was more difficult, and that  that fact might affect the materialization of Slovene ambitions,  we still required that the Croatian right of self-determination  be implemented in the same way as ours. Since independence was  achieved, our cooperation has deteriorated, but I do not think  that there is a plausible reason for it. It is true that the  conditions in Croatia are different from those in Slovenia, but  this does not justify the present situation. I think that  Slovenia has much understanding for special problems Croatia  has, but this understanding has its limits, too, simply because  the burden of unsolved problems has become heavier than the  understanding for the more difficult conditions in which Croatia  lives.    There was a period of time during which there had been no  political dialogue whatsoever between Slovenia and Croatia;  relations were then resumed only on the level of governments and  ministries. In other words, there has been no cooperation on  the level of presidents for a long time, so that I think that  the understanding of problems and the interest to solve them has  been considerably reduced. What is even more important is that  the mutual confidence which is necessary if we want to solve  problems has significantly fallen, too. I support the political  dialogue and I think that it is not only good, but also  necessary to talk; the attitudes, interests, and arguments of  the other side have to be known in order to be able to search  for solutions. If there is no dialogue, only short-term  solutions, or no solutions at all, can be expected.    [Zagorac] Relations between states are usually defined as  being on a high, low, or medium level. Where would you put the  Slovene-Croatian relations on that scale?    [Kucan] It cannot be claimed that they are on a high level.  They are far below the level which is necessary in order to  solve the existing problems on the onehand , and our vital  interests on the other hand. I have noticed the lack of  political will; there have been numerous opportunities which  allowed us to start solving our problems, but they have simply  not been taken. Chances have often been missed because of  egoistic political interests of both states and because of the  ambition to solve all problems at once. It is in my opinion,  however, impossible to solve all problems at once because they  are too complicated and too sensitive. Since this approach has  not borne fruit, I think that we should now decide to solve  problems gradually. Priority has to be given to those problems  which have to be solved in order to normalize life along the  Croatian-Slovene border, and economic life in general. The  Slovene Government has proposed such an approach, and I hope  that we could reach a solution more easily in this way.    [Zagorac] Is Slovenia ready to make special efforts for the  improvement of the present situation?    [Kucan] I would like to repeat that the present situation is  contradictory to the vital interests of both states, so that it  is only logical that it must be changed, and it can be changed  only if both sides are ready to change it. This means that  alternatives to old solutions and attitudes have to be found,  without giving up each state's own principles, though. A way  for the materialization of interests of both sides has to be  found in order to enhance the mutual respect which is necessary  in the search for a solution. I think that comments on internal  circumstances in other states only harm the positive atmosphere.  The assessment was made, for example, that Slovenia belongs to  those countries between the Baltic and the Black Sea in which  communists are returning to power, and which are characterized  by rifts between coalitions. As far as I am concerned, I think  that this is a Slovene matter. I think that Slovenia does not  assess the situation in other states and that it does not  interfere with internal political matters of other states. It  leaves it to the citizens of those states to realize whether  their regime is democratic or not.    I think that I can generalize and say that there is an  unhealthy competition between Croatia and Slovenia, as it can be  seen between the former Eastern European states, for example,  since they are trying to confirm their European affiliation by  exaggerating their own and diminishing the achievements of the  others in the field of transformation, which is certainly a  demanding and a long-lasting process. Expressions such as,  "compared with others, we have the advantage...," or "we have  achieved much more than others," can often be heard. To whom do  they want to prove this? The international community knows very  well what they have achieved. They cannot prove such a thing to  their neighbors because this only causes suspicion and  misunderstanding. In other words, this is only used for  political conflicts in domestic politics.    If I look at Slovene-Croatian relations in the light of  what I said before, I still think -- although I have just made a  very pessimistic statement -- that the circle of our bilateral  relations has not been closed yet. It must only be established  whether there is political will and readiness in both states to  solve problems in the atmosphere of mutual understanding.  Mutual respect has to be encouraged, and the starting point of  the search for solutions has to be the assumption that the  interests of both states have the same value.    [Zagorac] Can it be expected, and is it realistic to expect  international help in the sense of an arbitration or similar in  solving problems between Croatia and Slovenia? When I say this,  I primarily have the problem with the border in the Bay of Piran  in mind.    [Kucan] The international community has certain institutions  of "preventive diplomacy," which should enable peaceful  solutions to conflicts when it is impossible to achieve a  solution through bilateral cooperation. These instruments are  even being enlarged now. If we fail to reach an agreement about  the border in the Bay of Piran, there is the possibility of  international arbitration. I think, however, that this would  harm the prestige of both Slovenia and Croatia, because it would  mean we cannot find a criterion or a combination of criteria for  the definition of a state border and solve the problem  ourselves. International institutions can apply the same  criteria as we, they do not have any additional.    [Zagorac] Have Croatia and Slovenia reached the point at  which such help is necessary?    [Kucan] The question is whether our two states have  exhausted all possibilities which could enable us to solve the  problems ourselves. If there are no further possibilities, it  could be considered to cede the responsibility to an  international institution. The same is true of arbitration.    [Zagorac] Does this mean that we still have not tried  everything?    [Kucan] I think so. That is why we have problems. The old  attitudes have simply not changed. If no solution can be found  with these attitudes, it is obvious that other approaches have  to be looked for.    There is the tendency to simplify this complex issue and  reduce it to single problems such as the border crossings at  Raskrizje, Sveta Gera, or the Bay of Piran, but these are not  real problems and difficulties. Furthermore, if emotions are  added to the whole thing, the picture can easily become blurred.  The biggest problem is that the economic relations between  Slovenia and Croatia have been deteriorating for a long time  already. Economists usually claim that cooperation is made  impossible by politicians.    This means that we are in fact confronted with two sorts of  problems, the border issue and economy. It is bad that border  issues have not been solved yet. This harms the sovereignty of  both countries, since this is a condition for a legitimate  status in international associations. But as long as there is  no solution, the best thing would be to accept the situation as  it is and look for new solution in the meantime. It is bad to  try to change the present situation by imposing things on the  other side. This creates suspicion and diminishes the  possibility to reach a long-term solution. If one of the  international criteria for border determination is applied, it  should be possible to draw the border at those places where it  is controversial from the point of view of any side.    [Zagorac] What in your opinion are the elements of force  applied by either side with the aim to change the present  situation?    [Kucan] It is certain that felling of trees in the area of  Sneznik is a one-sided measure, since the property of citizens  of the other state is made use of. Take, for example, the  construction of the border crossing facility in Secovlje by the  Croatian side. It is being built on ground which can be assumed  to belong to Slovenia. These things cannot contribute to a  better understanding. In my opinion, these are some of the  unnecessary one-sided measures; the present situation should  remain unchanged until final solutions are found. If no  solution can be found to a problem, it is better to apply  alternatives as temporary solutions. Could not Plovanija, for  example, be used as the alternative border crossing for  Secovlje, and is it not possible that the Bay of Piran is under  Slovene supervision as it has been by now? I would like to  repeat that these could be temporary solutions until final  solutions are found.    If there is not this minimum of will, people have the  feeling  that there is no readiness to solve problems, or that both sides  are incapable of finding a solution. Life is already requiring  certain regulations, and the unsolved border, economic, estate,  and other issues inevitably affect the intensity of economic  relations. This is what I have in mind when I say that  politicians disturb the cooperation of economists. If there is  no good will, if there is no agreement on a free trade zone, or  on investments, if there is no anti double tax treaty, in short,  if there is no basic legal infrastructure for the regulation of  economic relations, people will look for illegal possibilities.  This affects the economic power of both Slovenia and Croatia.  This also affects their integration into Europe.    [Zagorac] There are countries in the world in which  economists are quicker than politicians, but this seems to be  impossible here; our economists are waiting for politicians to  prepare the situation for their activities.    [Kucan] Yes, they are, but I still think that economic  relations have not been completely frozen yet. This is good.    [Zagorac] This is true, but their scope and value have been  considerably decreasing.    [Kucan] There are well-founded grounds for this situation,  but politics cannot be the excuse for everything.    [Zagorac] What is the position you would like Slovenia to  achieve in the international community? After the idea about a  confederation between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina had been  confirmed, it was heard that Slovenia might join that  association. Are these expectations realistic?    [Kucan] I would like to stress that Slovenia already has its  recognizable position in international life, which it would  still like to improve, though. It is a member of the Council of  Europe, it has signed the agreement on cooperation within the  Partnership for Peace, it has signed the agreement on  cooperation with the European Union, and it has started  negotiating on its associate membership in the EU. I hope that  the EU Commission will formally approve of these negotiations in  the meeting of the EU ministers in June. Slovenia has been  invited to join the Treaty on Stability, it is a UN member, and  a member of international financial institutions. It lives a  normal international life. As a young state it has difficulties  with the confirmation of its rating in international life.  Since it is aware of the fact that it cannot live alone, and  does not want to live alone, it is therefore trying to make  contacts with the world, but by trying to establish  international contacts it is confronted with the danger of  losing its still not very recognizable identity. I would say  that the most important Slovene task is to make sure that its  identity does not get lost in the search for economic,  political, defense, and other connections with the world.    Regarding Yugoslavia and, I would say, "exotic" thinking of  certain poor, superficial, and ignorant "experts" on the  political situation in the Balkans and on the history of the  Slovene, the Croatian, and other peoples in the former  Yugoslavia, on the reasons for its collapse, and on the founded  wish of Slovenia and Croatia for independence and their  improvised ideas about the creation of a third Yugoslavia -- I  can say that this is not a realistic project for Slovenia.    As far as the confederation between Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina is concerned, this is probably a realistic  interest of these states, but Slovenia does not have any formal  relation to that confederation, and it does not want to have  one. Slovenia's interest is to cooperate with all European  states, including the European southeast, the Balkans, and,  naturally, all the states which arose or will arise from the  former Yugoslavia. When everything normalizes, the quality of  the cooperation will be significantly different from the one we  had when we lived in one state. These relations will be neither  better nor worse than they were as long as we lived together.  They will be determined by interests.    [Zagorac] There are opinions in Europe that Slovenia could  join Europe more easily in association with some other countries.    [Kucan] This is how those people think who do not want to  face complicated problems and who want to make things easy for  themselves. The case of Yugoslavia proved, however, that this  makes things more difficult. Every country is a separate  matter. We were in "one package" with Croatia when this was  necessary, we even insisted on it, but we are two separate  states now. If we regulate our bilateral relations, we shall  both be able to reach what we want more easily, and that is  Europe, without being in "a package."    [Zagorac] There were opinions in European political circles  that Slovenia was lucky because it was taken as the example of a  peaceful disintegration .    [Kucan] I did not feel the benevolence of such a judgment in  my work. I do not know whether this judgment is realistic. It  is true that Slovenia supported a peaceful disintegration of  Yugoslavia. We made efforts and concrete proposals, also  together with Croatia, but they were all strictly rejected by  Belgrade and the federal leadership at that time. Our proposals  were similar to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but they  applied them in a much better way, without bothering the  international community with their disintegration.    [Zagorac] Slovenia has lately been confronted with  demonstrations and similar forms of political life outside the  parliament.    [Kucan] I think that the scandals we have been confronted  with lately are a part of the democratization process in all  countries in transition. These phenomena are more or less  normal, although they are not desirable in countries with a  parliamentary democracy. The scandals in Slovenia have had a  positive effect, too. They have contributed to the awareness of  the real value of a parliamentary democracy, of human dignity  and rights. Their most important effect is, however, that they  have made people aware of the necessity to use and respect the  instruments of the constitutional state since this is the basis  of democracy.    [Zagorac] To what extent did these events affect the  reputation of Slovenia in the world?    [Kucan] We have been much more concerned on how this might  affect our reputation in the world than the world itself. We  have our idea on how the transition process should go and know  that it is affected by such phenomena, but this is not of great  interest for other states. What is important for them is that  Slovenia makes sure that it will carry out its economic and  political reforms, that it will respect human rights and grant  rights to its minorities, that it is ready not only to  materialize its rights in the international community, but also  to take over responsibilities. These are the basic elements for  political judgments. To my knowledge they have so far been more  or less positive regarding Slovenia. There have been  suggestions to make certain improvements in Slovenia, but  generally speaking they have been positive and benevolent.    [Zagorac] During the preparations for this meeting with  President Tudjman, there arose the question in Slovenia about  different powers of the two presidents according to the  respective constitutions. There were even rumors that it would  be better to organize a meeting between Mr. Tudjman and Mr.  Drnovsek (Slovene prime minister), or between Tudjman, Valentic,  Kucan, and Drnovsek. Are these differences an impediment to  successful negotiations?    [Kucan] I think that all contacts are useful, regardless of  the fact whether they are organized between two or four people.  It is important that it comes to negotiations and that they are  continuous. It is important to bring arguments and solve  problems, because this improves the confidence in the other  partner. I do not underestimate the problem of the formal power  of the president. This is a problem. The Croatian Constitution  introduced the presidential system in contrast to the Slovene,  which is a typical parliamentarian system with clearly defined  and very restricted powers of the president, but this is no  reason why the political dialogue on that level should be given  up.    Regarding my negotiations with President Tudjman, I can say  that they can represent a serious effort for the creation of a  favorable negotiating atmosphere. In other words, we shall not  solve concrete problems, but we shall try to define them and  express our political will that they be solved. Concrete  solutions will have to be offered by our governments and other  institutions. Apart from that, bilateral relations will be only  one of the topics discussed. They can, however, best be  discussed in a broader, in the European context, for example, if  we know that Slovenia and Croatia want to join the European  Union and other political, economic, and defense associations.  With the burden of unsolved bilateral problems we shall not be  able to join European associations, though. This can best be  proven by the example of bilateral difficulties Slovenia has  with Italy. This problem could slow down the Slovenian  integration into Europe.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5> <H5>  Unpleasant and Worrying </H5>   [Zagorac] A new, very unpleasant chapter has been opened in  the relations between Slovenia and Italy.    [Kucan] This is a very unpleasant and worrying matter. Mr.  Drnovsek has recently said that our relations, including the  problems regarding the estate cases of those people who chose  one of the two citizenships, were solved by the Ossimo  Agreements. Slovenia insists that it is the legal successor to  the agreement signed between Yugoslavia and Italy. Slovenia was  recognized the status of the legal successor of Yugoslavia by  the Italian government. Whether the confidence and the  political atmosphere will improve remains to be seen. In any  case, this has to be the will of both states. I think that it  is contradictory to the logic of contemporary democratic  relations in the international community to make bilateral  matters a condition for Slovenian integration into multilateral  associations, as this is the European Union, for example.  <H5>  [Box, p 11] </H5> <H5>  Markovic and the Attack Against Slovenia </H5>   [Zagorac] Ante Markovic has appeared in Slovenian media with  the opinion that "there was an agreement between the Slovenian  leadership and Serbia about a forged attack against Slovenia."  Is this true?    [Kucan] If he had really made that statement, I am very  surprised. I cannot imagine that a man like Ante Markovic would  make statements without any arguments. It would be better for  him to think about his responsibility for the things which have  happened in Yugoslavia. As the federal prime minister he had  the possibility to contribute to the process of peaceful  disintegration of Yugoslavia at the moment when it was clear  that it was impossible to save it. It would be good to remind  him of the conversation President Tudjman and I had with him in  the Villa Weiss [in Zagreb] on 29 November 1990 about his  possible future role in the process of peaceful disintegration.  He refused such a possibility then. This is true. The Slovene  agreement with Serbia he mentioned is simply not true. I do not  know who made such an agreement. It was not me, this is certain.</p>

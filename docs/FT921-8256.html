			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Little to laugh about in UK agriculture - At last week's NFU annual meeting farmers were not in the mood for jokes THERE were few laughs at the annual general meeting of the National Farmers' Union in London last week. The 600 to 700 delegates representing the farmers of England and Wales were too preoccupied with the sorry state of their industry for there to be much humour. Indeed, in case there were any doubts about the extent of the problems, they were spelled out early on in the proceedings by Mr David Naish, the union's president. The long-term decline in farm incomes, he said, had now led to a situation where 35 people were leaving the land in Britain each day, that is 12,000 a year. This could not go on, he concluded. Nevertheless, there were lighter moments at the meeting. One came during a debate on the need for better marketing of farm produce. The NFU had, in fact, launched a new initiative entitled Food from the Countryside late last year to encourage and assist farmers who were prepared to enter into collaborative ventures (co-operative is a dirty word in farm circles these days because there have been so many business failures in the sector) to market their produce to the supermarkets. Commenting on the logo adopted for the scheme, which dominated the stage at Kensington Town Hall, where the meeting was held, one delegate thought the stylised farmyard, the cattle on the meadow and the clear blue sky, were a bit idealistic. But he was particularly concerned with the three birds flying above the farm buildings. 'They may look like crows,' he said, 'but I have to tell you they are vultures. One is called MacSharry (the European Community's agriculture commissioner), another is called Gummer (the UK agriculture minister) and the third is called Sainsbury (Britain's leading supermarket chain).' It got a raucous laugh, reflecting the love-hate relationship between farmers and both politicians and supermarkets, whose combined activities seem to shape their lives; activities over which they feel they have little or no control. But the president was not so amused. He had wisely decided not to whinge and he found the comment about vultures negative. What was needed, he said, was a fair settlement of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and a non-discriminatory reform of the EC's common agricultural policy. Once those two elements were in place, efficient British farmers would be able to hold their own against any legitimate competition and better marketing would be one of the keys to their success. What he implied was that instead of calling the supermarkets rude names, farmers would do better to find ways of sharing in their prosperity. To achieve that, it was necessary for producers to group together to provide the enormous quantities and high quality that the supermarkets demanded. Few individual farmers, whose businesses were tiny in comparison with the multiples, could hope to go it alone. Some sort of joint venture involving the supermarkets was essential. Then came the second joke. It was the one about the hen and the pig who met to discuss the joint promotion of the great British breakfast. As the talks progressed, the pig began to have doubts. It gradually became clear to him that while the hen might do well out of their partnership, his commitment would be total and final. Too often, said that speaker, the farmers' role in joint marketing initiatives was analogous with that of the pig. Furthermore, there were real fears that British food producers might be at an unfair disadvantage when it came to competing with imports. Even the prime minister, who made a surprise visit to the meeting, confessed himself unsure if the same levels of safety and standards of animal welfare that could be guaranteed for British farm production could honestly be given for food coming from abroad. The point was taken up again during a party political forum in which agriculture spokesmen for the Conservatives, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats explained their policies for farming in advance of the Election. Mr David Curry, minister of state for agriculture, accepted the proposition that the standards imposed in the UK may be higher than those in force in some other EC countries. 'However, EC legislation means that we cannot ban European food coming to Britain.' Ms Sue MacGregor, presenter of the BBC's Today radio programme, who chaired the forum as a consumer of food, was visibly shocked at the admission and the minister tried to allay her fears by saying that his ministry officials monitored quite a lot of it and that if any were found to contain chemical residues or bacteria harmful to health it would be refused entry. Ms MacGregor did not appear totally convinced. All of which seemed to add weight to the growing arguments for more British food to be home produced. At present, UK farmers supply some 70 per cent of the food that can be produced in the British climate and there is a food trade gap of about Pounds 6bn. Reducing that gap would clearly be good for the balance of payments and the supermarkets have expressed themselves keen to move further in that direction. But not all the way. Mr Tom Vyner, joint managing director of Sainsbury's, made it clear to the meeting that 'the purchase of foods from abroad is part of a competitive process. It is skilful buying that keeps down prices. . . and that plays a cardinal role in our trading policy.' On my way back to Norfolk on the train, I read in a farming magazine that one of Mr Vyner's competitors, Tesco, had already demonstrated its commitment to competitive buying by purchasing Irish and New Zealand lamb. Since the EC variable premium ended in December, British open market lambs are too dear, a spokesman is quoted as saying, 'so we have to look elsewhere'. So, after extolling the virtues of fresh English lamb for the last few years, an excellent example of marketing and adding value, Tesco has apparently abandoned the quality image in favour of selling at the lowest price. Doubtless, all the other supermarkets will be forced to follow suit or risk losing sales, and UK sheep farmers' returns will presumably once again fall into loss. It is hardly surprising, then, that some farmers are a little cynical about the current rash of official recommendations to enter into long-term arrangements with one another and the big buyers in order to improve their marketing in the face of disappearing guarantees from Brussels. They feel that the forces ranged against them are so strong and so prone to change the rules at short notice that those jokes they crack about their plight are not even meant to be funny - merely ironic.</p>

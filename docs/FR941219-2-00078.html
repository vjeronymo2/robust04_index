Special Fraud Alert: Prescription Drug Marketing Schemes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Issued August 1994)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> How Does the Anti-Kickback Law Relate to Prescription Drug Marketing Schemes?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In recent years, prescription drug companies in the United States have increased their marketing activities among providers, patients and suppliers such as pharmacies. Many prescription drug marketing activities go far beyond traditional advertising and educational contacts. Physicians, suppliers and, increasingly, patients are being offered valuable, non-medical benefits in exchange for selecting specific prescription drug brands. Traditionally, physicians and pharmacists have been trusted to provide treatments and recommend products in the best interest of the patient. In an era of aggressive drug marketing, however, patients may now be using prescription drug items, unaware that their physician or pharmacist is being compensated for promoting the selection of a specific product. Prescription drugs supplied under one of these programs are often reimbursed under Medicaid. Among the specific activities, which the OIG has identified, are the following actual cases:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A ``product conversion'' program which resulted in 96,000 brand-name conversions. In this scenario, for instance, Drug Company A offered a cash award to pharmacies for each time a drug prescription was changed from Drug Company B's product to Drug Company A's product. The pharmacies were induced to help persuade physicians, who were unaware of the pharmacies' financial interest, to change prescription.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A ``frequent flier'' campaign in which physicians were given credit toward airline frequent flier mileage each time the physician completed a questionnaire for a new patient placed on the drug company's product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A ``research grant'' program in which physicians were given substantial payments for de minimis recordkeeping tasks. The physician administered the drug manufacturer's product to the patient and made brief notes, sometimes a single word, about the treatment outcome. Upon completion of a limited number of such ``studies,'' the physician received payment from the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If one purpose of any of these marketing schemes is to induce the provision of a prescription drug item reimbursable by Medicaid, then the criminal anti-kickback statute is implicated. There is no statutory exception or ``safe harbor'' to protect such activities. Thus a physician, pharmacy or other practitioner or supplier receiving payment under these activities may be subject to criminal prosecution and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

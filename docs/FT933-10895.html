			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: D-Mark remains the investors' choice THE franc fort policy has become the victim of its own success. The European exchange rate mechanism was supposed to be the route to low inflation. But the irony of last week's turmoil was that the currencies the markets were selling - the French franc, the Danish krone and the Belgian franc - were under pressure because their inflation rates are currently too low. If any country deserves to be punished for veering off the low inflation road, it is Germany and not France. So why should French virtue be so badly rewarded? The reason is that the D-Mark remains, at least for now, the ERM's anchor currency. And being the anchor of a system of semi-fixed exchange rates, such as the ERM, means setting the interest rate floor. The ERM's current problem is that this floor, while appropriate for inflation-troubled Germany, means dangerously and unsustainably high real interest rates for the low inflation countries. But hold on: theory suggests that the anchor ought to be the country which, on average, has the lowest inflation rate. Because inflation is expected to erode the anchor currency's value less than the other currencies, investors will accept a lower return for holding it. The first chart shows why the D-Mark was the clear anchor for the system during the first decade of the ERM's existence. During the years 1978-87 German inflation was by far the lowest of the member countries at an average of 3.2 per cent a year. Consumer prices in France rose more than twice as fast over the period, with an average annual inflation of 8.8 per cent. Three years after German reunification, however, this argument no longer seems to apply. In June 1993 German inflation stood at 4.2 per cent: the highest of all the countries in the ERM's northern 'core'. If low inflation is the prime qualification for the anchor currency then, by rights, Denmark and Ireland should now share the honour. Yet the Danish and Irish finance ministers have made no such claims, while the French finance minister, who suggested the franc could be the new ERM anchor, has been punished by the markets for what now seems a piece of grand hubris. Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minster, this weekend reaffirmed the D-Mark's continuing and vital role as the ERM anchor. How can Mr Waigel still make this claim? The explanation is that a country's long-term inflation prospects are what matter to investors when they are evaluating a currency's relative risk and return. The right-hand chart measures the markets' long-term predictions for inflation in all of the ERM countries as implied by the yield on long-term government bonds. It is easy to see why Germany was judged by far the best low inflation bet during the first decade of the ERM. But, despite Germany's current problems, the Bundesbank's reputation for delivering low inflation remains intact. Only the Netherlands has a marginally lower long-term bond yield than Germany: 6.4 per cent compared with 6.6 per cent. So, for all Germany's current difficulties, investors do not think that future German inflation will remain higher than in other ERM countries. Whether the D-Mark will remain the anchor currency will depend on whether the Bundesbank's high interest rate policy succeeds in bringing German inflation under control. If, that is, there is still an ERM for it to anchor.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.

adjusted. Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA. Retail sales volume: data from national government sources except Japan and Italy (value series deflated by OECD using CPI). Refers to total retail sales except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department stores only). Industrial production: data from national government sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US - help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies. Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series, cyclical fluctuations in which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in general economic activity.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

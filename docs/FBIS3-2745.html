			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Liu Huisheng (0491 2585 3932) and reporter </F> Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)]    [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- According to  information provided by the Supreme People's Court, the Hangzhou  city Intermediate People's Court recently passed sentence, in  accordance with the law, on two criminals who hijacked a China  Eastern Airlines plane. Zhang Daxing, the principal criminal,  was sentenced to life imprisonment and stripped of his political  rights for life, while his accomplice Chen Jiangfu was sentenced  to 10 years' imprisonment and stripped of his political rights  for one year.    In December 1993, Zhang Daxing, a self-employed industrial  and commercial businessman from Jiangsu's Taicang county who was  doing business in Shanghai, asked Chen Jiangfu, a farmer from  Jiangsu's Wujin county who wanted to start his own household  tailoring business in Shanghai Municipality's Baoshan County, to  go out with him under the pretext of doing business. On 28  January 1994, after purchasing air tickets for the  Shanghai-Hangzhou flight for the following day, Zhang Daxing  told Chen Jiangfu about his plot to hijack the aircraft to  Taiwan and showed him a blackmail letter he had written earlier.    On 29 January 1994, Zhang Daxing and Chen Jiangfu boarded  China Eastern Airlines flight 5513 for Hangzhou. Shortly after  the plane took off, Zhang Daxing got up and forced the flight  crew to change the plane's course to Taiwan using the blackmail  letter and threats to blow up the plane. Meanwhile, Chen  Jiangfu followed Zhang Daxing's orders and kept an eye on the  people on board. In the course of dealings between the flight  crew and the two criminals, the plane landed at Hangzhou's  Jianqiao Airport and the two criminals were arrested on the spot.    In trying the case, the Hangzhou City Intermediate People's  Court uncovered the facts and decided that Zhang Daxing and Chen  Jiangfu used threats to hijack the aircraft, disregarding state  law. There was sufficient clear evidence to prove that they had  hijacked the aircraft. To safeguard normal aviation order and  protect the safety of passengers and property, it is necessary  to strictly punish criminals who hijack aircraft. In accordance  with the relevant stipulations of the "Decision of the National  People's Congress Standing Committee on Strictly Punishing  Criminal Elements Who Hijack Aircraft" and the "Criminal Law of  the People's Republic of China," the Hangzhou City Intermediate  People's Court passed initial judgment on principal criminal  Zhang Daxing and his accomplice Chen Jiangfu. Zhang Daxing and  Chen Jiangfu pleaded guilty and accepted the verdict. As they  did not file an appeal within the legally prescribed period, the  initial judgment of Hangzhou City Intermediate People's Court  became legally binding.    A spokesman for the Supreme People's Court said: Hijacking  civil airplanes is a grave crime as it seriously endangers the  safety of passengers and their property. The crime must be  severely punished in accordance with the law. He said: The  judicial organs will definitely continue to severely punish  without leniency plane hijackers who defy the law and take such  risks.</p>

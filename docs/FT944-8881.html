			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Markets Report: US dollar steady as market sentiment improves The dollar yesterday responded cautiously to the larger than expected rise in US interest rates on Tuesday, writes Philip Gawith. While most analysts said the 75 basis-point increase in the Federal Funds rate, to 5.5 per cent, was good news for the dollar, there was little evidence of this in the market. Although the dollar managed to reach a high of DM1.56 in Europe, it then gave back its gains to close in London at DM1.5510, not far above the DM1.5445 where it stood before the rate rise. Against the yen it ended at Y98.38, from Y98.225 before the Fed's move. New York trading finished yesterday with the US currency at DM1.5505 and Y98.355. One casualty of the firmer dollar has been sterling, which gave up more ground to finish at Dollars 1.5713, from Dollars 1.5826. At the beginning of the month it was around Dollars 1.64. The pound also fell to DM2.4371 from DM2.4456. Analysts were slightly mystified by sterling's weakness, which comes against a backdrop of exceptionally good economic news. UK interest rate markets, however, had a better day, prompted by a benign set of economic data, and bullish inflation comments from the Treasury and Bank of England. Volumes were heavy and prices moved sharply, with the March 95 short sterling future trading around 85,000 lots to settle at 92.95, up 16 basis points on the day. In Europe, the D-Mark was firmer against most currencies. The French franc ended at FFr3.448/DM, from FFr3.437. The recent conjuncture of Fed intervention to support the dollar, Republican gains in the mid-term elections, and higher interest rates, have all combined to improve short term sentiment towards the dollar. Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan, commented: 'For the next couple of months it will be very difficult to sell the dollar for the reasons people have been selling it this year.' He said the Fed's aggressive move had laid to rest fears that it was behind the curve in combatting inflation. Mr Gunner was cautious, however, about the extent of the dollar's upside. 'I still get the impression that there are a lot of dollars to sell out there, particularly from central banks diversifying out of the dollar as a reserve currency.' Mr Mark Austin, trader at Midland Global Markets, said the lack of movement in the dollar reflected market nervousness about the extent of any likely rally. 'A feature of the dollar throughout the year has been disappointment. It has tended to give back gains quite quickly,' he added. The dollar has now risen from a low of around DM1.49 when the Fed intervened to support it earlier this month. Mr Austin said it was encouraging that it had held on to these gains, but he was cautious about the medium-term outlook. 'The structural problems are still there. Is it enough to persuade foreign companies to buy sufficient US assets to offset the large capital outflows?' he asked. Mr Austin said most trade yesterday had appeared to come from US funds, with little evidence of activity from longer term investors. Mr Gunner said that while there was room for a short term correction in the dollar, there was interest to buy it 'on the dips'. He felt higher interest rates had put a 'very strong floor' under the dollar. He predicted that, over three months, it could rise as high as DM1.625. On the downside, DM1.51 was a likely floor. Conceding the shift in sentiment, Swiss Bank Corporation told clients that the range for the dollar had now moved to DM1.53-59. SBC, which remains a long term dollar bear, cited the prospect of another cut in German rates as a further factor supporting the dollar. A feature of recent dollar gains is that they have been limited mostly to Europe. The yen has largely stood its ground. Analysts attribute this to high real interest rates in Japan, with the central bank resisting US pressure to ease policy, and ongoing trade frictions. Analysts said the strong rally in short sterling futures had been prompted by good inflation news; both in the form of a very good underlying retail inflation figure for October, and bullish inflation signals emerging from the minutes of the September monthly monetary meeting. In its daily operations the Bank of England provided Pounds 305m of late assistance, after forecasting a Pounds 500m shortage.</p>

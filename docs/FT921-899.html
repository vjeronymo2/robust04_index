			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Hanson considered offer for Lonrho HANSON, the acquisitive conglomerate, has evaluated a possible bid for Lonrho, the international trading group, a financier with close knowledge of Hanson said yesterday. But the financier said market speculation of a bid in the foreseeable future were unfounded. News of Hanson's evaluation of Lonrho comes as Lonrho prepares to face shareholders at today's annual meeting. There have been private complaints about the composition of Lonrho's board from institutional shareholders, but no public criticisms are likely at the meeting. Hanson's acquisition team examined the possibility of a bid for Lonrho, according to financiers involved. However Hanson, a specialist in the intricate tactics of stalking companies, evaluates large numbers of companies which may be vulnerable. Hanson's advisers said yesterday that the company had ruled out owning or merging with a company which derives more than 70 per cent of its pre-tax profits from Africa. Although Hanson does have a small presence in South Africa, through Ever Ready batteries, it has no experience of managing businesses in the rest of Africa. According to a financier who knows Hanson well, the company views Lonrho as a one-man band and feels that Mr Roland 'Tiny' Rowland, the group's chief executive, is 'irreplaceable' in dealing with a number of African governments. Hanson executives did not relish the thought of having to devote a significant proportion of their time to negotiations with politicians in Africa. Lonrho shares fell to a six-year low of 86p earlier in the month. They recently bounced back above 100p following persistent rumours that Hanson, after backing off from bidding for Imperial Chemical Industries, would attempt a takeover of Lonrho. Hanson might reconsider Lonrho as a possible acquisition if the international trading group's shares continue to fall. According to one Hanson adviser, however, it would be unlikely to consider bidding for Lonrho even if the price of the company's shares were to halve. The last outside evaluation of Lonrho to become public knowledge was by Samuel Montagu for Mr Alan Bond, the Australian businessman, who bought a 21.6 per cent stake before Bond Corporation ran into difficulties.</p>

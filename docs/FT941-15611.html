			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: Tory Lords question publication Lord Hailsham, the former Conservative Lord Chancellor, last night questioned the publication of the district auditor's provisional findings. During exchanges on a government statement to the Lords he said: 'What would one think of a judge who, halfway through a case, said he was minded to find the accused guilty but that the accused would have the opportunity of making his defence? 'Grave charges ought not to be made unless the person accused has the right to rebut. 'I understand that the right of the accused in the present case to rebut the charges has yet to be made. I am deeply concerned at what has happened.' Lord Gilmour of Craigmillar, a former Conservative cabinet member, demanded if this procedure was 'usual or unusual'. And Lord Elton, another Tory ex-minister, suggested that the case should be treated as if it were sub judice. Lord Campbell of Alloway, a Tory, said that from information published 'there doesn't appear, so far as I can see, to be any evidence as to those very serious charges or of misappropriation of funds'. The Conservative Earl of Onslow suggested that Britain was taking the matter 'miles more seriously than any other country in Europe' would have done. He said: 'Lambsdorff got away with murder. France is corrupt up to its eyeballs and the Italians and Spaniards are the same.' The Earl of Arran, junior environment minister, defended the district auditor's actions and added that technically the provisional report was not sub judice. He also said it would be 'extremely unwise' for Westminster City Council to continue its policy of designated sales while it was still under investigation.</p>

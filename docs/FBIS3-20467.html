			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article titled: "Lhasa Area Cracks Down on </F> Smuggling"]    [Text] Since August of last year, in various  areas throughout the entire country, various departments, in  accordance with the plans of the Party Central and State  Council, have taken joint action, together grasped joint  management, in focusing on launching anti-smuggling joint action  and special projects for combatting smuggling. Last year,  between August and October, various coastal provinces, cities,  and autonomous regions ferreted out 2984 smuggling cases,  amounting to more than 900 yuan in value. Up to this point, sea  and land-based pernicious smuggling activity had already been  controlled to some degree, and China's open environment to the  West and internal economic order were gradually being purified  and strengthened.    In a manner similar to the gratifying situation occurring  all  over the country with attacks on smuggling activity, Tibet's  work in attacking smuggling has also achieved a phased success:  First, a leading organ for attacking smuggling on a regional  basis has been established, and in conducting special purpose  attacks on smuggling, full play is being given to the core  effect; second, a case involving a group using border passes to  smuggle reactionary and obscene propaganda material, gold,  cultural relics, rare wild animal skins, fur, and bones has been  cracked, and the activity of a criminal group smuggling  internally and outside the border has been controlled; third,  market management has been strengthened, and groups smuggling  goods such as automobiles have been investigated and controlled;  fourth, inspections have been launched concerning enforcement of  the law, and the establishment of anti-contraband teams has been  strengthened; fifth, anti-smuggling education has been launched,  and combined with Tibet's practical dissemination of "Customs  Laws."    However, we must note that anti-smuggling in Tibet is still  a  long-term and arduous task. In particular, because a portion of  enterprise units participate in smuggling activity, there exists  in the society a mistaken sense that smuggling will lead to  riches, and the implementation details for Tibet carrying out  national anti-smuggling legal statutes have not been fully  perfected. Because the work awaits gradual strengthening,  Tibet's struggle with anti-smuggling work also faces a very  arduous task.    We should note that attacking smuggling in reality is a  serious political struggle between vast numbers of cadres and  the broad masses, and an extremely small number of smugglers.  The corrosive effect of rampant smuggling on staff and worker  teams, the effect of the credit situation, and attacks on the  normal management mechanisms are all substantial. In Tibet, the  state has provided preferential policies for foreign trade, and  any smuggling activity in fact infringes on the interests of the  autonomous region; any illegal profit seeking activity,  objectively speaking, is a forceful blow against normal  lawabiding management and against our establishment of a  socialist market economy. Attacking smuggling is not only a  requirement for us to put in order and rectify the social and  economic environment, and safeguard national interests, but is  also a requirement for our safeguarding of the basic interests  of the broad masses and striving for Tibet's long-term sustained  development.    Properly handling the anti-smuggling struggle requires  reliance on responsibility being taken by party and government  leadership at all levels, and at the same time requires the  mobilization of the masses, and reliance on the masses, to  jointly construct a steel great wall in the anti-smuggling  struggle. Only in this manner will it be possible to create a  healthy and stable environment for Tibet's reform and opening  and economic development.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Austrian bank records 45% surge CREDITANSTALT Bankverein, the Austrian bank, yesterday unveiled a 45 per cent jump in 1991 operating profit, but said it suffered large loan losses on its foreign business. Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, the chairman, said the bank took charges of more than Sch3bn (Dollars 149m) against its 1991 earnings. This includes Sch1.2bn in write-downs on loans to Third World and former communist countries, and Sch600m from the activities of its London branch. Operating profit jumped to Sch3.02bn in 1991 from Sch2.08bn as a surge in currency trading income offset lower earnings from regular banking activities. Partial operating profit, which does not include the bank's own-account trading, fell 15 per cent to Sch2.1bn from 2.46bn a year earlier, mostly because of higher operating expenses. Mr Schmidt-Chiari said he expected generally better results for 1992. Creditanstalt is not the only Austrian bank to have suffered large loan losses abroad. Bank Austria, which took Creditanstalt's place as the country's largest bank when it was formed through the merger of Landerbank and Zentralsparkasse last year, earlier reported it will take a charge of nearly Sch5bn because of losses in the US and Britain.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Property: 'Gold fever' gives way to sober realism - Budapest's developers are cautious The euphoria that characterised Budapest's property sector at the turn of the decade has given way to sober realism. According to the city authorities which are trying to sell off state-owned property, the market has slowed down. 'The real estate market has collapsed in the past two years,' says Mr Gabor Demszky, mayor of Budapest. He fears that demand for property has dropped so sharply that the city may not achieve its target of Ft6bn-Ft10bn in property sales this year. It is far cry from 1990-91, when interest in property was 'like a gold fever', according to Mr Demszky. 'Every day dozens of foreigners wanted to meet me because of real estate,' he says. But while developers are no longer beating a path to the mayor's door, agents in Budapest challenge the assertion that the market has collapsed. Supply and demand are in a good balance, with over-supply of 1 per cent. Rents for the best buildings have held at a monthly rate of about DM50 per square metre, though for some less well-located buildings the rates have fallen to DM30. The recession in property markets worldwide, together with a less bullish attitude to the domestic sector's prospects have prevented any speculative excesses in Hungary. Developers have therefore resisted starting new developments because of concern about the possibility of oversupply, the difficulty of raising finance without pre-lets and the problem of selling completed buildings. The result of this caution has been a relatively prompt take-up for completed buildings. Since 1988, 280,000 sq m of office stock has been completed. Take-up this year is likely to be about 80,000 sq m-100,000 sq m, according to Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors. Investors for completed, let buildings are currently a rare breed. 'You can assume that the majority of buildings are potentially for sale,' says Mr Michael Hodges of Jones Lang Wootton. So far, there have been a bare handful of investment deals. Two small office buildings were bought by Dutch investors last year on yields of between 13 per cent and 14 per cent. The slow development of Budapest's investment market is partly explained by the problems endured by markets in other countries in recent years. Those investors which are in a position to make purchases have been able to obtain high yielding buildings in more established markets. Investors might also be deterred by relatively short leases. 'For the development of the investment market, we need more buildings with good covenants and good lease structures,' says Mr Michael Carroll of Healey &amp; Baker, the surveyors. Moreover, potential investors do not believe returns are high enough to compensate for the extra risks associated with an unstable economy and the non-convertibility of the forint. Some commentators blame property owners for having an inflexible position on the value of their property. 'If prices stay as high, there is no chance of inviting foreigners to invest here,' says Mr Peter Keszthelyi of the Budapest Chamber of Commerce. But developers baulk at dropping their asking prices, given the high cost of building in Hungary, which is not much cheaper than in neighbouring countries. Developers must contend with heavy duties on imported building materials, lengthy planning procedures and onerous financing costs. Moreover, the authorities are reluctant to sell land cheaply. 'We have long-term goals. The city is waiting for a good time to sell it (property) at the right price,' says Mr Janos Haszonits of the city's enterprise department, Compared with other central and eastern European countries, there are relatively few problems in establishing a claim to land. 'The land registry has, for the most part, been carefully maintained. It is functioning well,' says Mr Wolfgang Dorn-Zachertz of the law firm, Punder, Volhard, Weber &amp; Axster. The legal system also presents few problems, he says. Even so, investors still need to confront the complexities of the ownership structure, which compels buyers to undertake tortuous negotiations with different state organisations. Complications arise because state-owned property is administered by several entities. Developers also have to grapple with a complex planning system. Applications are supposed to take more no than 30 days to process; but in reality they take a lot longer. 'The bureaucratic procedures have not been reduced by the change of regime,' says Ms Katalin Pongracz, of the city's special planning department. The structure of the planning authorities in Budapest is complex, involving six departments at the town hall and 22 local districts. Winning agreement for the city's new development plan, which replaces the old regime's 1988 plan will therefore be complicated. The main proposals in the development plan, according to Ms Pongracz, are: to ensure that the density and size of the city are contained; to improve the quality of living accommodation; to upgrade infrastructure and transport facilities; and to improve green areas and ensure the old parts of the city are restored before greenfield sites are developed. 'There is a special character of Budapest which we are not going to destroy,' says Ms Pongracz.</p>

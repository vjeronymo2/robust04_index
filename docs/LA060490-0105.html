			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> LOWRIDERS DRAW HIGH PRAISE AT SHOW  </P> <P> Mike Ramos looked at the restored dark green 1948 Chevrolet Fleetwood, complete  with the optional dash electric razor, that his car club was displaying at  Sunday's second annual Salsa Custom Lowrider Show and Family Fiesta, and beamed  with what he called "Latino pride."  </P> <P> "This is all part of our culture," said the 28-year-old vice president of the  Orange County chapter of the Dukes. "It's not involved with gangs, it's safe  and it's a good investment."  </P> <P> Whether they had classic oldies like Ramos' club's or the newer "tricked-out"  mini-trucks equipped with hydraulic, jumping suspensions and exotic paint jobs,  the exhibitors at the show said the cars are much more than just unique sets of  wheels.  </P> <P> "It's a whole lifestyle," boasted 29-year-old Art Vazicaion, who owns a yellow,  1984 Isuzu truck with an $8,000 stereo system.  </P> <P> More than 20,000 people attended the show at the Orange County Fairgrounds. It  featured not only cars and trucks but also authentic Latino food, art, crafts,  music and dance.  </P> <P> "It's really cool to walk around here. There's lots to see," said Rosa Mera,  16, of El Toro. "The guys are pretty cute too."  </P> <P> But for the most part, the 500 vehicles were the main attraction.  </P> <P> Alfonzo Serrano showed passers-by his cousin's lowriding 1978 Cadillac Coup de  Ville painted psychedelic colors.  </P> <P> "He's put at least $15,000 into this," Serrano said. "There's chrome on the  brakes and 14-karat gold on parts underneath the car." Pointing to the apricot  interior he said, "These seats alone cost $3,000."  </P> <P> In addition to the traditional lowriding Chevrolet Impalas, there were  Mercedeses, Porsches, BMWs and even Suzuki Samurais built to hug the pavement.  </P> <P> Rick Woods was showing off a 1988 white Mercedes with flashy gold rims and  about a six-inch ground clearance.  </P> <P> "I do these conversions for a living," he said. He smiled as he looked at the  car, which he charged a man in Tennessee $22,000 to customize. "I'm not saying  it's done in good taste or bad taste . . . this one is a little gaudy."  </P> <P> Mini-truck lowriders with high riding hydraulic beds were also a big draw.  </P> <P> "It's really amazing what these trucks can do," said Jeanne Sleeper, a  spokeswoman for Inter-Shows, which organized the event. "They shoot up into the  air and do 360s," she said. MATT LAIT  </P></p>

			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Trygg turns to Zurich in US Trygg-Hansa, the Swedish insurer, yesterday announced the virtual takeover of its loss-making US associate Home Holdings by Switzerland's Zurich Insurance group, tearing up an earlier refinancing agreement for Home struck only three weeks ago with a group of US investors. Zurich, one of Europe's top three insurance groups, will take over the management of Home and will be able to renew all existing Home business. Home will be de-listed from the New York Stock Exchange. Moody's, the New York credit rating agency, responded to the news by saying it might cut senior debt ratings of Trygg-Hansa and Home and also Home intercompany pool's insurance financial strength rating. It had previously said it may raise Home's ratings. Trygg-Hansa and Zurich will meanwhile enter a strategic alliance giving Trygg's industrial clients access to Zurich's international network in insurance and risk management and giving Zurich's customers access to Trygg's services in Scandinavia. The deal replaced a Dollars 590m refinancing package arranged with Fund American Enterprises Holdings, Trident Partnership and Hellman &amp; Friedman. As the result of its 1991 investment in Home, Trygg holds a 64.5 per cent stake in the US insurer. Mr Lars Thunell, Trygg's chief executive, said the about-turn was possible under an escape clause in the original deal - although Home will pay a penalty to the US investor group of about Dollars 12m. Trygg said the new agreement meant its total loss from the investment would fall to SKr4.5bn (Dollars 601m) from SKr5bn and its required write-down would fall by a similar margin to SKr2.3bn. Zurich is to pay Dollars 100m-Dollars 150m as a commission for taking over the renewal of Home business. It will lend Home Dollars 98m and put up working capital of about Dollars 30m. It will buy 800,000 Home shares from Trygg, now at Dollars 7.50 per share and, over an eight-year period, a further 17.4m shares at about Dollars 8.50 per share, cutting Trygg's stake to 12 per cent. Home will repurchase about 9m outstanding shares (not held by Trygg or the other principal shareholder, Centre Re) for Dollars 10 per share. Home's Dollars 170m debt to Trygg will be restructured, with Zurich initially paying Dollars 1m for Dollars 110m in junior debentures and Trygg taking on Dollars 60m in junior debentures. The repayment of the balance of Dollars 109m due to Trygg will be postponed and based on an assessment of Home's loss reserves at the end of 1994. The original deal involved a Dollars 420m injection into Home by the US investors, the write-off by Trygg of its USDollars 170m loan to Home and the option for the US group to buy 14.5m of Trygg's 22.5m shares in Home.

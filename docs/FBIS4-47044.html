			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In the Language of Figures: How Kazan </F> Relates to Others"]    [Text] The 18th session of the Kazan City Soviet of  People's Deputies has examined the issue "On the Course of  Implementation of the 'Package of Urgent Measures To Fight Crime  in Kazan for 1993-1995.'"    We present here the most interesting aspects of the  report of N. Akbarov, chief of the Kazan Internal Affairs  Directorate, and portions of the session minutes.    Prior to discussion of the report of N. Akbarov, chief of  the  Kazan Internal Affairs Directorate, charts were distributed to  the deputies showing comparative data on the crime situation in  Tatarstan and certain regions of the Russian Federation.    Over the first four months of this year, 20,581 crimes were  registered in the republic (20,690 during the same period of  last year). The lion's share of these crimes is attributable to  Kazan and Naberezhnyye Chelny (6,637 and 3,894, respectively).  One cannot fail to note, however, that 72.7 percent (last  year--53 percent) of them were investigated in Kazan, but only  64 percent--in Chelny.    The best indices of all were observed in Nizhnekamskiy and  Bugulminskiy Rayons. Of 1,299 crimes registered in Nizhnekamskiy  Rayon, 64 percent were investigated. In Bugulminskiy Rayon, 66.8  percent of the 800 registered crimes were investigated--and this  in view of the fact that the number of criminal incidents in  Bugulminskiy (just as in Zelenodolskiy and Almetyevskiy Rayons)  Rayon in the first four months of 1994 rose by more than  one-fourth.    Naturally we cannot help but be overjoyed by the fact that  the percentage of criminal cases solved in Tatarstan overall and  in Kazan in particular is higher than in our neighboring oblasts  and republics. In Nizhniy Novgorod this figure is 49.7 percent,  in Ufa--48.8 percent, in Saratov--53.4 percent, in  Cheboksary--39.9 percent, in Izhevsk--47.5 percent, in  Yoshkar-Ola--47.7 percent, and in Samara--63.2 percent.    On the other hand, in comparison with other big cities,  Kazan  occupies one of the top positions with respect to number of  crimes committed (6,637), outpaced only by Nizhniy Novgorod,  where felons provided cases for the militia 10,629 times over  the four-month period.    The Tatarstan capital also leads with respect to number of  grave crimes committed (2,043), once again leaving the first  prize for Nizhniy Novgorod (2,191). Overall, however, the  republic finds itself out in front of Nizhniy Novgorod as far as  grave crimes are concerned (5,132 and 3,971, respectively), not  to mention other contiguous regions (Bashkortostan--3,086,  Saratov Oblast--2,606, Chuvashia--1,614, Udmurtiya--2,260, Mari  El--661, and Samara Oblast--3,371).</p>

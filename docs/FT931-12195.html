			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / The Property Market: No sign of growth in year-end data PROPERTY yields reached a record of 10 per cent in the month of December, according to new figures from the Investment Property Databank, a research group. The data underlines the renewed sense of pessimism in the property industry following the transitory signs of growth earlier last year. The IPD Monthly Index shows that total returns for the month fell back once again to zero, as longer yields combined with further declines in rental values. The All Properties total return for the year sank to -0.1 per cent, the first negative year-on-year return since December 1991. The returns of the different sectors converged slightly in 1992. Retails, which had a year-on-year return of 4.8 per cent, took over from industrials as market leader in February. Retail rental growth dropped from -0.7 per cent in December 1991 to -3.0 per cent, although capital growth improved by almost 1 point over the period to stand at -2.8 per cent in December. Offices produced an annual return of -6.1 per cent, which nonetheless showed a 2 point uplift on 1991, the greatest relative improvement over the year. Capital value growth for the year to December was -14.2 per cent while rental value growth sank to -16.8 per cent. Yields on industrials have been pushed out to 11.4 per cent. Rental value growth fell by 9 points to -9.5 per cent, while capital growth dropped from  2.1 to -8.6 per cent.</p>

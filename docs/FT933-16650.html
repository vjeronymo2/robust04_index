His implacable stance on inflation, in particular, is the focus of gloom in several of the cluster of shops just down the street from his home.

And his view that both Bank and Treasury haven't done enough to oil economic wheels is shared, for instance, by chemist Dhiru Patel and Robert Smith who runs the local showroom of the S G Smith Motor Group.

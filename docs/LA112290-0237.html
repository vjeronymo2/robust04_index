			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON BRUSH REMOVAL LAW  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council on Tuesday delayed a final vote on a sweeping brush  fire prevention ordinance that would require firefighters to check 13,000  hillside lots for vegetation that could fuel a fast-moving blaze.  </P> <P> Adoption of the measure, which received preliminary approval last week, was  postponed after homeowner associations complained that it did not give property  owners enough time to comply with an order to remove brush.  </P> <P> As proposed, firefighters could order a property owner to clear hazardous brush  within 15 days. If not done, the city could send crews to clear the brush 10  days later and bill the owner for the removal costs.  </P> <P> City staff members agreed to review the notification guidelines and return the  measure to the council Dec. 4.  </P></p>

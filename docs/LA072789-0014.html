			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPOTTED OWLS AND LOGGERS  </P> <P> I'm distressed that you published Mark A. Stein's one-sided lament for loggers  in Sweet Home, Ore., who are supposedly losing work because environmentalists  are trying to save the spotted owl.  </P> <P> We in the U.S. decry Brazil's and Indonesia's felling of their tropical rain  forests while we decimate our own old-growth forest at an equally reckless  rate, contributing to the same global crises: release of carbon dioxide,  exacerbating the greenhouse effect; and loss of habitat, reducing species  diversity.  </P> <P> The "jobs vs. environment" dichotomy is a red herring. Most timber unemployment  has resulted from modernization of mill equipment. More jobs are lost because  so many logs are now shipped, unprocessed, to Japan. (We harvest more wood than  we need and sell 25% to Japan. Yet the Forest Service proposes chopping 25%  more over the next decade!)  </P> <P> A study by resource economist Jeffrey T. Olson shows that taking 25% less wood  would eliminate only 2,300 jobs in 40 years.  </P> <P> Industry "research" to duplicate spotted owl habitat in the monoculture tree  plantations with which it replaces nature's forests is absurd. What about all  the other old growth-dependent species whose survival is threatened by  ever-shrinking habitat -- grizzly bear, gray wolf, mountain lion, mountain  goat, wolverine, lynx, fisher, flying squirrel, red tree vole, bog lemming,  rough-skinned newt, Olympic salamander, tailed frog, goshawk, harlequin duck,  marbled murrelet, pileated, red-cockaded and three-toed woodpecker, elegant  trogon, red crossbill, olive-sided flycatcher?  </P> <P> DON STRACHAN  </P> <P> Topanga  </P></p>

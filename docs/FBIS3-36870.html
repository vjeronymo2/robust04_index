The priority in naturalization should be granted to those  non-citizens who have finished educational establishments with  Latvian teaching language rather than to the spouses of  citizens, as stipulated by the present bills, said Abikis.    Non-citizens should take another state language exam before  getting citizenship because the present language commissions  often issue undeserved language certificates, he said.    In addition, state language inspectors in Riga have faced  violence on several occasions, said Abikis. An inspector in the  Latgale district, for example, was severely beaten recently.    Abikis claims that the brutal acts are directed against the  Latvian state and evidence of reluctance of part of non-Latvians  to respect the Latvian nation and its language.    The State Language Center has applied to the Justice  Ministry  in a bid to receive salary additions from collected fines for  breaking of the state language law. State inspectors presently  receive 59 lats per month.    The language learning among adults proceeds with  difficulties  but the younger generation gives grounds to hope for the better,  said Abikis. In the largest cities, especially in Daugavpils  and Kraslava, many non-Latvian children learn in  Latvian-language schools.    The Latvia's Way faction believes that professional training  in Latvia should fully transfer to the Latvian teaching  language, said Abikis.</p>

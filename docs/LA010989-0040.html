			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BITTER IDEOLOGICAL SPLIT IN PARTY SEEN CLOSING;  </P> <P> CONSERVATIVES QUIET ON BUSH'S SELECTION OF KISSINGER ALLIES  </P> <P> Thirteen years ago, when then-Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger appeared at  the Republican National Convention, many of Ronald Reagan's delegates stood up  and booed at the man they considered an unwelcome symbol of foreign policy  moderation. And eight years ago, when Reagan first entered the White House,  Kissinger and many of his former aides were pointedly passed over when foreign  policy appointments were made.  </P> <P> But times have changed. Two of the most important foreign policy jobs in the  new Bush Administration have gone to former "Kissinger men," with more  reportedly to come. There has been hardly a peep of protest from the GOP's  right wing. And Kissinger himself, who sometimes criticized Reagan's leadership  in a tone approaching contempt, has nothing but compliments for the abilities  of George Bush.  </P> <P> "I'm very enthusiastic about the new Administration," the former secretary of  state said in a recent telephone interview. "Very, very enthusiastic."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Worked for Kissinger  </P> <P> Bush's choice for national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and deputy  secretary of state, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, are not only former Kissinger  aides; for the last five years they also have both been officers of Kissinger  Associates, Kissinger's private consulting firm.  </P> <P> Several other Kissinger acolytes are also in line for top jobs under Secretary  of State-designate James A. Baker III, according to Reagan Administration  officials and Bush transition aides: William G. Hyland, now editor of Foreign  Affairs magazine, John D. Negroponte, a National Security Council aide, and  Winston Lord, the U.S. ambassador to China.  </P> <P> In years past, a mere mention of their names would have prompted dire warnings  from Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and other conservative stalwarts that Reagan's  foreign policy legacy was in danger of being sabotaged. But a call last week to  Helms' office produced only a private word of disparagement from an aide about  "the Kissinger-Rockefeller types," a reference to Kissinger's original  political patron, the late Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller.  </P> <P> Instead, the return of the Kissinger men -- and the broad applause their  reappointments have drawn -- suggest that the bitter ideological differences  which often divided not only the Republican Party but also the Reagan Cabinet  as well are largely over.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Borrows Dukakis Line  </P> <P> "What we're seeing, ironically, is a turn to competence rather than ideology,"  said another former Kissinger aide, Helmut Sonnenfeldt (borrowing a line from  Bush's opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, in the presidential  campaign).  </P> <P> "The appointments, for the most part, have gone to the center of the spectrum,"  he said. "What it says is that Bush is going to be that kind of President, and  Baker is going to be that kind of secretary of state. . . . You'll be getting  professional people, pragmatic people."  </P> <P> "A triumph of competence over ideology," echoed Kenneth L. Adelman, Reagan's  former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. "It's a more  standard Republican lot than the Reagan Administration started with, more the  country club Republican set . . . a vanilla crowd."  </P> <P> "It's hard to find in this group what the drive will be, what the message will  be," Adelman added. "The Reagan Administration had SDI (the Strategic Defense  Initiative), the Reagan Doctrine (of aid to anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua  and elsewhere), the mission of revitalizing American strength. What are these  guys going to do?"  </P> <P> But even Adelman agrees that the time is ripe for a more centrist approach.  "This is a very different time from 1980," he said. "Then the strategic  momentum was with the Soviet Union, and the United States had to find a way to  turn that around. Now everything's coming up roses, and what we have to do is  stay on a steady path."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conservative Views  </P> <P> To be sure, Bush has not deserted the conservative tenets of Reagan's foreign  policy. The President-elect still supports SDI, aid for the Contras and the use  of U.S. military power in the Persian Gulf and other trouble spots. And on one  central issue, the U.S. attitude toward the Soviet Union, Bush has been  markedly more skeptical than Reagan, who embraced the idea of a new  understanding with Moscow as a major part of his legacy.  </P> <P> "The center of gravity has shifted a bit, but not that much," argued a Bush  aide. "Ronald Reagan's appointments went way up into the 90 percents on a  conservative scale. George Bush's appointments have maybe scaled back from 90  to 85. They're still conservatives."  </P> <P> But Bush's style has been noticeably different from Reagan's already, even  before his inauguration. His rhetoric has been less fiery; "He has a less  emotional approach to the issues," noted Sonnenfeldt. And his attitude toward  Congress has been more conciliatory, both Democrats and Republicans say.  </P> <P> And the most ideological conservatives, the ones who struggled to keep the  Reagan Administration's anti-Soviet foreign policy "pure," are noticeably  absent from the lists of rumored appointees.  </P> <P> "Part of it is that the Reaganites just aren't available any more. They've done  their bit in government, and now they're out doing other things," the Bush aide  said. "Part of it is ideological, sure. . . . But there's stylistic stuff as  well as ideology. George Bush likes people who solve problems. He doesn't like  people who are ideologically or personally aggressive, and the two traits often  seem to go together."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Faces Internal Debates  </P> <P> The Bush Administration still faces some internal foreign policy debates. On  Nicaragua, for example, the President-elect has spoken strongly in favor of  renewed U.S. military aid to the Contras in an attempt to push the leftist  regime toward internal democracy. But some members of Congress have said that  Baker seems skeptical about how effective the battered Contras can be; and  associates say Eagleburger, like Kissinger, has long believed that the center  of U.S. concern in Central America should be the threat of growing Soviet  influence in the region rather than the quest for parliamentary democracy.  </P> <P> As for Kissinger, Bush aides say he may be asked to head special commissions on  foreign policy problems, as he did for Reagan on Central America in 1983-1984.  Asked about a possible role for him as a special negotiator in the Middle East  or elsewhere, though, they sound uncertain.  </P> <P> "People would spend most of their time worrying about whether Henry was walking  away with the store," said one.  </P> <P> In any case, Kissinger himself says he is quite delighted to see his friends  walk away with the Administration's best jobs, and quite happy to remain in  private life with the best contacts in Washington.  </P> <P> "I probably shouldn't say this," he mused. "But there probably isn't a job  there that I really want."  </P></p>

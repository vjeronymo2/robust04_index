			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> QUARTERBACK PLATT FAILS TO REPORT FOR AZTECS, MAY LEAVE TEAM  </P> <P> Brad Platt, San Diego State's backup quarterback, did not report for the first  day of camp Thursday and may leave the team for personal reasons, Coach Al  Luginbill said.  </P> <P> Platt, who started seven games for the Aztecs last season, initiated a meeting  with Luginbill Wednesday night, the eve of the first day of camp for SDSU's 66  veterans. Platt and Luginbill discussed the situation for about an hour, and  Platt said he wanted to leave the program.  </P> <P> "I would not accept him quitting the football team," Luginbill said. "I told  him I just wasn't going to accept it."  </P> <P> Luginbill said he wanted to meet with Platt Thursday. "He was supposed to come  by and see me. It's now what, nine o'clock, and he hasn't been around. I don't  even want to comment. It's not a done thing yet."  </P> <P> It was not known if Platt met with Luginbill later in the day.  </P> <P> Platt was the only veteran who did not report for physicals, equipment,  academic counseling and initial meetings with Luginbill and his staff.  </P> <P> Platt, who played at Southwestern Community College and Hilltop High School,  threw for 1,466 yards last season, completing 130 of 226 passes. Platt was  expected to battle freshmen quarterbacks Cree Morris and David Lowery for the  No. 2 spot behind Dan McGwire, a transfer from Iowa who beat out Platt in the  spring.  </P> <P> There was some talk that Platt (6-feet-1, 210 pounds) might be switched to  another position, such as receiver or defensive back.  </P> <P> "It kind of changes things rapidly," said Dave Lay, the offensive coordinator,  of the possibility of losing Platt.  </P> <P> If he should leave, Platt would be the third SDSU quarterback to do so in the  past three months.  </P> <P> On the eve of the first day of spring practice, Scott Barrick announced he was  quitting because he lacked the necessary desire to continue playing. Barrick, a  Fallbrook High graduate, has since enrolled at Palomar College where he will  play for Coach Tom Craft, SDSU's quarterback in 1976.  </P> <P> About a month later, Jack Skoog, who would have been a senior, announced his  intention to transfer to Michigan State. Skoog also played baseball for the  Aztecs.  </P> <P> Platt who lives in Chula Vista, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Luginbill made it clear from the onset he would not tolerate out-of-shape  players, implementing a mandatory off-season conditioning program.  </P> <P> "Friday morning will really be a day of reckoning for a lot of them," Luginbill  said. "We will know how much conditioning they did. What has their commitment  been to making this a good football team? They know what to expect from me now.  There's no reason or excuse not to meet those expectations. It takes no ability  or skill to get in shape."  </P> <P> The first game of the season, at the Air Force Academy, is in 22 days.  </P> <P> "I think most of the players stuck to (their training programs)," said senior  safety John Wesselman. "If you were in town like most of the guys were, you  couldn't help but stick to it. I'm probably in the best shape I've been in  coming into the fall."  </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> Centers Steve Blyth and Bonner Montler are the only veterans expected to miss  Saturday's first practice because of injury. Blyth is still recovering from a  ruptured knee tendon that required surgery in May. Montler's second and third  toes on his left foot are still smarting from a dirt bike accident this summer  . . . Among the newcomers nursing injuries are receivers Will Tate (knee) and  Tom Underwood (hamstring), offensive lineman Mike Alexander (hip) and defensive  lineman George Tuioti (knee) . . . Because of the depth of the defensive line,  Doug Blanchard and Eric Duncan will be moved to the offensive line and  linebacker.  </P></p>

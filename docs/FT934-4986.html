			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: QMH holders waive right Holders of two Queens Moat Houses debenture issues worth a nominal Pounds 215m yesterday waived their right to enforce their security in a move that helps clear the way for the proposed restructuring of the hotel group. Under the debenture deeds, the security for the mainly institutionally-held tradeable debt must be at least 150 per cent of the principal but a valuation of QMH's assets by Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered surveyors, values the designated properties, mostly 27 UK hotels, at just Pounds 137.5m  -a shortfall of Pounds 178.5m.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / S Korean president targets military corruption SOUTH KOREAN President Kim Young-sam has declared war on military corruption in the boldest move yet of his political reform programme. The investigation of the military establishment represents a direct challenge to the men who ruled South Korea for 32 years until Mr Kim became president in February. The government is investigating allegations that military promotions and weapons procurement were heavily influenced by bribery during the administration of President Roh Tae-woo, Mr Kim's predecessor. A former chief of naval operations and a former marine corps commandant were charged yesterday with taking kickbacks on promotions between 1989 and 1991, while a former air force chief of staff, General Chung Yong-hoo, is under investigation for similiar charges. Meanwhile, General Chung has alleged that corruption was involved in the government's sudden decision in 1991 to switch the selection of the country's next-generation fighter aircraft from the McDonnell Douglas F-18 to the F-16 of General Dynamics. McDonnell Douglas was initally awarded the contract in 1989 for the Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.14bn) Korean Fighter Programme, but the government later cited budget problems in reversing the decision, explaining the F-16 was cheaper. The government audit agency yesterday began probing procurement in the past decade, including purchase of the F-16 and submarines, tanks and other equipment. The probes into the military, however, are fraught with peril. They threaten to weaken further the already sensitive relationship between Mr Kim and the military when security tensions are rising due to North Korea's suspected development of a nuclear weapon. The new president last month replaced the top military echelon, including the army chief of staff, in a bid to strengthen civilian control over the armed forces. The government has also cracked down on secret organisations among the officer corps that once wielded considerable political power, most prominent of which was the Hanahoe (One Mind) society, whose members included the two previous presidents. Mr Kim's actions threaten to demoralise the armed forces and raises the possibility that they may oppose him. 'Military opposition to President Kim could occur if it thinks its vital interests are threatened, such as a major reduction in defence spending, or if relations between North and South Korea deteriorate dramatically,' said Mr Ahn Chung-si, political science professor at Seoul National University. Officers could join 'old guard' politicians and bureaucrats also threatened by the anti-corruption campaign, to try to stop the reform process, said Mr Ahn.</p>

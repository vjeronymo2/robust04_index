			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Insurers wary of new retail regulator THE INSURANCE industry's support for the Personal Investments Authority, the proposed regulator of retail financial businesses, has been undermined by a call for it to set out tougher rules for members, the Association of British Insurers said yesterday. Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, has told the authority's Formation Committee that it must prove it will bring about a radical improvement in regulation. The PIA is intended to be formed by the merger of two self-regulatory organisations - Lautro for unit trust and life companies, and Fimbra for financial intermediaries. It is intended to be the lead regulator for firms selling life, pensions and unit trust products. Mr Large has insisted the PIA's proposed 30-member board be cut to 15, with a majority of 'public interest' representatives, including consumer representatives and individuals from outside the financial industry. He has also said that regulated businesses must be prepared to pay higher fees to cover tougher regulation and that sales agents and independent advisers would have to show fitness, properness and adequacy of capital resources before being allowed to join. The insurers' association, whose support is crucial to the PIA's success, is objecting to the suggestion that the board be dominated by public-interest directors. Mr Mike Jones, its chief executive, said: 'This looks like a big step down the road away from practitioner-based self-regulation and not what was intended under the Financial Services Act.' Mr Large's letter is said to have been privately welcomed by the banking industry. The banks' financial services businesses are regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board and they have expressed no interest in switching to the PIA. One banker said the SIB's conditions for the new body might 'lead to fewer claims on the investors compensation scheme'. The letter also indicates that the banks will be regulated under rules formulated by the PIA, a move calculated to encourage them to join the PIA. The SIB said yesterday it proposed to charge members of Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, an additional Pounds 350,000 for the 1992-93 fiscal year to cover increased expenditure after the Maxwell affair. The estimated fees from members in 1992-93 is Pounds 17.92m, up from Pounds 17.79m in 1991-92. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister [Waldemar] Pawlak is breaking the  coalition agreement, said Aleksander Kwasniewski in his opening  speech at the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP]  Main Council session. The Main Council is discussing the  situation that has arisen in Poland after yesterday's  resignation of Marek Borowski, the [deputy prime minister] and  finance minister.    [Unidentified correspondent] Kwasniewski added that the SdRP  wanted to implement the joint economic program that was agreed  upon with the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. The Left is waiting  for a similar declaration on behalf of the Peasant Party  members. In Kwasniewski's opinion, some of the prime minister's  actions and those of members from his entourage allow one to  think that the desire to retain the coalition is uneven.    [Begin Kwasniewski recording] A lack of respect for  coalition  decisions, making decisions without the knowledge of the  appropriate ministers, statements that are far from our jointly  implemented economic and political concept, all these are  pointers that make one want to ask out loud: What is going on?  [end recording]    [Correspondent] In their speeches, members of the council  complained that the government lacked a cadre policy: State  officials are being replaced by party colleagues of the Peasant  Party. Of the eight SLD governors who have recently taken up  their posts, only one is a member of the SdRP; the remainder are  specialists, said Kwasniewski.</p>

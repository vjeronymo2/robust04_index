Should additional categories, merged categories or part categories be added to the bilateral agreement, the entire category(s) or part category(s) shall be included in the coverage of this arrangement on an agreed effective date. Goods exported during the period January 1, 1995 through January 31, 1995 shall not be denied entry for lack of a visa. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A visa must accompany each commercial shipment of the aforementioned textile products. A circular stamped marking in blue ink will appear on the front of the original commercial invoice. The original visa shall not be stamped on duplicate copies of the invoice. The original invoice with the original visa stamp will be required to enter the shipment into the United States. Duplicates of the invoice and/or visa may not be used for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each visa stamp shall include the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The visa number. The visa number shall be in the standard nine digit letter format, beginning with one numerical digit for the last digit of the year of export, followed by the two character alpha country code specified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)(the code for Qatar is ``QA''), and a six digit numerical serial number identifying the shipment; e.g., 5QA123456. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The date of issuance. The date of issuance shall be the day, month and year on which the visa was issued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

Decimals or fractions will not be accepted. Merged category quota merchandise may be accompanied by either the appropriate merged category visa or the correct category visa corresponding to the actual shipment (e.g., Categories 347/348 may be visaed as 347/348 or if the shipment consists solely of 347 merchandise, the shipment may be visaed as ``Cat. 347,'' but not as ``Cat. 348''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Customs shall not permit entry if the shipment does not have a visa, or if the visa number, date of issuance, signature, category, quantity or units of quantity are missing, incorrect or illegible, or have been crossed out or altered in any way. If the quantity indicated on the visa is less than that of the shipment, entry shall not be permitted. If the quantity indicated on the visa is more than that of the shipment, entry shall be permitted and only the amount entered shall be charged to any applicable quota. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The complete name and address of a company actually involved in the manufacturing process of the textile product covered by the visa shall be provided on the textile visa document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the visa is not acceptable then a new visa must be obtained from the Government of Qatar, or a visa waiver may be issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce at the request of the Government of Qatar, and presented to the U.S. Customs Service before any portion of the shipment will be released. The waiver, if used, only waives the requirement to present a visa with the shipment. It does not waive the quota requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If import quotas are in force, U.S. Customs Service shall charge only the actual quantity in the shipment to the correct category limit. If a shipment from Qatar has been allowed entry into the commerce of the United States with either an incorrect visa or no visa, and redelivery is requested but cannot be made, U.S. Customs shall charge the shipment to the correct category limit whether or not a replacement visa or visa waiver is provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Merchandise imported for the personal use of the importer and not for resale, regardless of value, and properly marked commercial sample shipments valued at U.S.$250 or less, do not require a visa for entry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A facsimile of the visa stamp is enclosed with this letter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The actions taken concerning the Government of Qatar with respect to imports of textiles and textile products in the foregoing categories have been determined by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements to involve foreign affairs functions of the United States.

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Barcom shares dive 30p Shares of Barcom, the civil engineering and plant hire group, plunged 30p to 24p yesterday on news of a swing from profits of Pounds 757,000 to losses of Pounds 1.49m pre-tax for the six months ended March 31. First half turnover, however, improved from Pounds 13m to Pounds 15.3m. Mr John Pinckard, chairman, said there had been a 'significant setback' in the past few months. He also said there had been a need to reorganise Hawkins, the plant hire fleet acquired early in 1993. The reorganisation of Hawkins amounted to Pounds 716,000 and was taken above the line. Pre-tax profits were also affected by a rise in interest charges from Pounds 420,000 to Pounds 944,000. The 'early promise' shown by Hawkins had not been sustained and the 'anticipated profitable utilisation' of the acquired plant fleet had 'not been achieved'. Mr Pinckard said the effect of the problems encountered was exacerbated, and to a considerable extent hidden, by persistent wet weather over the winter months. Losses per share of 8.5p compared with earnings of 4.05p. The interim dividend is passed - 1.25p was paid previously. In spite of pit closures, the group's predominantly coal industry business had continued to make a positive contribution. The diversification of this business into the power generation field and to other non-British Coal customers was continuing as planned. Mr Pinckard said that with the achievement of a more balanced plant fleet and a lower level of operating costs there was a reasonable expectation that levels of business normally experienced in the summer months should result in a 'much improved' outcome in the second half.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Iraq denies plot to kill Bush The Iraqi government has denied allegations that it plotted to assassinate former US President George Bush during a visit to Kuwait last month, AP reports from Nicosia. Mr Abdul Jabbar Muhsin, President Saddam Hussein's press secretary, said Mr Bush was not worth wasting the explosives to kill him, and said the allegations were concocted to provoke another US-led attack on Iraq. Kuwait plans to try 17 suspects it claims had plotted to bomb Mr Bush when he visited the emirate on April 14-16.</p>

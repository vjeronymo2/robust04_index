			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> LOUISIANA FACILITY OPENED IN 1894;  </P> <P> LEPER COLONY CHIEF WANTS WORK TO GO ON AT NEW SITE  </P> <P> Leprosy treatment has come a long way since the days when victims of the  disfiguring disease were forcibly detained here.  </P> <P> Hansen's disease can be treated almost exclusively on an outpatient basis now,  and the director of the only leper colony in the continental United States  plans to phase out the antiquated facility set up when victims were outcasts.  </P> <P> But Dr. John C. Duffy does not intend for the work of the Gillis W. Long  Hansen's Disease Research Center to be lost as its buildings age along with its  140 permanent patients, whose average age is 65. One outgrowth of leprosy  research has led to help for diabetics, for example.  </P> <P> "Our research is outstanding, but our physical plant is a disaster," said  Duffy, citing an Office of Management and Budget study. He wants to move the  center's acute care, research and education functions to Baton Rouge.  </P> <P> The colony was opened in 1894 on a plantation when the state ferried five men  and two women up the Mississippi River under cover of night from a New Orleans  "pest house." The federal government took control in 1921 and as many as 500  permanent residents were housed there during the 1930s. Most of the 330-acre  complex of white, plantation-style buildings connected by a maze of enclosed  walkways was built during the 1930s by the Works Progress Administration.  </P> <P> "It was a very different patient population," Duffy said. "They were young,  non-immigrant and they were mainstream Americans."  </P> <P> Leprosy victims were arrested and forcibly detained here until after World War  II when drugs were found that stopped the contagiousness and progression of the  disease. Over time, fewer patients took up permanent residence.  </P> <P> The center, which has treated nearly 3,000 patients, survived when the Reagan  Administration in 1984 closed seven other hospitals operated by the U.S. Public  Health Service. The late U.S. Rep. Gillis W. Long spearheaded a drive to save  it, but federal officials suggested research be done by either the Centers for  Disease Control or the National Institutes of Health.  </P> <P> Leprosy, a bacterial infection, attacks the skin, flesh and nerves and is  characterized by scabs, deformities and eventual loss of sensation. There are  an estimated 6,000 to 10,000 U.S. cases, but up to 20 million worldwide.  </P> <P> "We will continue to receive men, women and children with this disease. It's  not an excludable disease," Duffy said. "You can have it, and you can come into  this country. Because the incubation period is sometimes six to eight years,  somebody can come into this country with no idea they have the disease."  </P> <P> Research needs to continue at the center, he said. For one thing, the work  takes hundreds of armadillos, the only nonhuman animal that gets the disease,  and "there is no room at either CDC or NIH for the armadillos."  </P> <P> "All the experts are here. They are not in Bethesda or Atlanta."  </P> <P> The center could take rental space in Baton Rouge without increasing its  $18-million annual budget, he said.  </P> <P> All major advances in leprosy treatment -- drugs, armadillo-related discoveries  and two generations of vaccines with limited effectiveness -- came from  Carville's researchers, said Duffy, who fears that research would be downgraded  if it was moved to another agency.  </P> <P> "It's one of the paradoxes of the disease that as far as scientists are  concerned, their interest is almost always elsewhere than on this disease," he  said. "It's not the kind of research for which you will win a Nobel Prize.  </P> <P> "As a result, the scientific community has paid scant attention to this  disease. There is this group that has almost, in a sense, religiously dedicated  their lives to this disease that are centered here."  </P> <P> But even the worst cases discovered today can be handled through one of 11  regional treatment centers or by private doctors. For example, a victim whose  disease progressed while he was confined in a Cambodian prison is undergoing  outpatient treatment in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Thalidomide, notorious for causing congenital birth defects, is one drug that  controls the disease. The drug of choice is diaminodiphenyl sulfone, first used  in leprosy treatment in 1941 by Dr. Guy Faget at Carville. Two other drugs --  rifampin and clofazamins -- have been tested successfully in recent years, and  research continues because the bacteria are becoming resistant to sulfone  drugs.  </P> <P> New admissions to Carville are mostly patients with reactions to the drug  treatment or have diagnostic problems. After a few weeks, they go home.  </P> <P> Research into the loss of feeling in hands and feet is being put to work for  diabetics, who often require amputations after foot injuries stemming from the  lack of sensation in their extremities.  </P> <P> About 500 diabetics have been treated here for foot problems like ulcers with  special casts that allow healing and mobility, said Dr. Charles Patout, chief  of rehabilitation. "The techniques we've developed here could reduce the number  of amputations among diabetics, about 50,000 a year, by 90%."  </P> <P> Of the diabetics treated at Carville, only two have undergone amputations.  </P> <P> Duffy would like to see more diabetics take advantage of Carville, but he  admits that the stigma of leprosy may keep many patients from coming to the  center. That is another reason to move treatment facilities to Baton Rouge.  </P></p>

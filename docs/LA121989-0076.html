			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Sears Moves to Revamp Image: Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. is ending its 10-year  association with model Cheryl Tiegs and loosening its ties to Walt Disney Co.  as the giant retailer continues its search for a winning image to revitalize  its lackluster retail business. The moves come as the Chicago-based retailer  struggles to maintain its No. 1 sales status against challengers K mart Corp.  and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Sears suffers from a weak fashion image, analysts say,  because the retailer is better known to consumers as a purveyor of tools,  appliances and automotive goods, despite a switch earlier this year to everyday  low pricing to lure back budget-conscious shoppers of all stripes.  </P></p>

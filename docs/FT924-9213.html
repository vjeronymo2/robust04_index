			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BT hangs up BT can breathe a huge sigh of relief that its investment in McCaw Cellular has been placed without gallons of red ink. McCaw increasingly looked like a cul-de-sac for BT, so it must also be satisfying that AT&amp;T's strategic thirst prompted it to pay twice the market price for BT's stake. Yet, McCaw has cost BT money once financing costs are factored in. The sale has also resurrected fears about BT's international strategy. Constrained by the regulator at home, the company has looked overseas for growth opportunities. But having set its face against minority participation in foreign privatisations, it is not clear where the large-scale opportunities lie. Nor is the company's wish to participate in the growing UK cable television and entertainment market likely to be granted in the near future. Even the purchase of the remaining 40 per cent of Cellnet or development of its systems integration business would not give BT a new strategic direction. With many of the avenues for expansion blocked, investors may start to focus on BT's cash generation. Privatised with a strong balance sheet, the company has lower gearing than most telecom companies. Indeed, with the proceeds of the McCaw stake and a strong cash inflow from operations, BT may have net cash within three years. Shareholders may put it under increasing pressure to brave the wrath of the regulator and return more of the cash, rather than sit on a pile or embark on another uncertain foreign adventure.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Jefferson Smurfit Cardboard boxes provide little shelter when the chill winds blow, as Jefferson Smurfit's 33 per cent fall in interim trading profits exemplifies. The length and severity of the current downturn have made this a paper cycle like no other. Demand in Europe and the US has remained depressed and even where volume increases have been achieved they have been more than offset by falling prices. Ireland may be picking up. The UK, though, remains anaemic, while recession in Germany and France has deepened. The supply side is little better. With the US awash with finance, even weak paper companies, which may have perished in previous downturns, have been able to refinance to keep excess capacity alive. Yet few companies have been strong enough to endure the financial pain of shutting capacity themselves. Smurfit is lucky to have its Latin American operations to keep it whistling by contributing 73 per cent of trading profits. Even here, however, conditions are likely to soften in the second half. But Smurfit is not a case of hope abandoned so much as of hope again deferred. Yesterday's 4 per cent share price fall perhaps reflects little more than lack of patience. Like all paper companies, Smurfit badly needs a firmer upswing in the economic cycle - or at least a dose of inflation. A bonus should come from the flotation of JSC, its leveraged US associate. But this, too, will have to wait for the upturn.</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RUNOFF CANDIDATE SUES OPPONENT FOR $6  MILLION  </P> <P> Long Beach City Council candidate Jim Serles has filed a $6-million libel suit  against opponent Doug Drummond, claiming Drummond defamed him with claims that  Serles struck "back room deals" and "sold his vote" while he was chairman of  the city's Planning Commission.  </P> <P> At issue is campaign literature circulated by Drummond before the April 10  election, which Serles was heavily favored to win. Drummond forced Serles into  a June runoff.  </P> <P> The literature depicted a newspaper clipping saying that Serles was under  investigation by the state Fair Political Practices Commission, when no such  article existed, the suit said. The literature also included a photo of Serles  emblazoned with the words "For Sale."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> IV. Corrections to Deficient Applications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> To be eligible for processing, an application must be received by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office no later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the date and time specified in Section II of this NOFA. The HUD State or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Area Office/Native American Programs Office will initially screen all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications and notify HAs of technical deficiencies by letter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an application has technical deficiencies, the HA will have 14  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar days from the date of the issuance of written notification to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the missing or corrected information to the HUD State or Area Office and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Native American Programs Office. Curable technical deficiencies relate only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to items that do not improve the substantive quality of the application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to the rating factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All HAs must submit corrections within 14 calendar days from the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD's letter notifying the applicant of any such deficiency. Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received after 3 p.m. local time (i.e., the time in the appropriate HUD State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or Area Office/Native American Programs Office), of the fourteenth calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day of the correction period will not be accepted and the application will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rejected as incomplete. All HAs are encouraged to review the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening checklist provided in Section III of this notice. The checklist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifies all technical requirements needed for application processing. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HA application that does not comply with the requirements of 24 CFR 882.204(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or 887.55(b) and this notice, including the drug-free workplace certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the anti-lobbying certification/disclosure requirements, after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expiration of the 14-day cure period will be rejected from processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> V.

(See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3537a) (Reform Act) was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published on May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088), and became effective on June 12,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of funding decisions are restrained by part 4 from providing advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (202) 708&hyph;3815 (TDD/Voice). (This is not a toll-free number.) The Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular subject matter can be discussed with persons outside the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department, should contact his or her HUD State or Area Office Counsel, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Headquarters counsel for the program to which the question pertains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements and prohibitions of section 319 of the Department of Interior and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the ``Byrd Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants, or loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Branches of the Federal Government in connection with specific contract,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable certification regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities in connection with the assistance. IHAs established by an Indian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not excluded from the statute's coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Section 112 of the Reform Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act added a new section 13 to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b). Section 13  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon the receipt of assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

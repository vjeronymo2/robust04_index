			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Pentos shares fall 20% after profits warning SHARES in Pentos, the specialist UK retailing group which owns Dillons bookshops, Ryman, Athena and Wilding, fell 20 per cent yesterday after the group warned that pre-tax profits this year will be 'significantly below' market expectations, and said the final dividend was under review. After the surprise profit warning, analysts cut their pre-tax profits estimates for the year ending today to about Pounds 5m, down from Pounds 15.2m last year. The stock, which was trading around the 140p level earlier this year, dropped 14p to 56p yesterday, reducing the group's market capitalisation by more than Pounds 20m. Pentos, which has expanded rapidly under its outspoken chairman, Mr Terry Maher, said the level of the final dividend 'will be considered in the light of trading at the time of the preliminary announcement in March'. Last year the group paid a final dividend of 2.05p, making a total for the year of 2.75p. Pentos blamed 'weaker than anticipated' trading during the final quarter in its office furniture manufacturing operations and the Athena poster and print business. At Athena, Christmas trading failed to match up to expectations. Sales for the full year will be about 3 per cent lower than in 1991 and profits are expected to fall by about Pounds 3m to break-even. 'Spending amongst Athena's mainly young target market remains depressed,' said Pentos. The core bookshop and office equipment businesses have continued to perform satisfactorily, with sales at Dillons up by about 4 per cent year-on-year. The group said Dillons' pre-Christmas 'cut-price' book offensive, an effort to undermine the price controls of the Net Book Agreement, had been a success. The office furniture business saw a sharp decline in orders from mid-September, and two large orders worth about Pounds 1m were delayed until 1993. As a result, these operations will post a small loss this year, compared with a trading profit of Pounds 3.7m in 1991. Steps have been taken to cut overheads by Pounds 2m in 1993. Mr Clive Gregory, who recently returned to Pentos as finance director, said reorganisation expenses, together with other non-recurring costs related to the acquisition of Hatchards in 1990, will be treated as exceptional items reducing pre-tax profits by a further Pounds 3.5m. Pentos expects to be well placed to improve profitability when consumer spending rises again. Cost reduction programmes would improve underlying performance in 1993, it said. Lex, Page 12</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Silentnight shares lose 18p on warning Shares in Silentnight Holdings fell 18p to 355p yesterday after Europe's biggest manufacturer of beds warned that its profits for the year to January 31 would be 'slightly below average market expectations'. Analysts had been forecasting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 13.5m. However, the Lancashire-based group said that its annual results on May 3 would be only marginally ahead of last year's figure of Pounds 12m. Silentnight said it intended to hold the final dividend of 5.25p, to give an unchanged total of 8p. The group said that in the UK it had maintained volume in its beds division and increased volume in cabinets, but margins had been under pressure. The previously lossmaking US business was continuing to recover, and the German subsidiary, Matthias Houben - bought in 1992 for Pounds 3.2m - was showing a very satisfactory return on investment. The group said it had been conscious of the need to inform the market at the same time that trading had been disappointing. One factor in the decision had been the Stock Exchange's recent guidance on the disclosure of price-sensitive information.</p>

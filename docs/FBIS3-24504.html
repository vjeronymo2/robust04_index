			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I.M. Okon, Yu.P. Tyumenev; UDC </F> 629.12:628.92/.97-52]    [Abstract] The Zont-M complex which generates the  helicopter landing light control system (STO) signals on a ship  or drilling rig is described. The Zont-M system generates 0.3 A,  27 V direct current signals and transmits them to the floating  drilling rig (PPBU) or ship deck and 0-10 V DC signals matched  to a 10 k_o_ load for the on-board computer. The Zont-M system  generates control signals which are proportionate to the angle  of roll within +/-10 at a 1 step, to the change in the  angle of roll, to the angle of trim within +/-5 at a 1  step, and to the change in the angle of trim, as well as a  signal indicating the a change in the direction of he vertical  linear velocity component perpendicular to the deck plane.  Operation of the system requires data on the pitching, rolling,  heaving, and yaw angles from such external sources as vertical  gyro or synchro resolver. The system ensures the necessary  accuracy (0.5 roll and trim, 0.2 m heaving, and 0.2 m/s  linear velocity component) in rough seas of up to force 5 within  a 0-40C temperature range at speeds of up to 20 knots. A  block diagram of the Zont-M system and its front panel are  cited, and the operating procedure is outlined in detail. The  system uses 150 W, 220 V, 50/60 Hz power supply, and its  electric circuits are executed on 4-mm thick 220x130 mm boards  and are splashproof. The system meets all Register  specifications.

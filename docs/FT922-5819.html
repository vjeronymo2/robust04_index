			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / US calls for joint action to control arms sales THE US administration is proposing the establishment of a multilateral co-operation council on which its western allies and its former Eastern bloc adversaries would work jointly to screen sales of sensitive technology to unstable or outlaw regimes. The plan was put forward by Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, in a letter to the foreign ministers of the 16 other western countries which belong to the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom). It is expected to be discussed at a high-level Cocom meeting in Paris next Monday and Tuesday. US concern has veered increasingly towards the need for controls on trade in weapons, military and 'dual-use' technologies to governments which are often-hostile like Iraq, Libya and North Korea. The Gulf conflict, the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the emergence of former communist governments which are now starved of hard currency, therefore might be tempted to sell off their surplus weapons, has intensified US concerns. Terming his proposal 'a major undertaking', Mr Baker envisages the co-operation council as a forum to 'engage the central and eastern European states and the former Soviet Union in a dialogue on the control of sensitive technologies'. He added that it would be modelled 'somewhat after Nato's North Atlantic Co-operation Council'. Mr Baker said the new council should provide technical assistance for the establishment of comparable export control regimes in all of the former Communist countries and to provide a forum for Cocom 'to address new strategic threats in co-operation with central and eastern Europe and the new independent states'. The co-operation council would also ease access to currently controlled western technologies to the former Soviet bloc countries. This proposal is bound to be applauded in Europe, where the US is seen as dragging its feet on export-control liberalisation, particularly for fibre optics. A US government official yesterday said fibre optics would be one of the 'issues' to be discussed next week. 'The co-operation council will provide an effective forum for consultation, collaboration and reform,' Mr Baker said.</p>

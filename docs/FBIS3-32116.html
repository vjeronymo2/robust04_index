Frejolito's central proposal is that the  United Left should become a party. This means eliminating the  United Left's various factions, reorienting its socialist  discourse with neatly Peruvian -- "Mariateguist," as he put it  -- foundations, and leaving aside the dogmas of Moscow or  Beijing. The leaders of the party, at all levels, should be  elected democratically by grassroots committees.    A few days ago, PAP [Aprista Party of Peru] Secretary  General  Armando Villanueva del Campo hinted at the possibility of  creating a "popular front" between APRA [American Popular  Revolutionary Alliance] and the leftist parties. Observers  believe that Frejolito could well be the candidate of this  alliance.</p>

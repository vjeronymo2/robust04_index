			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Lull in Sarajevo fighting THERE was a lull in fighting around Sarajevo, the capital of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia Hercegovina, ahead of peace talks today in Lisbon, the seat of the European Community presidency, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. EC negotiators say the resumption of talks among the leaders of Bosnia's 4.35m Moslems, Serbs and Croats is contingent on a stable ceasefire. About 300 people have been killed and some 2,000 wounded in the fighting over Bosnian independence. However, fighting was reported yesterday in Zvornik, eastern Bosnia, as well as in the north and west of the region.</p>

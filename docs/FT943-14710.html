			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Observer: Maximum factors Nelson Mandela has probably been waiting for this all his life. The final accolade; the ultimate triumph; the crowning glory. He is - wait for it - 'the international figure with the highest Factor X rating'. Admittedly, he still comes below Haagen-Dazs (an ice-cream), Sol (a beer), Jack Nicholson (an actor) and the Scottish Highlands (a geographic location). But he beats Hillary Clinton (a lawyer), Body Shop (a perfumier) and Nintendo (a torture). What precisely is 'Factor X'? Mazda Cars (UK) has found itself with time on its hands from selling cars and decided to commission a piece of unusually profound market research. 'In order better to understand what consumers were saying about Mazda, we needed to clarify two things: what 'a Nineties feel' is, and what other things, people and places have it,' says the company. So Mazda bought the services of a social psychologist to interpret some 'qualitative research group discussions'. This has given rise to some startling insights. 'Something with Factor X certainly has 'je ne sais quoi' and has undoubtedly got 'it'.' Beyond that, not much. Mazda tells us sausages have least Factor X of all food, while Essex is bottom of the list for places. Funnily enough, Mazda is narrowly beaten into second place (by Mercedes) in the top 10 list for cars, with poor old Ford at the bottom.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> IRAQ PRIVATIZING TOURIST TRADE  </P> <P> Iraq, home of some of the world's oldest archeological sites, is turning to the  private sector to spark a tourist boom after eight years of war with Iran.  </P> <P> As part of a drive to loosen rigorous state control of the economy, the  official press has said major hotels and almost all state-run tourist firms  will be sold off in whole or part.  </P> <P> Al-Iraq daily quoted tourism commission chief Abdul-Tawab al Mullah Huwaish as  saying 38 tourist enterprises will be offered in their entirety to Iraqi and  other Arab companies.  </P> <P> A 51% stake in 36 other firms would be sold off, he said, and to ensure their  freedom from state control, no government representatives would sit on their  boards.  </P> <P> Babylon, Sumer and Ur are among a string of ancient sites that could be big  tourist draws after the August cease-fire with Iran.  </P> <P> Since President Saddam Hussein launched a privatization campaign more than a  year ago, more than 50 state-owned enterprises, including farms,  food-processing plants and light industrial projects, have been privatized.  </P> <P> The tourist commission said last week that 51% of the 21-story Baghdad Sheraton  hotel is to be offered to private investors and run by a company with capital  of 50 million dinars ($160 million).  </P></p>

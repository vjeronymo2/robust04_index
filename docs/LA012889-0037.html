			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER WARFARE  </P> <P> The state Water Resources Control Board has prudently retreated from a flawed  staff proposal that would have guided California's most critical  water-allocation decisions into the 21st Century. In doing so, the board has  given itself six months in which to revise the plan so that it provides a sound  technical basis for increased water needs of fish and wildlife while  accommodating the conflicting demands of all other California interests.  </P> <P> Doing both things at once will be difficult. It will become impossible unless  the board better substantiates the need for a proposed increase of water for  fish life in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and provides a more equitable  allocation of what is left over.  </P> <P> The release of the proposal has re-ignited the north-south water battle with  special fury, demonstrating that the line between consensus on California water  issues and trench warfare is a thin one. Southern California interests served  by the Metropolitan Water District and the state Water Project claimed with  justification that the new water plan punished them unfairly. Project customers  would be limited to less than 800,000 acre-feet of water a year from the delta,  compared with the original promise of more than 2 million acre-feet. One  acre-foot provides for the residential use of two average families per year, or  enough to irrigate a third of an acre of cotton.  </P> <P> Northern Californians were delighted by the idea of absolute limits on the  south's imports at less than current levels. Now that the board has agreed to  drop its proposed limits, the north is claiming that the door is open to more  giveaways of the north's water. That is not necessarily so. The environmental  health of the delta is vital to all of California. There are many ways of  maintaining the delta's integrity without such wrenching upheaval of the  Southern California water system.  </P> <P> The controversy involves the board's periodic review of water-quality standards  for the delta -- the estuary that produces about 40% of California's  irrigation, municipal and industrial water. In three phases stretching over  several years, the board is expected to set new water-quality standards that  will determine how much the state and federal water projects can pump from the  delta.  </P> <P> The courts have given the board extraordinary powers to protect the  environment, but also have admonished the agency to balance natural needs  against other public interests. In its report, the staff dictated unprecedented  conservation of water in Southern California, more even than in past droughts,  without suggesting in detail just how that was to be achieved. The south's  sacrifice in part would benefit salt-sensitive bean crops on delta islands with  little comparable conservation by farmers along the Sacramento and San Joaquin  rivers. Upstream farm use would grow to more than 11 million acre-feet by the  year 2010, compared with 4.1 million acre-feet for what it deemed to be  "reasonable" urban use in all of Southern California. The report ignored a  considerable body of opinion that agricultural water needs in fact will decline  over the years.  </P> <P> The staff's major aim was to provide more water in the delta to reverse the  decline in salmon and striped-bass populations. The delta has been damaged, but  the staff failed to provide technical data to support its conclusion that  pumping was the primary cause. It vaguely said that "something must be done  now, even if all the reasons for the decline are not known" and that "a safe  level of exports is not known."  </P> <P> The controversy has resurrected the give-no-quarter mode of the water debate.  In opposing the staff plan, which it must, the Metropolitan Water District is  being branded in the north as a greedy monolith. The fact is that MWD has made  major advances in supplementing its water supplies in innovative ways without  drawing on further water from the delta. While more can be done, Southern  California has made considerable progress in saving water. As for delta  protection, there already are limits on export pumping and a variety of laws to  safeguard the environment.  </P> <P> The board's credibility will be at stake during coming months. Even if it  ultimately delivers a Solomon-like decision, the agency will suffer political  attack and legal challenge. Critics will be able to demagogue the issue because  it is so complicated and because water issues are decided by such a close-knit  fraternity in California -- mostly white males who are lawyers and engineers.  </P> <P> The California water world needs to be demystified, and now is the time. The  outcome of these hearings over the next two years will affect every California  citizen and community for decades. Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative  leaders should consider appointing a committee of respected citizens -- not  water experts -- to monitor the hearings. The group should represent the entire  state, but be of workable size. It would report to the public from time to time  as members best see fit. If nothing else, the committee might help to dispel  the myths that always cloud such water battles. The war-weary water world could  benefit from a little sunshine and common sense.  </P></p>

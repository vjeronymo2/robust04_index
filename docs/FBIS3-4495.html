Li made the remarks when meeting with a U.S. delegation of  the committee of 100, headed by 76-year-old renowned architect  I.M. Pei, the committee's governor.    Li said that both China and the United States are big  countries and their relations have an impact not only in various  fields of both countries, but also on the peace, development and  stability of the world as a whole.    Therefore, he said, leaders of both China and the United  States should carefully handle relations between the two  countries, with a highly responsible attitude.    He said that both China and the U.S. share common  understanding and cooperation, and also have differences.    Yet from the viewpoint of the process of the development of  bilateral relations, differences and opposition are reducing in  a winding way, while the common understanding and cooperation  are growing though in a difficult way, he said.    To develop bilateral ties is the will of the peoples of the  two nations and is in accordance with the trend of history as  well, he said, adding: "We are fully confident about the  prospect of the Sino-U.S. relations."    Li noted that many members of the committee are well-known  Americans of the Chinese origin. "There is no doubt that you  expect a powerful China, and of course a powerful United States  since you are living there," Li said, adding that he believed in  their sincere hope for a closer Sino-U.S. relationship.    The CPPCC chairman also voiced appreciation and thanks for  the great efforts that the committee has made for the promotion  of Sino- U.S. relations, and hoped that it will continue to do  more for the further development of such relations.    I.M. Pei said that they are delighted to see China's  achievement in its reforms and opening up, and that his  committee is willing to make contributions to the development of  Sino-U.S. relations.</p>

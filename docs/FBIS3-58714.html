If you see a French soldier  in Muellheim, likewise. Both soldiers will be incorrectly  dressed, according to national norms. And yet, the sartorial  oddities indirectly represent what enthusiasts believe could  become an important pillar of a future European defence policy.    Muellheim, in what is known as  Dreilaendereck--Three-Countries-Corner, where France, Germany  and Switzerland meet--contained a French garrison, as part of  the Allied troop presence, until German unity in 1990. Now the  barracks provide a home for the Franco-German brigade, where the  two nations work together, on a daily basis, under alternating  French and German command. The Franco-German brigade, in turn,  is part of the newly-inaugurated Eurocorps, whose commanders  hope that it could be the shape of things to come.    Blending the visual differences between the two armies has  been just one of the tasks facing brigade commanders. It was  agreed, for example, that Germans in Eurocorps should wear the  dark-blue French beret; but the French, in the spirit of  Euro-compromise, were told to wear their berets on the left  (Germanstyle) instead of on the right. (There is no single  Eurocorps uniform, "for the moment"). More seriously, there is  the question of how to standardise equipment.    Language is a challenge, too: the 4,500 members of the  Franco-German brigade are all supposed to speak each other's  languages. Thus, in theory, a French soldier addresses his  German colleagues in German, while the Germans reply in French.  This counsel of perfection soon breaks down. Thus, at the  guard-post in Muellheim, a German conscript admits that he  always speaks German with his French colleagues, since his  French is too poor. At Eurocorps headquarters in Strasbourg,  across the border from Muellheim, a German soldier greets the  visitor's excusez moi request for directions with a sheepish "I  am sorry, do you speak German?"    Already, Eurocorps is growing beyond its Franco-German  embryo. Belgium has signed up--though it caused some  consternation when the country's Defence Minister announced that  Flemish should be an official Eurocorps language (under a  complicated compromise, documents above a certain level will  probably be translated into Flemish, but Flemish will be ignored  in daily use). In Strasbourg, Belgians, French and Germans now  work side by side, under a single command.    Now the Spanish are ready to join: two liaison officers are  in the Eurocorps headquarters, and Spain's formal participation  is expected this year. Already, there are five flags on  Eurocorps desks: the four participating countries, plus the  gold-star Euro-flag. There have been expressions of interest  from further afield, too. Poland, which had the door shut in  its face by NATO this week, has asked if it might be allowed to  join the Eurocorps family (answer: don't call us, we'll call  you).    Gradually, the Eurocorps is moving from rhetoric to reality.  As of this month, Eurocorps commanders say that it is ready to  take on humanitarian missions. From July, it will officially be  ready for military missions. By 1995, it is due to have 40,000  men at its disposal.    Not all, however, are impressed. Britain regards Eurocorps  as mere Franco-German hot air, and has been keen, instead, to  sell the idea of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), under  British command and within existing NATO structures. One  difference between the two bodies is that the US plays an  important role in ARRC, but not in Eurocorps. The Eurocorps  commander, General Helmut Willmann, argues: "I am convinced  that ARRC has an important role within NATO--but the Eurocorps  is also necessary. The Eurocorps can react when the Americans  don't want to be involved. That's the most important thing."  He insists: "Eurocorps doesn't weaken NATO--it strengthens  NATO."    Crucially, Eurocorps--dreamed up by Chancellor Helmut Kohl  and President Francois Mitterrand in 1991--has what General  Willmann calls "a political dimension, which goes beyond the  framework of NATO". It is answerable to the West European  Union--which is, in turn, the would-be defence arm of the  European Union. Colonel Daniel Bruss, of the Franco-German  brigade, argues that Britain, by being so unenthusiastic, is out  of step with developments: "Britain doesn't want to take part  in Eurocorps. But Britain is part of Europe, too."    There are still arguments over how the corps might be used,  let alone how big it might eventually become. Some suggest that  a co-ordinated European mission might have been appropriate in  Somalia, if Eurocorps had been working last year. Bosnia, too,  is the kind of conflict where, in theory, Eurocorps could play a  role. Here, however, an old problem involving Germany arises,  hampering much military planning. The Bonn government has,  because of Germany's own history, ruled out the use of German  troops in former Yugoslavia. Indeed, German politicians are  still arguing over whether German soldiers should be allowed to  take part even in humanitarian actions abroad--let alone whether  they should be allowed to shoot. In the understated words of  one German officer in Muellheim: "The French have less hang-ups  about the armed forces than we Germans do."    The British argue, not very sotto voce, that the Eurocorps  uses up much money that would be better spent elsewhere in NATO.  Defenders of Eurocorps insist, however, that its time will yet  come. General Willmann says: "We're creating an instrument of  joint European security and defence policy... I'm absolutely  confident that we will achieve our goal."</p>

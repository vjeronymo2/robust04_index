			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Washington accord and the course of the Vienna  talks give us every reason to believe that the senseless war  between the Croats and the Bosniaks is finally over; whatever  ensues, the fact remains that this accord has saved lives. This  was underlined by U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith at  a news conference in Zagreb. He also dwelt on how the agreement  is reflected in the situation in the field in Bosnia-Herzegovina  and spoke on other points of interest.    The accord opens doors to a more comprehensive agreement  between the Croats and the Bosniaks, which is being discussed in  Vienna, and to an overall, peaceful solution, he assessed. On  the basis of NATO's ultimatum and the Washington accord, and in  collaboration with the European Union, we are determined to give  the people of this region a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic  future, Galbraith stressed.    President Clinton's Special Envoy Charles Redman said that  work on further rapprochement between the Bosnian Croats and  Bosniaks lies ahead, as well as work on the improvement of the  humanitarian situation in Bosnia. He pointed to the significant  changes in the field in Bosnia compared to the situation three  or four weeks ago. He said these changes encourage hope for  great possibilities for reaching a solution. An important step  to be taken is to include the Bosnian Serbs, because a  comprehensive agreement cannot be reached without their  participation, Redman said. He stressed that his visit to  Belgrade yesterday, when he met Milosevic and Bosnian Serb  officials, was a preliminary step. I explained what we have  accomplished so far and what we hope to accomplish, he added.    Assessing as productive and constructive yesterday's  meetings  with President Tudjman, Minister Granic, and other Croatian  Government officials, ambassadors Galbraith and Redman  underlined their positive and constructive role.    Asked about guarantees for the integration of the  UN-protected areas, Redman said he believed this process is  creating conditions for a stable situation in the region, not  only for peace in Bosnia, and providing better ways for  resolving the remaining issues -- including the UN-protected  zones in Croatia.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY  </P> <P> The South Bay is likely to have some of the cleanest garages in town today,  thanks to the city of Los Angeles' Household Hazardous Waste Roundup on  Saturday.  </P> <P> At the end of the six-hour roundup in Harbor City, more than 1,000 residents  had dropped off hundreds of containers of paint, used motor oil, insecticides  and other hazardous materials.  </P> <P> With state voter approval of Proposition 65 in 1986, it became illegal to  dispose of hazardous materials in household trash, according to city spokesman  Tony Harris. Toxic materials could contaminate landfills where trash is  deposited and eventually seep into the public water supply, he said.  </P> <P> The parking lot at Narbonne High School was transformed into a huge collection  site on Saturday. About 100 workers, including city refuse crews, employees of  the city's toxic-waste consulting firm and volunteers, were dressed in  protective garb and glasses to collect the materials. Scores of bags of kitty  litter were on hand to absorb spills.  </P> <P> Among the participants was Lance Coffey of San Pedro, who dropped off a  55-gallon container of used motor oil collected by his neighborhood. "I have a  truck, so I got to make the delivery," he said cheerfully.  </P> <P> Robert Bisbee of Harbor City got rid of a 10-year accumulation of paint, used  motor oil and garden insecticides Saturday and said he was relieved to dispose  of it in a safe and legal way. "I'm getting ready to move, so when I heard  about this event I cleaned out everything," he said.  </P> <P> The Harbor City roundup was the fifth of eight planned by the city this year.  At the first four, more than 5,000 households disposed of 13,000 gallons of  paint, 9,000 gallons of motor oil and 500 batteries, Harris said. Usable paint  is recycled for graffiti removal programs, and motor oil and battery parts also  can be recycled, he said.  </P> <P> Poisonous and other nonrecyclable materials are sent to licensed toxic-disposal  sites in Santa Barbara and Kern counties, according to Jim Grant of Safety  Specialists Inc., the firm the city hired to help conduct the roundups and  dispose of toxic materials.  </P> <P> Three more roundups will be held in other areas of Los Angeles. Then the Los  Angeles City Council will decide whether to continue the pilot program or set  up permanent sites, Harris said.  </P></p>

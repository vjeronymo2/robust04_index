			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CHINA CUTTING INTEREST RATES  </P> <P> China's central bank announced today it will cut interest rates on loans and  deposits beginning Tuesday to try to stimulate a sluggish economy.  </P> <P> The reduction, said by a People's Bank of China spokesman to average 1.08  percentage points, was the second drop in the cost of borrowing this year.  </P> <P> Rates fell by an average of 1.26 percentage points in March.  </P> <P> "The reduction of interest rates will help reduce the burden on enterprises,  reduce costs and stimulate the market," the official New China News Agency  quoted the spokesman as saying.  </P> <P> Actual rates were not published. Economists said they ranged widely, from about  7% for short-term deposits up to about 10%. Loans are generally slightly  cheaper.  </P> <P> The economy is showing "a favorable trend" but markets are slack, stockpiles of  unsold products are large and industrial efficiency is still low, the spokesman  said.  </P></p>

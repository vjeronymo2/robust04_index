			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- Japan's foreign exchange  reserves were up 172 million dollars in December from the  preceding month, totaling 95.59 billion dollars, the Finance  Ministry said Wednesday [5 January]. The rise follows  November's increase of 195 million dollars from October. As a  matter of policy, Finance Ministry officials do not provide  detailed reasons for changes in the nation's foreign exchange  reserves.    Foreign exchange reserves consist of foreign currencies,  gold, and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) at the International  Monetary Fund.    According to the latest monthly data available, Japan  appears  to have kept its position as the largest foreign exchange holder  as its reserves were 95.2 billion dollars at the end of October.    Taiwan came second with 85.6 billion dollars, followed by  Germany with 82.2 billion dollars and the United States with  77.8 billion dollars. Statistics for Taiwan were those at the  end of September.    In 1993 as a whole, the nation's foreign exchange reserves  increased by 26.9 billion dollars, the first increase in five  years and the second largest annual increase following the 39.2  billion dollar rise in 1987.    During the year, the dollar traded in Tokyo in a range  between 100.40 yen and 125.95 yen as the yen picked up upward  momentum last summer to prompt the Bank of Japan to buy dollars  for yen to stem the yen's upswing.    The central bank's dollar-buying intervention serves to push  up foreign exchange reserves, although monetary authorities  usually do not confirm such intervention.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Christopher heads for Mideast to strengthen ceasefire MR Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, prepared to set out for the Middle East yesterday as Israeli tanks and troops crossed back into northern Israel and thousands of Lebanese refugees began the trek back to villages bombed for a week. Mr Christopher, who is due in Egypt today before travelling to Syria, Jordan and Israel, will be trying to strengthen the fragile ceasefire in southern Lebanon, reached over the weekend, and seeking to revive the stalled peace negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbours. US officials were in no doubt about the difficulties faced by Mr Christopher and the extent to which his task had been complicated by the week-long Israeli attacks on Lebanon which killed more than 130 civilians, wounded at least 500 and drove an estimated 250,000 people from their homes. The ceasefire, which came into effect on Saturday after a series of telephone calls by Mr Christopher to the region's leaders, held yesterday apart from one minor skirmish. But as civilians began returning to the south, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrilla group, pledged that the fighting would continue as long as Israel continued its occupation. While appearing to rule out further rocket attacks on Israel itself, if Israel did not resume its bombardment, the Hizbollah leader indicated that further military action in the south of Lebanon was likely. 'There was no comprehensive ceasefire agreement with the Israelis,' he said. 'All options remain open because there was no agreement.' Mr Rafik al-Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, said yesterday that the only way to remove the threat of Hizbollah was for Israel to commit itself to a full withdrawal from the south of his country. Once Israel did that then there would be no need for a resistance force, he said. But Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, was reported to have told a cabinet meeting yesterday that the so-called 'security zone' in southern Lebanon had to be strengthened. He also claimed that Israel's week-long military action had created 'a more propitious background for the renewal of the peace talks'. His view is not shared by Arab foreign ministers who on Saturday concluded a two-day meeting in Damascus at which they expressed their solidarity with Lebanon and promised Dollars 500m (Pounds 336m) to help repair war damage.

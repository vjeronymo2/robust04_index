			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ACTOR'S ILLNESS CANCELS A 'SWEET SORROW' SHOW  </P> <P> The Hull Truck Theatre Company, a visiting British ensemble, was forced to  cancel Alan Plater's "Sweet Sorrow" in mid-performance during a Saturday  matinee at the Irvine Barclay when one of the actors became ill.  </P> <P> During the play's second act, Jeffrey Robert indicated to the audience that he  could not continue performing and left the stage, according to Barclay  President Douglas Rankin.  </P> <P> Robert was rushed by paramedics to Irvine Medical Center with symptoms that  "sounded like an impending heart attack," Rankin said Monday. Rankin said the  actor was admitted to the hospital for observation and released Sunday after  his symptoms were diagnosed as resulting from "low blood sugar."  </P> <P> Although the Saturday evening performance was canceled, Rankin said, the last  two performances of the company's engagement took place on Sunday as scheduled.  </P> <P> Like the other actors, Robert portrayed multiple roles in "Sweet Sorrow," a  play about the late British poet Philip Larkin.

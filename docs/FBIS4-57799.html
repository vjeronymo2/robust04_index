			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo, 24 May (AE) -- A luncheon hosted by Sao  Paulo State Federation of Industries [FIESP] leaders for U.S.  Treasury Assistant Secretary Lawrence Summers and Finance  Minister Rubens Ricupero has just ended. The business people  voiced satisfaction with the support shown by Summers for the  Brazilian stabilization program.    Businessman Luiz Fernando Burlan of the Sadia Company said:  "Summers came here as a U.S. Government representative and it is  our impression that it is truly committed to Brazil. I for one  was surprised by the way in which he conveyed the U.S. support  for the plan."    Businessman Antonio Ermirio de Moraes said: "Summers has  demonstrated that he has confidence in the plan."    Most of the business people who attended the luncheon ruled  out the possibility of an outburst of consumption in the short  term.</p>

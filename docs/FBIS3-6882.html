			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Japan New Party [JNP] is in growing turmoil  over the recent agreement between the JNP and Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] to form a joint parliamentary grouping. Many JNP  members still maintain that a parliamentary grouping with  Shinseito--which is associated with shady Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] factional politics--as a partner will only undermine  the JNP's public image, while others are concerned that this may  lead to the breaking off of fraternal relations dating to the  start of the Hosokawa administration with Sakigake [Harbinger],  with which the JNP has agreed to enter into a merger in the  future. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa merely told Toshio  Yamaguchi, former minister of labor, who visited him at his  official residence on 17 March, that "I will watch future  developments closely." This circumspection is believed to be in  consideration of the agitation in his own home camp.    There has been a rush of expressions of discontent or  concern, particularly among young JNP Diet members, over the  emerging plan for the JNP and Shinseito to form a joint  parliamentary group. Some say: "Even if the Diet members  agree, what will the party members say?" Others claim: "If  there should be a heated debate in the party, the prime  minister's leadership will again be called into question. In  the first place, it is anomalous that the other party leaders  have not been informed."    As JNP's relationship with Sakigake falls into disarray, JNP  Diet members say: "When we go home to our constituencies, our  supporters cheer us up and tell us 'carry on with your  cooperation with Sakigake'." Within the party itself, the  prevailing opinion is that the new group should at least consist  of Shinseito, JNP, and Sakigake.    A heated debate took place at the meeting of JNP Diet  members  on 17 March. One Dietman said, "Since we are a political party,  decisions should be made by the proper organs. The decision to  create a new-new party [shin shinto] with Sakigake was a policy  adopted by the proper authorities." Another stated: "If this  policy is to be changed, there will be a struggle between two  lines."    About 10 young JNP lower house members led by Yuichi Takami  also met in Tokyo on the evening of 17 March into the early  hours of 18 March to discuss how to deal with the realignment of  political parties. This shows how seriously the JNP is  distressed by the issue of forming a bigger parliamentary group.    Regarding the proposed joint parliamentary group, the new  JNP  leadership also claims that, "It is not the prime minister's  strategy to ally only with Shinseito. Such a claim is  groundless." "What we have decided so far is to create a policy  study group across party boundaries." The JNP leadership headed  by Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka made it a point to explain  at the joint standing committee meeting with Sakigake on 17  March that "[The proposal] came from Shinseito; we are not  involved in this."    However, Shinseito's Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa had met  with all JNP members of both houses of the Diet as of 16 March.  [During these meetings] Ozawa criticized Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura implicitly, saying "It is  ridiculous that someone who does not have a clear concept of the  state should advocate a so-called theory of the state." He  argued that "the ruling coalition parties should join hands and  work in unity under the leadership of Mr. Hosokawa."    Nevertheless, some JNP members have a favorable impression  of  Ozawa. They say, "Mr. Ozawa's conviction that Japan should be  changed came across quite saliently."    On the other hand, there are also objections to Ozawa's  remark at a meeting with JNP Diet members on the evening of 16  March that "(Shinseito) will be capable of nominating candidates  for all 300 single-seat constituencies (on its own)." JNP  members commented that "this is like being threatened with a  dagger pointed at your throat."    JNP members are beginning to feel that "perhaps the top  leaders of the two parties are planning to form an alliance  immediately" (according to a senior JNP official). Since the  prime minister is the only viable symbol of the party, party  officials admit that "the party will move in the direction the  prime minister wishes." However, other party members also  predict that "if there is no persuasive explanation on our  relationship with Sakigake, some Diet members may purposely opt  for the difficult way out."</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NWOKOLO, STILL CHASING FIGHT LEGACY, TRIES TO GET ON TRACK  </P> <P> He came out of Africa three years ago with a flashy name, a flashy record and  bright hopes.  </P> <P> He was born Charles Nwokolo, the nephew of Dick Tiger, who rose from poverty to  win fame and fortune as a boxer. Tiger was the son of a poor Nigerian chicken  farmer who won the world middleweight and light heavyweight championships  before dying at 42 of liver cancer in 1971.  </P> <P> Nwokolo decided to assume his uncle's legacy. And his name.  </P> <P> He left Nigeria with a 14-0 record, 12 by knockout, and the welterweight  championship of Africa, and settled in Hollywood as Young Dick Tiger.  </P> <P> But in the ensuing years, he hasn't quite lived up to the professional  standards of old Dick Tiger. Nwokolo is just 12-8 with five knockouts since  coming to America. His past two fights have been title shots and he has lost  both.  </P> <P> In May, he dropped a 12-round decision in London to Glenwood Brown in a  Continental Americas welterweight championship fight. In June, Nwokolo fought  for the United States Boxing Assn. junior middleweight title but lost a  12-round decision to Art Serwano in San Jose.  </P> <P> Some fighters, having failed in two title fights in two months, might take time  off to rethink their game plan, reassess their lives.  </P> <P> Not Nwokolo.  </P> <P> He went right back to the gym and, on Tuesday, will be right back in the ring  for the 10-round main event at The Country Club in Reseda.  </P> <P> His opponent will be junior middleweight Ruben Villaman (26-13-1, 23 knockouts)  of Tijuana.  </P> <P> Also on Tuesday's card will be middleweights Ray McElroy (5-0, four knockouts)  of Long Beach and Robert Carson (6-2-2, three knockouts) of Hawthorne in an  eight-rounder, and welterweights Stuart Baynes (9-10, five knockouts) of  Pasadena and Carlton Brooks (10-6-2, three knockouts) of Los Angeles in another  eight-rounder.  </P> <P> The card begins at 7:30 p.m.  </P></p>

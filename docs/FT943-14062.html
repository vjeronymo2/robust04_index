			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Pledge of no more cuts in defence The government insisted yesterday that this week's defence cuts would not be followed by more reductions in the near future, but the pledge was met by a sceptical reaction from the opposition parties. Government officials said that following Thursday's announcement of more than 18,000 job losses the Ministry of Defence would not be a target in the forthcoming public round of expenditure negotiations, which cover the period up to 1996. They stressed that the Pounds 2.4bn procurement package set out this week by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, would not have been feasible unless he was was confident that he would not be asked by the Treasury for further cuts. Mr Rifkind yesterday signed a Pounds 1.1bn contract with the defence company Vickers for 259 Challenger-2 tanks, which he said 'demonstrates that the fighting strength of the armed forces is being continually increased'. Mr David Clark, the Labour defence spokesman, said he doubted the government's ability to meet its stated defence commitments, even after Thursday's announcements, which are intended to trim spending by Pounds 750m a year from 1996-97 onwards. Mr Clark said the gap between commitments and available funding could rise to Pounds 3bn in 1997-98 and Pounds 3.5bn the year after. He suspected that more cuts were planned. Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said there were 'significant omissions' in the procurements announced. He said the armed forces' need for support and attack helicopters, and for fresh or upgraded transport aircraft, was more urgent than the tanks, ships and submarines Mr Rifkind pledged to buy. In Fife MPs, union leaders and councillors yesterday launched the Minesweepers for Rosyth campaign. The base is set to close as an operational dock for Royal Navy ships, with the loss of 700 jobs. Minesweepers and fishery protection ships are to be moved elsewhere and the loss of 1,500 service personnel will hit the local economy. The base will be kept open with more than 900 jobs - about two-thirds civilian - because of a continuing need for other operations at the base, including support for the adjoining royal dockyard. Along with the demand to keep minesweepers at Rosyth, the campaign will lobby for extra financial resources for the Fife region. In Exeter about 200 workers at a naval stores depot staged a walk-out in protest at the depot's proposed closure.</p>

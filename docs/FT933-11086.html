			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Major stands firm on plans for fuel VAT MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday ruled out a retreat from the government's plans to impose value added tax on domestic fuel in the wake of the Conservative party's humiliating defeat in the Christchurch by-election. As Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats celebrated their biggest post-war victory over the Conservatives, senior ministers acknowledged that the controversial tax had played a large part in the loss of the once-safe Dorset seat. A Tory majority of 23,015 in last year's general election was turned into a 16,427-vote Liberal Democrat margin. Mr Major's comments came as a victory for the government in the High Court against a challenge to ratification of the Maastricht treaty offered a glimmer of good news on an otherwise miserable day. Lord Rees-Mogg is considering whether to appeal but ministers are confident the judgment will be sustained. In an attempt to forestall a threatened Tory backbench revolt over tax policy, Mr Major insisted that he would not be deflected from tough measures to reduce public borrowing. He said: 'We need to get the country down to low inflation. We've done that. We need to get the finances right. We're in the process of doing that. We need to make sure the country gets back into growth. That's now happening.' The prime minister then ruled out a U-turn, stressing: 'I am not going to be deflected from those difficult decisions. I am not going to reconsider the policy on VAT on fuel.' His stance did nothing to defuse opposition calls for the tax to be scrapped or delayed, with some Tory MPs echoing demands that the second stage of implementation - due in 1995 - should be abandoned. Senior ministers acknowledged that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would have to offset the impact of higher fuel costs with generous compensation for those on low incomes and the elderly. The by-election defeat has severely limited Mr Clarke's room for manoeuvre in the November Budget. Some ministers are arguing that any further tax increases must be restricted to reducing the tax allowances of those on high incomes. With the massive defection of Conservative voters in Christchurch rekindling speculation about a possible challenge to Mr Major's leadership, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, led a concerted attempt to emphasise that economic revival would soon bring a recovery in the prime minister's fortunes. Mr Hurd admitted the government needed to do better in the way it dealt with the difficult questions: 'We have to listen, to decide, to persuade - and we have to improve our performance on all three.' Mr Clarke, who reinforced the prime minister's determination not to drop VAT on fuel, added that the government had to deliver 'competent government' with an agenda that met the concerns of the electorate. Mr Ashdown said that by giving the Liberal Democrats such a success the voters of Christchurch had let out 'a shout of rage' for the people of Britain about the government's policies. He echoed the words of Mrs Diana Maddock, the winning candidate, to the prime minister: 'Change your policies or get ready to change your job.'

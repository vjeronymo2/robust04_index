			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Dentists' fees THE FEES earned by UK dentists for treating national health service (NHS) patients today fall by seven per cent. In retaliation, the dentists have voted for a partial withdrawal from NHS work. Unhappiness over the terms of the current contract under which most dentists work has already started an exodus from NHS dentistry in some areas. This now looks likely to spread. The government says that the fee cuts are needed because dentists are earning more than the target net income set by their pay review body. Dentists have succeeded in signing up many more patients than anticipated when setting the fees. However, the cuts send out an unfortunate signal about the government's commitment to relating rewards to performance. And given the value of preventive dentistry in improving dental health, it is doubly unfortunate that the cuts are implemented on the same day as the white paper on improving the nation's health is to be published. Ministers' response to the gathering crisis has been to promise a fundamental review of dentists' remuneration, a move which is long overdue. It would examine criticisms that the current contract undervalues preventive work. It should also look at regional differences in costs such as salaries, rents and other overheads, so that dentists' income for NHS work bears some relation to their expenses. More radical options should also be explored. Some work currently available free or subsidised on the NHS is mainly cosmetic, with little value in health terms. And with most adults already paying 75 per cent of the cost of NHS treatment, charging them the full cost should be explored to release resources for improving incentives for dentists to sign up the 25m unregistered people and offer them regular checks. The sooner Mrs Bottomley gets her review under way the better for those who rely on the NHS for dental treatment. Meanwhile, dentists should put their threat of partial withdrawal from NHS work on hold until that review is completed.</p>

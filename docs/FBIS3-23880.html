			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Lukashov: "Milli Mejlis Demands </F> Resignation of President of Tatariya; Congress Opposes Elections  to Federal Assembly of Russia"]    [Text] Last weekend, the 2nd special kurultay (congress) of  the Tatar people was held in Kazan, drawing around 400 delegates  from various regions of Russia and the CIS, but primarily from  Tatariya.    The congress was an "expanded variant" of the Milli Mejlis,  the national parliament, which aspires to the role of expressor  of the interests of all the Tatar people. Anyone who bothered to  show up, fill out a form and receive a mandate could become a  delegate.    The task of the congress was to elect a new membership and  chairman (reis) of the Milli Mejlis. The previous chairman,  Talgat Abdullin, had been given the position of chief  administrator of the newly created semi-state bank, "Ak bars."  The national parliament handled this task without any  significant problems: A membership of the Milli Mejlis  consisting of 25 persons was elected, and the rather well-known  Fauziya Bayramova, leader of the Tatar party for national  independence, "Ittifak," became the chairman.    Here, at the congress, Ms. Bayramova was given her first  task: To begin collecting signatures demanding "to hold a  referendum on the independence of the Republic of Tatarstan."    Without a doubt, this decision was a reaction to the 15  February signing of the agreement between Kazan and Moscow,  which was evaluated as a "tragedy of the Tatar people" and a  "betrayal of the interests of our children." In this connection,  the new chairman announced that those who had signed the  agreement for Tatariya (President Shaymiyev and Prime Minister  Sabirov--SEGODNYA) did not have the authority to give their  signatures, since they had not asked the opinion of the people.  "As of 15 February, Shaymiyev is not president for us. And in  general, the institution of the presidency in Tatarstan must be  abolished," said Ms. Bayramova. The delegates to the congress  also did not agree with references to the fact that the  agreement had been signed in accordance with the constitutions  of Russia and Tatariya. "We have no other constitution except  the Koran," it was heard from the podium. Moreover, it was  specified that the Constitution of Russia "is irrelevant here,"  since "as of 1552 (the time of taking of Kazan by the forces of  Ivan the Terrible--SEGODNYA), we have been in a state of war  with Russia."    An appeal was adopted calling for the citizens of the  "sovereign state of Tatarstan" not to participate in the  elections to the Federal Assembly of the "neighboring state of  Russia" which were scheduled for 13 March, so as to demonstrate  their disagreement with the signing of the agreement. And  generally, in the opinion of deputies of the Milli Mejlis, the  time has come "to raise the Tatar people up in the struggle for  their independence."    The delegates elected the scientist-chemist Vil Mirzayanov  as  honorary member of the Milli Mejlis, and also adopted a  resolution expressing their indignation regarding the fact of  his arrest.    The measure which had passed, in the opinion of local  observers, demonstrated even more clearly the schism between the  different wings of the once unified Tatar National-Patriotic  Movement. For example, delegates from the radical committee,  "Sovereignty," and a number of others left the auditorium after  the first meeting, while in the auditorium itself there were  frequent outbursts of heated debate, turning at times to open  swearing and sometimes even to fistfights.    Many believe that the reason for the discord within the  Tatar  national movement is concealed not in political, but in personal  differences of the individual leaders. Therefore, we cannot  exclude the possibility that in the near future another two or  three milli medlis may emerge in Tatariya, and exclusively for  the purpose of satisfying the personal ambitions of the  "fighters for freedom of the Tatar people."    As we know, the sum is not altered when the addends change  place. And even if the total weight of the national-patriotic  organizations of Tatariya is equal to what it was before,  nevertheless the coefficient of their influence on political  life in the republic will still be close to zero. Before,  President Shaymiyev needed them to frighten Moscow with the  possibility of national conflicts. The national-patriots  fulfilled their task--with the aid of meetings, by storming  government buildings, through extremist slogans, etc.    Now the republic's leadership is faced with the task of  neutralizing the national-patriots. Having analyzed the  conflicts within the All-Tatar Public Center, the "Ittifak"  Party and all the other subjects of the Tatar national movement,  we may conclude that this process is close to its completion.    In the opinion of observers, today the Tatar  National-Patriotic Movement can only be saved by a striking  personality, although not such an odious one as Fauziya  Bayramova. However, it can also not be the former teacher of the  history of the CPSU, and today president of one of the wings of  the VTOTs [All-Tatar Public Center], Marat Mulyukov. Then again,  if we take as truth the fact that the only constitution for the  deputies of the Milli Mejlis is the Koran, then among them, who  are besieging the buffet tables despite the fast which is to be  observed during the current Islamic holy month of Ramazan, we  will not be able to find such an individual.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: US court blocks Parretti over MGM control CREDIT LYONNAIS, the French state bank that has been awarded management control of MGM, the financially-troubled Hollywood studio, said yesterday it had won a court injunction preventing Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier, from attempting any legal action to win back control of MGM in any forum other than Delaware. A spokesman for the French bank said the Delaware Chancery court had issued a restraining order that would also prevent Mr Parretti from attempting any action on behalf of MGM. The court order also confirms that the present directors of MGM, named by Credit Lyonnais, have full authority. The Delaware court order was sought by Credit Lyonnais, which last year disclosed it had loaned Mr Parretti Dollars 1bn to buy MGM, after Mr Parretti claimed last week that a Rome court had sequestered MGM shares. Credit Lyonnais claimed yesterday that the Delaware court order effectively blocked Mr Parretti's effort 'to interfere in the management of MGM' and would force him to bring any further challenge to Delaware, where MGM is incorporated.</p>

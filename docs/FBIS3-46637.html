After coming to power under the "civilian" veil in February  last year the traitor Kim Yong-sam, a puppet, has turned his  back on the South Korean people and the whole nation and  committed a long string of treacheries, outdistancing the  preceding military fascist rulers, the article says, and goes on:    One of the grisliest crimes committed by the traitor Kim  Yong-sam and his "civilian government" is that they have taken  the road of dependence on foreign forces, not national  independence, and of North-South confrontation, not national  unity, turning away the hand stretched by fellow countrymen for  the reconciliation, unity and reunification of the North and  South.    Kim Yong-sam the traitor resumed the "Team Spirit" nuclear  war exercises against the North on a larger scale in collusion  with the U.S. imperialists, the war game which had been  suspended in the closing years of the "sixth republic" and, at  "summit talks" and "annual security consultative meeting"  between South Korea and the United States and during his trip of  the United States, he asked the United States to shelve a  programme to cut back its troops present in South Korea and keep  the U.S. troops in South Korea for an indefinite period in  return for his promise to allocate more than 3 billion dollars  for the maintenance of its troops, and place South Korea under  the U.S. "nuclear umbrella".    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has made desperate efforts to  get "sanctions" imposed upon the DPRK and set up an  "international cooperation system" against it by spreading the  fiction of "suspicion of nuclear development by the North"  invented by the imperialist reactionary forces in a bid to  stifle our republic, the bastion of socialism.    Never to be condoned are the crimes committed by the Kim  Yong-sam fascist "regime" in turning South Korea into a fascist  pandemonium worse than under the "sixth republic" military  dictatorial "regime" and brutally suppressing the students and  people calling for independence, democracy and reunification.    It is only too natural that the South Korean people bitterly  condemn the present Kim Yong-sam puppet regime as a "civilian  fascist regime" and the "second-term government of the sixth  republic" which has replaced "military fascism with civilian  fascism".    The Kim Yong-sam group committed a towering crime by putting  a spoke in the wheel of the democratic development of the South  Korean society and driving the economy and people's living to  the worst phase through deceptive "reforms".    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has taken the road of  dependence on outside forces, not national independence, and of  North-South confrontation, not national reconciliation and  unity, going against the desire of the nation for independent  reunification and is fooling the people with hypocritical  "reforms". This is what the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has done  under the cloak of "civilian politics".    The traitor and fascist tyrant forsaken by the country and  the nation will face a stern judgement by history.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Sterling and Dollars continue decline The dollar and sterling continued their parallel decline yesterday, with the pound finishing at a 17-month low against the D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith. In spite of the release of buoyant UK GDP and trade data, sterling lost over a pfennig against the D-Mark to finish in London at DM2.3729 from DM2.3836 on Friday. Against the dollar, it closed firmer at Dollars 1.5501 from Dollars 1.5483. Later in New York it gained a little against both currencies. Sterling has now lost 25 pfennigs from a high of DM2.62 in January. Over the same period it has risen by 9 cents against the dollar, from Dollars 1.46. Analysts said the pound was being caught in the backwash of the movements of the dollar and the D-Mark. There was no evidence that it had become the object of speculative pressure in its own right. The dollar is slipping back towards the lows of DM1.5165 and Y96.55, touched on July 12. Yesterday it closed nearly a pfennig lower, at DM1.5309 from DM1.5396. It also slipped below Y98, closing at Y97.96 from Y98.475. Sentiment towards the US currency remains negative, with the market concerned about the state of US-Japan trade talks, whether the Fed is winning the fight against inflation and the weakness of the Clinton presidency.

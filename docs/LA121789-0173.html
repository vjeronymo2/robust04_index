			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RULING BACKS U.S. FORCES' POLICE ROLE;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: LEGAL OPINION SUPPORTS OVERSEAS ARRESTS. DRUG TRAFFICKERS,  TERRORISTS WOULD BE TARGETS.  </P> <P> U.S. military forces have the legal authority to conduct law enforcement  operations outside the United States, including pursuing and apprehending  international terrorists and drug traffickers, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's top  legal adviser has ruled.  </P> <P> In a Nov. 3 memorandum that opens the door to direct participation by the  military in stepped-up offensives in other nations, Assistant Atty. Gen.  William P. Barr concluded that a Reconstruction Era ban on such involvement was  not intended to apply outside U.S. borders.  </P> <P> Barr's ruling, first reported Saturday by the Washington Post and confirmed by  Administration sources, was made after questions were raised about the  military's authority to arrest Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega if a coup  attempt against him were successful.  </P> <P> Although the 28-page legal opinion cleared the way for such action,  Administration officials emphasized that a policy decision "at the highest  inter-agency levels" would be required before the military embarked on any law  enforcement mission in other countries.  </P> <P> "Even though we may have the legal right to do some things, we may not -- for  political reasons -- want to exercise all those rights," a senior Defense  Department official said.  </P> <P> Asked whether the Barr opinion had led to specific military actions, such as in  the escalating offensive against South American cocaine traffickers, one  Administration source declined to comment, while another said: "Not to my  knowledge."  </P> <P> The ruling could remove potential obstacles to the involvement of U.S. military  forces in the escalating offensive against cocaine producers and traffickers in  the South American nations of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.  </P> <P> U.S. troops have been deployed to South America to work with local officials as  part of an "Andean initiative" contained in President Bush's anti-drug program,  but their ability to apprehend traffickers was not clearly established until  Barr's opinion was issued.  </P> <P> However, any direct involvement by U.S. military personnel in the  drug-producing nations would be certain to provoke significant nationalist  opposition within those countries by citizens who view the U.S. involvement  with suspicion.  </P> <P> The memorandum on law enforcement actions by military personnel addresses a  different legal question than a controversial June 21 opinion by Barr that said  the FBI had authority to seize fugitives overseas without obtaining permission  of the foreign government.  </P> <P> And the assurances made by Administration officials that military actions would  not be undertaken without prior approval at high levels illustrates their  sensitivity to congressional criticism of the earlier opinion.  </P> <P> The Justice Department declined to make public Barr's latest ruling, just as it  had the June 21 opinion, on grounds that the documents constitute "private  communications" between Barr and his "client" -- Thornburgh, and, through him,  President Bush.  </P> <P> But an Administration official said Barr's latest written ruling was in line  with a verbal opinion that his office of legal counsel had formulated during  the Ronald Reagan Administration before Barr joined the government.  </P> <P> "OLC looked at the issue and wrote a rough first draft, but the issue abated,"  and the opinion was never completed, an Administration official said. He  declined to explain the facts under consideration at that time, but he said the  verbal opinion did not lead to any action by the military.  </P> <P> Barr's opinion reviews the history of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, passed in  response to opposition to military oversight of Reconstruction Era elections.  The ruling concludes that the act sought to bar military interference in  functions of the states and was not meant to address military actions in other  countries, an Administration official said.  </P> <P> "All the legislative history (of the act) related to interference with the  states, with the military in conflict with Americans that could undermine  confidence in the military," he said. "It was not Congress' intent for it to  apply extraterritorially."  </P> <P> Until recent years, the Pentagon had avoided any involvement in the fight  against drugs entering the United States by citing the ban on military  involvement in civilian law enforcement. But during the Reagan Administration,  the act was amended to permit the use of the military for intelligence in drug  interception along U.S. borders.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has invited proposals for broader military  involvement in anti-drug efforts, and he has been considering initiatives  submitted by the 10 principal U.S. military field commanders.  </P> <P> Several of these proposals "pushed the envelope on what we could or could not  do" in fighting drug trafficking, a senior Pentagon official said. He added  that Cheney has rejected some of the proposals on grounds that they went too  far.  </P> <P> Doubts over the military's limited powers in battling drugs were raised during  the Noriega coup attempt. Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of U.S. forces in  Panama, felt it necessary to have a federal law enforcement agent standing by  in case the coup succeeded and Noriega could be arrested on federal narcotics  charges he faces in Florida.  </P> <P> The White House then sought clarification of the limitations, which resulted in  Barr's opinion, an Administration source said.  </P> <P> Staff writer Melissa Healy contributed to this story.  </P></p>

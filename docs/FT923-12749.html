			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Letter: If all else fails, take the direct route to the filing cabinet Sir, Michael Dixon's article on executive recruitment (July 15) questioned what the thousands thrown out of work, mostly through no fault of their own, are doing. Judging by the experiences of a former colleague they are the recipients of countless standard rejection letters having an instantly recognisable format. The receipt of so many similar letters has prompted us to compose a standard letter of application, so far not seen in the text books, but designed to save a great deal of time and trouble, expectation and disappointment in the present climate. 'Dear Sir or Madam Ref--------------- In order to save you the bother of writing to inform me that there were a number of candidates whose qualifications and experience more closely met your client's requirements and that my application was not successful, I have definitely decided not to apply for the above advertised position. 'However, I enclose my curriculum vitae for I am sure you will be pleased, as always, to keep my details on your files, in the event that one of your clients may have a suitable vacancy at some time in the future. Yours etc' Alan Hopes, 5 Tulk House, Ottershaw Park, Ottershaw, Surrey KT16 0QG</p>

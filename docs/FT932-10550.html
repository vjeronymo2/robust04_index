			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Irritation at Yeltsin postponement THE UNEASY relationship between Japan and Russia was further strained yesterday after President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo, scheduled originally for last September and then for later this month, was postponed again, Robert Thomson writes. Japanese officials were also irritated that the announcement was conveyed informally to news organisations in Moscow before it was delivered formally to Tokyo. In September Mr Yeltsin complained that Japan was placing too much stress on an unresolved dispute over ownership of the Kurile Islands, occupied by Soviet troops at the end of the second world war. Japanese representatives again emphasised the islands dispute last week at a preparatory meeting for the visit. Tokyo assumes that Mr Yeltsin was under pressure from conservatives in Moscow to hold his ground on the dispute and preferred not to make the trip now. 'In some ways you can't say the visit was postponed because it was never formally announced,' a Japanese foreign ministry official said. Mr Yeltsin decided last month to invite himself. Another official said the postponement was an example of the 'lack of diplomatic etiquette' in Moscow, and a sign that the Russian government appears to have misunderstood the two-tier Japanese policy on the islands. At a meeting last month of foreign and finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations, Japan was prepared to drop its bilateral demand for the return of the islands. It conceded that the multilateral forum, designed to muster assistance for Russia, was not the place to settle a bilateral dispute. Japan, which promised Dollars 1.82bn in aid at the meeting, insists that the islands remain at the top of the agenda when the two countries meet, and expects that a visit by Mr Yeltsin to Tokyo would include a concession on their ownership. Mr Yeltsin is still invited to attend the Tokyo G7 summit in early July, and Japanese officials say they have received indications from the Russian government that he may come on a bilateral visit in September or October.</p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Observer: Michael who? The decision to prevent political journalists from enjoying a libation on the Terrace of the House of Commons has thrown an unaccustomed spotlight on Michael Martin. As chairman of the Commons catering committee, Martin is behind the decree that will allow MPs to wine and dine by the Thames this summer free from the prying eyes of the press. Perhaps fearing an increase in their bar bills, senior Labour figures were hastily blaming the ill-conceived ban on the Tories. It had obviously eluded them that Martin has represented the Labour constituency of Springburn in Glasgow for the last 15 years. But then the 48-year-old MP's only other claim to fame is that he was once an aide to Denis Healey.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ELNs are intermediate term (two to seven years), non-convertible, hybrid debt securities, the value of which is linked to the performance of a highly capitalized, actively traded U.S. common stock. ELNs may provide for periodic interest payments to holders based on fixed or floating rates, or they may be structured as ``zero coupon'' instruments with no payments to holders prior to maturity. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  ELNs may be subject to a ``cap'' on the maximum principal amount to be repaid to holders upon maturity, and they may feature a ``floor'' on the minimum principal amount paid to holders upon maturity. A specific issue of ELNs, for example, may provide holders with a fixed semi-annual interest payment, a cap of 135% of the issuance price on the maximum amount to be paid upon maturity, and no minimum floor on the principal to be repaid at maturity. Another issue of ELNs might offer lower annual payments based upon a floating rate and a minimum floor principal repayment of 75% of the issuance price. As may be seen, the flexibility available to an issuer of ELNs permits the creation of securities which offers investors the opportunity to more precisely focus on a specific investment strategy. Since July 1993, the Exchange has listed and currently trades seven ELNs issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange has agreed to notify the Commission if an issuer of ELNs provides for periodic interest payments to holders based on a floating rate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ELNs conform to the general listing criteria under Section 107A of the Guide, which provide that issues have: (1) A minimum public distribution of one million trading units and a minimum of 400 holders; (2) an aggregate market value of at least $20 million; (3) cash settlement in U.S. dollars and a redemption price of at least three dollars where the instrument contains such provisions; and (4) assets of at least $100 million, stockholders' equity of at least $10 million, and pre-tax income of at least $750,000 in the last fiscal year or in two of the three prior fiscal years. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  ELNs also conform to the special listing criteria of Section 107B of the Guide which provide that: (1) Each issuer have a tangible net worth of at least $150 million; (2) the total original issue price of the particular issue of ELNs combined with all of the issuer's other ELNs listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

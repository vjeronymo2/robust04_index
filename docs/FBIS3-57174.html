China is a high-priority  country in Russia's foreign policy, declared Deputy Foreign  Minister of Russia Aleksandr Panov in an interview with  ITAR-TASS on Monday.    The deputy minister said the relationship between the two  countries should be stripped of all "sensationalism, and should  just be normal relations between normal neighbors, two  superpowers" who are cooperating in the interests of each other,  their region, and the whole world.    According to Panov, the fact that the new year is beginning  with visits by United States President Bill Clinton to Moscow  and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to China is  symbolic. Although the delegations are in "different weight  categories", they reinforce the balance which Russia is  maintaining in its foreign policy, which is directed towards the  east as much as it is towards the west.    Panov said that Kozyrev's official visit, which is scheduled  to begin on January 26, will include discussion of preparations  for a return visit to Moscow by Chinese Premier Jiang Zeming.    The potential for Russian-Chinese partnership is great, said  Panov. In particular, Russia has not paid enough attention to  China's experience in gradual economic reforms, especially in  the formation of "special" free economic zones.    Talks on the two countries' border are currently being held.  Panov called "groundless" the allegations sometimes made by  indvidual Russian statesmen (especially in the Far East), to the  effect that Russia is making one-sided, unjustifiable  compromises under Chinese pressure. Whenever the two sides make  concessions, they are reciprocal, "mutual" concessions.    As far as the military sphere is concerned, Russia and China  are negotiating on the withdrawal of some armed forces from the  border areas. But these withdrawals would not be of a "sharp or  sensational nature, since it is more and more obvious that no  military preparations are being made along the border, which is  becoming a border of friendship", Panov explained.    The deputy foreign minister declared that Russian-Chinese  trade is mutually profitable and does not infringe upon Russia's  economic interests. This trade will be continually expanded, he  said.    Panov appealed for more complete information on the two  countries' relations to be made available to society. Kozyrev's  january visit to Beijing is destined to play an important role  in fulfilling this goal.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Nigeria adrift GENERAL IBRAHIM Babangida's decision to nullify the outcome of Nigeria's presidential election plunges the country into its most serious crisis since the Biafran war in the 1960s. Africa's most populous nation is adrift, bereft of leadership and gripped by a deepening economic malaise. The country's transition from military to civilian rule has been flawed from the start. Former politicians were banned, as were the 13 parties that originally sought to contest elections. The soldiers then foisted on the electorate two artificial parties, created by civil servants, with near identical manifestos. It has been a travesty of the democratic tradition the general promised to entrench. Nothing, however, has undermined his credibility so much as the confusion that followed the presidential election on June 12, and the diktat that postpones the advent of civilian rule for the fourth time. The poll was to have been the last step before a formal handover of power next August. Instead, it turned into a farce. A group calling itself the Association for a Better Nigeria, which seeks the extension of military rule until 1997, won a court order that halted counting of a poll that was generally agreed to have been largely free of the rigging which has characterised past elections. If leaked figures are correct, Mr Moshood Abiola of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) defeated Mr Bashir Tofa, leader of the National Republican Convention (NRC), winning 58 per cent of the vote and taking 19 of Nigeria's 30 states. Neither candidate inspired confidence in Nigeria's future, and far better qualified aspirants had been disqualified in the course of the bizarre electoral process. Nevertheless, most Nigerians chose civilian rule, however flawed, as the lesser of two evils. It now seems clear, however, that the general will not step down on August 27, the anniversary of the coup that brought him to power in 1985. He and his supporters seem to have been seeking a pretext, however feeble, for extending the life of a corrupt regime. The prompt and forthright condemnation of the action by London and Washington should leave General Babangida in no doubt that the best service he can now perform for Nigeria would be to reverse his ruling. But the measures that accompany their warning are symbolic rather than substantial. Far more persuasive would be an imaginative approach to Nigeria's crippling Dollars 30bn external debt. There should be a clearer link between political and economic reform and the debt relief that Nigeria desperately needs. Substantial concessions could be delivered more quickly than current rescheduling terms allow, on condition that General Babangida steps down and economic reforms are implemented. As an African proverb might put it: small stick, big carrot.</p>

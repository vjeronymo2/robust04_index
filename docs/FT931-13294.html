			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Press may escape law on privacy if regulator is reformed MR JOHN MAJOR is ready to consider shelving proposals for a new privacy law if newspapers respond to the Calcutt report by significantly strengthening the Press Complaints Commission. The government has signalled its determination to introduce criminal legislation against the use by the press of electronic surveillance, bugging and trespass. But Mr Major is hesitant over separate proposals for civil law measures to protect individual privacy. Senior officials have begun drafting legislation but the prime minister has made known his preference for tighter self-regulation of the press. An extension of the law of tort to cover privacy is backed by a number of senior cabinet ministers including Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. It would give individuals the right to sue for compensation when they believed they could prove that their private lives had been unreasonably invaded by intrusive behaviour or reporting. Mr Major recognises such a law would face practical difficulties. Without an expensive extension of the legal aid system, redress would remain out of reach for the ordinary individuals it would be designed to protect. The government would also face pressure for a loosely framed public interest defence to avoid charges that its main concern was to protect politicians and others in public life. So far, however, the press has not indicated willingness to undertake voluntarily the radical reform of self-regulation sought by Mr Major. Newspaper editors agreed last week to strengthen the complaints commission by guaranteeing a majority of lay members on the self-regulatory body. But the editors deferred a decision to underwrite its independence by ceding the industry's control over appointments.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (6): Taking the long view - US majors make the best of a tough situation Like tankers moving calmly over choppy waters, the giant US energy groups pretend that they float serenely above the turbulence of the world's troubled oil markets. In reality, their progress is not so smooth. True, the latest dip in the oil price is unlikely to interrupt the companies' long-term exploration and production plans - as long as it proves short-lived. But it will force the oil majors to give a further painful turn of the screw to the extensive cost-cutting they have already undertaken. And it will make more unattainable the goal of achieving a satisfactory return on capital. Most say their investment plans, while based on an oil price somewhat higher than the current level, are tested against prices of Dollars 15 a barrel or less. That makes them able to withstand troughs in the oil market. Nor do the big oil groups believe prices will stay at present levels for a sustained period. 'We don't see any deep fundamental change in our view (as a result of the recent price fall),' says Mr Ken Haley, manager of energy forecasting at Chevron. 'The market is at the lower end of its long-term sustainable level,' which Chevron puts at Dollars 18-Dollars 23 a barrel. Mr Alfred DeCrane, chairman and chief executive of Texaco, also expresses optimism about the price of oil: 'We haven't bet the store on it going up - but I haven't sold my stock.' He adds, though, that in the short term, lower prices mean 'we won't be getting in the front door what we thought we would be getting'. The fall in upstream earnings as a result of lower oil prices will put the energy groups under even greater pressure to husband their cash resources to support the investments necessary for long-term success. For two reasons, those investments are likely to get bigger rather than smaller. First, exploration and development spending is being ploughed into ever-bigger ventures outside the US in pursuit of the sort of massive discoveries which will provide long-term returns. Most mature US fields are no longer worth developing for big companies with large overheads to cover, while potential new large finds in Alaska or beyond the US's continental shelf are put out of reach by environmental concerns. A falling oil price has further reduced the attractions of exploring for oil in the US. Tax rates on oil production in the US are lower than in most overseas areas: this means that, when prices fall, the producer suffers more. In overseas markets, more of that pain is born by the taxpayer (the opposite is true when prices rise.) Not surprisingly, with the exception of a handful of giant fields in deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico, all the talk in the US now is of the development work in the former Soviet republics, the East China Sea or the North Sea. Investment budgets have followed this change in emphasis. Texaco's capital spending in the US has averaged Dollars 1.77bn a year over the past five years and is projected to continue unchanged at this level for the next five. Investment outside the US, by contrast, is expected to rise from Dollars 1.45bn a year to an average Dollars 2.12bn. Likewise, Chevron says three quarters of its Dollars 2.6bn capital investment on upstream activities this year has been spent outside the US. To support this move overseas, and at the same time cut costs, most US groups have disposed of marginal on-shore US fields. Texaco had 1,000 US oil and gas fields three years ago: by the end of next year, the number will be down to under 500. The second significant need for cash is in the US, where ever-more demanding environmental standards are forcing companies to upgrade their refineries both to produce cleaner fuels and to cut their own emissions. Few companies think they will be able to recover through higher fuel prices much of what they spend on revamping their refineries. Chevron, the largest refiner in the US, has put two refineries up for sale, representing around a quarter of its US refining capacity. 'It may not make sense to invest in all sites,' says Mr Donald Schmude of Texaco, which is also reviewing whether it can afford to upgrade all its US refinery facilities. In part, the refinery sales are part of a broader rationalisation of the US refining and marketing system. A flat gasoline market has forced companies to rethink their marketing strategies, concentrating their service stations into regional groupings close to their own refineries in an effort to cut costs and build market share. Service stations or refineries that do not fit into this pattern have been sold first. So far, refineries have changed hands rather than close down altogether. That could change, though, when the next phase of federal rules on gasoline standards comes into force at the beginning of 1995, says Mr DeCrane of Texaco: 'the need to spend to keep those refineries open will rise, and there will be closures of refineries in the US.' Against a domestic background of shrinking exploration and production and a downstream business facing significant (and probably irrecoverable) investment, it is not surprising that the US energy industry is living in reduced circumstances. By building reserves abroad, though, US oil is laying down the foundation for a more significant international presence well into the 21st century.</p>

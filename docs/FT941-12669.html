			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow at historic high ahead of growth data Wall Street US stocks climbed into uncharted territory yesterday after the bond market showed resilience ahead of today's initial estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 18.30 up at 3,926.30, breaking the previous record of 3,914.48 set on Friday. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 3.85 at 477.05, also a new peak. The Nasdaq composite put on 4.08 at 792.88. NYSE volume was 346.5m shares. In spite of a fresh round of news on corporate earnings, stocks were in a holding pattern until the afternoon, when program trading helped to extend modest gains registered early in the day. Activity was flavoured by anticipation of the government's preliminary reading on gross domestic product in the final three months of last year. Bond prices showed resilience in the face of unfavourable developments. Traders shrugged off a 2.2 per cent gain in December factory orders of durable goods as old news, and dismissed a big drop in unemployment benefit claims as a weather-related aberration. As a result, the inflation-sensitive long bond rose for a second consecutive day, a trend that was mirrored in the stock market. Utilities, especially sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, enjoyed their biggest day's rise in three years. Corporate earnings were not entirely ignored, however. The bellwether Dow average was initially suppressed largely because of disappointment over 3M's performance. The cyclical stock, a high-flier in recent weeks, fell Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 106 7/8 on posting flat earnings and casting doubts over its prospects this year. Offsetting the effect of 3M's decline, Caterpillar rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 101 1/2 , General Electric Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 108 1/4 and General Motors Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 59 7/8 . The other car makers were strong as well, with the Big Three reported to be scheduling an 80 per cent increase in production this week to make up for recent weather-related shutdowns. Ford put on Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 66 3/4 and Chrysler Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 60 1/2 . Near the top of the NYSE's most active list, Sara Lee shed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 23 3/8 after warning that its net income in the current quarter may fall short of analysts' forecasts. In telecommunications, AT&amp;T was in play after good news on its revenue growth and operating earnings in the final 1993 period. The stock firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 56 3/4 . Canada Falling gold shares offset an otherwise mainly strong Toronto market yesterday. The TSE 300 index closed just 7.1 ahead at 4,467.3 and advances led declines by 451 to 365. Volume reached a heavy 87.2m shares valued at CDollars 963.9m. Eleven of the 14 stock groups rose, but the golds index dropped 3.9 per cent as the spot bullion price tumbled USDollars 6.90 an ounce in New York. Banks gained 1.8 per cent, real estate 1.7 per cent and consumer products 1.3 per cent.</p>

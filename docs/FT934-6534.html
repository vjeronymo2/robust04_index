			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Elf-Aquitaine wipes slate clean  -Asset sales are central to plans for privatisation Four months after taking his seat at the head of Elf-Aquitaine, and with privatisation looming, Mr Philippe Jaffre yesterday gave his prognosis. France's largest industrial group will, he said, see net profits fall by about 80 per cent, to just over FFr1bn (Dollars 170m), this year. Recovery next year is likely to be slower than expected by most observers, as a result of the continued downturn in European markets, the weak oil price and the depressed chemicals sector. In response, he outlined a strategy of cost-cutting, disposals and strict limits on capital expenditure. Mr Jaffre's statement indicate a clean-up rather than a crisis. 'He is providing for risks and preparing the group for privatisation,' says Mr Vincent Bazi, head of research at Barings Securities in France. The government is due to sell its 50.8 per cent stake in the oil group early next year, and Mr Jaffre wants to be ready. Yesterday's warnings show he is treading a familiar path. Both Banque Nationale de Paris, which was privatised last month, and Rhone-Poulenc, which is in the final stages of its sale, issued profits warnings before being offered to the public, and took steps to cleanse their operations. Part of the the reason, say analysts, is to constrain the share price ahead of the pricing of the issue. At the operating level, Elf continues to perform reasonably well, given the recession in Europe and the weakness of the oil price. Operating income is expected to fall 20 per cent for the year as a whole, after a fall of 34 per cent in the first six months. Cash-flow, the most important indicator for oil companies, is expected to be about FFr24bn for the year, roughly the same level as last year. Debt, however, is perceived as a problem. 'What concerns me is the growth of financial charges,' said Mr Jaffre, emphasising that his priority was to stabilise the group's debt-equity ratio by the middle of next year, and reduce it thereafter. At the end of June, gearing stood at about 37 per cent. It is forecast to rise to between 45 and 50 per cent by the end of the year. The rise in borrowings is the legacy of his predecessors, notably Mr Lok le Floch-Prigent, who pursued an ambitious policy of acquisitions and investments. At the end of June, group borrowings stood at FFr39.8bn. 'It has become a heavy burden,' said Mr Jaffre. 'At a time when our competitors are taking steps to reduce borrowings, so should we.' The target is to keep the debt-equity ratio below 50 per cent. This is where the clean-up comes in. Elf plans to reduce its borrowings through a series of asset sales. This will involve the unravelling of many of the group's financial holdings in other businesses. Mr Jaffre offered no specifics regarding the sales. However, he has plenty to choose from. The company has an estimated FFr15bn tied up in numerous shareholdings in other groups, including Bidermann, the textiles group, Compagnie Financiere de Suez, and Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the construction and communications group. More immediate candidates for sale, however, are likely to be the FFr5bn or so of investments in non-listed companies accumulated over the past 20 years. The sale of assets is not expected to affect the group's core businesses. This would appear to include Yves Saint Laurent, the cosmetics and luxury goods group, acquired controversially by Mr le Floch-Prigent. 'I think it is still group strategy to build up its health and beauty business,' said one analyst in Paris. As for broader strategy, a stronger balance sheet should enable Elf to play its part in the government's privatisation programme. Mr Jaffre described as 'strategic' his company's relations with Union des Assurances de Paris, the insurance group, and Renault. His comments hinted at a new set of cross-share-holdings when the two companies follow Elf to the auction block.</p>

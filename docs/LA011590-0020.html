			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARD HEADS AND TENDER HEARTS FOR L.A.;  </P> <P> LEADERSHIP: DR. KING'S LEGACY OFTEN FALLS AFOUL OF DISTRACTIONS AND CONFUSIONS.  IN THIS DECADE, WE MUST DO BETTER.  </P> <P> Today marks the fifth national observance of the birth of Dr. Martin Luther  King Jr. and Los Angeles has been one of the nation's leading communities in  celebrating this important day of reflection and action. There is no city or  county in the United States of America that has organized so extensive and  diverse a series of events, activities, ceremonies, litanies, breakfasts,  luncheons, dinners and mass demonstrations. So Los Angeles, for the most part,  does very well when it comes to celebrating the holiday in honor of the drum  major for peace and justice.  </P> <P> Regrettably, one of the most important banks in the city, Security Pacific, has  decided to stay open for business on this day. This act of retrenchment  (Security Pacific reversed an earlier decision to close for the day) makes  clear that the peace and justice agenda must be a perennial project, not just  an annual acknowledgment.  </P> <P> Los Angeles still has a lot to do to make the legacy of Dr. King meaningful.  The fulfillment of his dream, so eloquently etched in hearts and minds of  millions, is the mandate of the 1990s. This decade, the last of the 20th  Century, poses real possibilities and challenges, and it warrants candor about  where things are, particularly for the African American community.  </P> <P> Public policy is one of the first areas in which substantial focus must be  placed. In the words of Dr. King: "We must be hardheaded and tenderhearted."  There is too much going on that could have a positive impact on the quality of  life in the African American community that does not do so, because of  confusion, inattention, distraction and self-interest.  </P> <P> A few examples will suffice. First, what was a reasonable proposal to build a  criminal justice center in South-Central Los Angeles, to better serve those who  now have to go downtown and elsewhere, has been distorted -- wittingly and  unwittingly -- and now the prospects for such a facility are remote at best. It  was rumored that the center was nothing more than a dishonest way of building a  big jail. The rumors took on a life of their own, and innuendo and suspicion  smothered the bill that might have provided the funding for the center.  </P> <P> Today, the needs of those who could benefit from such a center go unmet. Why?  Largely because of a lack of clarity and leadership. Further, the very notion  of literally building a jail in a community that feels that it's already jailed  evokes a visceral reaction that rational debate could not begin to address. The  residents of South-Central are justifiably sensitive about the stigma  associated with jails. South-Central does not want to be viewed as a place  where a bunch of criminals hide-out or a place where too many residents --  young men in particular -- are lurking about to do their dirty deeds.  </P> <P> Part of the King legacy is that the African American community has the right to  view itself, and have others view it, in the best light, rather than by racial  stereotypes, for prospects of peace and justice emerge out of a constructive  view.  </P> <P> Redevelopment is another issue of concern. In this decade, major redevelopment  schemes will be implemented in the inner city, largely because it is the most  undeveloped part of Los Angeles. One developer said, "It's as good as virgin  land." Economic justice should be at the heart of the discussion about  redevelopment. However, there can be no sense of justice without active citizen  participation and the involvement of those who are directly affected by plans  that portend neglect at best and rip-off at worst.  </P> <P> Why isn't it possible to have more affordable housing in Los Angeles? Why can't  the city-designated agencies make South-Central and East Los Angeles the  priority they ought to be and then show clear results? Why can't those  developers who traditionally relate to those agencies on behalf of  underdeveloped communities broaden the circle, train more people and share the  wealth? This arena needs more hard heads and tender hearts that will not  compromise those who are most deserving and the most neglected. The quality of  life of the city as a whole is at stake. Redevelopment must be high on the  peace and justice agenda.  </P> <P> Finally, the matter of public education is a source of constant concern and  even dismay. There are simply too many functional illiterates in the Los  Angeles community. This problem has reached crisis proportions in the African  American community and substantially contributes to a decrease in the quality  of life and to the high drop-out rates and the attendant problem of gang  activity.  </P> <P> The recent initiatives on arresting low achievement, made on behalf of African  American students, have not been successful in most instances and have been  diluted to the point of meaninglessness in others. The peace and justice agenda  in public education has to be one that inculcates critical thinking, for this  is the key to liberation.  </P> <P> The heirs of the King legacy have our work cut out for us, and there is plenty  of it. More so than in decades gone by, the 1990s will require increased  integrity, ingenuity and tenacity.  </P></p>

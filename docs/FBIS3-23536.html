			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent Aleksandr Yegorov, </F> under the rubric: "Arsenal"; "The `Gyurza' Has a Stern Nature"]    [Text] In a recent article, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA discussed  the equipment and arms exhibition in Turkey. Special attention  was devoted to the "small-arms" section presented by Russia.  Besides similar models, you mentioned the "Gyurza" 9-mm pistol  set. Could you discuss this weapon in more detail?    Aleksandr Vlasov    Krasnodar    Despite the modest dimensions and limited combat  significance  of this type of weapon, the history of the pistol is the history  of the dramatic struggle of a designer's idea and the  capabilities of the technology. Frankly speaking, until recently  there hasn't been an ideal pistol in the world. There were  simply successful and popular models: the Browning, the Mauser,  the Colt, the TT [Tokarev Tula pistol]... But, based upon the  big picture, they remained a weak weapon of destruction. Small  weapons are acquiring force only right now. The pistol that we  are discussing today is actually a powerful weapon that meets  very high combat requirements.    They named it "Gyurza" [Persian -- gurza -- a type of  poisonous snake], probably because there is little chance of  pulling through after a "bite". As Mauser the younger once said,  Inventor and State Prize Laureate Petr Serdyukov, in cooperation  with Aleksey Yuryev (the cartridge designer), managed to  accommodate so much death and force in the space called "Gyurza"  that the pistol can legitimately be considered to be one of the  best, if not the best, in its class. But let's let the technical  specifications speak for themselves.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tactical-Technical Specifications of the "Gyurza" Pistol Set                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Length, mm                            |195                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Height, mm                            |145                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Thickness, mm                         |30                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weight without cartridges, grams      |995                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Capacity of the magazines             |2 X 18                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Caliber, mm                           |9                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bullet muzzle velocity, m/s           |420                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Combat rate of fire, cartridges per m-|up to 40                              |  |inute                                 |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      One of the main specifications is effective firing range.  For  "Gyurza", it is 100 meters (as we know, the PM [9 mm pistol  designed by Makarov] has a range of 25 meters). It is from this  distance that the pistol permits us to destroy an enemy who is  protected by a helmet. At a range of up to 70 meters, "Gyurza's"  bullet pierces a flak jacket (two titanium plates 1.2 mm thick  each and 30 layers of Kevlar). No other pistol is capable of  doing that today.    "Gyurza" is equipped with two automatic safeties which is an  innovation. One is located on the trigger (a pin that depresses  when squeezed) and the other is on the handle. The safeties are  turned off when the pistol is grasped properly by a hand,  thereby excluding the possibility of delays when opening fire  that are characteristic for a standard pistol and which are  associated with a forward safety in the fighting position, or  the possibility of the pistol becoming stuck in the holster,  caught on clothing, etc.    The new pistol permits you to conduct fire when the hammer  is  placed in the fully cocked platoon.    There is a horn, a bend in the trigger guard, or, as they  call it here, a support for the other hand. That is also an  innovation that facilitates firing the powerful pistol. However,  experience has shown that firing the "Gyurza" one-handed is also  adequately effective. A pistol shooter with a medium level of  training hits a full-length target no less than 16 of 18  possible times at a range of 100 meters.    It remains to be added that the pistol was developed at the  Central NII of Precision Machinebuilding and is entering the  inventory of MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] special subunits.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol -- An appeal to the president and the  people of Crimea was adopted at a meeting of the personnel of  the Crimea Republic Security Service on 15 April. The document,  in particular, expresses concern over the progress of events  around this collective. "The latest developments prove that  attempts are being made to shift the activity of the service  from the legal sphere to political, in which we have no right to  interfere," says the statement. "This is fraught with the  disorganization of the operational and search activity under  conditions of growing crime rates and increasing danger of the  emergence of political terrorism."    Accusations to the effect that the Crimean Security Service  "went over to Ukraine" are senseless, because no one questions  the provision of the law "On Security Service of Crimea" which  stipulates that it is a regional body of the Security Service of  Ukraine. Such reproaches evoke surprise, to say the least,  because they are made also by "separate employees of the Crimean  president's administration who are former executives of the  former KGB. It is they who should be aware of the consequences  of involving the special purpose law enforcement body in  political confrontation better than anyone else."</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Arts: Morals and mortality - Cinema SCHINDLER'S LIST (15) Steven Spielberg A BRONX TALE (18) Robert De Niro LA CRISE (15) Coline Serreau In any rollcall of movie-resistant subjects, the Holocaust's name would be read out first. How do you film a human tragedy so inhuman, in its conception and enactment, that some people today deny it ever happened? The greatest achievement of Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List is to make the 'impossible' seem possible. The Holocaust did happen and the human imagination - even the Hollywood imagination - may be able to encompass it. Shooting in a harsh high-contrast monochrome, Spielberg and cameraman Janusch Kaminski combine handheld camera movement with the chiaroscuro of old archive footage. Directors have stolen the traditional clothing of truth before - Documentary Material Never Lies  - to masquerade as guides into history. But here the clothing seems truly to take the film over. It becomes one with that past: not just the trappings but the real terrors beneath. Thomas Kenneally's truth-based novel was a controversial Booker Prize winner in its day. Was it fiction or fact or bits of both? German businessman Oskar Schindler, played in the film by Liam Neeson, did exist and did rescue over a thousand Jews from extinction by 'buying' them from the Nazis to work for his munitions plant in occupied Czechoslovakia (a plant that managed, we are told, never to produce a usable shell). Previously, Schindler had employed Jews in his Krakow porcelain factory, before and briefly after the emptying of the ghetto in 1943. And if we believe the book and film, he begged, bribed or blackmailed SS officers he knew, notably the sadistic Amon Goeth who ran the Plaszow camp outside Krakow, to spare Jewish victims. So was he Saint Oskar? Is Spielberg's film a hairshirt hagiography? Mercifully not. For most of the film's 3 1/4 hours Spielberg, Neeson and screenwriter Stephen Zaillian make their 'hero' even more of an enigma than Kenneally did. Neeson's profile - part Botticelli pin-up, part jungle predator - is lit by Spielberg with an eerie emphasis, so that it seems both beautiful and monstrous. Towering above fellow actors, Neeson swishes through offices and SS parties in his haute couture greatcoat, pressing the flesh both manually and sexually. His appetite for women give an edge of ambivalence to his Galahad antics as a Jewish saviour. Is he in it for virtue or for cosy side-helpings of vice? Is he in it, indeed, just for the commercial bonus of cheap labour? Once the horrors begin, the play-off between equivocal hero and unequivocal history becomes hypnotic. While watching from a hilltop the clearing of the ghetto, Schindler seems to make his inner commitment to risk all to help the Jews. But we only intuit. He sees what we see, so we project onto him our responses: to the random killings, the firestorm of SS machine-guns in a room where Jews are hiding out, the boy whose stomach is blown out as he is marched back after an escape attempt, the fleeing girl eerily picked out in a red coat. Once we know that the safety-catch is off Spielberg's imagination, as it never was in his earlier second world war venture Empire Of The Sun, Schindler's List becomes a game of 'dare' between audience and film-maker. Will he give us an Amon Goeth as diabolical as Kenneally and history suggest? Yes: this is the camp commandant - sometimes more modernly camp in Ralph Fiennes's seesaw intonations and 'Cherman' accent - who brutalised his prisoners with beatings and bullets (including morning rifle practice from his villa balcony). And will Spielberg tear down the tasteful veil usually imposed between audiences and feature-film portraits of prison camp life? Yes: the film's ragged or naked prisoners are closer to newsreel reality than any screen fiction has managed before. The bravest decision is to resist giving us any frontline identification figure among the Jews. Easy to have laid on 'the Little Boy' or 'the Helpless Girl' or 'the Old Watchmaker': a character to whose shirt-tails we could cling, comfortable in that facile pathos. But with the victims seen collectively, the need to individualise our sympathies is turned back on the most difficult character of all, Schindler. And when he proves unyielding, we even try to find a chink of humanity in Goeth. This Nazi officer is given one overwhelmingly funny, pathetic scene of self-transcendence in which he tastes the 'power' of mercy. Schindler, in conversation, has tried to disarm Goeth's cruelty-addiction with some sophistries about the thrill of sparing life rather than taking it. So for a while - roughly, half a morning - Fiennes becomes saint rather than sinner. He pardons those who offend him and practices his melting 'Messiah' look in the shaving mirror. Then, bored with that, he takes up his gun again. Here and in the movie's other two great scenes - a game of cat-and-mouse with a gun-threatened prisoner, a step inside the gas chamber itself - Spielberg takes us to the moral and emotional brink. When life and death are as arbitrary as this, and when good and evil can be play-acted (Goeth) or tinged with pragmatism (Schindler), what are the guideposts of human action? Schindler's List only backs away from the grim near-nihilism of its vision at the close. Preparing to flee his factory as peace breaks out in 1945, Neeson's wheeler-dealer is given a speech of valedictory emotionalism as if to signal to us 'Ah] He had a heart] He was a saint all along]' This scene is a deathbed Hollywood repentance in a film we have admired up to this point for its ability to look straight into the face of a godless time, beyond all the special pleadings and false sanctities of past Holocaust cinema. Talking of special pleadings, here is Robert De Niro's directing debut, A Bronx Tale. This film does for the New York Mafia what Saatchi and Saatchi have done, in recent elections, for the Conservative Party. You know the Mafia? Very nice people with Italian accents and good suits? Well, when neighbourhood boss Sonny (Chaz Palminteri) befriends nine-year-old Calogero, the boy's bus driver father (Robert De Niro) takes at first a dim view. No, De Niro won't run a numbers racket for his son's new friend. And no, he don't like the two of them hanging out together in dives and gambling joints and police stations. But we are supposed to like it: mainly because Sonny is one of those mobsters with a notional heart of gold beneath the shiny suit and bulletproof vest. The film is based on a stage play by Mr Palminteri and plays like it. Not so much in a claustrophobia of setting: plenty of street life and driving around in cars. More in a sentimental claustrophobia of concept. This is a rites-of-passage movie where a boy learns Who His True Friends Are. Coline Serreau's La Crise is our old friend, the French buddy movie about the life-battered romantic from the educated classes (Victor Landon) and his blue-collar Sancho Panza friend (Patrick Timsit). While Landon suffers serial crises - wife walks out, boss sacks him, parents split up - Timsit scurries alongside, spouting the wisdom of the working classes. Serreau directed the original Three Men And A Baby and still seems to think films are like Christmas crackers: funny hats, a few plot surprises and a pinbrained serio-comic message about humanity.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / The Lex Column: UK market Yesterday's Pounds 149m rights issue from TransAtlantic Holdings, while something of a one-off, served to remind the London equity market of the notion that the UK election result has opened the door to a flood of cash calls and takeovers. It might not do to count on it just yet. The UK institutions have formidable claims on their cash flow, ranging from heavy gilt issues to equity offerings from such as Wellcome and GPA. They are likely to react badly to rescue rights issues, or indeed any issues not designed for a specific acquisition. As to the liberating effect of the election, it is worth recalling that Bowater and ECC got successful issues away for specific projects just before the election was called. As for the supposed flood of takeovers, it is certainly conceivable that foreign purchasers will be influenced at the margin by the prospect of five more years of UK political stability. But to the extent that they do not have UK-style access to equity finance, they are faced with the old problem of dear money and high asset prices. Meanwhile UK companies are still up against the same difficulty which has hampered merger activity for many months: the simple lack of clarity on their own prospects, let alone those of a target company. If the market is looking to bids to keep it going, it may have to wait awhile.</p>

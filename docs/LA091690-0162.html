			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONCE-BANNED PALESTINIANS APPLAUDED IN JORDAN  </P> <P> Two Marxist Palestinians who were banned from Jordan for 20 years were greeted  by loud applause as a conference of leftist and Islamic groups convened  Saturday to demonstrate solidarity with Iraq's Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> The participation of George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh underscored a growing  alliance between Iraq and radical Arab factions that is alarming Western  officials.  </P> <P> Habash is leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and  Nayef Hawatmeh heads the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.  </P> <P> Habash and other Palestinian leaders were kicked out of Jordan after the 1970  civil war pitting PLO rebels against the Jordanian army. The war started when  Habash's guerrillas hijacked three jetliners and blew them up in the Jordanian  desert.  </P> <P> Habash was welcomed back at the start of a three-day conference of Arab  leftists and Islamic activists sympathetic to Iraq. They demand that the  U.S.-led multinational force leave the Persian Gulf region.  </P> <P> Jordan's King Hussein, considered a U.S. ally, has been tilting toward his  powerful neighbor since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2. The king has said he  opposes the occupation of Kuwait but wants an Arab solution of the crisis.  </P> <P> In his speech Saturday, Habash urged Washington to avoid double standards in  dealing with Iraq's invasion and Israel's occupation of Arab territories.  </P> <P> "We reject the U.S. principle of selectivity in dealing with the U.N. Security  Council resolutions," Habash said in a speech, marked by ovations from the  audience of about 150 delegates.  </P> <P> Shortly after the invasion, Saddam Hussein said he would contemplate leaving  Kuwait only if U.N. resolutions calling for Israel's withdrawal from occupied  lands were implemented at the same time. Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza  Strip, and the Golan Heights in 1967.  </P> <P> His declaration threw many Palestinian leaders into his camp. Habash, who had  been based in Syria, moved to Baghdad.  </P></p>

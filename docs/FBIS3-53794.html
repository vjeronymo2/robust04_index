The meeting was attended by GCC delegations and senior  officials.    At the beginning of the meeting, the Saudi minister welcomed  the participants and expressed his sincere wishes that their  visit would boost U.S.-GCC economic dialogue.    He expressed appreciation for the U.S. people and government  for their support during the Gulf crisis and stressed that "our  joint effort to support international legitimacy" had led to the  liberation of Kuwait.    He confirmed the GCC desire to enhance economic cooperation  with the United States to coincide with excellent political and  strategic relations between the two sides.    He expressed satisfaction with the development of trade  between the U.S. and the GCC and pointed out that today's  meeting would help expand and diversify trade exchange.    "I would like to cease [as received] this opportunity to  congratulate the U.S. Government on successfully concluding the  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and I would also  like to express our complete satisfaction with the outcome of  the Uruguay round of international trade negotiations,"  al-Sulayyim said adding that these two accomplishments were two  steps on the right path towards a more liberated world trade  order.    He said GCC states firmly believe in the freedom of trade  and  keenly follow up the growth of world trade and are seriously  considering joining the GATT agreement.    He said the Kingdom has officially applied for GATT  membership and expressed hope that the U.S. would support this  request. He also pointed out that Bahrain has recently joined  the GATT.    He also confirmed the keenness of GCC states on the  protection of copy rights and the facilitation of resolving  trade disputes. He pointed in this connection to the decision  by the recent GCC summit to set up a commercial arbitration  center and a previous summit's decision to approve the patent  system and set up an office for the protection of copy rights.    Dr. al-Sulayyim expressed hope that these measures would  encourage and protect direct U.S. investments in GCC states and  said he was looking forward to negotiations on a legal formula  for an agreement on the protection and encouragement of  exchanged investments in the United States and GCC countries.    Turning to the field of energy, he said it was an important  sector of GCC-U.S. cooperation and stressed that their bilateral  dialogue had led to exchanging information and evaluating this  important sector.    He said the GCC, as a main source of producing hydrocarbon  energy, and the United States, main consumer, have a joint  interest in establishing healthy and stable energy markets. He  said their joint efforts in this field would give a positive  signal to the energy industry to encourage investments and meet  future international demand.    However, he expressed GCC [word indistinct] about growing  trends in consumer countries to place more hurdles in the face  of energy trade with the excuse of protecting the environment.    He said GCC states agree with this noble goal but do not  believe that prejudice against oil for the sake of other more  polluting energy sources is required or justified.    "That is why we look forward to the understanding and  empathy  of our friends in the United States for this legitimate  concern," he said.    Brown addressed the meeting confirming that GCC states and  the U.S. have joint economic interests.    He said GCC states look forward to new industries and the  U.S. looks forward to new markets. He added that GCC states aim  to attract international investments to realize security and the  U.S. aims to reach security by increasing investments outside  its borders.    He stressed that their joint efforts could lead to an  unusually successful economic cooperation.    He expressed confidence that current meetings and talks  between the U.S. and the GCC would increase their chances to  found more liberated markets and closer cooperation.    He underlined the importance of U.S. efforts to reach an  international agreement on the GATT and confirmed that the  Clinton administration aims to realize a more open and active  international economy and pointed to current negotiation between  the U.S. and Japan to reach a trade balance between them.    He added that the United States has realized that its  national security is linked to its economic security and that is  why it has expanded its international relations.    He said the return of peace to the Middle East stimulates  hope to provide more freedom to devote resources to more  economic development.    He also confirmed that economic development can bolster the  stability of peace.</p>

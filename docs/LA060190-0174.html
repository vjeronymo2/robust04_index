			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PENTAGON TO SEEK SCRUTINY OF TAKEOVER OF HIGH-TECH FIRMS  </P> <P> A report being prepared for the Pentagon will urge the government to tighten  its watch on foreign takeovers of U.S. high-tech firms and perhaps provide help  for companies critical to national security, industry officials said today.  </P> <P> The officials said a panel of 15 experts from business, government and  universities had tentatively approved the draft of a study this week  encouraging specialized microchip and other U.S. industries to remain in  American hands.  </P> <P> The final report will be sent to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney this summer.  </P> <P> "It (the study) notes that complete self-sufficiency in such areas as  microchips is impractical today, but says we should make sure foreign  restraints don't hamstring U.S. industry in critical areas," said one official.  </P> <P> The officials confirmed today's New York Times report that the study is being  prepared by the Defense Science Board Task Force on Foreign Ownership and  Control on U.S. industry.  </P> <P> The panel, headed by Apple Computer Corp. Vice President Deborah Coleman,  recommended that the government as a last resort should try to save weak firms  by helping U.S. mergers, providing refinancing or taking other steps before  such firms are put on the international market.  </P></p>

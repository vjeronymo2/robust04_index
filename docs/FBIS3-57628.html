The Belarussian leader's resignation was quite unexpected  for  Russia's foreign ministry, he said. Nevertheless Russia had no  reason to fear that relations between the two countries would  cool, since "all the branches of power and major political  forces (except the Popular Front, which has about 10% of  the  vote in Belarus's parliament -- IF) stand for strengthening  cooperation with Russia."    According to Interfax's interviewee, no one in Belarus needs  negative changes in bilateral relations, since Belarus gets from  Russia about 90% of its fuel, and Russia accounts for up to  72%  of Belarussian turnover.    As the diplomat said, Shushkevich's departure may even  stimulate closer cooperation between the two countries in the  framework of the CIS and on a bilateral basis. For instance,  the former parliament chairman procrastinated on a decision on  his country's joining the treaty on collective security, and  notified the Russian leadership of a positive decision on this  issue only on December 31, 1993.    With reference to the unification of the monetary systems of  Russia and Belarus, which caused a controversial response in  Moscow, Interfax's interviewee said that "the political  dividends Moscow will gain as a result of the proposed agreement  will outweigh the financial expenditure, and in the future this  will bring Russia considerable profit."    Head of Belarussian diplomacy Piotr Kravchenko maintains  that  changes in the country's leadership will not affect relations  with Russia.    The Minister-Counsellor of the Russian Embassy in Minsk,  Vyacheslav Kovalenko, told Interfax that at Thursday's meeting  with Russian Ambassador Igor Saprykin he stressed that the  Belarussian leadership would continue its policy of  rapprochement with Russia.</p>

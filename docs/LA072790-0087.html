			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BICYCLES BANNED ON TRAILS  </P> <P> Rolling Hills has banned mountain bikes and all other wheeled vehicles from the  24 miles of equestrian trails that wind through the private, gated community.  </P> <P> Council members unanimously adopted the law Tuesday after equestrians cited  several instances in which horses had been spooked by cyclists. The council  feared that serious accidents could result if cyclists continued to use the  trails. Motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles were already banned from the  trails.  </P> <P> Violators of the ban, which takes effect immediately, could be fined $500 or  face six months in jail.  </P></p>

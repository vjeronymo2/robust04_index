			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major supports Baker and fuels immigration row MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday strongly backed Mr Kenneth Baker's efforts to put immigration on the electoral agenda in spite of charges that the Conservatives' were 'scaremongering' and playing the race card. The prime minister said the home secretary had been 'right to make the warning' in a speech on Monday, although he added that he regretted that immigration sometimes became a party political matter. Mr Neil Kinnock said Mr Baker's remarks were 'not really worthy of him.' Accusing the home secretary of scaremongering, he said: 'To try and drag in the activities of extreme right parties is so irrelevant to British politics. The British people show no inclination whatsoever in any system of election to support the far right.' Mr Major insisted that it was thanks to 'firm but fair' immigration policies that Britain's race relations had improved and that the country had not suffered from the same problems that recently provoked riots in Marseilles. Distancing Conservative policy from the 'colourful language' employed by Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, the Tory candidate for Perth and Kinross, on race questions at the weekend, Mr Major said the home secretary was entitled to comment on immigration. 'What Kenneth Baker warned of yesterday was the danger that could be caused if that firm but fair immigration control was swept aside,' he said. The controversy over Mr Baker's comments came after he had suggested that Labour and the Liberal Democrats were preparing a 'deadly political cocktail' for Britain by weakening immigration controls and simultaneously proposing electoral reform that would 'unleash extremists'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, immediately condemned his remarks as 'panicky scaremongering.' Questioned over growing representation for the French National Front and the German extreme right as a consequence of proportional representation, Mr Ashdown said that by contrast it was Britain's first-past-the-post system that encouraged extremist rule. He pointed out that if Italy had used the UK system, the Communist party would have held power in the 1960s with between 38 and 40 per cent of the vote.</p>

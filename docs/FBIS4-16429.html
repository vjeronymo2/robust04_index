			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] The former Soviet republics will not be capable of  overcoming the situation they are in separately. The way out  provides for support of the initiative on establishment of a  Eurasian union put forward by Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev. This was suggested by Kazakh Foreign Minister  Tuleutay Suleymenov in an interview with Interfax.    Suleymenov clarified that the Kazakh president's proposal  meant that the economy must finally prevail over the politics.  "The CIS in its present framework does not work. Its documents  (there are already more than 400 of them adopted) are not  carried out. If two, three or four states interested in a close  cooperation join the Eurasian union, it will work," Suleymenov  suggested.    He said many people were worrying that establishment of  over-national organizational structures might violate the  sovereignty. "However, Kazakhstan is not afraid of this. That  is why President Nazarbayev has put forward this initiative," he  added.    Suleymenov is certain that the CIS states will back the  Kazakh initiative in the near future "some earlier, some later."  "Definite mechanisms of interaction do exist. There is no use  to reinvent the wheel. For instance, there is the European  Union [EU] is it not an example which should be followed? This  is a single customs and economic space with inter-state banks  and mutual settlement. By the way, the sharp issue on dual  citizenship would be resolved." One would be able to change the  citizenship freely, Suleymenov stressed.    Suleymenov believes that there is no reasonable alternative  to the Eurasian union. "We need each other. Even now our  former Soviet republics are more integrated with each other than  the EU states. We must unite. We have separated in order to  reunite on a new basis," Suleymenov suggested.    On the convention on human rights for ethnic minorities  submitted for additional work on it, Suleymenov emphasized its  importance and necessity for Kazakhstan.    "The draft convention was considered by the Council of  Foreign Ministers for the third time already. We have  repeatedly put forward our proposals and recommendations.  Unfortunately, experts do not always take into consideration  the recommendations of all the CIS states. That is why  documents turn out to be incomplete. This happened once again,"  Suleymenov said.    He announced that the CIS foreign ministers had agreed to  reconsider the convention in mid-May in order to discuss it once  again and to submit it for approval by the heads of state. "We  would like this document to work in favor not only of Kazakhstan  but also in favor of the whole CIS. It concerns our burning  issues. That is why the convention must be brought to conformity  with the national legislation of all the CIS states," Suleymenov  pointed out.    He stressed that Kazakhstan was also very interested in  another document - the declaration on sovereignty, territorial  integrity and inviolability of the CIS states' borders. "These  issues are of great importance for us now. We are satisfied  with the adoption of this document," Suleymenov stressed.</p>

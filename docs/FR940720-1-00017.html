			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the Navigation Safety Advisory Council (NAVSAC), a congressionally mandated advisory group, has been reviewing the Inland Navigation Rules for consistency with the 72 COLREGS. As part of this ongoing review, NAVSAC has recommended several regulatory changes to clarify ambiguities in practical application of the rules as well as to bring the Inland Navigation Rules into closer conformity with the 72 COLREGS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Proposed Amendments to Conform to 72 COLREGS Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In November 1995, eight amendments to the 72 COLREGS will become effective. NAVSAC has endorsed amending the Inland Navigation Rules technical annexes to reflect these changes to the 72 COLREGS. These proposed amendments deal primarily with light placement requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Masthead Lights for Vessels Less Than 20 Meters in Length (&sect;84.05) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard is proposing to revise 33 CFR 84.05 to allow vessels less than 20 meters in length to carry their masthead light as far forward as is practicable. This would result in no substantive change for mariners because Inland Navigation Rule 23(a) already provides that vessels less than 20 meters in length may carry their masthead lights as far forward as is practicable. However, this proposed change to &sect;84.05 would maintain parallel language between the Inland Navigation Rules and the 72 COLREGS. Although the 72 COLREGS amendment was originally based on a U.S. proposal to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to amend Rule 23(a)(i), the IMO Subcommittee chose to amend technical Annex I rather than Rule 23(a)(i). The proposed revision will ease compliance for mariners who will be able to refer to parallel language in Annex I of the 72 COLREGS and Annex I of the Inland Rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Use of Two Lights To Meet Angular Sector Requirements (&sect;84.17) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed amendment would allow the pairing of light fixtures to ensure all round visibility of navigation lights. This change would maintain consistency with the corresponding 72 COLREGS amendment. On a vessel with a mast of large diameter, such as a warship or a vessel with a combined smoke stack and mast configuration, it is often structurally impractical to mount a single all around light at a sufficient distance from the mast to meet the 6 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; angular cutout requirements of the Navigation Rules, which prescribe a maximum 6 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; blind zone. This problem can be addressed either through the use of two separate lights adequately screened, or two lights close enough together that they appear, for all practical purposes, as one light. This proposed regulation will specifically allow the use of two lights sufficiently screened or placed near enough together that they appear as one light at a distance of one mile. Two unscreened all-around lights that are 1.28 meters (4.2 feet) apart or less will appear as one light to the naked eye at a distance of one mile. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> High Speed Craft (&sect;84.27) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed amendment would allow modern high speed catamarans and other craft of unusually wide design to carry masthead lights at a lower level than would otherwise be prescribed by the rules. This change will keep the Inland Annex I in conformity with an amendment to the 72 COLREGS Annex I. The proposal would create a new provision for high speed craft. The proposed definition of high speed craft is the same as is used in IMO's ``Draft Code of Safety of High Speed Craft''. This change recognizes that existing light placement requirements based on traditional ship design are often impractical when dealing with non-traditional designs such as catamarans and SWATH (Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull) craft. The proposed definition of high speed craft includes a formula which captures those vessels, such as hydrofoils and hovercraft, that can exceed conventional craft hull speed through use of dynamically supportable hull designs. The corresponding 72 COLREGS amendment was drafted such that modern catamaran and non-displacement craft that are unusually wide relative to their length and capable of speeds generally in excess of 25 knots, would not be required to carry their masthead light at a heights unreasonable for the size of the vessel. This new provision would apply to vessels that meet the definitional requirements for both high speed craft and have a length to breadth ratio of less than three-to-one. The following example illustrates the calculations for mast height on a vessel meeting the definitional requirements: A high speed catamaran ferry, 59 meters in length with a 20 meter beam, may carry its forward masthead light 5.1 meters above the sidelights, instead of 8 meters above the hull. (Sidelights need only be placed above the hull high enough so as not to be interfered with by deck lights). The definition of ``high speed craft'' is based on a formula that compares displacement to maximum speed. Generally hydrofoils, surface effect ships, some light monohulls and catamarans will meet this definition, while conventional displacement vessels, tankers, fishing vessels and container ships, will not. Certain high powered displacement vessels such as frigates or destroyers may meet this definition but would not meet the length to breadth ratio requirements. Because compliance with the proposed provision for high speed craft would be required only in lieu of compliance with &sect;84.03(a)(1), existing vessels need not modify their light configurations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IMO considered extending the use of the yellow light provided for in Rule 23(b) for air-cushioned vessels to all high speed craft. However, this light is intended to draw to the attention of other vessels the possibility that an air-cushioned vessel may be proceeding at a large yaw angle. Thus, the navigation lights may not give an accurate indication of the track made good. Therefore, the IMO determined that extending the use of the yellow light to all high speed craft would be inappropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: BT supported The significant underperformance of BT shares over the past six months was highlighted by a number of broking houses, including Kleinwort Benson, which removed BT from its sell list for the first time since early 1993. Further support for the shares came as BZW reiterated its buy stance. These investment notes saw BT shares bounce off their lowest level since October 1992, to close a net 7 firmer at 368 1/2 . BT partly-paid stock added a similar amount at 250 1/2 p. BZW said the major trigger for BT's underperformance has been the sell-off in US bonds and high yielding stocks. The investment bank said that, once the full-year figures, due on May 19, are out of the way, it hopes that a return to relative stability in the bond markets may allow a review of the stock's fundamentals. Kleinwort said BT's underperformance reflected investor concerns of increasing competition, especially from cable operators. BZW expects BT to achieve preliminary pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.76bn and a dividend total of 16.8p, while Kleinwort is going for profits of Pounds 2.75bn and a dividend total of 16.7p.</p>

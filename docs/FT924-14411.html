			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: EC environment rules will stay, Howard says EUROPEAN Community directives on environmental standards would not be abandoned as part of the government's work on subsidiarity, or minimum interference by the EC Commission, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said yesterday. Mr Howard, speaking after his conference address, said it was hard to see any directives that should be repealed, although there were some that should be reviewed. He emphasised that the environment was an area in which many of the issues crossed national boundaries and he indicated that even directives that were less obviously trans-European, such as those on beaches and on drinking water quality, would remain. However, he added that it was now unlikely that the Commission would legislate in some areas where it had planned to do so, for example on standards in zoos across the EC. Mr Howard's defence of the Commission's role in environmental issues was matched in his conference speech by his emphasis on its duties in ensuring proper enforcement of EC directives by all the member states, as included in the Maastricht treaty. The representatives warmly applauded his comment: 'I'm getting sick and tired of taking lectures from countries who don't take a blind bit of notice of existing laws themselves'. He suggested that the drive for stricter enforcement might end 'the cynical charade of countries signing up to new laws to catch headlines at home when they have not the slightest intention of putting them into effect'. Mr Howard is to receive a report at the EC summit which is to be held in Edinburgh in December from Mr Karel van Miert, the acting environment commissioner, on whether member states of the community are complying with EC legislation. Next month the UK is to host a conference for environmental inspectors from across Europe that is intended to establish a common approach to enforcing the EC's directives on the environment.</p>

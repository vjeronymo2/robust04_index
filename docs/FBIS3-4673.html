But the mission headed by Ambassador Yasue Katori emphasized  the need for "transparency and accountability" in implementing  official development assistance (ODA) extended to the  Philippines.    Hideaki Ueda, a member of the mission, said reports of  corruption in the use of ODA in the Philippines have triggered  criticism in Japan. He said, however, no particular case was  discussed during the talks.    Japan is the Philippine's biggest foreign donor, providing  37  percent or about 2 billion dollars of all ODA to the country  last year.    In a joint press statement, the mission also said the  philippines should continue to further "self-help efforts,"  particularly in the areas of tax reform and agrarian reform. It  also expressed Japan's desire for the Philippines to "pay full  consideration to the environment impact of development projects."    Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said the Philippines  responded by expressing its intention to continue "self-help  efforts," particularly in raising counterpart funds related to  ODA projects.    Manila also said it "recognized the need for greater  transparency and accountability in the implementation of ODA"  and pointed to parallel efforts toward environmental  conservation.    The two sides agreed that future Japanese assistance will be  channeled to economic infrastructure, support for the  restructuring of industries and development of agriculture,  poverty alleviation and environment conservation. The mission  also expressed support for grass-roots projects in these fields.    Ueda said the philippines will be a major recipient of  future  Japanese aid but could not say how much of Tokyo's 70-75 billion  dollar outlay for 1993-1997 Manila would be getting. He also  said an early agreement between the Philippines and the  International Monetary Fund would make discussions on future  assistance easier but said this was not a "precondition" for the  grant of Japanese ODA.</p>

The giant U.S. aircraft maker has not officially nixed the  project itself, but it is believed that the program will wilt in  light of Boeing's recent decision to simply remodel its 737 into  a successor known as the 737X, according to Japanese sources.    The Japanese view that it had little choice but to bow out  underscores how tightly this nation's aircraft industry has tied  its fate to Boeing. Even as the YXX program fades away, new  projects are on the horizon for Japan, but all of them in one  way or another depend on Boeing's moves.    The relationship dates back decades, but a key turning point  was in 1981, when Boeing planners envisioned that the follow-on  to their highly successful 737 would be the 150-seat 7J7, known  in Japan as the YXX.    In a move that brought howls from U.S. critics who claimed  Boeing was giving away America's key technologies on a silver  platter, the firm turned to Japan for 25&percnt; of the  investment  dollars and a piece of the development and manufacturing  responsibilities.    Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry  regarded  the YXX project as an important step toward the eventual goal of  a Japanese-developed passenger aircraft.    Several Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries, Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., and Fuji  Heavy Industries, Ltd., have spent more than a decade  researching and developing aspects of the YXX.    MITI recently revealed it has decided to suspend the YXX  project next fiscal year, beginning in April. Bureaucrats have  reduced the proposed spending for the YXX project in the 1994  fiscal year budget to an amount needed simply to pull loose ends  together.    For the post-737 aircraft, Boeing has decided to modify its  existing 737, in order to save on development costs. The 737 is  the world's best-selling passenger aircraft, with total orders  of more than 3,000.    MITI officials concluded that, in light of Boeing's plans  for  the 737X, a YXX wouldn't be competitive.    Industry sources said Boeing and Japan have reached a basic  agreement on Japanese participation in the new 737X project.  Boeing has proposed to limit Japan's share to wing-related  parts, the sources added, becausethere will be only limited  modifications to the 737 aircraft.    Most parts and components of the 737 have been manufactured  within the U.S. and will continue to be. Given that Boeing is  implementing drastic streamlining measures, including slashing  employees, offering jobs to Japan is quite unlikely, Japanese  officials said.    In addition, the appreciation of the yen and relatively  expensive labor cots would make Japanese parts costly for  Boeing, they added.    On the other hand, Korea announced recently that it would  take part in the 737X project. Japanese officials also suspect  that China would join the project.    Earlier 1993, Japan's major aircraft builders started  shipping components for Boeing's new 777 passenger plane. The  industry hopes such shipments will help offset business lost  because of declining Japanese defense spending.    While the decline of the YXX project is a setback for  Japan's  hopes to invigorate its aerospace industry, MITI has another  plan in the works.    The budget is expected to balloon next year for another  proposed aircraft, the 75-seat YSX regional jet.    This time the project is being led by a private Japanese  consortium, heavily backed by the government, which is hoping to  attract other nations. Officials would especially like to lure  China into the project since that nation's 21st-century appetite  for regional jets is expected to be huge.    It also is said in Japanese circles that the tables are  being  turned on the U.S. It is Boeing, according to industry sources,  that is knocking on Japan's door in hopes of getting a piece of  the project.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Panamanian military has agreed to participate in talks toward ending the  political crisis involving Defense Forces chief Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, the  government said. The military will be included in the government delegation,  Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter said in a letter to the Organization of American  States. The talks among the government, military and opposition were proposed  last week by an OAS mission, which has made two trips to Panama City since the  government annulled a May election that observers said the opposition won  handily. The government had insisted that the role of Gen. Noriega, Panama's de  facto leader, is "not negotiable." But a Foreign Ministry statement, which  included parts of Ritter's letter, did not mention Noriega.  </P></p>

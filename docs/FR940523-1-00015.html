			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some software changes would not be significant enough to require recertification. PAVE-certified presort product developers would be required to notify the Postal Service whenever changes were made to their certified products to determine whether recertification were necessary. To aid in the quick release of improved presort products to accommodate mailing industry needs, the Postal Service proposes the establishment of a toll-free telephone number, to obtain information on whether the changes would warrant recertification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> DMM-Initiated PAVE Cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any significant change in the make-up and preparation standards for presorting might intersect the normal 12-month PAVE certification period. Such a change might require a presort product developer to modify its product enough to trigger a recertification or a DMM-initiated PAVE cycle. To provide time for recertification, the Postal Service would attempt to delay implementation of significant presort standard changes (those deemed significant enough to require recertification) by 120 days whenever practicable. The Postal Service would implement these changes 120 days after the final date of notification (i.e., the date of publication of the final  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  rule) whenever possible. (Some changes, such as those resulting from congressional action or postal rate commission proceedings, might require more immediate implementation.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Postal Service conducted PAVE testing out of the normal cycle to accommodate such DMM changes, presort products tested and approved during this time would maintain certification for 1 year beyond the next normal test period. For instance, if a DMM change became effective May 1995, a presort product that became PAVE-certified in July 1995 (out of cycle to meet the new standard) would be issued a PAVE certificate valid from July 1995 until January 1997 (unless further DMM changes warranted significant software updating).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Out-of-Cycle Fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participating in the PAVE certification program during the normal testing cycle would be free of charge. In those instances when a DMM-initiated PAVE cycle was conducted, participation would also be free of charge. A fee, however, would be charged for those participating in the PAVE program outside the normal test cycle. This fee would be assessed as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Test File_Initial presort category (file generation, postage and handling)_$50.00  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 --> ($10.00 for each additional test category requested at the same time)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Certification_Results evaluation (presort analysis and documentation review)_$200.00  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 --> ($25.00 for each additional test category submitted at the same time)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Minimum Fee_$250.00 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Out-of-cycle PAVE certifications would expire at the end of the next normal test cycle (e.g., a certification obtained in June would expire December 31 of that same year).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> PAVE Test Failures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants would receive notification of errors during PAVE test evaluations so that retesting could be accomplished within the normal PAVE cycle. Although November 15 through December 31 is proposed as an established time frame for retesting, the Postal Service would strive to expedite the mailing and evaluation of retests whenever possible. The first 2 attempts for a specific category would be free of charge. All subsequent certification attempts would be charged the out-of-cycle fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Software not achieving certification prior to December 31 would not be included in the list of PAVE-certified presort product developers to be published in January of each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

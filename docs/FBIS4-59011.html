			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben and Washington </F> correspondent 'Aqiva Eldar]    [Excerpts] Israel does not view U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's shuttle mission as a substitute for direct  talks with Syria, either in the framework of the Washington  talks or at a higher level, senior political sources stated  yesterday. According to these sources, Israel regards the U.S.  mediation as an auxiliary element of the negotiations aimed at  settling matters of principle, but believes the details must be  discussed directly by the sides. [passage omitted]    The senior political sources said that the gap between the  Israeli and Syrian positions is very big and that detailed  deliberations in working groups can only start after a framework  for the negotiations has been determined. [passage omitted]    'Aqiva Eldar reports: The United States neither supports nor  rejects the Israeli plan for an arrangement with Syria. Israeli  and U.S. officials in Washington asserted yesterday that  Secretary Christopher relayed the Israeli proposal to Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad without adopting a position on it.  Referring to the banner headline in HA'ARETZ yesterday ("The  United States Has Reservations About the Israeli Proposal"),  Israeli sources said they had been told by senior State  Department officials that Christopher had neither rejected nor  criticized the Israeli proposals.</p>

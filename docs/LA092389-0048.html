			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE IN THE TICKET LINE  </P> <P> Re Sylvie Drake's Sept. 14 Stage Watch report on how I was assaulted while in  line to buy tickets at the James A. Doolittle Theater. The assailant was one of  many scalpers, each purchasing 12 to 34 tickets for "Who's Afraid of Virginia  Woolf."  </P> <P> Easily 75% of the people in line were aged 12 to 18, giving this theatrical  event the look of a Metallica concert.  </P> <P> The Doolittle's Gordon Davidson is right in noting there is no law to stop  ticket-buying abuse. However, L.A. theaters do have an obligation to honor  customers' right to buy reasonably priced, quality seats without having to bow  to violence or the greed of a few.  </P> <P> MICHAEL K. NAGEL  </P> <P> Culver City  </P> <P>  Nagel required 23 surgical stitches after the Sept. 10 assault which occurred  during an exchange between people in line to buy tickets for themselves and a  group there to buy for brokers. His assailant escaped.  </P> <P> </P></p>

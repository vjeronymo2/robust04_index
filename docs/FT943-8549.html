			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Cash bags seized in Siberia Police at a Siberian airport have seized bags stuffed with 1,300kg of cash worth Rbs7bn (Pounds 2.2m at the market rate). The six sacks were to have been flown by special aircraft from Irkutsk to Volgograd in central Russia, according to Itar-Tass news agency. The Irkutsk deputy governor said there were no documents for the cargo, which was traced to an investment firm called The Russian House of Selenga. A year ago, a Volgograd court ruled that the firm was operating illegally but it has continued to take investors' money, according to the Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper. On Tuesday the firm placed advertisements in Volgograd newspapers informing shareholders it was suspending operations, but promising to return their money. The firm's activities are under investigation.</p>

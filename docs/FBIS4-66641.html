			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal; all quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 14--The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V.  Narasimha Rao, today urged friends of Pakistan--an obvious  reference to the United States, among others--to persuade  Islamabad to be responsive to India's approach for normalising  and building up bilateral relations. The Pakistan Prime  Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, had heightened the anti-India  rhetoric to unprecedented levels on Kashmir which, naturally,  aim in the way of dialogue he said.    Mr. Rao underscored the futility of this course, for  eventually she would have to come to the negotiation table. Her  own father had signed the Shimla agreement and someone had to  tell her, according to Mr. Rao, to adhere to it.    The Prime Minister made these points in a conversation with  the visiting U.S. Senator, Mr. Daniel Patrick Moynihan who said  he would convey these views to his President, Mr. Bill Clinton.  Mr. Moynihan gave a similar assurance when Mr. Rao stressed the  urgency of all out efforts to end the Bosnia crisis which was  fuelling the fires of Muslim fundamentalism all over the world.    The current state of Indo-Pakistan--and also  Indo-U.S.--relations figured at length at the meeting the Prime  Minister had with Mr. Moynihan who is the chairman of the U.S.  Senate Panel on South Asia and a former Ambassador to India.  <H5>  Framework Exists </H5>   Mr. Moynihan, who sought the Prime Minister's views on  Indo-Pakistan ties, was told that a framework of dialogue  between the two countries already existed in the form of the  Shimla Agreement. India, according to Mr. Rao, had offered to  continue talks for good-neighbourly relations but Pakistan's  actions in continuing its support to terrorism in Jammu and  Kashmir and its world-wide anti-India propaganda were major  barriers. According to Mr. Moynihan, the United States continued  to favour the Shimla Agreement framework for Indo-Pakistan talks.    The present rhetoric was not going to help Pakistan, said  Mr.  Rao. Unless Islamabad jettisoned the Shimla framework there was  no justification for its leaders to go from place to place. "I  am a serious-minded person. I do not want to indulge in  rhetoric. It would be waste of time and energy and would  encourage tension," Mr. Rao said.  <H5>  `Strange' </H5>   It was strange, according to the Prime Minister, that India  should be blamed for human rights violation when it had an  independent judiciary, free press, and democratic system--and  now a human rights commission to probe cases of excesses. Mr.  Moynihan remarked: "You have my sympathies and respect."    Regarding Indo-U.S. relations, they discussed both the  positive and the negative aspects in the bilateral field. Mr.  Moynihan was happy at the growth of economic ties, as evidenced  by the level of U.S. investments in India last year, which was  higher than that of the previous 40 years. He expressed  satisfaction at the progress of the economic liberalisation  programme in India.  <H5>  `We don't have bomb' </H5>   As the discussion turned to nuclear non-proliferation, Mr.  Rao assured Mr. Moynihan that India did not have a bomb and  therefore there was no question of dismantling it. If they  (Pakistan) have it they should dismantle it, he said.    Mr. Rao's reference to "friends of Pakistan" was obviously  intended to be a hint to the United States to try to restrain  Pakistan from pursuing its no-holds-barred anti-India campaign.  In the immediate context, it could mean persuading Pakistan to  continue the dialogue begun last month at the level of Foreign  Secretaries on the basis of the six Indian proposals, regarded  as positive by Washington, instead of using the international  for anti-India tirades.    As a matter of fact, the Pakistan Foreign Secretary, Mr.  Shahryar Khan, was now in Washington--obviously to seek U.S.  support to his Government's move to use the U.N. Human Rights  Commission for an anti-India campaign. This could be an  appropriate occasion for the United States, if it so wanted, to  counsel Pakistan against recklessness.    Mr. Moynihan's visit here comes in the wake of the Senate  panel's hearings where the Clinton Administration's policy on  South Asia and the style of the Assistant Secretary of State,  Ms. Robin Raphel--the cause of extreme disquiet here--were  sharply criticised. Mr. Moynihan strongly defended India on the  human rights issue, saying that its Constitution provided firm  guarantees of individual freedom and its record since 1947 was  impeccable. This was followed by a warning about the futility of  mechanical application of the standards of civil liberties to  situations of ethnic conflicts.</p>

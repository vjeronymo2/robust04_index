			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: The watchdog bites harder DO LIFE insurance customers finally have a strong watchdog looking out for their interests? Lautro, the life assurance regulator, yesterday fined Guardian Royal Exchange Pounds 100,000, the highest penalty it has yet imposed. It has increased its record fine three times this year. In June it levied a fine of Pounds 50,000 on Norwich Union, for a misleading advertisement, and then fined General Accident and Commercial Union the same sum for investing in the disgraced Levitt Group. Then, last week, it fined London &amp; Manchester Assurance Pounds 80,000 for breaches of sales rules by its tied agents. GRE had made the same mistake. Lautro found that it had failed to monitor two agents tied to selling its life products exclusively, Centrust and Coventry Investment Group, in the three years up to February 1991. Both companies are now out of business, and investors are claiming compensation. So it looks like Lautro is getting tougher. However, Julia Liesching, Lautro's chief policy and administration officer, denies this. Instead, she says that procedures have been improved, and the disciplinary process had speeded up, leading to a faster resolution of cases. Has the watchdog bitten GRE hard enough? Peter Buckell, a spokesman for the Centrust Investors' Action Groups, said he was pleased the fine had been levied, but disappointed Lautro had not used its power to demand that compensation be paid to investors. He also regretted that Lautro had taken so long to act. Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy for the Consumers' Association, welcomed the trend towards stiffer penalties. She said: 'Certainly Lautro is looking a lot more effective than it did a year ago. The trend is right. Whether it is enough is another matter.' She pointed out that other regulators had not been as strict as Lautro, particularly where the insurance operations of high street banks were concerned. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission can levy fines in millions of dollars, according to Eaglesham. GRE said that important changes had been made to its control procedures and it had not appointed any new tied agents for 18 months. Its total number of agents has gone from 900 to about 500. So far, the company has offered Pounds 164,000 in compensation to 30 Centrust clients, and another 20 claims are being processed. It has asked other policyholders to come forward. Even if Lautro has not deliberately toughened its stance, a leaner, more efficient watchdog should still provide valuable added defence for investors.</p>

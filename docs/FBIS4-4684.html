			<p>BFN     [Text] On 1 April, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi  Ichikawa said he felt that now that the political reform bills  have been enacted, the ruling coalition parties should reexamine  agreements they made last July and work out agreements regarding  such issues as security policies and tax system reform, in  particular. He made the remark during a news conference at a  hotel in Kyoto, where he made an appearance during part of his  stumping tour. Specifically, Ichikawa proposed a plan to set up  a new "council on basic issues" (tentative name) under the  coalition party representatives' conference to coordinate  policies among the ruling coalition parties in preparation for  the next general election. He plans to formally present the  proposal at a 4 April representatives meeting.    Regarding the political situation since the enactment of the  political reform bills, Ichikawa said: "The situations at home  and abroad have drastically changed since the coalition  government's inauguration last July, as exemplified by such  developments as the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development."  He then stressed the need for working out agreements among  ruling coalition parties to promote cooperation in the next  general election, saying: "We should work out both an agreement  on mutually essential points and a new outline of policies."    In the ruling coalition alliance, a plan to set up a "policy  study group" was recently shelved due to opposition by such  parties as the Social Democratic Party of Japan. This study  group was expected to serve as a stepping stone toward the  formation of a new party to unify the coalition partners into a  single party. In this regard, Ichikawa said: "In the future,  even should the ruling coalition parties decide not to move  toward (the formation of) a new party, they cannot cooperate in  elections unless their basic policies are coordinated."    Regarding the process of making adjustments among ruling  coalition parties in selecting candidates for the next general  election, Ichikawa said: "I expected the process to begin in  April, but the issue of setting up a policy study group has  created unnecessary misunderstandings, resulting in straining  the relations (among the coalition partners). Therefore, there  may be a slight delay." He thus indicated the process is  expected to start later than originally planned.</p>

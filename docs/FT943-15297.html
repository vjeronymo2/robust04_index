			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / World News in Brief: Footsie knocked by US jobless figures The FT-SE 100 Index ended 2 points off at 2,962.4 after US employment news drove it down 12 points. The market rallied when Wall Street came in higher. Over the week, the Footsie gained 26 points as investors became more confident that the Group of Seven leading industrial nations meeting which closes tomorrow would not bring any aggressive action on global interest rates.

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Brussels clears BT-MCI link The European Commission has cleared an alliance between British Telecom and MCI, the US operator, to provide global telecom services to multinational companies. The ruling, which remains in effect until the year 2000, removes the last serious regulatory hurdle to the deal which US authorities approved earlier this month. The ruling yesterday is the first in-depth examination by Brussels of global alliances in the fast growing telecom market. The ruling covers the plan by BT to take a 20 per cent stake valued at Dollars 4.3bn (Pounds 2.77bn) in MCI and the proposed joint venture known as Concert to provide services such as data transmission, video-conferencing and global calling cards. The Commission said the BT stake in MCI was not a threat to competition as BT had no possibility of controlling or influencing MCI. On the other hand, it would restrict competition as the two companies were at least 'potential competitors' in the market for value added services and general telecommunications. It also found that the appointment of BT as exclusive distributor of Concert within the European Economic Area (EEA) - which covers the EU as well as Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden  -was anti-competitive. It has obtained an assurance that any user in the EEA will be able to obtain Concert's services through MCI. In addition, a provision intended to dissuade MCI from entering the EEA market will last for five years.</p>

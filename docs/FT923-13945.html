			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Renault first-half sales best for 12 years TWO of Europe's biggest motor groups yesterday reported increased sales for the first half of 1992. Renault, the French state-owned car maker, sold 767,000 cars in the first six months of the year, its best first-half performance since 1980. This is a 4.8 per cent rise on the first half of last year and lifts Renault's share of the European market for private cars from 9.9 per cent to 10.5 per cent over the same period a year earlier, said Mr Patrick Faure, marketing director. He was optimistic about the company's outlook, but warned that he saw no signs of recovery in the European market. The performance lifts Renault's share of the French market by three percentage points over the past year, to 30 per cent, where it is level pegging with the combined forces of Peugeot and Citroen. Renault's unit sales in Germany, its biggest export market, fell by 12 per cent, but it held market share as the Renault 19 continued to be the biggest selling imported car. Separately, Valeo, France's biggest supplier of car components, reported a 7.8 per cent increase in first-half sales, from FFr10.3bn to FFr11.1bn (Dollars 2.2bn). Of the total, 68 per cent was to truck and car makers, with the remaining 32 per cent to the repairs market, where turnover rose by 3.7 per cent over the comparable period. Audi, part of the Volkswagen group, reported a drop of 13 per cent to DM315m (Dollars 210m) in pre-tax profits for the first half of this year, despite a sharp rise in sales. The company said the profits decline stemmed from the fact that it was now selling more cars in export markets, where margins are lower due to distribution and marketing costs, after the slackening of the German market which had previously benefited from unification. In 1991, Audi's net profits jumped by 30 per cent to DM370m, helped by a lower tax bill. Audi's turnover in the first six months was 20 per cent higher at DM8.6bn, with unit sales up by 15 per cent to 271,200 cars. Mr Ferdinand Piech, the chief executive of Audi who becomes head of the VW group next January, said the company intended to increase output to some 490,000 cars from last year's 451,000. This, he told the annual meeting, would 'have a positive impact on earnings'. Turnover should exceed DM16bn, a rise of some 8 per cent on the DM14.8bn of 1991.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ASH benefits from reduced costs and improves to Pounds 7m AUTOMATED Security (Hold-ings), the international electronic security systems company, yesterday reported higher interim profits reflecting sharply lower interest charges and UK reorganisation costs. For the six months to May 31 pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 4.92m to Pounds 7.13m although at the operating level they fell because of margin pressures in the core UK alarms business. The year-ago figures have been restated to comply with FRS 3 accounting standards. Interest charges were reduced from Pounds 8.93m to Pounds 3.15m and costs related to reorganisation of the group's UK operations over the past 18 months amounted to Pounds 953,000 (Pounds 4m). Mr Tom Buffett, chairman, said the first half had seen a continuation of difficult trading conditions in the UK, while the US operations continued to expand and perform well. He said the group's overall results were 'about Pounds 1m below expectations' because of the underperformance in the UK. Earnings emerged at 2.2p (0.4p). The interim dividend is 3.05p (2.25p) with the alternative of an enhanced scrip dividend. Turnover from continuing operations increased to Pounds 74.3m (Pounds 64.5m) and recurring revenues grew by 17 per cent to Pounds 42m. Operating profits dropped to Pounds 11.2m, including Pounds 446,000 from acquisitions, compared to Pounds 19.4m a year ago which included Pounds 5.75m from the discontinued operations. Mr Buffett said that in spite of tough conditions in the UK the group had succeeded in retaining its market share. Revenues from continuing operations in the UK grew by 8 per cent and recurring revenues showed a 5 per cent increase. He added that the UK cost base had been substantially reduced by the reorganisation which included reducing the workforce by some 700 to 2,200.</p>

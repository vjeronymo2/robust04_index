			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sune Olofson: "Acute Financial Crisis in the Air </F> Force"]    [Text] The Air Force has landed in an acute financial  crisis. There is a shortfall of nearly 700 million kronor for  this fiscal year. A contributing reason is that the JAS project  has become 5 to 6 billion more expensive than estimated due  solely to the lower value of the krona and the high dollar  exchange rate.  <H5>  Later Payment </H5>   "We have been forced to postpone several of this year's  materiel orders, primarily for the JAS project, to next year. We  have also negotiated with industry, so that we can pay a little  later," says Lieutenant Colonel Arne Heden, head of the  coordination section of the Air Force command at the military  headquarters in Stockholm.    Last winter it was the Navy that was struggling with an  acute  deficit of 800 million. That problem was solved by Defense  Minister Anders Bjorck with very tough demands for savings and  an extra supplement of 400 million kronor through the sale of  oil from the emergency stores.    Now it is apparently the Air Force's turn. Air Force chief  Lars-Erik Englund has been summoned to the Defense Committee on  Thursday [5 May].    There he will, among other things, reply to questions about  the strained financial situation of JAS and why the costs of the  JAS project are not accounted for in a satisfactory manner,  something which the parliamentary JAS Committee has pointed out.  <H5>  Worried Command </H5>   Commander in Chief Bengt Gustafsson and Lars-Erik Englund  themselves recently took up the question of the Air Force's  runaway expenses in the military command's advisory commission,  which also includes politicians from the Defense Committee.    According to what SVENSKA DAGBLADET has learned, the  military  command is somewhat concerned that the Defense Ministry does not  really want to face the future seriousness of the situation.    Arne Heden maintains that the Air Force's problem is not  about an acute liquidity crisis but about the space within the  Air Force's planning framework that has shrunk due to the  reduced value of the krona and the previously very high dollar  exchange rate.  <H5>  High Exchange Rate </H5>   Approximately 30 percent of the technology of the JAS  aircraft was bought abroad at a high exchange rate, which has  resulted in a collapse of the financial planning calculations.    "I believe that we have the situation under control. We will  hardly exceed the budget for this year. But if the krona does  not strengthen and the dollar rate goes down, after 1994/95 we  will have problems of financing what we have planned for,"  stresses Arne Heden.    He admits that the Air Force planners to some extent have  postponed the problems in the hopes that the Swedish economy and  the foreign exchange rates will stabilize.    If the high costs continue, there are really only two things  to do: reduce operations, disband units, or allocate the Air  Force new money.    The government will shortly decide about buying a  radar-guided interceptor missile for the JAS 39 Gripen. If the  government chooses to buy approximately 500 missiles, although a  lower number is being discussed, the order amount will be at  least a couple of billion kronor.    According to Arne Heden, the missile deal is not affected by  the situation that has developed, "since money has already been  allocated for missiles for the JAS."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report from the Center for the State of the Economy at the </F> Government of the Russian Federation: "Structure of Russia's  Foreign Trade Turnover in 1993 by Sector"]    [Text] The Center for the State of the Economy at the  Government of the Russian Federation, on the basis of official  statistical data on foreign trade turnover, has conducted an  analysis of changes in the branch structure of Russia's exports  and imports with states of the far abroad for the first nine  months of 1992 and 1993.  <H5>  EXPORTS </H5>   During the period January-September 1993, as compared with  the same period in 1992, the share of production of the fuel and  power engineering complex declined somewhat, and amounted to  53.5 percent as opposed to 55.4 percent.    The production share of the metallurgy complex rose from  14.5  percent to 17.1 percent. However, the share of non-ferrous  metallurgy declined from 9.5 to 7.5 percent, while at the same  time that of ferrous metallurgy increased and amounted to 8.6 as  opposed to 5.0 percent.    The share of exports of machine-building production  (including deliveries along the line of military-technical  cooperation) was reduced from 14.8 to 11.1 percent.    Exports from sectors of the chemical and wood products  complex increased from 9.1 to 11.2 percent. However, more  significant changes were observed in the timber, woodworking and  pulp-and-paper industries. For the first nine months of 1993 the  sector's share amounted to 4.4 percent, as opposed to 3.1  percent for the corresponding period in 1992. But exports of  chemical and petrochemical products rose from 6.0 to 6.7 percent.    The share of product exports from the agro-industrial  complex  showed an insignificant increase--from 2.2 to 3.0 percent.  <H5>  Fuel and Power Engineering Complex </H5> <H5>  Electrical Power Engineering </H5>   In the overall volume of exports, the sector's share is  insignificant. For the first nine months of 1993 it amounted to  0.3 percent in all, and remains practically at the level of the  corresponding period in 1992.    The value of electrical power exports for the first nine  months of 1993 was calculated at $95 million, as opposed to $85  million during the period January-September 1992. As before, the  main consumer of Russian electrical power is still Finland,  whose share of the overall volume is at the level of 85-90  percent.  <H5>  Oil and Gas Industry </H5>   The share of the oil and gas industry for the first nine  months of 1993 declined somewhat with respect to the first nine  months of 1992, and amounted to 52.0 percent as against 52.9  percent in 1992. The value of exports from the sector remained  practically at the level of the corresponding period of 1992,  and the sum total of exported production was $14.5 billion.  <H5>  Oil </H5>   The share of oil (including gas condensate) continues to  occupy a leading position in the structure of branch exports:  during the period January-September 1993 it amounted to 44.4  percent; that is, it increased by 3.2 percent.    The increase in oil export volume is taking place under  conditions of a continuing production slump. During the first  nine months of 1993, as compared with the same period in 1992,  the decline in oil extraction amounted to 13.3 percent, and  initial refinement of oil declined by 15.3 percent. In this  connection, the increase in the export volume of oil was made  possible primarily by virtue of significant reduction of exports  to countries of the near abroad. Thus, oil exports to these  countries during the period January-September 1993 declined, in  comparison with the corresponding period in 1992, by 43.9  percent, or by 25.5 million tonnes.  <H5>  Gas </H5>   Deliveries of gas to the export sector occupy second place  in  terms of value. The share of export gas in the period  January-September 1993 amounted to 36 percent, and with respect  to the corresponding period in 1992, declined by 2.0 percent.    The decline in the value of export gas is connected with a  decline in the level of both world and contract prices. While  the volume of deliveries increased by 6.6 percent, their value  declined by 5.2 percent.  <H5>  Petroleum Products </H5>   The share of petroleum products in sector exports was  reduced  from 21 percent to 19 percent, which is associated with changes  in the structure of deliveries, and with a decline in the level  of world and contract prices.    In all, during the period January-September 1993, petroleum  products valued at $2.7 billion were exported, as opposed to $3  billion during the corresponding period of 1992; that is,  exports declined by 10 percent on the average.    In spite of the decline in the value of petroleum product  exports, deliveries in physical terms increased by 44.5 percent,  or by 8.1 million tonnes, which is also taking place against a  background of reduced production volumes.  <H5>  Coal Industry </H5>   The share of exports of production of the coal industry  declined to 1.2 percent during the period January-September  1993, as opposed to 2.1 percent for the corresponding period in  1992. The value of exports amounted to $322 million, and  declined by $250 million, or by 44 percent.    There were significant changes in the structure for  deliveries in the sector: in terms of value the share of exports  of hard coal increased from 86 to 98 percent, and the export  share of brown coal declined from 14 to 2.0 percent.  <H5>  Metallurgy Complex </H5> <H5>  Ferrous Metallurgy </H5>   The export share of the sector rose from 5.0 percent in the  period January-September 1992 to 9.6 percent in  January-September 1993. This is the highest growth among all the  sectors. The value of exports increased nearly twofold and  amounted to $2.7 billion as opposed to $1.4 billion for the  first nine months of 1992.    Eighty-five percent of the value of the sector's exports  came  from deliveries of steel and rolled metal. In the first nine  months of 1993, their share was a little lower and amounted to  82 percent.  <H5>  Non-Ferrous Metallurgy </H5>   The export share of non-ferrous metallurgy for the first  nine  months of 1993 declined in comparison with the same period in  1992, from 9.5 to 7.5 percent, while the value of exports  decreased by $600 million.    Changes have been made in the export structure of the sector  over the past year. During the period January-September 1992,  aluminum comprised 32 percent; nickel, 18 percent; and platinum,  palladium and rhodium, 13 percent. During the period  January-September 1993, the export share of aluminum amounted to  41 percent; nickel, 16 percent; and platinum, palladium and  rhodium, 19 percent.  <H5>  Chemical and Timber Complex </H5> <H5>  Chemical and Petrochemical Industry </H5>   The share of chemical and petrochemical production showed  insignificant increase--from 6.0 to 6.7 percent. The value of  product exports from this sector amounts to $1.9 billion; that  is, an increase of 13.9 percent.  <H5>  Timber, Woodworking and Pulp-and-Paper Industries </H5>   The share of exports for products of the timber, woodworking  and pulp-and-paper industries increased from 3.1 percent for the  first nine months of 1992, to 4.5 percent for the first nine  months of 1993. On the whole, exports amounted to $1.8 million;  that is, a 49 percent increase.    Negative trends in the export structure remain and became  even more critical: these are connected with a reduction in the  export of ready-made products, and growth in the export of raw  materials. The share of non-processed wood materials rose from  35 to 41 percent; processed wood materials declined from 28 to  25 percent; and exports of wood pulp from timber were reduced to  the level of 1992 (12 percent).  <H5>  Machine-Building </H5>   The proportion of machine-building products (including  deliveries along the line of military-technical cooperation)  declined from 14.8 to 11.1 percent. In absolute terms, for the  first nine months of 1993, exports of machine-building products  declined in comparison with the corresponding period of 1992 by  23.5 percent and amounted to $3.1 billion. The decline in  exports in rather significant and is approaching one billion  dollars.    As in the past, the leading position in product exports in  this sector is occupied by motor vehicle deliveries. Their share  increased from 26 percent in January-September 1992 to 31  percent in January-September 1993. Next comes deliveries of  technological (including boiler) equipment, whose export share  has grown from 20 to 27 percent. The share of the remaining  kinds of machine-building production decreased slightly in the  period January-September 1993, or declined to the level of the  corresponding period in 1992.    Changes in deliveries of basic groups of machine-building  products for the first nine months of 1993, in comparison with  the corresponding period for 1992, in order of decreasing export  proportion in the sector, are shown in the following data:    Means of Ground Transport --91.2 percent    Technological Equipment --99.6 percent    Aircraft --50.7 percent    Electrical Equipment --71.6 percent    Optical Instruments and Apparati --76.5 percent    Rail Transport --42.8 percent    Exports of Clocks and Clockworks --10.0 percent  <H5>  Light Industry </H5>   As in January-September 1992, the light industry product  export share was insignificant, and amounted to 0.41 percent as  against 0.7 percent. Product exports in the sector declined from  $193 million to $114 million, or by 40.9 percent    Exports of cotton fabrics dropped by $40 million. Losses  from  reduced exports of products made from flax amounted to nearly  $10 million.    The share of deliveries of raw leather goods increased  somewhat, from 3.0 to 12.0 percent; for wool, from 2.0 to 4.0  percent; and for clothes from textile products, from 10 to 17  percent. At the same time, not only their export share but also  their export value increased--by 230, 13.3 and 4.3 percent,  respectively.  <H5>  Food Industry </H5>   The production share of food industry exports grew from 1.8  to 2.8 percent; in absolute terms the growth in exports amounted  to nearly $280 million.    A basic increase of $270 million was provided by virtue of  increasing deliveries of fish. Exports of fish grew by 82.1  percent, including a $150 million increase in sale of fish to  Japan; a $25 million sales increase to South Korea; and a $43  million sales increase to Norway.  <H5>  IMPORTS </H5>   As in the past, purchases of machine-building products  occupy  the leading position in imports; however, their share is  gradually decreasing from year to year, and according to data  from January to September 1993, it amounted to 38.5 percent, as  opposed to 40.7 percent for the corresponding period in 1992.    The share in product imports from the agro-industrial  complex  decreased from 28.5 to 25.5 percent. However, the import  dynamics of the sectors which make up the complex are taking  different directions. For example, the share of agricultural  products decreased from 14.8 to 10.8 percent, which is  principally connected with a gradual decline in state grain  procurement. The share of products from the food industry, on  the other hand, increased by 1.0 percent, and for  January-September 1993 was 14.7 percent as opposed to 13.7  percent.    Significantly, the share of products from the chemical and  timber complex decreased from 12.4 to 8.6 percent. Moreover, the  proportion for chemical and petrochemical products decreased  from 11.2 to 7.6 percent, while timber, wood-processing and  pulp-and-paper products remained practically at the level of  January-September 1992.    In the period under examination, the share of product  procurement from the metallurgical complex increased nearly  twofold, and for the first nine months of 1993 amounted to 6.9  percent. At the same time, ferrous metallurgy products increased  from 2.7 to 4.1 percent, and non-ferrous metallurgy products  from 1.3 to 2.8 percent.    A small amount of growth is seen in the proportion of  products from light industry, and its share for the period  January-September 1993 amounted to 12.3 percent, as opposed to  11.9 percent in the corresponding period of 1992.  <H5>  Machine-Building </H5>   In January-September 1993, as compared with the  corresponding  period for 1992, purchases of machine-building products declined  by more than $5 billion, and their share of the overall import  volume decreased from 40.7 to 38.5 percent.    As in the past, the leading place in imports of  machine-building products want to purchases of technological  equipment, whose share remained practically at the level of the  preceding period, and amounted to 51 percent.  <H5>  Metallurgy Complex </H5> <H5>  Ferrous Metallurgy </H5>   The share of imports of ferrous metallurgy products rose  from  2.7 to 4.1 percent.    The year 1993 was characterized by an increase in  procurement  of ready-made products, in particular pipe, whose share in  branch imports increased from 44 to 77 percent, and in terms of  costs by a factor of 1.4.    About 42 percent of imports fell to the procurement of pipe  for oil and gas pipelines, while 35.6 percent was made up of  import of pipe for drilling oil and gas wells. According to  information from the Institute on Economic Problems of the  Transition Period, production of drilling pipe in Russia has  decreased to 8.0 percent of the level of 1992; that is, it has  practically ceased. Therefore, it was necessary to make up for  their lack on the Russian market by procurement from import.  <H5>  Non-Ferrous Metallurgy </H5>   In imports, the share of non-ferrous metallurgy products  increased from 1.3 to 2.8 percent, and this is the only sector  for which import costs increased in the period January-September  1993 in comparison with the same period of 1992.    The increase took place primarily as a result of an increase  from 76 to 84 percent in the share of procurement of raw  materials for the aluminum industry. The share of raw material  procurement for production of zinc climbed from practically zero  to 6.0 percent.  <H5>  Light Industry </H5>   The share of this sector in overall import volume rose from  11.9 to 12.3 percent. On the whole, imports of products from  light industry declined by $1.4 billion; however, the rates of  decline in this sector, which amounted to 46.7 percent, lag  behind the rates of decline for imports as a whole.    During the period January-September 1993, the procurement  structure for imports changed somewhat, and the share of basic  goods was as follows:    Clothing from Textiles --29 percent    Shoes --18 percent    Knitted Wear --13 percent    Carpets --10 percent    Leather Goods --9.0 percent    Furs and Fur Goods --5.0 percent  <H5>  Agro-Industrial Complex </H5> <H5>  Food Industry </H5>   The share of the food industry increased from 13.5 to 14.7  percent. On the whole, food industry imports were reduced by  $1.5 billion; that is, the rate of decline of procurement of  food products amounted to 44.8 percent, which is somewhat lower  than the rate of decline for imports as a whole.  <H5>  Agricultural Products </H5>   The share of agricultural product imports declined rather  significantly--from 14.8 percent in January-September 1992 to  10.8 percent in January-September 1993, which corresponds to a  decrease of $2.4 billion, or 62.4 percent.    Since the mid-1980's, procurement of grain had occupied one  of the leading places in Russian imports; however, in 1993 grain  imports began to decline in comparison with preceding years.  Thus, in the period January-September 1993 the share of grain  imports in total agricultural product import volume declined  from 91 to 87 percent, which corresponds to a $2.2 billion  reduction in procurement.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico sets up Euro paper programme MEXICO has set up a Dollars 500m Euro commercial paper (ECP) programme, the first ECP programme to be established by a Latin American sovereign borrower. The ECP programme will allow Mexico to borrow in a broad range of OECD currencies with a maturity range of between 30 days and a year. Citicorp Investment Bank, which is the arranger and dealer for the programme, said Mexico would use the programme to establish its short-term debt profile in the hope of attracting international investment, for example, from money market funds. Mexico has built up a variety of international bonds ranging in maturity from one year to 10 years, including 30-year Brady bonds. So far, Mexico has not offered investors short-dated paper.</p>

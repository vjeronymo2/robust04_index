			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Technology: Square pegs in round holes - Judy Dempsey finds the Russian tank industry facing difficulties adjusting to civilian life For years, employees at the Lenin Engine Factory in Chelyabinsk, a sprawling, industrial city in the Urals, made tanks and tractors. The plant, part of a complex of enterprises set up by Stalin in the late 1920s, was in a privileged position. Money flowed in from the ministry of defence of the former Soviet Union to support a sector which was designed to turn the Soviet Union into a great superpower. Today morale at Lenin is low. Some of the production lines of an enterprise which employs 45,000 workers are making equipment for invalids. As part of bilateral agreements in arms reductions between the US and the former Soviet Union, and unilateral reductions on the part of the Russian side, the factory can no longer afford to roll tanks off the production lines. Funds, and orders from the ministry of defence, have been sharply reduced. Many at the factory are asking what impact these arms reductions will have on their jobs. Indeed, many are asking if it is really possible to convert tanks into wheelchairs. Oleg Guz, the 36-year-old manager of the tractor floor, recalls how the factory used to manufacture between 250-300 tanks a year. Now, he says, the assembly lines have to concentrate on making tractors, and finding ways to turn excess capacity into civilian projects. 'We have stopped making complete tanks here,' explained Guz. 'However, we are continuing to make parts for tanks, such as engines. The tanks are assembled at another plant. I cannot tell you how many engines the (Russian) ministry of defence have asked us to make for 1992. This is still classified information.' The plant first started the process of converting military equipment to civilian projects in 1989. But Guz said it could take three years to complete the conversion. 'There is no method in the conversion. There is no clear sense of direction from the central authorities. I suppose we will have to rely on our own resources in the future, and keep whatever profits we make in the factory itself,' he added. Even if the plant continued to make tanks and weaponry, Guz now recognises how the international market for such machinery has become competitive. The performance of western tanks in the Gulf war was a salutary lesson for Russia's military establishment. 'It was embarrassing for us. When we were producing the tanks, we were just following orders. We had no information on the levels of western superiority and quality. We now realise we have to produce goods which are marketable. That's why we need some joint ventures with western firms. We need a sense of direction,' said Guz. Yuri Disilov, who has worked in the plant for 31 years, shares the same sense of uncertainty. 'We never had to think about the future. Everything was controlled by the centre,' he says.' Because of this uncertainty, the Russian government has earmarked credit and financial assistance for the sector. Andrei Nechaev, Russia's economy minister, explained how soft credits would be lent to certain enterprises specialising in the production of military equipment. 'To activate the process of conversion, we are going to lend Rb 42bn to some enterprises. This money will be used for special projects related only to conversion. All enterprises which do not have orders from the state will have to convert, or else they will have to be closed,' explained Nechaev. State expenditure for purchasing arms in 1992 have been reduced by 50 per cent. The minister added that the Russian government could not ignore the social repercussions arising from conversion, or the sharp reductions in arms production. 'Conversion brings lots of social problems. Sometimes, whole towns are based solely on production of military equipment. If you stop production, you stop the whole life of the town. In order to guarantee some level of wages, and to cover social expenses, such as hospitals, housing and kindergartens which in the past have been partly financed by the profits of these enterprises, the government has already allocated Rb 40bn from this year's budget. But for the workers at the Lenin Engine Factory in Chelyabinsk, Moscow, the seat of the Russian government, this is a long way off. Sergei Mukharkin, co-chairman of the Union of Workers, an independent trade union, explained that sections of the management are not prepared to respond to the changes sweeping through Russian society. 'The situation here in the enterprises is confusing,' said Mukharkin. 'Our union knows that some of the management - still the same old communists because there has been no change in the personnel yet - are actually increasing the workers wages. This is pushing up the rate of inflation. I reckon this is an attempt to undermine the government's reforms,' said Mukharkin. He added that some workers have been forced to sign contracts agreeing to a shorter working week - with a corresponding cut in wages. 'If they don't sign the contracts, they will get the sack,' he said. These claims confirm not only the sense of uncertainty and confusion hanging over the military-industrial sector as it tries to come to terms with the collapse of the Soviet Union, reductions in the defence budget and the need to convert and find markets for their products. They indicate potential areas of social unrest for a Russian government which is committed to a reduction in military production and spending.</p>

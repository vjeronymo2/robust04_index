			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> BUSH ASKS COMPASSION ON AIDS  </P> <P> President Bush appealed today to Americans to demonstrate compassion for  victims of AIDS, saying that a "misplaced fear" of the deadly disease is  preventing some people from helping.  </P> <P> Bush underscored his point by touring the clinical wards of the National  Institutes of Health, meeting children ranging in age from less than a year to  the early teens who are being treated with experimental AIDS drugs. He was  accompanied by his wife, Barbara.  </P> <P> Later, addressing health professionals involved in fighting AIDS, Bush said, he  wanted to educate "Americans who don't want to help, don't want to become  involved because of a misplaced fear. They're afraid of holding an AIDS patient  because they're frightened of getting AIDS."  </P></p>

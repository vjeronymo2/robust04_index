			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Federal Express considers restructuring FEDERAL Express, the Memphis-based express package delivery company, has confirmed market suspicions that it is actively looking to restructure its international operations, although it would not speculate on when any decisions might be reached. The company released a formal statement saying it had been considering options aimed at reducing its losses overseas. It said these could include restructurings as well as co-operative or other business arrangements with third parties. Preliminary talks had been held with outside parties, it added, but the company stressed the examination of options was 'at this stage, exploratory only'. It said, 'No conclusions have been reached with respect to any courses of action the company may take, nor have there been any agreements with third parties.' The bulk of Federal Express's problems overseas have come in Europe. Last spring, the company took a Dollars 121m charge against earnings to cover workforce and other cuts in the UK and a large part of its British operation has been sold back to Littlewoods, the privately-owned UK retailer. In the second quarter of its current financial year - to end-November - Federal Express still reported operating losses of Dollars 64.5m, up from Dollars 54.7m a year earlier and said it was 'disgusted' with the performance.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Observer: Front runner The Battle of the Elliotts is being waged in Rotherham, Yorkshire. Should Olympic athlete Peter Elliott be honoured with one of the plaques to be put on the houses where the town's most famous offspring were born; or should the honour go instead to Ebenezer of the same surname? True, Peter is the more famous and is backed by the borough's Conservative councillors. But in this contest, at least, he looks bound to be an also-ran. For, although Ebenezer broke no world records, he left his mark on 19th century literature with verses such as: What is a communist? One who hath yearnings For equal division Of unequal earnings. Moreover, his candidature is backed by Rotherham's Labour councillors who outnumber their Tory counterparts by 64 to two.</p>

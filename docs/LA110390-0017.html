			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAYERS NOT GUILTY, BUT USC BAND IS  </P> <P> I would like to respond to the letter of Oct. 27 from Mr. Butler concerning the  USC band.  </P> <P> Come on. "Tribute to Troy"? "School songs"? "A band the university can be proud  of"? Don't you mean "Tribute to repetition," "School song" and "a band the  university should do something about"?  </P> <P> Let's face it. "The Song" is no longer inspiring. The results of the football  team will attest to this. How about a "Tribute to Mercy"?  </P> <P> STEVE ACOSTA  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

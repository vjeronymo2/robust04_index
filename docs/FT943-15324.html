			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Tricolori wave the flag of national pride - How Romanians are greeting their team's success Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's quarter-final against Sweden, it will be a long time before anyone in Romania forgets this year's World Cup. The success of the Romanian team, which went to the US as a rank outsider, has at last given this Balkan country something to celebrate after nearly five years of bruising market reforms and rising poverty and crime. The whole country seems to have been caught up by soccer fever. With each victory, more and more ecstatic Romanians have taken to the streets and danced till dawn in the biggest demonstrations since the overthrow of Stalinist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989. 'Ole, ola. We'll beat Sweden too. Argentina has said good-bye. Romania will take the cup,' jubilant crowds in Bucharest chanted after their team's 3-2 win against Argentina last Sunday. Hundreds of thousands of fans, many carrying the Romanian flag, cavorted through the centre of the capital for several hours, beeping car horns, jumping into fountains and using dustbins as drums. Riot police were used to keep wild fans out of the Bucharest embassies of those foreign countries unlucky enough to lose to the Tricolori, as the team is known locally. Romania's leaders have cashed in, giving lengthy television interviews on soccer tactics and firing off telegrams to the US to congratulate the team on Romania's greatest sporting success since the victory of gymnast Nadia Comaneci in the 1976 Olympic games. 'Our dear ones, no-one can describe the immense joy you have brought to the souls of the Romanians in that memorable night of July 3,' Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, an ardent soccer fan, wrote to the team after last Sunday's victory. Amid reports of Romanians of all ethnic backgrounds embracing each other after the match, President Ion Iliescu spoke glowingly of a 'national consensus' created by the victory. The team - led by Gheorghe Hagi, an ethnic Macedonian - reflects Romania's diversity and also includes representatives of the ethnic Hungarian, ethnic Serb and Gypsy minorities. Above all, politicians regard the team's performance as a public relations coup. 'You have made a whole country happy, and, much more, you have made great propaganda for our beloved homeland,' the prime minister told the team. Government officials say they hope the world will in future think of Romania as a land of soccer stars rather than of club-wielding miners, inter-ethnic violence and Aids-infected orphans - the images which filled the world's press in the aftermath of the 1989 revolution. Bursting with pride at Romania's three victories to date and at the torrent of international coverage they have provoked, local newspapers are reprinting stories about the team and its stars which have appeared abroad. Throughout the tournament, the top-selling Evenimentul Zilei (Event of the Day) has dedicated eight of its 12 pages to the World Cup. Other news, such as this week's parliamentary vote on impeaching President Iliescu, have been squeezed off the front pages by soccer. For the Romanian press, captain Hagi, 29, the most capped player in the team and scorer of three of Romania's eight World Cup goals, is the team's undisputed star. 'Hagi for President', read the headline in Evenimentul Zilei after the match with Argentina. Next in admiration come mid-fielder Ilie Dumitrescu - 'a flash of genius, a devil named Ilie' - who scored twice in the same match, and manager Anghel Jordanescu. These three, like many in the national team, share a background at Steaua Bucharest - Romania's top club since the mid-1980s. In 1986, Steaua, with Jordanescu as player and assistant coach, beat Barcelona to become the first team in what was then the East Bloc to win the European Cup. Until 1990 only a few Romanian players were allowed to play for foreign clubs. But since the fall of communism, footballers have become a top export. After a good performance in the World Cup in Italy, where Romania reached the second round, most of the country's best players won lucrative contracts at top European clubs, including Real Madrid, AC Milan and PSV Eindhoven. Eight of those due to face Sweden played abroad last season. If successful tomorrow, other Romanian players could notch up rich contracts. Already, Italian and British clubs have begun to negotiate for Steaua captain Ilie Dumitrescu, considered the best player left in Romania. Tottenham Hotspur and Barcelona are reportedly interested in acquiring Hagi, who has spent the last two seasons at Italian club Brescia after a year at Real Madrid. The departure of top players has weakened local league football and, with the national squad scattered all over the continent, made World Cup preparations difficult. But commentators believe that the international experience gained by Romanian players in the past four years is one of the main reasons for the team's new-found success.</p>

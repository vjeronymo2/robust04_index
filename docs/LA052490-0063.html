			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> MiXed Signals: A Christian Broadcasting Network engineer in Norfolk, Va.,  pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges of using CBN equipment to send religious  messages over the Playboy Channel and another cable operation.  </P> <P> Thomas Haynie is charged with satellite piracy in a six-count federal  indictment. He is alleged to have substituted unauthorized messages over the  channels in September, 1987. The messages stated: "Thus sayeth the Lord thy  God. Remember the Sabath and keep it holy. Repent, the kingdom of God is at  hand!" The evangelical warnings pre-empted a soft-porn movie on the Playboy  Channel. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

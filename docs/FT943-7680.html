			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Sport: Mavericks as heroes Last week I got lucky on a horse called Ezzoud, 4-1 winner of the Juddmonte International Stakes at York. A gamble is always a gamble, but a gamble on Ezzoud is really a gamble: he is always capable of winning but he does not, it seems, always want to do so. Betting on him, I was hoping not merely that he would overcome the other horses, but also that he would overcome himself, his own wayward temperament. Ezzoud had a handsome victory in the Coral Eclipse Stakes at Sandown last month, storming disdainfully past Derby and St Leger winners. Very soon afterwards, when strongly fancied in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot, he threw his jockey - poor helpless Walter Swinburn  -within about a second of the off. Throughout the whole of the race one glimpsed his blinkered face in its executioners hood, glinting demoniacally amid the other horses as he refused to do the decent thing and get out of everyone's way. I have backed a horse whose chances Ezzoud almost certainly scuppered. Nonetheless my overriding feeling was one of admiration for this free-thinking creature, who was running exactly the race that he wanted. It was a travesty, but it was magnificent. And it heightened immeasurably the pleasure that I felt when Ezzoud - this time carrying my money on his back - ran with such will and majesty at York last Tuesday. If a gamble on Ezzoud is a double gamble, then when it comes up it brings double the satisfaction. He is his own man, or horse: abundant with talent, miserly in its deployment: hugely frustrating, proportionately rewarding. His slit-eyed mask amid all those noble brows looks like a badge of disgrace, as indeed in a way it is. When it comes off his eye gleam wildly, faintly contemptuous and not a little sadistic: he knows that he has his followers horribly hooked. I love him. His heart is not always in the right place - quite often he keeps his brain there instead - but he is mesmerising and surprising, and, when he wants to be, almost great. Above all, he is remarkable for his independent spirit. This is a rare characteristic in sport: sports personalities may proclaim their autonomy, but, like most of us, they are circumscribed by innumerable unnecessary fears. They worry about their image, which means they worry about the press. They worry about competition, which means they worry about the abilities of others at least as much about their own. I admit that a horse is not in a position to entertain anxieties of this kind. But Ezzoud's is an example of the kind of attitude which, when translated into human terms, signifies freedom from dull, pointless and miserable fear. Cyclist Graeme Obree, for instance, is his own man. I love him too. On the recent BBC 1 programme The Contenders, in which sportsmen vied with one another in telling the camera who among them trained the hardest, he made them all look faintly foolish with his pronouncement, made from deep within an armchair, that he only went out on his bike when he felt like it. Of course the authorities mistrust him, as they do all free-thinkers. Last week, they banned him from defending his 4,000m pursuit title in the capital's World Track Championships in Sicily: apparently when he rode his chest was too close to his arms. Or was it that the bike which he had built for himself - an achievement deserving stunned praise, not curmudgeonly censure - had handlebars made from stags antlers, or wheels made from LP records, or just looked peculiar dammit? The authorities are trying to crush Graeme's independent spirit, but they won't do it. I have faith in him, as I have in Ezzoud: both can always win because both always know they can. This is the thing about free-spirits. They can be cavalier with their ability because they are so sure of it. Of course there are great talents who are not free-spirits and free-spirits who are not great talents. But best of all are those that are both: those in whom supreme ability mingles with the truly unimpeded flow of personality Golfer Laura Davies, for instance, is her own woman. I love her too. Feminists desperately seeking a role model should look no further than Laura: she shows all those poor uptight women, frantically juggling old and new definitions of feminity, for the anxious sheep that many of them are. She does what she wants. She plays golf better than every woman, and almost every man, in the world. When she wins she celebrates in her own style, enjoying her money, gambling shamelessly. She knows as much about sport as any man, and gives her answers on 'Question of Sport' with none of the usual 'I'm proving a point for women' coyness. She conforms to no received ideals of beauty, and paradoxically this makes her rather attractive. Anyway, why should she care about nonsense like dieting, when her thighs enabled her to power a ball upwards of 300 yards? Of course those who do not relish free-spirits are worried by her, just as they are worried by Ezzoud's rolling eye and Obree's mechano set bicycle. Why doesn't she want to be like everybody else. They wonder in agony. Because, she like that wicked horse and that lazy cyclist, has the gift of being herself. Laura Davies; Graeme Obree; Ezzoud: my three sporting heroes.</p>

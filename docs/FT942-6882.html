			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Metal slumps to Y2.6bn Prolonged recession, unstable weather and a strong currency combined to reduce profits at Mitsubishi Materials, the Japanese metals and cement manufacturer, in the year to the end of March. Unconsolidated pre-tax profits slumped 74 per cent to Y2.6bn (Dollars 25m) on turnover down 8.2 per cent at Y682bn. The difficult operating climate saw sales of most products tumble, with particularly sharp declines for copper, cement and processed goods. Unseasonably cool summer weather hit aluminium can production, while the 14 per cent appreciation of the yen in the period cut exports. Gold was the only division to increase sales as world demand remained buoyant. The company is implementing a restructuring programme that will see its workforce fall by 10 per cent by 1996. Lower capital expenditure and other economies are expected to reduce costs by about Y10bn over the period. This reorganisation, together with a gradual recovery in the Japanese economy, is expected to yield improved results in 1994-95. The company forecast a 3 per cent increase in turnover and a rise of 16 per cent in pre-tax profits.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW GAINS 15.84 IN LIGHTLY ATTENDED POST-YULE SESSION  </P> <P> The stock market bounced higher in slow trading today as traders straggled back  from the Christmas holiday.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average closed with a gain of 15.84 points at  2,637.13. In the broader market, advancing stocks outpaced decliners by a 7-6  margin. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a very light 78.73 million  shares, against Monday's four-year low of 57.20 million.  </P> <P> Traders said stocks were boosted by the Treasury bond market, where the  benchmark 30-year issue rose about two-thirds of a point. Higher bond prices  mean lower interest rates that make stocks a more attractive investment.  </P> <P> But traders said that with the very light volume, it was hard to predict a  clear trend. They noted little enthusiasm for chasing after stocks as 1990  winds down.  </P> <P> The showdown in the Persian Gulf appears to have dampened expectations for any  sort of New Year's rally after the pressure of tax selling is lifted from the  market.  </P> <P> Many questions also linger about the economic outlook. Early news reports  described the returns from retailers' Christmas selling season as very weak and  a big disappointment.  </P> <P> Gainers among the blue chips included Texaco, up 1 5/8 at 60 3/8 an hour before  the close; Philip Morris, up 1/2 at 51 3/8; Ford Motor, up 1/2 at 26 7/8, and  USX, up 1/4 at 30 1/4.  </P> <P> Among retailing stocks, The Limited added 1/8 to 17 7/8, but Wal-Mart Stores  dropped 3/8 to 31 1/8 and Toys R Us was down 3/8 at 22 3/4.  </P> <P> Pan Am Corp. was up 1/8 at 1 3/8. The company said it has not ended merger  discussions with Trans World Airlines Inc., but said it is waiting for TWA to  make a firm, detailed offer.  </P> <P> UAL Corp. rose sharply, gaining 2 1/2 to 115 1/2.  </P> <P> "We've seen sporadic buying throughout the morning," one trader said. "But it's  been very, very light. Professional traders are not doing much."  </P> <P> Don Hays, an investment strategist at Wheat First Securities, said the market's  strength was purely seasonal. "There are so few players that bargain-hunters  are pushing stocks higher."  </P> <P> Hays said the market was ignoring negative influences such as higher oil and  gold prices.  </P></p>

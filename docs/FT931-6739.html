			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Explosion fails to disrupt Dow Jones Wall Street AN explosion and fire at New York's World Trade Centre at midday yesterday caused only minimal disruption to trading on the New York and American stock exchanges, although the small order execution system was suspended, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 5.67 at 3,370.81. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 firmed 1.05 at 443.39, and the Nasdaq composite rose about 2 points to 669. NYSE trading volume was 234m shares and rises outnumbered declines by 1,160 to 746. Regular Nasdaq trading was uninterrupted at midday, but some trading floors were evacuated because of the fire and more than a dozen trading desks had to be closed because of power failure and smokey conditions. Market sentiment was mixed, in spite of an upward revision of gross domestic product for the fourth quarter to an annual rate of 4.8 per cent, above an earlier estimate of 3.8 per cent. Wal-Mart was active and gained Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 32 1/2 . Tobacco stocks remained lively, with RJR Nabisco adding Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 8 1/2 and Philip Morris Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 67 1/8 . In the auto sector, General Motors fell  1/4 to Dollars 37 1/2 , Chrysler rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 39 5/8 and Ford fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 45 7/8 . Rollins Environmental dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 7 7/8 after the US brokerage, Alex Brown, cut its rating on the stock from 'neutral' to 'sell' following the shutdown of the company's Texas incinerator. Telefonos de Mexico climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 49 5/8 in active trading after Bear Stearns increased its rating to 'strong buy' to reflect expectations of continued operating profit growth. In the big board technology sector, shares in Hewlett-Packard fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 74 and Digital Equipment fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 47 3/4 after a new technology analyst at Kemper Securities issued an initial 'neutral' rating on the stocks and suggested that investors swap into them from IBM and Amdahl. Shares in International Business Machines rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 54 3/8 . The biotechnology bellwether stock, Amgen, fell  3/4 to Dollars 36 1/4 in Nasdaq trading. The stock dropped more than Dollars 9 on Thursday following disappointing first quarter earnings projections. Many Nasdaq technology stocks were broadly lower with Intel off Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 116 1/2 , Seagate Technology down Dollars 1 to Dollars 15 5/8 , Apple Computer off Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 53 7/8 and Dell Computer easing Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 1/8 . Shares in Buttrey Food &amp; Drug tumbled Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 6 7/8 after the company posted fourth quarter operating income of 3 cents a share against 25 cents a year earlier. Canada TORONTO stocks closed mixed in heavy trading, dragged down by lower gold stocks. According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index was off 8.25 points, or 0.24 per cent, to 3,451.69, but advances outnumbered declines 366 to 278. On the week, the index was up 26 points. Volume fell to 49.424m shares from 54.607m shares on Thursday, and trading value was CDollars 412.1m against CDollars 492m. Ten of the 14 stock groups were down, led by golds, which fell 1.91 per cent. Industrial products fell, and financial services, consumer products and mining were flat.</p>

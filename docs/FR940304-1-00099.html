			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Florida State Energy Office (FSEO) suggested that the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider classifying room air conditioners according to their load  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics. (FSEO, No. 42 at 5, 6). The Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers stated that regional standards could increase the product's cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by denying manufacturers the economy of large production runs and augment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution problems by isolating inventories by region. (Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 22&hyph;25).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department assumes that the Florida State Energy Office comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns regional standards. The Department believes the program requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setting of a national standard and is proposing therefore only a national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard for room air conditioners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Florida State Energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office proposed that DOE establish procedures that take into account the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integration of room air conditioners and water heaters (heat recovery units).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Natural Resources Defense Council No. 13 at 29; FSEO No. 42 at 2,3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establishing standards and developing test procedures for appliances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which serve two types of loads simultaneously is a very complex problem. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department is in the process of developing standards and test procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined central air conditioners and water heaters. However, because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficulty of running water lines to a remote room air conditioner location  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the inherent heat losses from the hot water line, a room air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditioner/water heater configuration does not seem particularly appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, DOE will not establish a standard for room air conditioner/water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heater systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Florida State Energy Office  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy stated that DOE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should consider the cost of peak power in evaluating the cost effectiveness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> room air conditioner standards. (Natural Resources Defense Council No. 13 at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18; Florida State Energy Office No. 42 at 5,6; American Council for an Energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Efficient Economy No. 6 at 7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The price of electricity used for room air conditioners is the projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996 average residential electricity price from DOE Annual Energy Outlook  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991. Analysis of electricity price by end-use from data in the DOE/EIA 1987  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Residential Energy Consumption Survey indicates that the average electricity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price for residential air conditioning was the same as the national average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residential electricity price (in other words, the end-use price multiplier is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.00). Cost effectiveness to the consumer, e.g., life cycle cost, payback and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of conserved energy, is evaluated according to the actual charges to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Fedders Corporation urged DOE to establish a minimum energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency ratio for window air conditioners of 10.0, stating that this should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be done to keep the industry competitive on a global basis. The Fedders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation also stated that existing technology clearly can support this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum efficiency at small cost to manufacturers. (Fedders, No. 91 at 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers responded to the Fedders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation's comment stating that the Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers was unclear as to which classes the Fedders Corporation was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referring, and urging DOE to maintain and evaluate separate classes of room  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air conditioners. Furthermore, the Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers stated that the Fedders Corporation cannot accurately judge the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technological and economic impacts of such a minimum energy efficiency ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on other manufacturers. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department notes both comments and has analyzed each proposed class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of room air conditioners separately, using all available cost and performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data. The results presented in today's notice as proposed minimum energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency ratio's for room air conditioners range from 9.3 to 11.1, depending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on size and configuration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Water Heaters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Classes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There was considerable discussion about water heater product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classes. Many comments came from gas utilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Gas Association urged DOE to adopt a source-based energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis and to recognize the importance of efficiency of the total energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivery cycle. (American Gas Association, No. 23 at 3.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We received a statement from a spokesman for the  president, related to articles in today's Bulgarian newspapers  which quote the Greek TO VIMA daily to the fact that President  Zhelev was subjected to active foreign pressure.    The spokesman for the president recalls that President  Zhelev  was the first to determine the priorities of the new Bulgarian  foreign policy and formulated the principles of the Bulgarian  position regarding former Yugoslavia.    Bulgaria declared already at the very beginning of the  conflicts to the west of our border that it will not take  advantage of former Yugoslavia's difficulties and that it will  not interfere in any military manner in the events there, and  appealed to all other Balkan countries neighboring Yugoslavia to  adopt the same position.    It is a fact that the Balkan countries are burdened by their  past and any military interference on their part could become a  precondition of a new Balkan war.    This Bulgarian policy is upheld by the president in all  international contacts. It also figures in President Zhelev's  correspondence with Turkish President Demirel, about which the  Bulgarian public is well-informed.    The Bulgarian mass media are very clear regarding this  position, even to such a degree that they do not think it is  purposeful to repeat it constantly and thus assume the risk of  becoming the target of their readers' ridicule, the president's  spokesman continues. Nevertheless, one is puzzled by the  attention they devote to the claims of a Greek newspaper, which  are completely unfounded and unsupported by any facts or  evidence, and which obviously pursue political goals which  undermine Bulgaria's prestige, the statement of the president's  spokesman reads.</p>

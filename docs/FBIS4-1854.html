			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Communist Party  and government leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li  Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao this morning  joined two million Beijingers in planting trees in the capital.    Together with local leaders and residents, as well as 50  young pioneers, they planted 80 trees of Chinese pine and willow  in the Yuanminyuan Park -- garden of ten thousand gardens -- an  imperial park created over a 150-year period from 1709 to 1859,  in the north-western suburbs.    The first Sunday of April is a tree-planting day for the  capital, and over the past few years, government and party  leaders have joined in the green activities on this day.    Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Chinese Communist  Party  Central Committee, was told that the trees planted last year by  the leaders were growing well. He expressed gratitude to the  gardeners, saying that it was they who had taken good care of  these trees. He added that what was wanted was to create a  general greening spirit.    After planting a tree, Jiang said that every citizen should  be aware of the importance of tree-planting since it can bring  benefit to this generation and coming generations.    Also taking part in today's tree-planting were a dozen other  high ranking officials.</p>

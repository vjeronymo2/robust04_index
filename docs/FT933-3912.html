			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Deutsche Aerospace Airbus announces job cuts Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, the German aircraft manufacturer, announced yesterday that it will cut up to 2,800 jobs by the end of 1995 in nine to 10 factories across Germany, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. The company said the 'dramatic' decline in the demand for aircraft had forced it to cut its workforce of 20,600 by 13 per cent. The company, which is a subsidiary of Deutsche Aerospace, itself owned by Daimler-Benz, reported profits of DM410.8m (Dollars 253.5m) in 1992, down from DM421.3m the previous year.</p>

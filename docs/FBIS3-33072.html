			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Ortiz from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today the People's Militias and the Valle de Aburra  independent militias signed a preliminary agreement to disband.  These are the principal groups of this kind that exist in  Medellin, Antioquia Department, and control the city's  northeastern area. They emerged years ago as instruments of  self-defense against neighborhood violence and extortion by drug  traffickers' henchmen.    The preliminary agreement took effect early today in  Granizal  neighborhood, where militias gathered surrounded by a crowd.  They were transferred under police escort to a detente camp in  Santa Elena district, 30 minutes from Medellin's downtown.    The negotiations began with the reading of the preliminary  agreement and acknowledgment of this event by Government and  Interior Minister Fabio Villegas. He described it as courageous  and as an investment in the future.    [Begin recording] [Villegas] This is an example of how they  can achieve their political goals, how it is possible to strive  for their ideals amid tolerance, pluralism, and respect for the  rights and lives of our people.    [People's Militias' spokesman Dennis Santamaria] It is  absurd  to continue with the armed struggle. We have to think of  helping the country progress from another perspective, from the  political and social perspective. [end recording]    The preliminary agreement recognizes these militia members  as  a political force. They will have six negotiators who must  remain in the camp and five spokesmen who will mediate with the  government on conditions for social investment for their  communities and security in the neighborhoods, the most critical  issue, since they fear an invasion by the militias of the Simon  Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board once they disband  and become legal.</p>

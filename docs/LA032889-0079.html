			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> COMPULSIVE GAMBLING: A NEW ROUND OF VICTIMS  </P> <P> For 12 years, Diane played poker in Gardena casinos nightly until 4:30 a.m.  While regularly kiting checks and stealing from her husband and children to  finance her habit, she quit her job because she believed she could earn a  living gambling.  </P> <P> Johnny also gambled in Gardena -- three nights during the week and all weekend.  Although he counted cards well and won regularly at blackjack in Nevada  casinos, he didn't feel the narcoticlike rush he got from poker. So he played  poker all night unless he ran out of money and couldn't finagle more.  Frequently he left the casino crying and vowing never to return, but he did --  for the better part of eight years.  </P> <P> Diane, a great-grandmother who lives in West Los Angeles, and Johnny, a black  teacher from Los Angeles, represent segments of society -- women and non-whites  -- who experts say become compulsive gamblers more commonly than had been  thought. Both Diane and Johnny, who asked that their last names not be used,  now belong to Gamblers Anonymous, an organization patterned after Alcoholics  Anonymous and founded in Los Angeles 32 years ago.  </P> <P> Although Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose grabbed headlines recently for  alleged sports betting as prodigious as his 4,256 career hits, and although  compulsive gambling is commonly perceived as the province of white, middle-aged  males like Rose, a study conducted for the National Institute of Mental Health  found that women comprised 34% of all problem gamblers in New York, New Jersey  and Maryland. The figure for non-white minorities was 39%. The extent of the  problem nationwide and in California is not known, but experts agree that more  women and non-whites are seeking treatment.  </P> <P> "I see more women and non-whites," said Dr. Robert Custer, a Bethesda, Md.,  psychiatrist who specializes in compulsive gambling and lectures around the  world. "When I started 15 years ago, I would say they were probably around 5%  of my patients. Now it's approaching 30%. I assume that by the turn of the  century it will be 50%."  </P> <P> "We find a much higher proportion of women, blacks, Hispanics and Asians in  treatment programs, and their numbers are increasing," said Dr. Durand F.  Jacobs, chief of psychology service for the Veteran's Administration hospital  in Loma Linda. "They are acutely involved with problems of a legal, economic,  marital or psychological nature. Usually they are very depressed and often they  are suicidal."  </P> <P> Although women and non-whites joining the 15 GA chapters around Los Angeles  suffer from the same symptoms as men -- chronic and progressive failure to  resist the impulse to gamble -- they appear to bet differently.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Addicted to Slot Machines  </P> <P> Whereas men more often bet on sports or competitive casino games such as poker  or blackjack, women become addicted to slot machines, video poker games, bingo  or lotteries, said Henry Lesieur, a St. John's University sociologist who  interviewed 50 addicted female gamblers in Reno, Las Vegas and on the East  Coast. According to Custer, blacks and Latinos commonly wager on sports, the  lottery or illegal numbers games.  </P> <P> Men and women choose different types of gambling because they are addicted for  different reasons. A man may bet on horses, Lesieur said, because the  competition is exciting. "They are into the handicapping. Their intention is to  win money." Female gamblers, he said, often are trying to relieve loneliness or  to escape an alcoholic husband or a traumatic past.  </P> <P> Dr. Richard J. Rosenthal of Beverly Hills, a psychiatrist who is president of  the California Council on Compulsive Gambling, said that he has noticed two  patterns among female gamblers.  </P> <P> "The first woman feels empty and depressed," he said. "She is more apt to be a  solitary gambler, spending hours in front of the slot machines or playing video  poker. This may also be the lottery addict.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Social Outlet  </P> <P> "In the second group, loneliness seems most striking and gambling provides a  social outlet. Competitive aspects are less important than they are with her  male counterparts. She views the people that she is playing cards with, for  example, as friends."  </P> <P> Women also start gambling later than men -- in adulthood -- but get hooked  quickly, Rosenthal said. "Most men start in childhood or early adolescence. A  boy might lose his collection of baseball cards on a bet at age 6 or 8."  </P> <P> Massive social changes have made it easier for women to be pulled into  gambling, just as men have been, said Valerie Lorenz, director of the National  Center for Pathological Gambling in Baltimore, Md.  </P> <P> "Twenty years ago if someone wanted to gamble on a legal basis, she would have  to fly to Las Vegas or drive to a race track, which (might) be in the next  state," Lorenz said.  </P> <P> "First of all, society ruled that she had to be accompanied by her husband or  an escort. Additionally, that took money, big money, and a woman did not have  it. A woman did not have her own credit card or her own checking account or  job.  </P> <P> "Nowadays, she has money from her job or her credit card and she can walk down  the street and use her food money to buy lottery tickets at the grocery store.  Or she can go play bingo."  </P> <P> Although more women and minorities are entering private treatment or Gamblers  Anonymous, still only a small fraction of those addicted seek help. Margie, a  compulsive gambler from Santa Monica, agreed with other GA members that she  invariably saw only a few women or non-whites at meetings. Experts say many  newcomers enter the group but don't stay.  </P> <P> "If a woman is going to be the only female in a room with 30 to 50 men at a GA  meeting, she is going to have a hard time," Rosenthal said. "She may have a  hard time identifying with their issues as they might with hers. In one  situation, for example, a woman had been prostituting herself in order to  continue her gambling habit. If she has to talk about that and is worried that  the men are going to start hitting on her, it's difficult."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Intimidating to Women  </P> <P> "GA is still a predominantly white-male group," Lorenz said. "It's intimidating  to women, and some gamblers' wives resent the fact that the husband spends time  with other gamblers, especially female gamblers, since he spent so much time  away from home when he was gambling."  </P> <P> Women who succeed in GA say that they joined when their lives had reached  bottom and they were desperate to break their life style of lying, stealing and  manipulating.  </P> <P> "When I went in I became sexless," said Diane, a West Los Angeles card player  who joined the group 25 years ago. "I wasn't a man or a woman. . . . I felt  completely worthless. I felt like a thing. . . . I wanted a decent life, which  I knew I was not going to get out there. I couldn't stand the stress of lying  and cheating and trying to get money."  </P> <P> The male members respected her situation, and today she and other female and  non-white GA members serenely recount their triumphs, no matter how seemingly  commonplace.  </P> <P> "One day, on Nov. 20, 1984, I left the casino and two days later I came into  GA," said Johnny, who has not gambled since. "I was sick and tired of being  sick and tired."  </P> <P> "When I quit gambling, my credit was not worth a good gosh darn," Diane said.  "I couldn't have borrowed 10 cents from any bank in the world. Today I have  triple-A credit and that is a wonderful feeling. I worked hard enough to get it  up there. When I got my first credit card, I thought it was the most wonderful  thing in the world."  </P></p>

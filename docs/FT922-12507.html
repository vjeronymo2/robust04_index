			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Finland sees first signs of economic recovery THE worst of the Finnish recession may be over, helped by a pick-up in timber and engineering exports, according to the Confederation of Finnish Industries (CFI) yesterday. The quarterly survey of 580 companies reports an increase in new orders and says export orders are expected to increase further in the spring. The survey contains the first signs of optimism among industrialists over the economy. Last year, Finland's GDP declined 6.1 per cent, and the government was forced recently to produce an emergency economic package to avert devaluation. Exports to Germany and to east Asian markets increased in the first quarter. Both forestry and engineering, traditionally two of Finland's most important sectors, are expected to show a further recovery in exports in coming months. However, the CFI warns that construction and textiles sectors expect new orders to continue to decline. Industrial production during the first quarter was slightly better than expected although still below last year. Expectations for the next six months are still 'extremely conservative,' although the survey predicts an increase in industrial production in the second quarter, partly due to seasonal factors. Although 84 per cent of companies report idle capacity, the CFI says this is slightly better than last year. Capacity utilisation improved a little in March, especially in forestry and engineering. The CFI says industrial investment continues to decline, with the biggest falls in the building industry. However, it predicts that the fall in investment will be halted within a year, but will remain at a low level.</p>

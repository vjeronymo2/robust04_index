			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Declaration" issued by the Guatemalan National </F> Revolutionary Unity General Command on 5 April; place not given]    [Text] The latest round of negotiations held in Puebla,  Mexico, allowed the signing of three basic agreements in the  negotiating process, such as the General Agreement on Human  Rights, Timetable for the Negotiations, and the joint  government-URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity]  declaration on the issue of a commission to clarify violations  of human rights.    The serious events and incidents that have taken place in  Guatemala after this signing demand that the URNG General  Command address national and international opinion to:  <H5>  Communicate </H5>   The great satisfaction with having signed the aforementioned  agreements, which are the result of an intense and difficult  process, and that they offer a solid and viable base for a  serious, fair, and in-depth negotiation. [sentence as published]    A current General Agreement on Human Rights and its prompt  verification concern the urgent needs of the country insofar as  it covers the basic demands of Guatemalans and it opens the  doors to a new phase in the negotiation process. Full compliance  with this agreement creates the necessary conditions for all  sectors of society to find solutions to the current problems.    That the value of the General Agreement on Human Rights must  be evinced through its true implementation and compliance. In  addition to the obligations pledged by the parties in signing  this document, the right of the entire population to demand its  respect and validity becomes legitimate.    This agreement has been made possible through our people's  heroic toil, the substantial efforts and sacrifice of their  organizations, which express, under totally adverse  circumstances, their complaints and demands as well as the  contribution of those who, understanding this situation, have  abided by and supported it.    This pivotal agreement was also made possible thanks to the  understanding and favorable reception of the international  community, which with its statement and support helped advance  it.    The General Agreement on Human Rights and the timetable  agreement cover the entire content of the negotiation. They do  not mean an end to the conflict, but they constitute a basic  step in a process that calls for the participation and permanent  mobilization of all sectors of society to achieve its true and  practical significance.    Compliance with the General Agreement on Human Rights and  the  prompt establishment of the agreed verification mechanism by the  United Nations constitute the first trial by fire of the  process. The first aspect would make no sense in the absence of  the second one.  <H5>  Warning </H5>   Regarding rights and statements that are alarming and highly  negative.    The heinous assassination of Constitutionality Court  President Epaminondas Gonzalez on 1 April is condemnable and, in  the context of the signing of a human rights agreement,  constitutes a flagrant provocation of Guatemalan society and the  international community.    The statement by President Ramiro de Leon Carpio immediately  following the signing of the General Agreement on Human Rights  does not demonstrate his commitment to comply with it, but  rather his intention of offering the URNG militants amnesty.  This action conveys the existing contradictions, contravenes the  negotiation process, and calls into question his political will  to conclude a negotiation that will bring a just and democratic  peace.    The campaign of misinformation and distortion conducted by  official and unofficial spokespersons before the signing of the  General Agreement on Human Rights, and which continues to  flagrantly seek to discredit the URNG--blaming it for actions  that have been perpetrated by groups of the Army itself--reveal  recalcitrant wills that oppose a fair political solution.  <H5>  Urges and Demands </H5>   The government of President De Leon Carpio and the Army to  comply with the General Agreement on Human Rights, thus  returning the support and trust offered by the international  community and the national public.    That the assassination of the Constitutionality Court  president, an action that lies within the jurisdiction and scope  of the security forces, where it originated, be cleared up as  soon as possible.    The threat of imposing a state of exception is part,  whatever  its true or presumed justification, of a preconceived plan to  limit the freedom of expression of civic and popular forces.  Therefore, it is inadmissible and condemnable.    Fair play in the negotiation process is the fundamental  condition for it to evolve. This is why the Army organizations  must suspend the psychological war, and the president must not  lend himself to maneuvers to discredit the URNG as its main  counterpart in the negotiation process.    Nothing must be allowed to curtail the expression of  Guatemala's civilian sectors. The international community plays  a highly significant role in ensuring this freedom, and we urge  it to express its solidarity.    [Signed] URNG General Staff: Comandante Rolando Moran;  Comandante Pablo Monsanto; Comandante Gaspar Ilom; and Carlos  Gonzales, secretary General of Guatemalan Labor Party Central  Committee.    [Issued] 5 April 1994</p>

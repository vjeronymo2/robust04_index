			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Required U.S. Partnership"] </F>   [Text] Reports indicating that U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher intends to visit the Middle East next month  raise anew the issue of the U.S. partnership in the peace talks  and whether this partnership is effective and active or merely a  media term that has no connection with reality.    If we overlook a known fact -- namely, that the  Palestinian-Israeli interim agreement was reached in the absence  of that partnership and that the rounds of negotiations between  the various Arab negotiating parties and Israel, held in the  U.S. capital, have ended in deadlock on all or most of the  tracks -- then one is more than justified in questioning the  role and effectiveness of the U.S. partnership.    The United States' silence in the face of Israeli practices  that were and are still being carried out in the occupied Arab  territories, including the pursuit of fugitives, settlement  activity, and detentions, as well as its silence in the face of  the ongoing stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli talks and  Israel's evasion of its commitments and its disregard for the  timetable on implementing the agreement under the pretext that  the dates are "not sacred," makes an observer feel that the U.S.  partnership in the peace process is neither effective nor  adequate.    The most elementary interpretation of U.S. partnership means  adopting the resolutions of international legitimacy and their  obvious meaning and calling what is self-evident by its real  name. The occupied territories are, in fact, occupied and not  disputed, because this term, adopted lately by Washington,  creates the impression that those who champion Arab rights are  on an equal footing with the Israeli party. During recent  rounds of negotiations in Washington, the United States tended  to dilute the concepts and terms approved by the international  community in describing the situation in the occupied  territories. To a large extent, this endangers the provisions  of the terms of reference on which the peace process is based.    The Palestinians and the Arabs are interested in an active  U.S. partnership that will manifest itself in difficult times  and lead the Israeli side back to the reality and spirit of the  peace concepts as adopted by the international community. Such  a partnership will certainly boost the peace process in the long  run, because it will contribute to the establishment of a just,  comprehensive, and lasting peace acceptable to coming  generations, who alone will decide whether to preserve that  peace.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Survey of London Docklands (5): A return to favour - Industrial Sector FOR most of the 1980s, the industrial sector's role in regenerating London Docklands was eclipsed by the rapid growth of the office sector. But in the wake of the slump in the Docklands' office market, the sector's potential is being re-examined. The London Docklands Development Corporation has commissioned Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, chartered surveyors, to consider the prospects of attracting light industry to the area. Although the findings have not yet been published, they are likely to show that there is scope for putting more emphasis on industry property. 'The fact that the LDDC is now seriously considering industrial development in the Docklands is logical and sensible in view of the infrastructure and spending already accorded to the area and given the state of the office property market,' says Mr Stephen Mallen, head of property research at Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. A greater emphasis on industrial development would build on an established base. The docks traditionally had numerous industries related to the import and export of goods, even though it was rarely associated with heavy manufacturing. North Woolwich and Silvertown are still important areas for manufacturing and service industries. For instance, long-established companies include Pura Foods, refiners and bottlers of edible oil, in Leamouth and Tate &amp; Lyle, sugar refiners and Charringtons, the brewers in Silvertown. That said, the past two decades saw a rapid decline in industrial activity. The closure of the Docks left many riverside industries with no long term prospect of survival. Some critics of the LDDC think that it did not do enough to tackle the continued decline of the area's traditional industrial and manufacturing base - 'the LDDC has consistently encouraged and even accelerated this decline. Rather than use its power and resources to assist local industries, the Corporation tends to see them as a barrier to regeneration,' said the Docklands Consultative Committee, a group set up by the area's local authorities. The LDDC did not accept this criticism. It pointed to the support it gave businesses through serviced industrial sites at Cody Road, north of Canning Town, Crescent Street in E16 and the Poplar Business Park, together with the London Industrial Park that Newnham set up in Beckton. Various government grants such as City Grant are also available. The LDDC has earmarked 42 acres of land for light industry. The proposed sites are four acres at Quebec Way in Surrey Docks, seven acres at Cody Road, north of Leamouth, 11 acres on the south side of King George V Dock and 20 acres on the south side of Albert Basin. SOME critics suggest that these sites may have problems attracting occupiers. Access may be too difficult and the high building and landscaping requirements too onerous to suit some potential users. However, a change in policy which allowed industrial or distribution companies to use better sites might ultimately be considered a wasted opportunity. Having invested heavily in upgrading the area - some Pounds 500m has been spent on infrastructure in the Royal Docks - it holds out the hope of attracting prestigious occupiers, such as a business park or corporate headquarters. A decision to encourage industrial development would, in some respects, be a break with the past. The architects of the dockland's regeneration had an ambivalent attitude to manufacturing industry. They did not want to 'condemn Docklands to its past,' as Mr Reg Ward, its first chief executive put it. The efforts made by local authorities in the 1970s to bring back manufacturing industry were considered to be futile. Moreover, the Docklands, they believed, had the potential to be more than a routine industrial development area. The LDDC got the chance to prove this in 1982, when the Government set up an Enterprise Zone covering 460 acres on the Isle of Dogs and Lea Estuary. This gave a ten-year exemption from rates and allowed 100 per cent tax write-offs against the capital costs of non-residential buildings. Although the government had expected the Enterprise Zone to encourage industrial expansion, the LDDC believed it could also be used by office users, who would be attracted by the ability to write-off their investment against tax. 'We used the EZ in an entirely different and somewhat 'maverick' way . . . to make the Isle of Dogs an office and commercial location rather than confirming it as an industrial one,' said Mr Ward. Builders put up flexible 'business space,' which could be used for activities ranging from warehousing, production, research and development and offices. Although these were mostly successful, the emphasis increasingly switched to office developments in the 1980s as the service sector expanded and land values rose. Nonetheless, the area had successes in bringing in high-tech industry, particularly in the case of the telecommunications industry. For instance, a teleport was opened at North Woolwich to handle satellite communications for financial business services. National newspapers were also important investors. The printworks of the Daily Mail, Guardian, Daily Telegraph and the FT moved in to Surrey Quays, Millharbour, Isle of Dogs and Leamouth. They were attracted to Docklands by its enterprise zone status, its good communications, large sites and easy accessibility to Central London. The tax breaks have now expired, although the other attractions remain. The effort to attract new users to the area is likely to focus on the limited number of manufacturing activities that benefit from proximity to central London. Potential occupiers may include perishable food processors serving the Central London market or businesses associated with telecoms, data storage and transmission and computer centres. There may also be demand from warehouses for distributors serving the London market, although planners might be reluctant to give permission to buildings with relatively low aesthetic appeal or employment potential. The difficulties of attracting industry to the inner cities means that more industrial development cannot play more than a partial role in the regeneration of the docklands. But the area's greatly improved infrastructure and its over-supply of offices makes a good case for putting a greater emphasis on industrial development.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A witness for NCI testified that even though somatic cells  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect the quality of milk, particularly in the manufacture of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cheese, it is difficult to place a value on their effect. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> witness explained that the variability in somatic cell levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from day to day and producer to producer makes determining an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate payment adjustment imprecise. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> witness pointed out that other factors affect milk quality, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that placing a precise value on their effect is even more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult than in the case of somatic cells. The NCI witness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained that the NCI proposal would allow each handler to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish and apply its own somatic cell adjustment schedule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the approval of the market administrator, as long as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total payments to producers met or exceeded the Federal order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum value. The witness explained that each handler could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change its payment plan as conditions warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A witness for Kraft emphasized the earlier testimony on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of somatic cells on milk quality and cheese yields. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> witness listed several studies supporting the results testified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to by the NAJ expert witness. The Kraft witness testified that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kraft has, since the early 1980's, employed a quality payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program as part of its producer payroll. The witness went on to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state that the plethora of somatic cell payment programs in use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the industry is strong evidence of the industry's recognition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that somatic cells play a major role in milk quality. The Kraft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> witness explained that, in order of preference, Kraft supports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposal submitted by NCI, followed by LOL's proposal and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TAPP/FUMMC proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kraft, in its post-hearing brief, reiterated its support for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a somatic cell adjustment to be included in the amended order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kraft's brief did not support a particular adjustment plan but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferred the LOL&hyph;NCI concept. If that plan were not adopted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kraft expressed support for the proposal by Mid-Am or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original CMPC proposal. A brief filed largely reiterative of NCI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testimony was filed on behalf of NCI with the Dairy Division  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than the Hearing Clerk, and was received more than 3 weeks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the extended due date for filing briefs. The brief is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered in this decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Anderson-Erickson Dairy Company (A&hyph;E) post-hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brief, A-E opposed the application of an adjustment for somatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cells to Class I milk. They contended that the Class I handler  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is unable to recover the added cost of lower somatic cell count  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> milk from the retail market. This position was supported in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> post-hearing brief filed by Lamers Dairy and Hansen Dairy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Lamers). Lamers pointed to testimony that indicated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monetary effect of somatic cells on Class I milk could not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantified as it could be with the manufacture of cheese.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NFO, in its post-hearing brief, opposed the inclusion of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cell adjuster in the recommended order. NFO expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the opinion that support for a somatic cell adjuster was rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weak, with none of the positions presented having strong support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As an example, the NFO brief pointed to the neutral position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken by CMPC at the hearing after including a somatic cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjuster in the original CMPC proposal. The NFO brief continued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by explaining that testimony at the hearing indicated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between somatic cell levels and economic return is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not a clear and definite relationship. The NFO brief went on to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point out that there was no consensus at the hearing on how to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply a somatic cell adjuster.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is ample testimony and evidence to support the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inclusion of a somatic cell adjuster in these amended orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The somatic cell adjuster per hundredweight per 1,000 somatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cells will be calculated by multiplying .0005 times the monthly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block cheese price. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the value for an individual producer, the producer <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monthly average somatic cell count (in thousands) will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtracted from 350 and multiplied by the somatic cell adjuster.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The value of the somatic cell adjustment will be applied on a per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hundredweight basis in the handlers' payment to producers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Somatic cells will not be included in the computation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producer price differential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Fighting leaves three dead in Haiti Fresh violence broke out in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince yesterday as a demonstration celebrating the expected return of Haiti's democratic government degenerated into a pitched battle, leaving at least three people dead and over a dozen injured. The fighting, after a grenade attack that killed five people on Thursday, marked a resurgence of clashes that threaten US efforts to restore democracy to the Caribbean nation. Yesterday's confrontation, erupted, when paramilitaries loyal to the military regime attacked a crowd marching on the third anniversary of the coup that toppled elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The incidents throw into doubt the capacity of the US military, numbering 20,000 troops, to guarantee civilians security for free political expression. They have also increased pressure on the US to pursue a more forceful disarmament of Haitian paramilitaries. The demonstration followed mass at Port-au-Prince cathedral, where Father Amos called for reconciliation between military loyalists and Aristide supporters. The mass was attended by Mr Robert Malval, Mr Aristide's nominated premier, who emerged from hiding to sit in the front pew, across the aisle from Mr William Swing, US ambassador. Last night Mr Aristide urged Haitians to halt the fighting. 'There should be neither violence nor vengeance.' He was noncommital about when he would return to Port-au-Prince, suggesting it could be 'before October 15' - the date Haiti's military are due to step down. The crowd had followed the official route for the demonstration past the offices of Fraph, a militia faction loyal to the military government of Lieutenant-General Raoul Cedras. Fraph paramilitaries were understood to have thrown stones at and opened fire on the demonstrators, who took cover. A suspected member of the paramilitary group was chased and beaten to death by the crowd. Observers say low-ranking officers of the police and army have relinquished their responsibilities.</p>

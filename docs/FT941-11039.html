			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / New state secondary school opened in London London's first new state secondary school for more than a decade has been officially opened by Tower Hamlets Borough Council, John Authers writes. Swanlea School (above) cost Pounds 9.55m and was built on derelict land near Whitechapel Road. It will take 210 pupils each year, most of them from ethnic minorities - particularly Bangladeshis and Somalis. School signs are written in both English and Bengali. Swanlea's radical architecture, which features a broad central mall with an arched glass ceiling and an integral sports hall, is designed to help reduce the borough's truancy problem. The architects hope that children will prefer the school's environment to the streets of Whitechapel.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ulster TV rises to Pounds 1.97m PROFITS of Ulster Television, the independent programme contractor, advanced from Pounds 1.79m to Pounds 1.97m pre-tax for the six months ended June 30. The improvement was scored on the back of a turnover some 2.5 per cent lower at Pounds 13.2m. Directors said that comparisons with last year were beset by complexities arising from the loss of Channel 4 airtime, the introduction of a new basis of payment for network and acquired programmes, and the implementation of the programme plans which UTV had submitted as part of its licence application. They also noted that the improvement in profits was after deducting a half year pro-rata cash bid charge of Pounds 516,000 compared with an exceptional levy charge of Pounds 90,000. The interim dividend is being lifted by 2p to 6.25p from earnings of 11.79p (10.22p).</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: ROOSEVELT'S 'DEDICATION' TO GET ITS DUE  </P> <P> The buzz: "It's about time." That's what movers and shakers are saying about  the salute to James Roosevelt planned for May 20 at the Irvine Hilton and  Towers.  </P> <P> Chapman College is planning the gala benefit dinner, which has Sen. Pete Wilson  heading up an honorary committee that includes former Presidents Richard M.  Nixon and Gerald R. Ford; Peter Ueberroth; Gov. George Deukmejian; Athalie  Clarke, and Barbara Grant, widow of actor Cary Grant.  </P> <P> Chairing the dinner committee is Doy Henley, CEO of Aeromil Engineering in  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> According to Vaughn W. Kelley, director of community relations and special  events for Chapman, the college plans to present a Roosevelt Award each year to  an individual who exhibits the "dedication to higher education and public  service" that Roosevelt has made his life's work. The award will probably  include a college scholarship, Kelley says. "Our board is working that out."  </P> <P> Proceeds from the event -- $300,000 is hoped for -- will be used to endow the  Roosevelt Award program.  </P> <P> More than 800 guests are expected to attend. Tickets are selling for $150 each,  and tables are being sold in the $1,500 to $10,000 range. Roosevelt, eldest son  of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, is a Chapman College trustee. He lives with his  wife, Mary, and daughter, Becky, in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> For arts' sake: Christopher Kennedy Lawford, son of Pat Kennedy Lawford and the  late Peter Lawford, is expected to attend a benefit sale of art by the  handicapped April 1 at Galerie Olivia in Newport Beach. Proceeds will benefit  Very Special Arts California, an educational affiliate of the John F. Kennedy  Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. VSA, founded by Jean Kennedy  Smith in 1974, is now an international program; its mission is to help  individual handicapped people through encouraging them to express themselves  artistically. On the sponsoring committee with Lawford is Marylyn Pauley, vice  chairwoman of community relations for the Orange County Performing Arts Center.  The 8-month-old gallery, which specializes in original European oil paintings,  is owned by George Townsend and Franklyn Richards.  </P> <P> Now, that's entertainment: Paul Newman. George Burns. Julie Andrews. Glenn  Close. Liza Minnelli. Diana Ross. Those are but a few of the few hundred stars  who lit up Spago last year at super-agent Irving (Swifty) Lazar's post Academy  Awards smash. Let's face it. There's not another party like it in the universe.  And only somebodies gain admittance. ("You're somebody if you're there, whether  you're somebody or not," chirps one giggling insider.) But take heart. Orange  County will be stunningly represented at the nouvelle-pizza party when Newport  Beach model Tina Schafnitz makes her entrance with husband Matt, an insurance  broker. What to wear? Tina knows. A showstopper, of course. But she hasn't  decided which showstopper. "It will either be my black-and-white by Gildas or  my charcoal-with-pearls by Bob Mackie," says the statuesque blonde with the  saucer eyes. We're rooting for Gildas. He's from Orange County too.  </P> <P> Morsels: When charming Fernanda Gilligan, a vice president with Tiffany &amp;  Co. in New York, attended a recent benefit at Tiffany in Costa Mesa, few guests  realized that they were hobnobbing with the former stepdaughter of one of New  York's reigning hobnobbers, supreme socialite Mercedes Kellogg Bass. Gilligan  -- a bright-eyed fireball whose well-shod feet are planted firmly on the ground  -- is the daughter of Francis L. Kellogg, one-time husband of Mercedes, the  chic Iranian-born Manhattanite who recently wed Sid Bass. While Gilligan was in  town, she stayed at the Newporter Resort -- "It's so California!" -- and took  her daughter on a whirlwind tour of Disneyland. . . .  </P> <P> Leave it to billionairess Leona Helmsley of New York to wear le dernier cri in  fashion at the Ritz-Carlton hotel last week when she and hubby Harry's Helmsley  Palace received the Five Diamond Award from the American Automobile Assn. The  queenly brunette was all the rage in diamonds and rubies and a cloud of floaty  chiffon, the gala look that's so in for spring. Helmsley admitted that she had  never heard of Orange County before she came to Dana Point. But she said she  had heard of the Amen Wardy boutique in Newport Beach. She spent a day there  and "bought a bunch," she said. As for O.C., Leona, who has mansions in all the  right places, pronounced it "beautiful." "I like it. Truthfully, the air is  clear here. You have the sea." (For trivia lovers: Harry owns the Empire State  Building, and last year he lit it up for Leona's birthday. But Leona wasn't  saying which birthday.) . . . .  </P> <P> Birraporetti's in Costa Mesa will be the happening place Tuesday night after  "Elvis: A Musical Celebration" makes its debut at the Orange County Performing  Arts Center. The 20-member cast -- along with Elvis seem-alikes Johnny Seaton,  Julian Whittaker and Terry Mike Jeffrey -- will mingle with Center board  members and enjoy a '50s theme party, complete with 45 r.p.m. records dangling  from the ceiling. (In a perfect world, the Center board would all show up in  blue suede shoes.) Be there or be square.  </P></p>

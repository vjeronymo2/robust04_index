			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Capital gains and Polly Peck I HAVE recently received a Polly Peck International report to the creditors dated May 25 1992 in which it says 'confirmation has now been received from the Inland Revenue that PPI shares can be treated as of negligible value from 7 May 1991. Accordingly shareholders may make negligible value claims for the tax year 1991/92.' As I was not informed of this fact before April, I only took Pounds 5,500 capital gains from my share sales to keep within the exemption limit. If my loss of Pounds 4,000 on PPI must be taken in that tax year I will still not be liable to tax as my gains would be Pounds 1,500 of the losses. If I had been informed before April 1992 I would have taken Pounds 9,500 capital gains tax free. My question is: can I claim that my PPI shares became of negligible value in the tax year 1992/93, thus allowing me to make Pounds 9,800 capital gains in the present financial year without being liable to CGT? If not, I feel that I have been cheated out of using my PPI loss by not being informed before 5 April 1992. It is a pity that you have missed all the published replies about negligible value claims in our columns over the years. You would have known that the answer to your question is 'yes', and you would have been spared much anxiety. On April 1 1993 or the next day or so, (not before April, but in time for your letter to reach the tax office by April 5) you should write to your tax inspector along the following lines: 'In accordance with section 24(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, I claim that the value of my holding of . . . Polly Peck International plc shares has become negligible, namely one penny, and that I should therefore be treated as though I had sold that holding for that sum today, April 1 1993, and had immediately reacquired it for that same sum in circumstances falling outside section 105(1) of that Act. 'Please let me have your decision on this claim within 30 days.' No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

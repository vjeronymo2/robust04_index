			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Summit rift delays Israeli withdrawal Final agreement on terms for an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho has been pushed back by at least 10 days after the failure of a summit yesterday aimed at resolving differences on vital security issues. The meeting in Cairo between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, was designed to clear the way for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, which was due to start today under the terms of the outline peace agreement signed between Israel and the PLO in September. The two men, holding separate press conferences after more than 2 1/2 hours of talks, said they would meet again in Cairo in 10 days in the hope of reaching agreement. Mr Rabin added that both leaders remained committed to implementing in full and on time the outline peace deal signed in Washington, but said: 'We found certain differences in the interpretation of the deal.' These included responsibility for 'the lines dividing the territories and Jordan and Egypt, the problem of difficulties at the border and the size of Jericho'. The two leaders said talks on economic co-operation would continue in Paris, while separate delegations would continue to discuss the eventual transfer of power from Israeli to Palestinian administration in Gaza and Jericho. On the crucial security issues, Mr Rabin said only that these would be addressed in 'informal talks'. There had been optimism, particularly in Israel, that the summit would reinject momentum into stalled negotiations on withdrawal. The breakdown means that an Israeli pull-out is unlikely to begin until Christmas Eve at the earliest and heightens the risk of intensified violence in the occupied territories. Mr Rabin said he saw no reason why Israel could not complete its military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on schedule by April 13 next year 'if in 10 days from now we reach agreement on those issues on which we have not reached an understanding'. Mr Arafat showed disappointment over the summit's outcome. Asked if the delay would fuel violence in Gaza and Jericho, he replied: 'I hope not.' He had been insistent that today's deadline for the start of an Israeli withdrawal should be met. But neither he nor Mr Rabin could announce even 'symbolic gestures' to mark the day.

The parliamentary press service told BNS the principal  objective of the Latvian delegation was to coordinate positions  on key questions of the Estonian-Russian and the Latvian-Russian  negotiations. Latvia and Russia initialed an agreement on  military pensioners that perplexed Estonian politicians. Since  the troop withdrawal agreements must be ratified in the  parliament, the Latvian Saeima delegation wanted to find out  Estonia's standpoint on the pensioners' issue.    In Nugis' opinion, the Latvian MPs "would have liked to take  advantage of Estonia's critical position to build up a similar  attitude in the Latvian parliament." Nugis stated, however, that  Estonia will not officially condemn Latvia's position.    "This is Latvia's domestic issue, but we don't rule out that  it may complicate the future course of Estonian-Russian  negotiations," Nugis said. "Estonia, however, is not going to  change its position or make any concessions on this issue," the  parliament speaker emphasized.    In Nugis' words, the standpoints of the Estonian delegation  for talks with Russia are consistent with the aliens law, which  regulates also the problems of social guarantees for the retired  Russian military, and the citizenship law.    "Latvia at present lacks analogous legislation," Nugis  noted.    The Latvian Saeima delegation met also with Prime Minister  Mart Laar and Rein Helme, chairman of the parliamentary National  Defense Commission.    The delegation included Maris Budovskis, chairman of the  Saeima Credentials Committee and the Baltic Assembly Presidium;  Juris Sinka, chairman of the Baltic Assembly foreign affairs  committee and a member of the Latvian delegation for talks with  Russia; Romans Apsitis, a member of the Saeima Law Enforcement  Commission; and Baltic Assembly secretary Ance Anteniske.    The meeting between the Latvian delegation and Nugis touched  on the next session of the Baltic Assembly scheduled for May in  Riga, as well as the initialing and ratifying of a cooperation  agreement between the Baltic Assembly and the Benelux countries  (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg).</p>

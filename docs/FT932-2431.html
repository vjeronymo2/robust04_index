			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: DTI inquiry focuses mainly on finance THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry's 545-page report into Astra focuses primarily on financial issues and largely ignores several external factors which some, especially former directors, blame for the group's demise. The company became very publicly embroiled in the Iraqi 'supergun' affair in September 1989 when directors Mr Gerald James, Mr Christopher Gumbley, Mr Stephan Kock and Mr John Pike discovered that propellant to be supplied to Jordan by PRB, Astra's newly acquired Belgian subsidiary, was destined for a large gun in Iraq. The contract was stopped in spite of considerable opposition from the management of PRB, who feared that the company's future business in the area would be seriously undermined. The Astra directors informed British intelligence of their suspicions, and last year provided evidence to that effect to the Department of Trade and Industry's select committee inquiry into the supergun affair. Astra's warning came a full five months before government ministers claimed that they knew of the gun's existence. According to Mr James, many of PRB's problems in meeting its future targets were related to this decision and the subsequent change in climate towards the export of defence equipment to Iraq or any of its conduit countries. This issue is barely dealt with in the report. Mr Gumbley, the company's former chief executive, who served four and a half months in prison on two corruption offences, yesterday said that the loss of the propellant contract caused the company 'grave damage'. He added that 'we thought it was better to be legal than illegal.' He said that prior to his departure from Astra he had tried to investigate allegations of large commission payments to PRB employees which were seriously affecting that company's profit margins. This issue is barely looked at in the report. PRB's problems cannot be blamed entirely on events after Astra's acquisition. Its very poor financial condition was not entirely clear to Astra at the time of purchase. The report does not refer either to a controversial explosives agreement struck between the Ministry of Defence and Royal Ordnance which effectively cut Astra out of the Pounds 400m a year ammunition market. This caused the company's 1988 acquisition of BMARC to look seriously overvalued and led to financial problems ahead of the ill-fated acquisition of PRB. The inspectors say that Mr James's evidence to them covered a wide range of subjects, certain of which apparently had little or no direct connection with Astra.</p>

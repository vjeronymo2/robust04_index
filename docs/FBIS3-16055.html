Answering SNARK correspondent's question on the appraisal of  Armenian Government's concrete actions, Nersesiants noted that  Armenia has successfully accomplished land privatization.  "Other countries need 20-30 years of persuasions to make such a  step", stressed he.    In Nersesiants's view, housing privatization and open trade  also provide favorable image for Armenia. However, the reforms  in financial system are being postponed. "Yet, strategic course  of Armenian economy's development is appraised by the World Bank  highly enough", said Vahram Nersesiants.</p>

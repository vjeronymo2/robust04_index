			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / World Trade News: Japan sends senior trade envoy to US ONE of Japan's most senior trade officials, Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister for international affairs, has gone to Washington in another attempt to ease trade tensions before the arrival of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, later this month. Mr Hatakeyama is expected to reject a US proposal for quantitative measures to track market access in Japan but to discuss the possibility of increased procurement of US products. The visit, described by the Trade Ministry as an unofficial follow-up to the trip made last month by Mr Yoshi Mori, Japan's trade minister, comes as several trade disputes between the two countries threaten to flare up again. In particular, the Japanese authorities are considering measures against the US carrier Northwest Airlines, according to Mr Ihei Ochi, transport minister. The dispute centres on Northwest's exercise of rights to fly beyond Japan on three flights a week from New York via Osaka and on to Sydney. The US-Japan aviation accord allows specific US airlines to fly to Japan and on to another destination. Tokyo has argued, however, that in doing so US airlines must not endanger the business of Japanese airlines. Japan gave the US airline the go-ahead for the Osaka-Sydney leg of the flight on condition that it kept the proportion of passengers boarding at Osaka to 50 per cent or less. The Transport Ministry said yesterday it was considering not allowing Northwest to board passengers in Osaka on one of its three flights out of the city to Sydney. The US and Japan have been at loggerheads about the onward rights issue for some time. Talks in February to try to break the impasse were inconclusive. The two steel industries are also at odds over each other's activities in the US market. The latest salvo has come from the American Iron and Steel Institute which has accused Japanese steelmakers of threatening an embargo on supplies of specialty steel products on which US users are dependent. The accusation follows a Japan Iron and Steel Federation claim that the US anti-dumping action against Japanese steelmakers 'threatens the exclusion of foreign steel from the US market, including substantial quantities of steel not available domestically but crucial to the international competitiveness of some sectors of the US economy'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, June 24 (XINHUA) -- The Group of 77,  the largest organization of developing countries, marked the  30th anniversary of its establishment at a special ministerial  meeting here today.    The group enlarged its membership to 130 today by admitting  South Africa as a new member.    Created on June 15, 1964 by 77 developing countries, the  group has played a cardinal role in international economic  relations, calling for the establishment of a new international  economic order, safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests  of developing countries, and working as a major actor in  promoting development and international economic cooperation.    Presiding over the meeting, Algerian Foreign Minister  Mohamed  Salah Dembri, who is chairman of the Group of 77, said the group  faced the challenge of further strengthening its role, so that,  30 years after its founding, its common ideals might live on and  the complementary interests of all the members might be  effectively promoted.    The group should maintain its cohesion, broaden its horizon  and reaffirm its originality, specificity and independence, he  said.    UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali praised the group's  efforts for developing countries to gain independence and  promote development.    "Long indeed has been the road traveled by this group toward  what is today the underpinning of United Nations action for  development," he said.    UN General Assembly President S.R. Insanally congratulated  the group on its "splendid record of achievement" and said he  believed the group, through their collective efforts, would  "continue to make progress toward the goal of full development  for all peoples."    Chinese Premier Li Peng sent a telegram to the special  meeting, extending China's warm congratulations to the group and  pledging that China stands "ready to work with the Group of 77  for a gradual reform of the international economic order and for  the common development and prosperity of developing countries."    China's permanent representative to the UN Li Zhaoxing told  the meeting that China has decided to contribute 10,000 U.S.  dollars to the group.    At today's meeting, representatives from the group's member  states reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening south-south  cooperation, called for renewing the dialogue between the north  and the south, and urged developed countries to implement their  commitments to international economic cooperation, providing  developing countries with financial and technological support.    The meeting adopted a ministerial declaration which put  forward a new strategy of action of developing countries for the  year 2000 and beyond in light of the current world situation,  and a ministerial statement on "an agenda for development."    It also adopted terms of reference of the joint coordinating  committee between the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement,  another grouping of developing countries.</p>

Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins Act). Under the proposed absolute priority, funds under this competition would be reserved for applications proposing to demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector and public agencies in vocational education programs that serve criminal offenders under the supervision of the justice system. In addition, the Secretary intends to invite applications that, within the absolute priority of correctional education, incorporate one or more of the following invitational priorities: (1) Advanced technologies; (2) community-based correctional education; and (3) juvenile justice education. The Secretary also proposes to impose requirements related to the priorities and other matters, and to use new selection criteria in evaluating applications submitted for this competition only.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before May 6, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All comments concerning these proposed priorities should be addressed to Gail M.

This program can help further the purposes of the National Education Goals. Specifically, the correctional education priority directly supports Goal 5, that every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The designation of correctional education as a priority under the Cooperative Demonstration program is based on the critical problems of illiteracy and recidivism pervading our Nation's adult and juvenile corrections population. The U.S. Department of Education's National Adult Literacy Survey Report, ``Literacy Behind Prison Walls'' described a 70 percent illiteracy rate among a sample of prisoners as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> About seven in ten prisoners *&blank;*&blank;* are apt to experience difficulty in performing tasks that require them to integrate or synthesize information from complex or lengthy texts or to perform quantitative tasks that involve two or more sequential operations and that require the individual to set up the problem (1993, p.vi). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, a recent study, ``Vocational and Academic Indicators of Parole Success'' published in the Journal of Correctional Education, found that inmates who had received academic and vocational training while in prison were more likely to be employed and less likely to commit crimes after their release than other inmates (Schumacker,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Academic and vocational training is also critical for probationers and parolees since the majority of the Nation's criminal offenders are serving sentences within community corrections settings. There were about 4.5 million individuals under correctional supervision in the United States by the end of 1991, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Of these, 3.3 million, or approximately 73 percent, were under active probation or parole supervision within the community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Educational programs for criminal offenders that use applied learning strategies to teach life skills, job skills, and literacy can reduce the likelihood that the offenders will return to the criminal justice system. After completing their sentences, ex-offenders often have limited opportunities for meaningful employment and lack necessary basic life skills, including the job-seeking and job-retention skills needed to obtain and maintain employment. Without basic literacy and job skills, it is unlikely that these persons will become fully productive members of society.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary will announce the final priority in a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The final priority will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations of the Department. Funding of particular projects depends on the availability of funds, the nature of the final priority, and the quality of the applications received. The publication of this proposed priority does not preclude the Secretary from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only this priority, subject to meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office of Vocational and Adult Education's Office of Correctional Education coordinates programs for criminal offenders with other Department of Education offices and other Federal offices, including the Department of Justice's Federal Bureau of Prisons, National Institute of Justice, and Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The Office of Correctional Education collaborated with these Department of Justice offices in preparing this notice.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This notice of proposed priorities does  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> solicit applications.

The Secretary will fund under this competition only model projects that demonstrate ways in which public agencies in vocational education and the private sector can work together effectively to assist vocational education students who are criminal offenders under the supervision of the justice system to attain the advanced level of skills they need to make a successful transition from correctional education programs to productive employment including_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Work experience or apprenticeship programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Transitional worksite job training for vocational education students that is related to their occupational goals and closely linked to classroom and laboratory instruction provided by an eligible recipient; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Letter: Sterling struggle suggests 'game is up' again Sir, As the government struggles daily to maintain the existing parity of sterling against the D-Mark one may recall J M Keynes's warning to the prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, in August 1931 when unemployment was approaching 3m and sterling was under pressure: 'It is now nearly certain that we shall go off the existing parity at no distant date. When doubts as to the prosperity of a currency such as now exist about sterling have come into existence, the game is up.' In less than two months Britain left the Gold Standard and sterling depreciated quickly and sharply against the German mark. Will the present government's resolve be allowed to last as long?

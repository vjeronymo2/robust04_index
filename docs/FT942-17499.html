			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / US accuses Serbs of atrocities The US yesterday accused Serbs of a new wave of ethnic atrocities in northern Bosnia and called for those guilty of war crimes to be brought to justice. It said Serbs were trying to drive out Moslems, Croats and gypsies from the towns of Banja Luka and Prijedor. The US condemnation follows United Nations and Red Cross reports accusing Serbs of murdering 17 Moslems and two Croats in the Prijedor area, although Serb police claimed they were investigating only seven deaths. Meanwhile, the UN is considering despatch of 800 Ukrainian peacekeepers to Gorazde, the besieged Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. This move comes as Serb attacks on Gorazde have left 30 people dead and 132 wounded since Monday. Serb media, however, claimed a Moslem offensive was under way. The UN is also considering sending reinforcements for the French peacekeeping contingent in the north-western Moslem area of Bihac, where Serb and Bosnian forces yesterday signed a ceasefire. Plans for bolstering peacekeeping forces in Bosnia follow approval by the UN Security Council on Thursday of an extra 3,700 troops and advisers.</p>

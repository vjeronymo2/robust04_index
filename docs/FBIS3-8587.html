			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 10 (CTK) -- The Slovak economy is  undergoing a period of stabilization, Vice-Premier and Finance  Minister Julius Toth told CTK today in response to the  opposition's accusation in Parliament that the Government lacks  a clear economic and financial policy.    Toth thus also refuted President Michal Kovac's criticism of  the Slovak economy expressed yesterday in his speech.    All the important macroeconomic figures are changing  systematically, Toth said. Only after they have been stabilized  by the Government can a better economic policy be formulated, he  added. An economic strategy does indeed exist; its principles  were approved by the International Monetary Fund, he said.    The opposition "criminalizes" almost all the Government's  economic decisions, he stated. Of course the Government cannot  influence all business activity; it can only supervise it, he  said in response to criticism to the effect that millions of  crowns worth of hard currency payments have been leaking abroad,  including to the Czech Republic.    He admitted that Slovakia has a trade deficit vis-a-vis  Russia totalling 30 billion Slovak crowns ($910 million).    He reminded CTK that last year the Government lowered taxes  on businesses by five percent and plans to lower them still  further.    Vice-Premier for the Economy Sergej Kozlik said in defense  of  the Government that the U.S. foreign secretary praised Slovakia  for keeping inflation under control, building up foreign  currency reserves, and managing the budget deficit. Foreign  investment last year rose by 60 percent as compared to the three  preceding years.</p>

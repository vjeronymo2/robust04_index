			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN PRESIDENT DISPUTES SHOUP CLAIMS  </P> <P> After weeks of public silence on the issue, Cal Lutheran President Jerry Miller  spoke out Wednesday on Bob Shoup's dismissal as football coach, disputing  Shoup's claim that he was guaranteed lifetime job security by a former  president.  </P> <P> "There is nothing in the records that indicates tenure was ever given for the  position of coach," said Miller, who previously had restricted his comments  because a grievance by Shoup was in progress. Denial of the grievance was  upheld Monday by the executive committee of the university's Board of Regents.  </P> <P> Shoup has produced notarized documents by former President Maurice Knutson and  Jack Woudenberg, a former regent, stating that after Cal Lutheran won the NAIA  football championship in 1971 Knutson offered Shoup lifetime security as  football coach.  </P> <P> "There also is an indication in the record of the Board of Regents in . . .  October, 1971, that no additional tenure arrangements would be rendered for any  employees for a year," Miller said. However, Knutson claims that soon  thereafter he offered Shoup tenure as football coach, "which would seem to be a  contradiction," Miller said.  </P> <P> In his statement, Knutson said that, because of the university's dire financial  situation at the time, he was granted powers by Lutheran church officials that  superseded those of the Board of Regents. Miller said Shoup told him in August  that former university presidents had promised him tenure as football coach. "I  talked to two former presidents (Mark Mathews and Raymond Olson), and they knew  of no such commitment," said Miller, who did not ask Knutson.  </P> <P> Shoup said he disagrees with Miller's interpretation of that conversation.  "What I told him was that each president at Cal Lutheran had added to what is  now my current contract," Shoup said.  </P> <P> Miller also said there had been "no deal struck" with members of the Southern  California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference regarding Shoup's job as coach.  </P> <P> On May 3, Miller announced at a meeting of the conference that the 1989  football season would be Shoup's last as coach, a declaration that preceded the  university's Aug. 8 public announcement of Shoup's dismissal. Miller said the  SCIAC simply was informed about an agreement Shoup had reached with the  university earlier in the spring.  </P> <P> "The discussions that initially indicated that Shoup would not be returning as  football coach after the 1989 season occurred in February and March," Miller  said.  </P> <P> Shoup said he did not know his coaching future when he signed his '89-90  contract "under duress."  </P> <P> Shoup also had been disgruntled over losing supplemental income for the summer  of 1989. Miller said that because CLU decided in October, 1988, to stop  recruiting off campus and offering scholarships in implementing the move to the  SCIAC, Shoup's duties no longer necessitated a supplemental contract .  </P></p>

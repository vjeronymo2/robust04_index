			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 19 Apr (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Relations  Minister Roberto Robaina today focused on the result of his  regional tour: the opening of greater communications channels  and economic opportunities in Latin America.    The Cuban foreign minister, who was stopping over in this  city on his way back to Havana, has just visited Uruguay, Peru,  Argentina, and Paraguay. He said: "It was an opportunity to  better explain our situation and to learn more about the reality  of the American continent, which now more than ever needs to be  united."    The foreign minister told PRELA that the objective of this  visit was to explain what Cuba can contribute to the continent  and what Cuba can receive from the region. He announced that  businessmen from these four nations will begin visiting the  island in the next few days.    Robaina pointed out how convenient it is for Cuban diplomacy  to reflect the needs of national reality. He also pointed out  that the most important need nowadays is to find economic  opportunity.    To this end, he said that the natural stage for Cuba is  Latin  America, which Havana has always wanted to rescue and from which  it was almost artificially cut.    He underscored that it is very important for the Caribbean  nation to explain that our plan has not only shortcomings and  weaknesses but has also made many contributions.    As an example, he cited the influx of foreign capital,  because the country has raw materials, infrastructure, and a  work force with great cultural, technical, and scientific  qualifications.    He believes that the basic priority for the subcontinent is  economic integration, which will be discussed at the next  Ibero-American Summit in June in Cartagena, Colombia.    We can no longer continue to see how some countries are  meeting and solving their problems due to their resources and  geographic locations, while we, the poor ones, are more divided  than ever and are being ignored during the distribution process,  Robaina added.    As he delved deeply into the issue during his visit to these  countries, Robaina said that beyond the differing opinions made  public in the last few months, there was some progress made in  Argentina on the projects that the two nations can embark on  together.    As for Paraguay, the foreign minister stressed that Havana  is  not on the road to establishing diplomatic ties. He added,  however, that his visit opened a door and that the island now  has more friends in the Paraguayan political and socioeconomic  arenas.    As for the upcoming "Nation and Emigration" talks that will  be held this weekend in Havana with members of the Cuban  community living abroad, Robaina said that it is a natural step  and recalled that most countries maintain relations with their  citizens who live beyond their borders.    He said the objective of the meeting is not to rescue the  nation, as some have speculated, because Cuba has much more  important priorities. He underscored: "We are not willing to  let that community be used as an instrument against the island."    To this effect, Robaina explained that dialogue opens the  path to ensuring that "the communication that must exist comes  from us and that others can no longer manipulate it."</p>

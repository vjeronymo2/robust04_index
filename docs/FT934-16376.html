			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Survey of Cable TV and Satellite Broadcasting (1): The power of choice, with the promise of a digital future - Rapid changes in technology herald a gradual move away from public service monopolies and the mass media to individual programme selection. As new media empires start to emerge, Raymond Snoddy considers the likely prospects for the consumer - and the entertainment provider - in this brave new world The new headquarters of MTV Europe, in a North London building that was designed by architect Terry Farrell, are impressive by any standards. The international pop music satellite channel has recently expanded out of its former modest, cramped premises in a far less fashionable part of London, to inherit the Camden premises of TV-am, the commercial breakfast television station that lost its licence and went off the air at the beginning of this year. The office of Mr Bill Roedy, the MTV managing director, overlooking the Grand Union Canal, used to be occupied by David Frost, and the MTV executive has kept a picture of TV-am's most famous broadcaster on the wall. The famous TV-am egg cups are still on the roof of the building, but nowadays instead of chat at breakfast the studios transmit MTV 24 hours a day to about 55m homes around Europe and the Middle East. Two more channels are on their way across the Atlantic from Viacom, owners of MTV Nick-at- Nite, which offers entertainment for younger adults, and VH-1, Video Hits One which focuses on video hits from the past. They could also come out of studios where until recently Mr Bruce Gyngell, the chairman of TV-am, reigned supreme. The progress of MTV Europe over the past six years, symbolised by its new headquarters, is to a considerable extent a paradigm of the growing international ambitions, reach and technical potential of the new media. So as to improve its coverage, MTV Europe is now on four different satellites and last month it arrived for the first time in both Cyprus and Turkey, through deals with local broadcasters and cable operators. There was also a press conference, held on a bomb site, to mark the arrival of the service in Lebanon. In January MTV Europe will use digital compression technology on at least one of its satellites so that it can squeeze four channels into the satellite capacity presently occupied by one in providing a service to cable networks. The company declines to disclose financial figures but it is now believed to be at least modestly in profit, almost certainly the first pan-European channel to move out of loss, with revenues of more than Dollars 70m a year and more than 200 advertisers. 'In September (ie last month) we took more advertising revenue than in the whole of 1990,' is all Mr Roedy will say. He adds, however, that on his travels he has seen MTV not just at the Czech airport in Prague, in nightclubs in Moscow, or in Reykjavik in Iceland but also in the En Gedi kibbutz at the base of Masada in Israel, in souks in Marrakesh and in a fallout shelter converted into a nightclub in Bratislava, Slovakia. Mr Roedy only just stops short of claiming credit for the fall of the Berlin Wall for his irreverent service although he points out that MTV was there two days later, broadcasting to the former east Germany and was invited into Lithuania as a step towards democracy and free flows of information while President Landsbergis was barricaded in his office, resisting the Soviet army. He says he is going to try to make sure that MTV gets to the Gaza strip and Jericho following the Middle East peace agreement, whether or not it adds much to his advertising revenues. Across London in Battersea, a new consortium has inherited the plush remains of another broad- casting misfortune in Marco Polo house, headquarters of British Satellite Broadcasting until it was rudely merged with Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television to form British Sky Broadcasting. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, was a major shareholder in BSB and has a 17.5 per cent stake in the merged BSkyB satellite venture. Now, the magnificent atrium and the marbled toilets, where in the BSB days fresh flowers were placed every day, are occupied by broadcasters of a very different hue. On October 1 QVC, a joint venture between QVC of the US and Sky Television, went on the air - the UK's first 24-hours-a-day, 365 days a year shopping channel. In the US the QVC channel, run by Mr Barry Diller, former head of the Twentieth Century Fox studios, had a turnover of Dollars 1bn in 1992-93. The company is bidding against Viacom to take over Paramount, one of the Hollywood majors. In the UK the joint venture will be pioneering the round- the-clock selling of a wide range of domestic, consumer and electrical goods costing between Pounds 10 and Pounds 500, largely by credit card. Presenters will be responsible for three-hour live stints - with a particular theme bringing together groups of goods being offered every hour. At least to begin with the programme will not be live for all of the 24-hours with repeats being broadcast in the early hours. All the goods will actually be owned by the consortium and be ready for dispatch from their own warehouse to customers who should receive them usually within three or four days. Because the productions are live, if a item sells out the presenter can move on rapidly to the next series of goods. Mr Peter Ridsdale, the chief executive, promises that the channel, which is part of the Sky multi-channel subscription package, will emphasise quality rather than cheapness but adds that discounts will average around 20 per cent on shop prices because of the lower overheads involved. In the begin- ning a wide range of goods will be offered to see which go down best. The service will be the first of its kind in the UK with its own dedicated channel although there are rivals such as Sell-A-Vision, a joint venture between two cable programme companies, Flextech of the UK and Quantum International, part of the National Media Corporation of the US. The Sell-A-Vision service, aimed at the larger European market, takes on unused morning hours on other channels and focuses on 'infomercials'  - long films on the virtues of a particular product. It is broadcast in four languages, English, Dutch, German and French, for up to 55 hours a week on the Astra satellite. According to Mr Roger Luard, chief executive of Flextech, profits are rising month-on-month. In London leading cable operators have also improved their prog- ramme services by building a link between their franchises - 'the London interconnect' - and setting up a special channel for cable called Wire TV. The London interconnect allows cable operators to exchange new programme services such as Performance, devoted to the arts, and Identity, specialising in black programmes, which no single cable operator could provide on its own. Satellite transmission would be too expensive for such services and the interconnect is much more practical than delivering video cassettes by motorcycle all over London. There are even plans for a London news channel and talks are believed to be going on with a number of newspaper groups. The next stage is to link the London cable network with Birmingham and in time it is expected that all the big cable franchises in the UK will be able to communicate with each other and exchange programmes. Such links not only open up the possibility of creating a greater diversity of new channels but should also make the cable audience more interesting to advertisers. At the moment the multi-channel universe - a total of 658,884 households at the beginning of July could receive at least some of the new channels - is too frag- mented to appeal to national advertisers. The ability to reach all the cable households in London with a single advertisement could begin to change that. Down in Bristol, the head- quarters and studios of Wire TV, the new channel supported by the large cable players and operated by United Artists Programming, are much less plush. In fact, in an echo of the access television pioneered by Mr Moses Znaimer's CityTV in Toronto, a lot of the prog- ramme time is set in a shopping mall and there are experts such as doctors and lawyers on hand to give advice. But the emphasis is on informality and almost anything can happen. Mrs Joyce Taylor, chief executive of United Artists Programming, whose prog- ramme interests range from Discovery, the documentary channel to Bravo, the classic films channel, or as they are trying to market it today 'timewarp television', sees Wire TV as closer to a commer- cial radio station with pictures than conventional television. Wire TV is meant to provide a national backbone of prog- rammes to hold together the local programme offerings of cable operators around the UK and an outside broadcast van trundles around the country making programmes. The 5-7pm period each evening is designated as an opt-out slot when operators can insert their own local news prog- rammes. It is also part of the process of making sure cable television has channels and attractions of its own on top of those common to satellite. The life and diversity of international, national regional and local programmes ranging from MTV to QVC and Performance to Wire TV gives a suggestion of what is happening in the cable and satellite television market and the way an increasing number of services is being delivered, in addition to the offerings of the traditional broadcasters. Yet all the signs are that what is available now is very much the beginning. Large international corporate forces taking advantage of rapid technological change are gathering, which are likely to transform the media business over the remaining years of this century and equally transform the level of choice available, at least in theory, to consumers. Politicians glibly revive old visions of creating 'super- highways' of limitless capacity down fibre optic strands as thin as a human hair, usually without going into the specifics of how it is going to happen and who is going to pay. But 10 years after the first wave of such talk, this time at least there is some reality to the vision. In a notable piece of investment research last year Goldman Sachs predicted that because of rapid technological developments in computer software and hardware, consumer electronics, cable and telecommunications industries, 'a true revolution in the delivery of enter- tainment, information, trans- actional and telecommun- ications service may be at hand'. The analysts argued that the marrying of the cable converter box with the computer, the turning of television pictures into digital form and their compression and the use of fibre optics and personal computer software would ultimately allow 'immediate access to and manipulation of a bounty of information and informational products'. They called it the new world of Communacopia. Predicting the precise timing of such a process, when the consumer will start realising he lives in Communacopia, and be prepared to pay, and forecasting who will be the winners and losers in such a world are challenges of a different order to noting that a number of industries are con- verging. According to Mr Nicholas Negraponte, director of the media laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, there is simply no doubt. The future is digital. And when everything from television to telecom- munications can communicate in digits, the language of computers, the extra choice that becomes available will lead to a gradual move away from the concept of mass media to one of personal media and individual choice. Of course people will still read a general newspaper or magazine and watch a mainstream television channel to be surprised, amused, come across something they did not know they wanted to know, or share in the feeling of being part of a larger society or culture. But increasingly, Mr Negraponte believes, there will be a growing tier of personal media both visual as well as print and that computers will be programmed to hunt databases and programme libraries to assemble specific packages of information or programmes to match the taste and needs of individual consumers. Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation, would certainly not go so far as Mr Negraponte - or at least not yet - but he keeps in touch with the latest developments in media technology. Last month he expressed what is rapidly becoming conventional wisdom at a high-powered dinner in London's Whitehall held to mark the transformation of Sky into a largely subscription package. Five major industries - computers, telecom- munications, television, entertainment and telecommunications - were converging into a single giant industry which would be the third largest in the world, he said. 'We feel that our company, with its worldwide network of talent, can make an important contribution to this exciting industry and, in the process enrich the countries in which we and their peoples work,' the News Corporation chairman said. The speech and a flurry of announcements that preceded it - everything from the purchase of a controlling stake in Star TV in Hong Kong which broadcasts to 38 Asian countries, to joint television ventures in Mexico and Germany, led critics to conclude that Mr Murdoch had embarked on a new phase of his bid for worldwide media domination now that he had largely broken free again from the debts and bankers who nearly took the company under three years ago. He did not manage to persuade everyone with his further claim that technology was undermining the power of the individual media mogul by greatly increasing the number of possible competing choices available. One of the key technologies Mr Murdoch was talking about was digital compression - turning television pictures into a digital stream and manipulating them. Digital television equipment is already commonplace in the backrooms of the television industry, in such places as editing suites and special effects where they can turn reality on its head and send things whizzing through the air. But much more than visual gimmicks can be achieved. Turn a picture into digital form and you can either have a wide screen with enhanced quality picture, a large number of new channels or a trade-off between the two. Consumer electronics manufacturers would very much like to sell their customers new high definition television sets . One day no doubt they will, but early indications from the marketplace would suggest that more consumers are interested in having an increase in channels than seeking sometimes evol- utionary enhancements in the television picture that are more readily noticeable to television engineers than those who already quite happily watch appalling pictures with badly tuned aerials. Companies such as National Transcommunications, the former transmitting and engineering arm of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority in the UK, Scientific Atlanta and Compression Labs of the US are already offering digital compression systems. A National Transcom system is being used this autumn to turn one channel into three for FilmNet, the Brussels-based European film channel. The Astra satellite system is planning to offer digitally compressed channels from 1995 - as long as agreement has been reached on standards - something that seems increasingly likely. Last month 85 manu- facturers and broadcasters from 12 countries met in Bonn to set up the Digital Video Broadcasting project to draft a European standard by the end of this year which will incorporate, where possible, the work of the Motion Pictures Expert Group and the emerging standard known as MPEG 2 . Agreement could mean the prospect of 150-channel television systems for Europe would then open up. Eutelsat, the rival satellite system to Astra which is owned by the post and telecommunications organisations of Europe, plans to offer digital on a satellite due for launch in 1996  - Hot Bird Plus. A large number of compressed channels is also likely on the Star system by 1995. In digital compression a great reduction in the amount of information that has to be transmitted is achieved by storing the elements of a television picture that do not change from one frame to the next. Instead, only the information covering movement, or any other new elements in the picture, is transmitted. The savings in information are so great that, depending on the quality of picture required, as many as 10 television channels can be squeezed into the space previously occupied by one channel. Not only does digital technology make more channels possible, by reducing the cost of delivery a wider range of minority channels broadcast by satellite becomes financially viable. So far, digitally compressed channels are being sent only to cable networks rather than direct to the consumer. This is the quickest way to achieve savings because only one decoder is needed at the cable head end to serve the entire cable network. Domestic decoders are now being designed and the first digital television service to the home will be launched next year. This December a Hughes Aircraft company satellite will be launched from French Guyana, a satellite which by April 1994 will be broadcasting a digitally compressed service of between 70 and 80 channels to dishes of less than 18 inches diameter over the entire US continent. A second satellite is due to go up in mid-1994, which will mean the system will be able to offer a total of 150 channels. 'Everything is on schedule,' the operating company DirectTV said this month. The domestic equipment is being manufactured by Thomson Consumer Electronics. About 50 to 60 of the channels will be given over to 'nearly video-on-demand'. Five or six satellite channels can be devoted to a single popular film and the showing times staggered so that the viewer is never more than 15 or 20 minutes away from the beginning of the film on one of the channels. DirectTV also plans to run a batch of channels aimed at rural areas of America which are not cabled or cannot receive television signals without erecting enormous dishes. There will be special events and sports channels covering games not shown on network television. DirectTV expects its subscribers to spend something like Dollars 25 to Dollars 30 a month on the services available. It is too early to judge how well DirectTV will fare - previous high power satellite television services in the US have foundered largely because more than 60 per cent of the population are already hooked up to cable networks. The receiving equipment is expected to sell at Dollars 699 to Dollars 899, not including installation. This compares with between Dollars 1,800 and Dollars 2,500 for existing backyard dishes which can be as large as three metres in diameter. Some US observers think that DirectTV could at least dent cable's growth as well as making inroads into the 3m homes in the US that have very large dishes. A number of large US media groups are looking at different ways of delivering greatly increased choice and pay- per-view movies, through cable networks as well as satellite. Time Warner, for instance, the world's largest media group, is already running a 150-channel service on a conventional cable network in the New York borough of Queens - and again, apart from the normal selection of cable channels and several ethnic minority services such as Korean and Japanese channels, a large block of channels is set aside for the staggered showing of a small number of hit movies in the hope of generating new revenue. The company is also building an experimental cable system in Orlando, Florida, to look into the market for advanced interactive services of all kinds. Viacom is setting up its advanced cable system at Castro Valley, California, as virtually a cable laboratory to test a range of possible ways of delivering and charging for new services. 'There may not be a single answer. There may be two or three ways to play,' Mr Frank Biondi, chief executive of Viacom, says. TCI, the Denver-based cable operator run by Mr John Malone, which is the largest in the world, is even pushing ahead with a 500-channel cable service using compression. A lot of the activity flows from the hope in many US media companies that pay-per-view could begin to generate enormous revenues. So far, the hopes have far outstripped the performance. Mr Biondi recalls that, when satellite film channels such as Home Box Office were launched in the early 1970s, the talk was of pay-per-view but instead it went down the monthly subscription route because the billing was more convenient, although technical developments have now eased that particular problem. According to Mr Biondi, 'there has been no serious take-up for pay-per-view for 20 years. We are way behind revenue projections on motion picture pay-per view.' He believes there is still a great deal of posturing in the marketplace. 'If there is a tremendous jump in revenues people will do it much more quickly,' he adds. When 50 to 60 channels were first introduced at Queens, it is believed that the monthly revenue for home pay-per-view on five channels rose from Dollars 4 to Dollars 8 or Dollars 9 per home. 'Good but not great,' one industry observer commented. By contrast, film subscription channels in the US have an annual take of between Dollars 4bn and Dollars 5bn, a figure that totally dwarfs pay-per-view, which so far is little more than Dollars 200m a year. At this year's FT cable and satellite conference Mr Edward Bleier, a Time Warner pay-per-view specialist, suggested that although conventional systems produced only Dollars 5 a month from each pay-per-view subscriber, Dollars 10-Dollars 15 might be possible with movies 'nearly on demand'. He warned, however, that all the evidence suggested that there was a limited range of things that the public were willing to pay for - mainly hit movies and genuine events such as a world boxing title match. Run-of-the-mill concerts do not register at the pay-per-view box office. The outlook could, however, improve further, he added, when 'we finally achieve electronic Nirvana'. What Mr Bleier had in mind was massive libraries of films stored electronically which can be directly switched to individual viewers' homes. Nirvana has hardly arrived yet but a number of organisations, apart from cable and satellite companies, are working hard on developing ways of competing directly with the video shop by enabling consumers to order the film of their choice electronically. Later this month British Telecom will decide whether to go ahead with a video-on- demand service down existing conventional telephone lines. The plan would cost several billion pounds. A number of American telephone companies have been carrying out similar work. BT technologists insist that pictures of a 'merchantable' quality - as good as video recorder reception can be deliv- ered over a high proportion of the BT telephone network which goes into 23m homes. There is enough capacity for the pictures to be transmitted down a telephone line while a conventional telephone conversation is taking place. BT concedes that picture quality may fade the further away a consumer is from the local telephone exchange. Cable television critics say it is all very well demonstrating good quality pictures in the laboratory with brand new copper wire connections, but quite another matter to deliver such pictures down ancient copper wires installed decades ago. Mr John Sheridan, chief executive of Encom Cable, which operates cable franchises in London from Newham and Tower Hamlets to Redbridge and Waltham Forest, says that BT will be in a weak competitive position with its pictures down telephone wires. 'It's something that has been invented after it is too late,' he says. 'It's going to be very limited in terms of bandwidth (capacity). The technology will expand it but if it is competing with fibre which is much deeper in the neighbourhood (through cable ),' Mr Sheridan adds. Last month appeared to clear a major regulatory hurdle which might have blocked the introduction of such a service. The Independent Television Commission after discussions with Oftel, the telecom- munications watchdog and the Department of Trade and Industry said it did not think that pure video-on-demand, where a programme was requested by and shown in an individual household, needed a local delivery licence under existing broadcasting legislation. If BT had needed a local operator's licence from the ITC, it would almost certainly not have got one one in cable franchise areas. The Commission has always taken the view that it will not license competitors to cable, at least while networks are still being built. The ITC's view of the matter, which is subject to seeing detailed proposals might yet be tested in the courts. Mr Richard Woollam, managing director of the Cable Television Association, the industry trade organisation, is phlegmatic in commenting about the challenge from such a service. 'What we are seeing from the US is that while video-on-demand may be the cherry on the cake as a stand-alone product, it isn't proving to be a commercial success.' The CTA managing director adds that BT has not fully sorted out its voice business yet. 'To try to stick in some form of digitalised compressed video service is very much Hans Christian Andersen stuff,' he adds. In spite of his doubts about the financial viability of such a service, it is likely that the CTA, on behalf of the cable industry, will sue BT if it tries to go ahead. Under the Duopoly Review BT is for- bidden from competing directly with cable television in programme services until at least the year 2000. Any legal dispute is likely to revolve around what sort of service under existing legislation video-on-demand is deemed to be. Certainly, many of the big players in the UK media industry have been to see BT's telephone pictures, including companies such as Pearson and ITV groups such as London Weekend Television. Apart from trying to expand into a new business, and perhaps applying indirect pressure for the loosening of restrictions on its activities, BT is probably not averse to trying to shake some of the growing confidence in cable television. The cable industry has been causing BT a small but growing headache by offering competing telephone services at a discount and video services could help stunt cable growth although the main threat would be to video shops. The BT decision to enter the satellite dish market, and put considerable marketing weight behind the initiative, is once again designed to try to stop cable in its tracks. The more satellite dishes there are out there, the fewer customers there will be for cable, the hope goes, and with it fewer customers for cable telephone services. But as BT tries to make up its mind at board level whether to commit itself to a national video-on-demand system, another approach to the market shows signs of coming to fruition.</p>

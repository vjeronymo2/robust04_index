			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Swift action to block cartels urged by Borrie THE GOVERNMENT should press ahead quickly with legislation to prevent cartels emerging in industry, Sir Gordon Borrie, the director-general of fair trading, said yesterday. Sir Gordon, who retires this month after 16 years in the job, said that in his final meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, he had urged him to introduce legislation as soon as possible. He warned banks in particular that the OFT was watching them to see if they were operating cartels. He said: 'Small businesses do not have a lot of choice when it comes to banking services.' He added that although there was no direct evidence of a cartel, there was a great deal of concern over the introduction by several banks of charges for setting up overdrafts. He also referred to the OFT's fears that the Lloyds bid for Midland might reduce competition in high street banking. He said: 'When one of the majors (banks) decides to try and take over another of the majors, one can only wonder whether this might not make the problem worse.' The OFT feels that although it has been effective in tackling cartels in some industries - such as construction materials manufacturing - its present powers are too limited for it to be sure whether cartels exist in some industries. Total complaints to the OFT were 750,000, 8 per cent up on 1990. There was a particularly steep increase in the numbers of complaints about financial services, especially about banks and estate agents. More than 4,000 complaints were received about banks, 63 per cent up on last year. There were 2,477 complaints about estate agents, 58 per cent up on 1990. Financial services were well below many other industries for the number of complaints. The largest category was about house building, fittings and appliances. There were nearly 237,000 complaints in this category but the total was slightly down on 1990.</p>

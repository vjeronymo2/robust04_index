			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 SURVEYS FIND MAJORITY SYMPATHETIC TO HOMELESS;  </P> <P> HOUSING: RESPONDENTS BLAMED SOCIETAL FORCES FOR THE SITUATION. MANY BELIEVE THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD HANDLE THE PROBLEM.  </P> <P> Public support for homeless people remains high despite some recent reports  that Americans are beginning to lose sympathy for them, two independent  research groups have reported.  </P> <P> In a survey of residents of Buffalo, N.Y., 66% said they blame societal forces  such as unemployment for the plight of the homeless, while 34% said they blame  the homeless themselves.  </P> <P> Similarly, a poll of Nashville residents revealed that 58.6% blamed society.  The studies were reported Saturday at the annual meeting of the American  Psychological Assn. in Boston.  </P> <P> "The public is very supportive of the homeless," said Paul Toro, a psychologist  at the State University of New York in Buffalo. "There appears to be support  for the homeless across the political spectrum and across the nation."  </P> <P> Toro said he disputes several recent media reports suggesting that the public  is becoming fed up with the homeless and their problems. Four major surveys  over three years, he said, show public support for helping the homeless has not  wavered. And no evidence of weakening public support is apparent in data  compiled through April of this year, he said.  </P> <P> "Our data are in conflict with those findings" that the public is losing  sympathy, Toro said.  </P> <P> He suggested that the aggressive tactics of some street panhandlers might cause  some resentment of the homeless even though general public support has not  declined.  </P> <P> Both the Nashville and Buffalo studies found that the public is eager to seek  solutions to the homeless crisis.  </P> <P> "Only crime was rated as more important than homelessness," said David Lewis of  Vanderbilt University. The Nashville study was based on a telephone poll of 293  people and the Buffalo survey used 240 respondents.  </P> <P> In the Buffalo study, 59% of the respondents said they believed that the  homeless problem is worsening, and 58% said they believed that the federal  government was most responsible for helping the homeless. Only 19% said they  believed that state government was primarily responsible.  </P> <P> More than half of those surveyed, 59%, said they are willing to pay more taxes  to help the homeless. Most said they favored increased job training and  building more low-cost housing over increasing welfare spending or raising the  minimum wage.  </P> <P> Toro said he found that widespread media coverage of homelessness has  enlightened the public.  </P> <P> "The public is amazingly knowledgeable about characteristics of the homeless,"  he said. "If you have a good image about a person -- which most Americans have  about the homeless -- it's easier to support them."  </P> <P> Homelessness is a major issue at the 98th annual APA convention that runs  through Tuesday. In other studies on homelessness reported at the convention:  </P> <P> * Pennsylvania State University researchers also found that the public blames  society for the problems of the homeless, but the experts cautioned that  support for the homeless could easily fall given "the public's limited  attention span" and alternative public worries, such as environmental problems.  </P> <P> * Adolescents are living on the streets at a much younger age than they did  several years ago and have more problems than adult homeless people, a Berkeley  researcher reported. Marjorie Robertson said her study revealed that homeless  adolescents have many more health problems than teen-agers living at home.  One-quarter of homeless adolescents surveyed in Hollywood rated their health as  only fair or poor.  </P> <P> * Nearly one-third of the nation's 1.5 million homeless are veterans, reported  Sumner Garte of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Chicago. According to  Garte, a high percentage of homeless veterans may have used the military to  escape from a poor economic situation. While these men are in the military  "they learn skills that are not transferable to the job market," Garte said.  </P></p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico Mexican shares ended a dull session slightly higher as investors mulled over Thursday night's debate between the country's three main presidential candidates. The 37-share IPC index ended up 4.47 points at 2,240.17 after trading in a narrow eight-point range. Advancing shares led declines 42-23 in moderate trade of 77m shares. The debate between the candidates in August's election was the first ever televised but it appeared to have little effect on trading. 'There's just no news and the market's flat,' a trader said. 'There was a lot of speculation before the debate but there hasn't been any reaction today.' Baring Securities in New York said that it was advising investors to buy Mexican stocks more aggressively on expectations of real earnings per share growth of 12 per cent for a sample of companies in 1994, followed by 19 per cent in 1995.</p>

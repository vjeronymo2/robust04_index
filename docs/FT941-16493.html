			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not taken in by vouchers Sir, Russians learned not to believe everything they saw on television long before the launch of TV ads promising a fortune in return for a privatisation voucher ('Yeltsin plans curbs on abuses of privatisation by voucher', January 5). Our representative survey of Russians, supported by the Foreign Office Know-How Fund, found the great majority of Russians have a realistic idea of a voucher's worth, estimating its value at Rbs9,000 roubles (about Pounds 5). Moreover, 82 per cent reckon their voucher will decline in value. We can extend to Russia the aphorism of a pioneering student of public opinion: 'Ordinary people are not fools'.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) EPA approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under this section is to be presumed not to have been granted if a requirement of this subpart has not been met. This includes, but is not limited to, properly modifying the nonroad engine to be in conformity in all material respects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the description in the application for certification or not complying with the provisions of &sect;89.605&hyph;96(a)(2) or if the final emission test results, adjusted by the deterioration factor, if applicable, do not comply with applicable emission standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, EPA approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under this section is presumed to have been granted if the ICI does not receive oral or written notice from EPA to the contrary within 15 working days of the date that the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA receives the ICI's application under paragraph (a) of this section. EPA notice of nonapproval may be made to any employee of the ICI. It is the responsibility of the ICI to ensure that the Manufacturers Operations Division of EPA receives the application and to confirm the date of receipt. During this 15 working day hold period, the nonroad engine is to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stored at a location where the Administrator has reasonable access to the nonroad engine for the Administrator's inspection. The storage is to be within 50 miles of the ICI's testing facility to allow the Administrator reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access for inspection and/or testing. A storage facility not meeting this criterion must be approved in writing by the Administrator prior to the submittal of the ICI's application under paragraph (a) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.606&hyph;96  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Inspection and testing of imported nonroad engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) In order to allow the Administrator to determine whether an ICI's production nonroad engines comply with applicable emission requirements or requirements of this subpart, an EPA enforcement officer or authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative is authorized to conduct inspections and/or tests of nonroad engines imported by the ICI. The ICI must admit an EPA enforcement officer or authorized representative during operating hours to any of the following places upon demand and upon presentation of credentials:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Any facility where any nonroad engine imported by the ICI under this subpart was or is being modified, tested, or stored and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Any facility where any record or other document relating to modification, testing, or storage of the nonroad engine, or required to be kept by &sect;89.607&hyph;96, is located. EPA may require inspection or testing of nonroad engines at the test facility used by the ICI or at an EPA-designated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing facility, with transportation and/or testing costs to be borne by the ICI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Upon admission to any facility referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, an EPA enforcement officer or authorized representative is allowed during operating hours:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To inspect and monitor any part or aspect of activities relating to the ICI's modification, testing, and/or storage of nonroad engines imported under this subpart;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To inspect and make copies of record(s) or document(s) related to modification, testing, and storage of a nonroad engine, or required by &sect;89.607&hyph;96; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) To inspect and photograph any part or aspect of the nonroad engine and any component used in the assembly thereof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) An EPA enforcement officer or authorized representative is to be furnished, by those in charge of a facility being inspected, with such reasonable assistance as the officer or representative may request to help discharge any function listed in this subpart. An ICI must make arrangements with those in charge of a facility operated for its benefit to furnish such reasonable assistance without charge to EPA. Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to, clerical, copying, interpretation and translation services, and the making available on request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their working hours to inform the EPA enforcement officer or authorized representative of how the facility operates and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to answer any questions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section apply whether or not the ICI owns or controls the facility in question. It is the ICI's responsibility to make such arrangements as may be necessary to assure compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. Failure to do so, or other failure to comply with paragraphs (a), (b), or (c), may result in sanctions as provided for in the Act or &sect;89.612&hyph;96(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Duly designated enforcement officers are authorized to proceed ex parte to seek warrants authorizing the inspection or testing of the nonroad engines described in paragraph (a) of this section whether or not the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement officers first attempted to seek permission from the ICI or facility owner to inspect such nonroad engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) The results of the Administrator's test under this section comprise the official test data for the nonroad engine for purposes of determining whether the nonroad engine should be permitted final entry under &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.607&hyph;96  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Maintenance of independent commercial importer's records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Independent Commercial Importer (ICI) subject to any of the provisions of this subpart must establish and maintain adequately organized and indexed records, correspondence and other applicable documents relating to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the certification, modification, test, purchase, sale, storage, registration, and importation of that nonroad engine. The ICI must retain such records for 8 years from the date of final admission or exportation of a nonconforming nonroad engine imported by the ICI. These records include, but are not limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The declaration required by U.S. Bureau of Customs regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Any documents or other written information required by a federal government agency to be submitted or retained in conjunction with the certification, importation or emission testing (if applicable) of nonroad engines;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) All bills of sale, invoices, purchase agreements, purchase orders, principal or agent agreements, and correspondence between the ICI and the ultimate purchaser of each nonroad engine and between any agents of the above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) For nonroad engines imported by an ICI pursuant to &sect;89.605&hyph;96 or &sect;89.609&hyph;96, documents providing parts identification data (including calibration changes and part numbers and location of such parts on each nonroad engine) associated with the emission control system installed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each nonroad engine demonstrating that such emission control system was properly installed on such nonroad engine;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

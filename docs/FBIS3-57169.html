Kozyrev  announced this to an Interfax correspondent before leaving  Moscow for Kyrgyzstan and China on Monday.    Zhirinovskiy stated last week that he gave Kozyrev a "week  for thought," and if the Russian foreign minister did not  correct his approach Zhirinovskiy would seek his resignation.    The foreign minister pointed out that the LDP leader's  position was an "overt attempt to push Russia into a world war."  He warned against engaging Russia in the conflict on the Balkan  peninsula, where the First World War had started and led to the  seizure in Russia of power by an irresponsible clique causing  monstrous damage to the country for 70 years.    According to Kozyrev, "some political forces" may try to get  Russia involved in a "global catastrophe," to make a career of  this and to seize power.    "I am not satisfied with this scenario either in foreign or  in domestic policy and I will never be satisfied with it. If  after this Zhirinovskiy demands my resignation I will consider  this as the best recognition of the correctness of my policy,"  the minister pointed out.</p>

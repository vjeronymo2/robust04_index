			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Sergey Knyazkov: </F> "The Fourth Draft Is Like the Previous Fifth Point:  Russian-Latvian Agreement Threatened"]    [Text] The Latvian  Sejm did not approve the intergovernmental agreement with Russia  on social protection for military pensioners initialed back on  15 March, despite the fact that it was undoubtedly aware of the  official statement made by President of the Russian Federation  Boris Yeltsin just yesterday. Among other things, it stressed  the fact "we have not planned and are not planning to build  military bases on Latvian territory. This has to do only with  the temporary functioning of a single Russian establishment  under civilian control, the radar station in the city of  Skrunda". (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA covered relations between our nations  in greater detail on 20 April).    Public opinion has also forced President of the Republic of  Latvia Guntis Ulmanis to alter his position. He spoke out in  favor of an agreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops prior  to 31 August of this year, on social protection for servicemen  for the period of troop withdrawal and for temporary retention  of the radar station at Skrunda. Speaking of the fourth  agreement, which has to do with social protection for military  pensioners and their families residing in Latvia, Ulmanis  proposed the establishment of a group of experts, which would  continue the quest for mutually acceptable solutions for the  next 10 days.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA learned yesterday that Russian President  Boris Yeltsin and Latvian President Ulmanis had reached  agreement by telephone to hold a meeting in Moscow in the  immediate future.    The precise date of the meeting, at which it is planned to  sign the initialed agreements between the two countries,  specifically the one on the withdrawal of Russian troops and  rent for the radar station at Skrunda, has apparently not yet  been set.</p>

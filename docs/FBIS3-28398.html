			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  will call a meeting of national security-related cabinet  ministers Tuesday morning to discuss the North Korean nuclear  issue and overall security on the Korean peninsula.    The meeting will be attended by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang,  Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Minister Yi  Yong-tok, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae.    The ministers are likely to work out measures to deal with  the latest developments in the nuclear issue and security  concerns on the peninsula, his aides said.    At this year's first national security meeting, President  Kim and his ministers are expected to analyze the negotiations  between North Korea and the International Atomic energy agency  on IAEA inspections.    They will then discuss possible international action on the  matter, sources said.    Specifically, the issues include referral to the United  Nations Security Council of the North Korean question and the  North's military activities in relation to security in the South.    They will also study a third round of high-level talks  between Washington and Pyongyang on improving relations and the  content of North Korean President Kim Il-song's personal message  to U.S. President Bill Clinton.    The meeting, coming only one day before the three-day Lunar  New Year's holiday, reflects the sense of urgency among South  Korean Government leaders as the deadline for resolving the  North Korean nuclear issue fast approaches, the sources said.    The Seoul Government wants to establish firm measures on the  nuclear problem and dispel anxiety among South Korean citizens,  they said. It has been widely reported that the United States  will refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security  Council unless Pyongyang and the IAEA reach some kind of  agreement on inspections before Feb. 21, when the IAEA convenes  a three-day Board of Governors' meeting.    Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik, however, tried to  diminish the rising sense of crisis when he told reporters that  the meeting is not being held because of any urgent developments  in the North Korean nuclear problem.    "The nuclear problem has surfaced as an important question  (for the government) and a pending issue throughout the world,"  Chu said, explaining the meeting's background.    Those attending the meeting include Kim Tok, director of the  Agency for National Security Planning, Gen. Yi Yang-ho, chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Chong Chong-uk, senior  presidential secretary for foreign affairs and national security.</p>

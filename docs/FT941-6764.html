			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (6): Correction became a crash - Stock values have lost 60 per cent since 1992 Jamaica's rampaging bull has been harnessed and reduced to a troubled and uncertain bear. Wounded investors are still trying to come to terms with the behaviour of the stock exchange. In 1992 it was the fastest growing in the world in 1992. Since then it has lost 60 per cent of its value. While brokers say the correction was inevitable, not many anticipated such a crash. The traded companies have remained profitable, but the market was affected by a coincidence of economic and political developments which have left it winded. The volume of business in 1992 pushed the index to a record high of 25,975.88 at the end of that year. The growth continued into January and February of last year. Transactions in January last year totaled JDollars 1.4bn when market capitalisation reached JDollars 99bn. Inevitably, the bubble had to burst, says Mr Wain Iton, general manager of the exchange. 'The market could not have continued at the rate it grew in 1991 and 1992, but not many investors realised this. Average price appreciation in 1991 and 1992 was 110 per cent.' A survey of the world's stock markets in January 1993 found that Jamaica's - with an increase of 218 per cent in share prices - was the fastest growing, ahead of Peru and China, says Mr Iton. Brokers and investors discounted the first warning signs of what they expected to be a moderate correction. But the slide gathered speed: between January and December the index moved from 32,421.71 to 13,099.68. 'The companies were making profits, and are still making profits, so the change had nothing to do with the performance of the listed companies,' Mr Iton says. He and brokers and economists have blamed the contraction of the market on several other factors. The financial sector was troubled by reports of irregularities in the central bank's foreign exchange operations, followed by uncertainty, with indications that the prime minister was planning an early election - called in March of last year. This was accompanied by concerns about possible changes in economic policy if the government was changed. The incumbent People's National Party retained office, but the 1993 budget was delayed, amid persistent reports that the government planned to impose taxes on capital gains. The main cause of the slump in the market, says Mr Basil Buck, chief executive of Buck Securities, one of the island's leading brokers, has been the government's decision to pursue a high interest rate policy as part of its efforts to curb demand and ease pressure on the exchange rate of the Jamaican dollar. Investors jumped from the stock market into government paper which offered interest rates of just over 50 per cent. 'Investors will go back to the market only when there is an end to the high interest rate policy,' says Mr Buck. 'High yields in fixed investments have become the alternative to the stock exchange,' said Mr Iton. 'The fixed investments to which investors are turning are risk-free, and the interest rates which are offered are currently about 50 per cent.' There has been some debate about the interpretation of what happened to the market. 'The stock market crashed,' says Mr Bruce Golding, the shadow finance minister. His conclusion is shared by Mr Buck. 'Like every bull market there had to be a correction, but a correction is usually between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. This market self-destructed.' 'Some have referred to what happened as a crash,' argues Mr Iton. 'Clearly, the decline has been of crash proportions, as the market lost 60 per cent of its peak of January 1993. But while the decline has been continuous, the market is still there.' It is unlikely that the market, if and when it recovers, will experience the levels and rates of growth of 1992. Investors will be more cautious - inevitably, more sceptical of bullish tendencies, and react more quickly to signs of a bear market. 'The market will improve later this year as stability is achieved and interest rates come down and investors look for outlets,' says Mr Paul Chen-Young, head of the Eagle Financial Network, a financial services conglomerate which includes stock broking. 'It will take time, however, before they get into long term investments, especially as there is no bond market because of high inflation and high interest rates.' These have to be supported by other changes in the economy, says Mr Iton. Any recovery in the market will depend on the success of the government's policies in containing inflation and stabilising the exchange rate. 'Stability in inflation and the exchange rate will support the fact that companies are still making profits,' he says.</p>

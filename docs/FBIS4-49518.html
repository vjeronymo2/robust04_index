			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, May 8 (XINHUA) -- King of Cambodia  Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monineath Sihanouk today hosted a  banquet in honor of He Zhiqiang, governor of China's Yunnan  Province.    The visiting governor said that he and his delegation are  bringing the friendship of the 38 million people of Yunnan  Province to the king and the queen as well as the Cambodian  people.    Sihanouk said that there has been a very close and deep  friendship between the two nations in the past decades, "from  the late Chairman Mao, the late Premier Zhou Enlai, to his  excellency Deng Xiaoping, President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li  Peng."    He added that he is proud that even Chinese children "know  me  and Cambodia."    A six-member delegation from the Yunnan Provincial  Government  led by He Zhiqiang arrived here on Friday [6 May] for a five-day  goodwill visit to the country. This has been the second  provincial delegation, following Guangdong Province, to visit  Cambodia since the royal government was founded last October.    He Zhiqiang and the delegation called on Co-Prime Ministers  Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen on the day of their arrival and  visited the port city of Sihanouk on Saturday.    On the rebuilding of Cambodia, Sihanouk said that the  Cambodian economy in the 1950s and 1960s was better than that at  present. After the 20-year-long war, Cambodia is poor and needs  economic and technical assistance from foreign countries, he  said.    "I am so happy that Cambodia and Yunnan Province will  develop  economic cooperation, particularly cooperation in agricultural  technology," the king said.    He called on all parties in Cambodia to do their best to  maintain peace and stability in Cambodia, without which foreign  investors will hesitate to invest in the country.    He Zhiqiang, who is accompanied by 15 businessmen, agreed  with what the king said and appreciated his efforts to rebuild  Cambodia. He said his province will do its best to help Cambodia  in its reconstruction.    Cambodia is the first leg of the delegation's  three-nation-tour in Southeast Asia. The Chinese guests are  scheduled to leave here on Wednesday for Thailand and Burma.</p>

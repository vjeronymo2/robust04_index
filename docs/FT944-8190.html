			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (8): Perturbation in the boardrooms - Corporate governance Germany's two-tier board system has been a much admired feature of its industrial and financial strength in the post-war decades, but recent events have led to some red faces among bankers and businessmen. For the more complex and international businesses become, the harder it is for non-executive supervisory board members - meeting only four times a year  -to have a firm grasp of what is really going on. The case of Metallgesellschaft has reopened the debate about the effectiveness of these boards. The main questions asked are whether they serve any real purpose and what sort of reforms, if any, should be introduced. As usual in such cases, it is the banks which feel the impact most severely. It is they who provide many of the non-executive board members, and especially chairmen. Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, a managing board member of Deutsche Bank, took over the supervisory board chairmanship of Metallgesellschaft in March of last year. It was at the end of 1993 that the industrial and trading company revealed spectacular losses on US oil futures trading. Mr Schmitz's response was to sack key members of the company's board, headed by Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, and try and unwind the financial costs of the complex oil contracts. The argument about whether this was done in the right way - or whether it made paper losses into real ones - is continuing, with executives of the bank and the company ranged against academics and former Metallgesellschaft employees. But the wider and more significant debate, over the real purpose and relevance of German supervisory boards, is only just beginning. Nor is it a new one. Previous industrial upsets have also led people to question not only whether the system of two-tier boards was appropriate in the first place but also whether the right people were being appointed to them. Today, however, the debate in Germany also has to be seen in the context of a wider international discussion over corporate governance - the relationship between management, shareholders and others closely involved in a corporation, such as employees. The main criticisms of the German supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) system concern the frequency of meetings, the number of mandates individuals should hold and the extent to which their work is supported by committees on such functions as auditing and personnel. None of this would guarantee that debacles like that of Metallgesellschaft - where Mr Schmitz says Mr Schimmelbusch did not keep him properly informed - could never happen. But such improvements would provide an extra level of protection. The main job of the supervisory board is to choose the management board (Vorstand). It also advises on major investment and other decisions. Since 1976, under the Mitbestimmung (co-determination) law, large companies must have an equal number of shareholder members on their supervisory boards. However, the chairman has a casting vote and one labour member has to come from the white-collar staff and is thus likely to side more with management. The workload for supervisory board members can be immense, especially for the chairmen. Because of their links with corporations and their status in the financial community, bankers are often chosen as heads or members of these boards. Top managers of Deutsche Bank (from board members downwards) sit on around 400 supervisory boards; Mr Hilmar Kopper, the bank's chairman, heads the supervisory board of Daimler-Benz, the country's biggest industrial group, and sits on those of Volkswagen, Lufthansa and Bayer, among others. One of his Deutsche Bank colleagues, Mr Rolf Breuer, believes it is up to the banks to make the main proposals for a reform of Germany's non-executive board system. One suggestion, also put forward by some politicians, is for a reduction in the number of such board positions one person can hold; currently, it is 10. 'It would certainly be desirable if people had more time for a difficult mandate,' he told Finanzen magazine. He also said supervisory boards would benefit from having more experienced businessmen at or near retiring age. 'They would be 65 or younger and have a great deal of experience or contacts.' More committees would help, too. But he thought the Aufsichtsrat system as a whole was healthy. In a comprehensive description of changes needed to the system, Mr Florian Schilling, partner in a Frankfurt-based management consultancy firm (Amrop Mulder &amp; Partner), agreed with some of these points. He said a study by the firm had shown that many supervisory board members themselves agreed with criticisms now being aired. Of course, if shareholders took greater account of their own interests in the first place, many of the problems would never occur. This would need a basic change in shareholder consciousness, he said in an article in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the daily newspaper. But since this was not likely in the short term, improvements in the workings of supervisory boards were necessary. The lack of a strong equity culture in Germany is often bemoaned by those wanting to speed up development of the country's financial markets. Carl Furstenberg, a legendary German banker who died in 1931, once said shareholders were stupid and cheeky - stupid for buying shares and cheeky for expecting dividends. However, Mr Schilling noted there were few German shareholders and they were seldom 'cheeky' enough to call management and non-executives severely to account. Among the main proposals arising from the Amrop Mulder study were: a more open method of choosing supervisory board members; more use of specialised committees; smaller boards of no more than 12 people instead of the 20 or so at some companies; fewer bankers, a point with which many bankers themselves agreed (Mr Schilling reckoned this reflected the harsh criticism many have come under because of their supervisory board roles); the voluntary acceptance of fewer mandates; and more frequent meetings. Few critics of the system actually want to do away with it altogether; it has played too valuable a role in promoting industrial harmony and solidity. Nor is the current discussion anything new. Reforms were also mooted after crises such as those at AEG, the electrical company now owned by Daimler-Benz, IBH, the now defunct construction equipment maker, and the Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz engineering concern. Changes do not happen fast in Germany, so any revamping of the supervisory board system will take time. But if nothing is done, the next crisis will raise further doubts about its viability.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Labour loses heavily in polls THE LABOUR party suffered heavy losses in yesterday's local elections in England, deepening the party's post-general election gloom. The Conservative share of the vote, projected across Great Britain, was estimated by the BBC at about 45 per cent  - the Tories' strongest local election showing since Mrs Thatcher first took power in 1979. Basildon again exemplified Labour's trauma in southern England. The Essex town unexpectedly returned a Tory MP last month: yesterday all the 15 seats up for grabs on its council fell to the Tories, who took control. The ghost of Militant also refused to die: the Liberal Democrats gained 10 seats in Liverpool, seven from Militant and three from Labour, while in Glasgow Labour's five losses were all to hard-left rebels. Labour's performance was little better in the Midlands: it lost control of Walsall and Wolverhampton and fell back sharply in Birmingham and Coventry. Its only comfort was the Tories' failure to regain Derby. The number of councils lost by Labour was limited, however, because only one-third of seats, in a minority of councils, were being contested. There were no elections in London, Leicester, Nottingham and Plymouth. Scotland continued to buck the English trend, showing only a modest Tory advance. Labour added Aberdeen to its council strongholds north of the border while the Tories failed to win Edinburgh  - though Labour lost its overall majority in the city. Labour lost control of 16 councils in total, including Bury (Greater Manchester), Cambridge, Dudley, Milton Keynes, Rochdale, Walsall, Welwyn Hatfield, and Wyre Forest. The party also suffered notable losses in Brighton, Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne and Peterborough. Mr Chris Patten, Tory party chairman, hailed the results as 'terrific - a strong confirmation of last month's general election result'. For Labour, Mr John Cunningham conceded 'disappointment'. 'The general election defeat means that we are losing hundreds of seats in safe Labour areas.' For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Simon Hughes predicted the party would end the night with its largest number of councillors ever  - although its share of the vote was barely up on 1988, the last time the seats fought for yesterday were contested. With 3,652 of the 3,910 results declared, Labour had suffered a net loss of 362 seats, with the Conservatives gaining 303 seats and the Liberal Democrats 65. Most Tory gains were at the expense of Labour, with the Liberal Democrats gaining from both sides. The turnout was low across Britain  - as little as 20 per cent in some inner-city wards. Despite making a net gain of 31 seats, the Scottish National Party failed to add much momentum to its campaign for Scottish independence. Only four councils in Wales voted yesterday, with none changing control. Results, reaction and analysis, Page 11</p>

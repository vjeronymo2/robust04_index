			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on news conference by FYROM Interior </F> Minister Ljubomir Frckovski on 15 June: "The Interior Ministry  Does Not Break Up Parties"]    [Text] At yesterday's news conference the interior  minister briefly reviewed the preelection political situation  and fervor, and said that, depending on their profile and  internal structures, the parties are using different methods to  try to provide excuses for various political situations, but, as  he said, the Interior Ministry does not intend to provide such  excuses. Some of the attacks that have appeared on the public  political scene have accused the Interior Ministry of  infiltrating and breaking up various parties with the intention  of dispatching them from the political scene. This is a known  methodology used by a number of political parties in the past  for plotting, and it is usually studied as part of the lesson on  promoting global revolution. The general characteristic of  revolutionary parties is the syndrome of conspiring and  searching for conspirators engaged in breaking up a group and  creating a new one. Frckovski emphasized that no police force  has ever managed to break up a political movement or political  party.    It is neat when party problems can be covered up by such  external factors because then we have a victim and an excuse for  personal political defeats. However, we must be concerned with  the low level on which the political struggle is being waged,  making political pornography [as published] the main topic of  political discussions. Playing around with confidential  documents, trying to create party policies without having  accusations investigated through a parliamentary or court  procedure, or both, represent political manipulation, because  they make serious hearings and serious democratic procedures  impossible. There is no way to incorporate all of these into a  procedure or to establish who is responsible. The aim is to  satanize the authorities and to score cheap political points,  Frckovski underlined. We can do nothing other than to offer to  open our files and check the results, but that cannot be done in  the media. However, I fear that the whole affair will remain  within the sphere of political gossip. It causes great trouble  when somebody's personal failure is associated with the  political interest of a party. There were such manipulations  when the Interior Ministry was accused of mass murder, with  claims that it organized a traffic accident with five casualties  in order to cover up the activities of one of its employees  against some politicians. Such manipulations indicate not only  mentally and morally disintegrated personalities, but also a  situation in which there are no bounds in the political  struggle. This is very dangerous for the political climate.    The State Security Service and the Interior Ministry cannot  be blamed for a meeting, which might even have been accidental,  between a certain lady, an ordinary secretary of the VMRO-SMD  [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of  Macedonian Organizations, a Bulgarian-based party], and some  politicians of a certain political party on 26 and 27 March of  this year, who were then given 50,000 German marks in financial  assistance. The Interior Ministry cannot be blamed for the  meeting in the Rila Hotel [in Sofia] when some well-known  politicians of this country met a group from the VMRO-SMD, and  were also joined by the Sofia district attorney and chief of the  city's Interior Ministry. On that occasion they agreed on a  plan for the election campaign, including the placement of a  radio station on a historically famous mountain close to our  border, all designed to help the party in the elections. Three  groups were formed: one for ideological preparations and  publishing activities, another for distributing publicity  material, and a third for military preparations. The Interior  Ministry can present evidence on these matters, but nobody can  be blamed for the failure of the party except its own political  program.    The claims that there was organized crime made us bring a  number of criminal charges that we would not normally have done,  in order to vindicate some statements made by former Interior  Ministry officials, but that again is their personal problem.  [sentence as published] The claim that we were allegedly not  bringing charges so as to protect someone was an evident mistake  made by the Interior Ministry to cover up political statements  by operational work. [sentence as published] The legal case is  closed that dealt with former minister Antoni Pesev, who issued  a permit for the construction of a gas station without the  permission of the Interior Ministry. I do not wish to make a  personal inquiry into this mistake, but there was actually such  a permit from the Interior Ministry. After that, the government  made a decision, which simply made things ridiculous. The  mistake was used politically to cover up the amateurish public  statements of that time. There still remains the possibility of  slander charges but I do not know what my reactions would be  then. What we in the ministry owe is at least an apology for  having been used, at least a number of us, to cover up political  statements made by some senior officials.    Concerning the events on the Macedonia-Serbian border  Frckovski said it was in the domain of the Defense Ministry  because it was about the border itself, not a border crossing or  zone. He listed the incidents: One illegal crossing of 17  soldiers and two officers occurred on 24 May 150 meters inside  our territory, threatening a UNPROFOR unit; the airspace was  violated by a Yugoslav warplane on 27 May; two soldiers  penetrated 200 meters into Macedonian territory on 30 May; two  soldiers went 200 meters inside our territory on 1 June; on 8  June they set up a tent on our territory; they have dug trenches  mostly on their own territory, except possibly for one. The  situation is similar today. We have our forces positioned a  close distance from there, but all of this is "frozen" until a  settlement.</p>

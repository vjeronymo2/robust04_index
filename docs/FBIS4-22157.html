			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Statistics"] </F>   [Text] More than 80 percent of the products from defense  industries today are for civilian purposes: agricultural  equipment, equipment for light, food, and chemical industry,  machine tools and motor vehicle trailers, household radio  equipment and televisions, gas and electric ranges, vacuum  cleaners, bicycles, furniture, small summer houses, street cars,  medical equipment, diesel generators, motor vehicles...    In 1993, the military-industrial complex produced the  following:    --520,000 kW of steam turbines;    --20.044 billion rubles [R] worth of oilfield and drilling  equipment and spare parts for it;    --nearly R10 billion worth of equipment for manufacturing  knitted fabric;    --7,748 woodworking machines;    --3,587,500 televisions;    --212,000 knitting machines;    --3,261,200 refrigerators and freezers;    --188,700 motor blocks;    --R31.928 billion worth of automobile spare parts;    --R1.0163 billion worth of medicines;    --R33.933 billion worth of sporting equipment;    --3,844,000 pairs of shoes.    At the same time, in those areas where it is necessary to  maintain expensive fixed assets, a sharp decrease in production  volumes is observed: 42 percent in the arms industry; 40.2  percent in the shipbuilding industry; and 29.9 percent in the  electronics industry.    A particularly difficult situation has taken shape in the  electronics industry, where the volume of production has  decreased to the 1991 level to 67 percent, including to 35  percent for military products and to 81.6 percent for consumer  goods. Computer equipment production last year was 32 percent  less than in 1992.    The 1993 budget level did not make it possible to compensate  for the increase in cost of maintaining fixed assets of  equipment, which are the basis of high technologies, and led to  a decrease in the share of funds allocated for wages. As a  result, the average monthly wage in the defense complex in 1993  was R28,600 with the statistical average for Russia at R58,400.    The draft 1994 budget allocated approximately 46 percent of  the 1993 level of funds for national defense needs. In the next  3-4 months, this may deprive about 20 million people of means of  existence.</p>

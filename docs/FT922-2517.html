			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Vote fears keep D-Mark strong THE D-MARK held on to most of its recent gains against other European currencies on the foreign exchange markets yesterday, supported by fears over European Union, writes James Blitz. With two days to go to Ireland's referendum on European political and economic union, the markets remain slightly jittery about the possibility that European union is on the rocks. Although the opinion polls show that the Irish people will vote 'Yes' to the Maastricht Treaty on Thursday, the markets are still putting their faith in the D-Mark, which they perceive to be the strongest currency in the European Monetary System (EMS). The German currency made new headway against sterling, partly helped by an upward revision of Britain's first-quarter current account deficit to Pounds 2.64bn from an estimated Pounds 2.17bn. The pound closed  1/4 pfennig down at DM2.9175. Sterling will be tested further in a big week of UK indicators: May's retail sales figures are due out tomorrow and May's unemployment number is scheduled for Thursday. The French franc and Spanish peseta improved only slightly against the D-Mark to FFr3.367 and Pta62.85 from previous closes of FFr3.370 and Pta62.88 respectively. The Italian lira would have lost ground to the D-Mark had it not been for yet more intervention by the Bank of Italy. The Bank sold 4m ecu at the midday currency fixing as the lira was set at a fresh 1992 low against the D-Mark of L757.19. At least one London bank reported that the Bank of Italy had intervened in the market to prop up its currency at around L757. The lira finished at L756.7 to the D-Mark from a previous close of L757.2. Conversely, the German currency lost much ground to the one other currency in Europe that is seen as a safe haven in times of European trouble: the Swiss franc. The D-Mark ended at a four-month low against the 'Swissie', although traders were divided over exactly why. The Swiss currency may have been boosted by a small rise in short-term interest rates in the Swiss franc market or by a general feeling that it was undervalued. It ended the day up at SFr0.90 to the D-Mark from a previous close of SFr0.9040. The dollar was mostly sidelined, with no important indicators out of the US. It moved mainly in a narrow range between DM1.5700 and DM1.5664, and at its weak point touched a four-month low against the D-Mark in European trading. It ended more than  1/2 pfennig down from Friday's close, at DM1.5715. In New York yesterday the dollar finished at DM1.5708. The US currency will be tested by today's figures for May US housing starts, which weakened sharply last month.</p>

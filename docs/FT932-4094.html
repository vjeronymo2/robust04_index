			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Skandia's new course SKANDIA chief executive Mr Bjorn Wolrath (above) yesterday said the group would pursue its ambition of integrating insurance activities in its 'Nordic home market' after three years of turmoil in the Scandinavian insurance sector. An ownership struggle culminated on Tuesday when Skandia's controlling shareholders - Norway's Uni Storebrand and Denmark's Hafnia - sold stakes in a SKr3.2bn (Dollars 444m) deal. 'We can now concentrate all our resources on the development of business activities in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, while implementing a restructuring of our international operations,' Mr Wolrath said. The group has signalled a retreat from non-life reinsurance and has a strategy of gaining 20-25 per cent of the Scandinavian insurance market, against 13-14 per cent.

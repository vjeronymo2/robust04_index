			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan's manufacturing  production is expected to post 5.41 percent growth for the  second quarter of 1994, according to the Taiwan Institute of  Economic Research.    The institute attributed the growth to rising foreign and  overseas investment in Taiwan, strong export competitiveness,  the economic recovery in the United States, and a depreciating  NT [New Taiwan] dollar.    Rising investment can be seen from the 29 percent growth in  foreign and overseas investments made in Taiwan during the first  four months of this year. This is the first positive growth  after two consecutive years of negative growth, and is an  indication that foreign investors are gaining confidence in  Taiwan's investment climate.    Brought up by rising interest rates and a recovering economy  in the United States, the depreciating NT dollar is favorable  for Taiwan's exports. Strong export trade also constitutes a  factor in pushing up manufacturing production, the institute  said.</p>

FYROM Foreign Affairs Minister Krste Crvenkovski, will meet  with Mr. Vance in the afternoon.    The goal of the UN mediator is to renew the dialogue between  Greece and FYROM which was cut off after Athens' decision to  force a commercial blockade on FYROM. Just before the meeting  with the Greek foreign affairs minister, Mr. Vance said he hoped  to reach an agreement.    Greece decided on the blockade in order to defend itself  from  "the aggressive attitudes" of FYROM, Mr. Papoulias reminded the  European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday. The European  Commission repeated that the Greek measures are in contradiction  with the right of the European Union [EU], which is currently  being presided by Greece.    On 16 February, Athens refused the transit of goods to FYROM  from its harbor of Saloniki and closed its consulate in Skopje,  capital of FYROM. In order to lift the blockade, Greece wants  FYROM to renounce its name. It estimates that the name  "Macedonia" implies territorial claims on a northern province in  Greece which has been called Macedonia for centuries.    The United States declared to the government of Athens that  they wish to see the economic embargo against FYROM lifted  because it "does not contribute to stability" in the Balkans.  Washington favors a renewal of the dialogue between Athens and  Skopje under the protection of the United Nations. But  Washington will not put forward "an American solution."</p>

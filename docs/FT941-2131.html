			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (12): Experience dampens both sides' high hopes - Eastern Europe's Needs Western management educators joined in a general excitement in the West at the start of the decade: eastern Europe was a market which seemed to offer unbounded potential. Here was half a continent whose companies were crying out for executives familiar with modern management techniques. Just as structured management education spread from the US to western Europe in the 1960s, so the movement appeared poised to take the former communist bloc by storm in the 1990s. But management schools have shared in the disappointment of the discovery that need does not automatically translate into demand for services. 'An enormous market - an enormous, insolvent market,' says Robert Crane, dean of the International Management Center in Budapest, one of the leading schools in the region. 'As far as I can tell, no one has made money from management training in eastern Europe.' East European trainees can rarely pay fees out of theirown pockets. Salaries remain a fraction of western levels while management training is little cheaper. Fees at the International Management Center in Budapest, for instance, are Dollars 10,000 a year while a US school would charge between Dollars 12,000 and Dollars 20,000. Some students make the sacrifice. Vilmos Skultety of Szekesfehervar in western Hungary sold his Lada car to raise the funds to study at the IMC. He is now Hungarian marketing manager for Loranger, the US car components maker, and possesses a smarter car but he is the exception. Local corporations are as strapped for cash as individuals. Management courses were the fashion when the east European economies first opened up. But prolonged recession has forced many state enterprises to cut their training budgets and rising unemployment has made employees more cautious about taking a couple of years out. That has left official and private philanthropy as the main source of financing. Most important is the European Union's Phare aid programme for eastern Europe. George Soros, the hedge-fund speculator, provides scholarships through his foundations for almost all the students on IMC's full-time MBA course. Official assistance has not been sufficient, however, to induce reputable western management schools to establish a permanent presence in eastern Europe. The University of Pittsburgh has close links with the International Management Centre in Budapest and the Czech Management Centre. Five top-ranking US schools have formed a consortium which provides courses for east Europeans. But involvement is generally at the level of individual faculty members. After initial exploration, most institutions have retrenched. Disillusionment has been mutual. 'We had a trooping to the east of a lot of dubious people in management education who were, by and large, charlatans,' says Derek Abell, professor at the Institute for Management Development in Lausanne. That has done little for the standing of management training in eastern Europe. 'What the West was offering was suspect,' says Mr Abell. 'There is a real sense of disappointment.' East Europeans are nevertheless gradually becoming more discriminating and a few institutions have managed to build reputations for quality and find their financial footing. The International Executive Development Centre in Slovenia, dynamically led by Danica Purg, is particularly well-regarded. Most observers' lists include Budapest's IMC, the Czech Management Centre in Prague and the International Postgraduate Management Center of Warsaw University. The better schools, seeking to reduce their dependence on grants, are trying to drum up business from western companies with operations in eastern Europe. IMC conducts an in-house MBA programme for Tungsram, General Electric's lightbulb-making subsidiary in Hungary. IMC hopes, through projects like these, to match western schools and cover 70 per cent to 75 per cent of operational costs within five years. For east Europeans without backing from a western employer, distance learning is increasingly popular and has provided opportunities for some western providers. The Open Business School, a branch of the Open University, has students in Slovakia, Hungary and Russia and is expanding into Bulgaria and Romania. There is untapped potential in management education beyond standard MBA courses. 'The initial traditional activities have not been the growth areas,' says Julie Rowney, formerly of the IMC. Gay Haskins, head of the European Foundation for Management Development, believes there is a pressing need for first degrees in management and entrepreneurship training, not to speak of education for the educators. Others argue that institutions should target senior executives. Slovenia's IEDC has set up a President's MBA course for chief executives who lack formal management education and the time for a full-time course. But above all the impact of schools in eastern Europe depends on localising management education and making courses relevant. On a mundane level, that involves giving more weight to finance, accounting and marketing. More fundamentally it requires western trainers to adapt to eastern European business conditions, and more give-and-take between western theory and eastern practice. 'People have been teaching rather than learning,' says Mr Abell of the IMD. 'Once they learn, they will be able to teach more successfully.'</p>

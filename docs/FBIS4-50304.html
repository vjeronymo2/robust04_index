			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Trade and  environment should be of mutual support to each other instead of  obstacles to each other's development, a Chinese official told  the second session of the Commission on Sustainable Development  today.    Delivering a statement at the session, Zhang Kunmin, head of  the Chinese delegation, said that in order to protect the  ecological environment and consumers' health and safety, it is  necessary to formulate appropriate environmental regulations and  standards in international trade.    But he said environmental protection should not be an excuse  for new protectionism and non-tariff trade barriers.    Otherwise, he warned, they would only further limit the  export of developing countries, which would lead to the  aggravation of poverty and the weakening of their power in  environmental protection.    Zhang pointed out that when establishing environmental  regulations and standards, the international community should  also take into consideration the situation and requirements of  developing countries.    The developed countries should help the developing countries  to "improve their capability in the compliance of environmental  regulations and standards through such forms as technology  transfer," Zhang said. In short, he added, the principle of  "prompting the economic growth of trade partners and the  development of developing countries," which was brought forth in  the declaration of Uruguay Round, should be substantively  adhered to.    In recent years, the question of relations between trade and  environment has become one of the hot issues, which have  attracted much attention from the international community.</p>

But Yutaka Kume, chairman of the association, said  the industry has no plan to introduce "objective criteria,"  which the U.S. has been demanding.    Kume said some auto companies in Japan can provide figures  each year for auto parts purchases, but they should not announce  how much they will buy in the future as it will be regarded by  the U.S. as a "promise."    Kume made the remarks at a press conference in Tokyo  concerning the failure in the bilateral economic "framework"  trade talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S.  President Bill Clinton. Autos and auto parts are one of three  priority areas of the talks.    As for marketing of imported cars in Japan, Kume said the  Japanese industry should launch a public relations project  concerning Japan's auto sales "to make the U.S. understand that  Japanese automakers don't control dealers."</p>

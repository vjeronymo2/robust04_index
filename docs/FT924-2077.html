			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Technology: Research faces uncertain future - Technically Speaking Tensions behind the scenes over the UK government's forthcoming Science and Technology White Paper erupted in public as the deadline for submissions passed last week. Dai Rees, Medical Research Council secretary, made an astonishing attack on the 'amazing and appalling' proposals put forward by the government-appointed Advisory Council on Science and Technology. Acost advocates abolishing the five research councils that distribute about Pounds 1bn a year in grants and contracts. Instead, it wants the government to set up one agency to support 'curiosity driven research' and another to fund 'mission oriented research'. Acost - whose members include industrialists and academic researchers - also proposes to privatise the research councils' units and institutes. Rees told a press conference the Acost proposals were 'naive and wrongly founded, and far from the best interests of the nation. 'We regard the integration of basic and clinical work as absolutely vital to our mission,' he said. Rees warned that privatised research units 'will need to employ armies of administrators, PR people and marketing experts to ensure that they can survive.' Acost's scheme would mean providers of basic research would compete for funds in a free market. Such an approach might appeal to the present government, but it would be extremely damaging to the long term continuity of Britain's world-class scientific teams. Some distinguished members of Acost, including Sir Michael Atiyah, president of the Royal Society, have quietly dissociated themselves from its proposals. But Rees rightly felt he had to speak out because 'Acost was constituted to give scientific advice to the prime minister, so anything it says may be taken seriously.' The Acost submission is one of 520 documents received during the government's White Paper consultation period. 'All the views expressed will be taken on board and fed into our thinking,' said William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for science. However, he and Bill Stewart, chief scientific adviser in the Cabinet Office, will find it extremely hard to draw together common threads from so many contradictory and inevitably self-interested views. They would waste an opportunity if they did not consider making radical changes, since this is the government's first fundamental review of science and technology since the 1971 Rothschild report. But the area crying out for far-reaching reform is not basic research - the research councils are doing a reasonable job, though there is scope for some reorganisation. What needs to change is the way the government funds and conducts industrial and applied R&amp;D. The Office of Science and Technology, which John Major set up after the General Election as part of the Cabinet Office, is directly responsible only for basic research. It should be given new powers to co-ordinate R&amp;D across the whole government, in collaboration with industry. The Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry, in particular, carry out important R&amp;D programmes that seem often to lose out in the internal competition for departmental funds. The MoD spends hundreds of millions of pounds a year supporting technologies such as advanced materials, electronics and computing, which must be protected from the run-down in military spending and redirected towards civil industry. The challenge Waldegrave faces is convincing his cabinet colleagues to surrender some control over their departmental R&amp;D, to give Britain its first co-ordinated national policy for science and technology.</p>

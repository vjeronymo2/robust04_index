			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Tories return to the centre One-nation Toryism is reclaiming its inheritance. The battle for the soul of the Conservative party has been joined in earnest. Amid the chaos of Mr John Major's government, the disciples of the social rather than the liberal market have decided it is time at last to disclaim publicly the ideology of the 1980s. Thatcherism is to be consigned to the history books. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, put the case at the weekend in a lecture to the Tory Reform Group. The Thatcherite revolution had been appropriate when the trade unions had to be tamed, the state role cut, the power of market competition unleashed. But the government had moved too far in the direction of unfettered markets. There was such a thing as society. And Conservatism should recognise 'the moral and social inadequacies of laissez-faire'. The lecture itself - with its call for the party to look again to the Christian Democrat tradition in the rest of Europe - was no surprise. Mr Hunt has always been viewed by the Tory right as 'wet' as he is clever. A disciple of Peter Walker and Michael Heseltine, he has never disguised his preference for pragmatism over ideology. The lecture contained strong echoes also of the advocacy of a European-style social market which Mr Chris Patten offered in an interview in Marxism Today as long ago as January 1990. But Mr Hunt's decision to recall the traditions of a one-nation, pro-European Conservatism was only one piece in a jigsaw. After living in the shadow of the recalcitrant Euro-sceptic right of the party at Westminster, the social marketeers have decided to assert their authority. With the end in sight of the Maastricht bill there is a new sense of liberation. Six weeks ago Mr Stephen Dorrell, still outside the cabinet but talked of as a future leader, issued a sharp warning of the risks of 'dogmatic attachment to market economics'. If Toryism meant high living standards and individual choice, it also stood for social stability and evolutionary change. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, took up the same theme in a recent newspaper article. Tories had to remember that the pursuit of low inflation, privatisation and lower public spending were means rather than ends. But the pivotal change has been Mr Kenneth Clarke's move to the Treasury. A self-styled member of the 'hard-centre', he has dispensed with the monetarist rhetoric of policy-making during the 1980s. Sure Mr Clarke wants low inflation, tight control of public spending and the opportunity to cut taxes. But he has no desire to dismantle the welfare state. He wants to listen to industrialists as well as City economists. The language of pro-Europeanism and partnership has returned to the Treasury. None of this presages a return to 1970s-style corporatism. Lady Thatcher shifted the centre of gravity in politics. Many of those now proclaiming the virtues of the social market would a decade ago have been judged to have been on the right rather than the centre-left of the party. Nor are they without enemies in the cabinet. Mr Michael Howard, Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Peter Lilley and, most recently, Mr John Redwood, remain faithful to a more liberal, individualistic creed. The government's slim majority and Mr Major's weakened authority makes them a powerful force. On the day Mr Major won the party leadership he turned to a friend in the lobby of the Commons and proclaimed: 'We are in charge now. The party is in our hands.' He was wrong. The right has fought a dogged rearguard battle. But Mr Hunt and others are determined now to claim that victory.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Climb: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose to  the highest level in two weeks. The Treasury Department sold $6.6 billion in  three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.94%, up from 7.65% last  week. Another $6.6 billion in six-month bills was sold at an average discount  rate of 7.70%, up from 7.35% last week. The rates were the highest since July  24, when three-month bills sold for 8.09% and six-month bills averaged 7.73%.  The discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 8.21% for  three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,799.30 and 8.12% for a  six-month bill selling for $9,610.70. In a separate report, the Federal Reserve  said the average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for  making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 7.73% last week, from  7.86% the previous week.  </P></p>

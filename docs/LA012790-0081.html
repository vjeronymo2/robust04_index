			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMENIANS IN L.A. JOIN IN RELIEF EFFORT FOR REFUGEES  </P> <P> Stepping up relief efforts to their ancestral homeland, 10 major Armenian  groups in Los Angeles on Friday announced the formation of a joint council to  provide humanitarian aid for fellow Armenians victimized by strife in Soviet  Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> The Save Armenia Council said it initially hopes to raise $3 million to aid  Armenian refugees who have fled Azerbaijan to Soviet Armenia, and to also  provide support for Armenians in the blockaded region of Nagorno-Karabakh, a  predominantly Armenian region inside Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> Despite the efforts of Soviet troops to put down the violence, "things will  remain tense for quite a while to come," predicted Kevork Santikian of the  Armenian Revolutionary Federation, one of the 10 groups in the council.  "Attacks will continue against Armenians just because they are Armenian."  </P> <P> Armenians portray the violence in Azerbaijan as a relapse into the  centuries-old persecution of Armenians by Turkic-speaking peoples.  </P> <P> In a news conference at the Armenian General Benevolent Union in Hollywood, the  council dramatized its appeal by showing graphic videotaped interviews with  refugees, in the Soviet Armenia capital of Yerevan, who had fled pogroms -- or  mob attacks -- in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku. Among them were a middle-aged  woman who had been shot, an elderly woman who said her attack was "too  horrible" to describe, and a man who had lost a finger and had his face burned  when a homemade gasoline bomb exploded near him.  </P> <P> In addition to door-to-door fund-raising within the Armenian community in the  United States, the Save Armenia Council said, it will also lobby the U.S  government to provide humanitarian aid to Armenia and seek Soviet assurances  that relief supplies will reach the intended destinations.  </P> <P> One destination is Yerevan, already strained with refugees from the massive  December, 1988, earthquake that killed more than 25,000 people and left more  500,000 homeless. Another is Nagorno-Karabakh, where 160,000 Armenians have  been isolated by a blockade by Azerbaijanis. Conditions there were described as  critical, with food, drinkable water, gasoline, electricity and heating in  short supply.  </P> <P> The council is collecting donations at the Benevolent Union offices, 589  Larchmont Blvd. Leaders said the relief effort may be coordinated with a  continuing airlift by the United Armenian Fund. Using cargo planes chartered  and paid for by financier Kirk Kerkorian, controlling shareholder of MGM, the  United Armenian Fund delivered several tons of medical supplies, food and other  goods in recent weeks -- "a drop in the bucket" of what is needed, spokesman  Harut Sassounian said.  </P></p>

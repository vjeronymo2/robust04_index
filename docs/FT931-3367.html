			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (6): In and out the money maze MARKET MOVERS by Mark Jones and Ken Ferris McGraw Hill Pounds 35, 256 pages MARKETS &amp; DEALERS, THE ECONOMICS OF THE LONDON FINANCIAL MARKETS edited by David Cobham Longman Pounds 12.99, 183 pages IN THEIR different ways these two books will be of considerable help to those seeking initiation into the ways of the City of London and the financial markets that operate there. Markets &amp; Dealers is a guide to the City and designed to be read. Market Movers is a guide to international economic indicators that make prices move. It is more of a reference book. That both the main authors of Market Movers include stints with Reuters news agency on their curricula vitae comes as no surprise, given the lucid objectivity with which they present their information. One can imagine them beavering away at their screens to produce those flash announcements of economic news which have become one of the agency's hallmarks. It is also refreshing to discover that, far from being content to remain mere messengers, the authors have actually posed the question of what the figures mean. The result is this guide to economic statistics in the five main industrial countries (US, Japan, UK, Germany and France). The book not only gives details of the source, frequency of publication and make-up of statistics ranging from GDP to money supply and consumer price indices, but also some guide as to how they should be interpreted. This includes assessments on realiability and the impact of seasonality. Less clear is the relative importance of individual indicators. We are told, for example, that construction is excluded from the monthly UK industrial production figures and that production industries accounted for just over one-third of GDP as of June 1991. We are not sure what weight financial markets put on this information or how important it is in comparison with, for example, survey data from the Confederation of British Industry. Presumably German markets focus on the M3 money supply aggregate because that is the one the Bundesbank watches most closely. Why the Bank of England - and therefore UK financial markets - focus on M0, M4 and bank lending is left to the imagination. With a better evaluation of the impact of individual indicators, the pointers towards future trends would have more relevance. Still, it is useful to know that the French Finance Minister normally warns financial markets if forthcoming inflation figures are significantly outside expectations. The book says that the Minister 'should always be heeded'. It would be nice to believe the same of our own dear Chancellor. One should not be put off by the drear discussion of the economic role of market makers with which Markets &amp; Dealers opens. It is perhaps necessary for the authors of such a book to establish their academic credentials even if the real interest of most readers is likely to be in the book as a comprehensive overview of the City's working. Like many works assembled from a multitude of authors, Markets &amp; Dealers suffers from loose editing. With a little reordering of the material this book would have become more digestible and its basic strengths more apparent. There are few books which combine a description not only of the equity market after big bang but also of the other large, but lower profile markets which make up such a large share of the City of London: the eurobond, sterling bond, futures and options markets and, of course, the money market. Admittedly, the risk is always that such a guide will date. Though sterling commercial paper was only launched in 1986, the market has never taken off. The authors' interest in the subject really does seem rather academic. The chapter on such a fast moving subject as regulation already leaves something to be desired in terms of timeliness. Nonetheless, the book has a shelf life that will help see it through for a while.</p>

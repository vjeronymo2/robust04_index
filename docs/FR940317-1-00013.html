This proposal would require inspections of the inboard and outboard strut chords, stiffeners, and web to detect cracks and loose fasteners; repair of the chords, stiffeners, or web, if necessary; and replacement of any loose fastener. This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue cracks and loose fasteners found in the forward lower spar web of the inboard strut on Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D&hyph;3 and JT9D&hyph;7 series engines. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent separation of the strut from the wing of the airplane due to fatigue cracking. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by May 10, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;05&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

The cracks were found in the area under the stiffeners and baffle and along the web chord. The airplanes on which these cracks were found had accumulated between 6,451 and 18,350 flight cycles and between 17,797 and 83,960 flight hours. All cracks reported have been found on the web of the inboard strut.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During investigation of a recent in-flight engine loss, a similar crack of approximately two inches in length was found on the forward lower spar web. Although the in-inflight engine loss incident is still under investigation, the crack in the web was determined to be a contributing cause of the accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cracking in the forward lower spar web of the inboard strut could reduce the lateral strength of the strut. This condition, if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, could result in separation of the strut from the wing of the airplane due to fatigue cracking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although all cracks reported were found on the web of the inboard strut, given standard design tolerances, little difference exists between the thickness of the web of the inboard strut (0.025 inch) and that of the outboard strut (0.032 inch). Additionally, the inboard and outboard webs are similar in configuration and loading environments. For these reasons, the FAA finds that the outboard strut web is subject to the same unsafe condition as the inboard strut web.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

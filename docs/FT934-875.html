			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: In need of an effective remedy - The problems facing Fisons Fisons' latest boardroom drama has moved Mr Patrick Egan into the full glare of the spotlight. Following the sacking last week of Mr Cedric Scroggs, the group's chief executive, and the resignation of Mr Roy Thomas, finance director, Mr Egan, the chairman, now dominates the Fisons stage. Mr Egan is looking for an external candidate to fill Mr Scroggs' role. Given the difficulties the company had filling the post last time - two headhunting firms failed to find a suitable external candidate - Mr Egan may be running the company for some time. A courageous, straight-forward and at times blunt manager, he feels, according to insiders, at least partly responsible for the problems currently faced by the group, Mr Egan believes he can personally help Fisons overcome its crisis. Mr Egan knows the company's problems well. He was a non-executive for seven years before becoming chairman during which time Fisons made critical errors leading to its spectacular fall from grace. These mistakes included lack of investment in pharmaceuticals manufacturing, which led to the withdrawal of key products from the US on the insistance of the Food and Drug Administration. Another error was the dubious trading practice of the discounting of drugs towards the year-end to boost sales and profits. By 1991, when the practice was at its peak, it generated nearly a fifth of the division's sales. However, mistakes were also made after January 1992, since when he has, as executive chairman, in effect been running the company. During his tenure, Fisons has issued two profit warnings and suffered a collapse in market capitalisation from Pounds 2.23bn to only Pounds 794m. Mr Egan's 40-year career in Unilever's consumer products businesses was a far cry from the role he must now play as executive chairman at a pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group. The son of an Indian civil servant, conversant in Urdu and Punjabi, he joined Unilever in 1951 after national service. Without a university degree, he once said: 'My horizons haven't been narrowed by too much education.' In 1978 he became a director of Unilever, chairman of its UK operations in 1982, and regional director of Latin America, central Asia and South Africa in 1987. He joined the Fisons board in 1985. He took over as Fisons' executive chairman in January 1992, after the sudden departure of Mr John Kerridge. The architect of Fisons' phenomenal growth in the 1980s, Mr Kerridge left because of ill health. He had come under heavy pressure after US regulatory authorities had discovered manufacturing irregularities. At that time, Mr Egan stressed Fisons' underlying strengths, claiming scientific equipment was a good business. Yet the instruments business's profits plunged from about Pounds 40m in 1991 into a Pounds 16m loss this year. He also misread the prospects for the pharmaceuticals division. Mr Egan was unrealistically optimistic about the possibility of Opticrom, an eye treatment, being reinstated by the FDA in the US. He said 'the FDA could telephone tomorrow and we could have it up and running the day after'. The product, which had annual sales in the US of Dollars 40m (Pounds 27m) is still not on the market nearly two years later and is unlikely to be relaunched. Mr Egan also misread the state of the drugs division's pipeline of new products, essential for the company's future. Mr Egan stressed: 'We have critical mass in R&amp;D. We have compounds in the larder. There is a string of products that will sustain the business in the years ahead, not only in the respiratory area, but also for the central nervous system.' However, in April this year, development of Tipredane, Fisons' only late stage treatment for asthma, the group's most important therapeutic category, was halted. Its only other product in late stage development, an anti-epileptic product called Remacemide, is not expected to be launched until 1998. Analysts believe the chances of licensing in new compounds from other groups will be held up again while a new chief executive is chosen. The cupboard is, in effect, bare. If Mr Egan misjudged the state of Fisons' businesses, the strategic direction he chose over the past two years has also been questioned by analysts. He initiated a strategic review in January 1992 which concluded with the decision to sell the consumer health operations and horticulture business. With hindsight the group should have kept the consumer businesses, which provided steady revenue streams, and sold the more cyclical scientific equipment operations, say analysts. After an abortive outside search for a new chief executive, Fisons turned, in April 1992, to Mr Scroggs, head of the scientific equipment division. Although Mr Scroggs had taken over a division in 1981 with a Pounds 64m turnover and trading profits of Pounds 2.8m and turned it into a Pounds 645m business, making profits of Pounds 68.4m, there was criticism in the City for appointing him. It was felt he lacked the necessary pharmaceutical experience and was too closely identified with the Kerridge years. The reason for the timing of Mr Scroggs' sacking this month remains obscure. Mr Egan said his departure was precipitated by the rapid deterioration of the scientific equipment business and the need to accelerate the winding up of the unwise, though not illegal, forward selling policy. However, insiders insist Mr Egan had become aware of the forward selling policy in April 1992. Moreover, no secret had been made of the scientific equipment division's deterioration. The board had been given details of its performance every month. Indeed, Mr Scroggs publicly admitted the division's difficulties were 'a nasty episode' in September this year. The board's decision, with the agreement of Mr Egan, to sack Mr Scroggs leaves Fisons without a chief executive, without a finance director, and without an apparent strategy. It does leave the company vulnerable to a bid. The prognosis is gloomy. Mr Egan, a hunting, beagling and polo-playing enthusiast, must now prove his mettle if Fisons is to survive as an independent entity.</p>

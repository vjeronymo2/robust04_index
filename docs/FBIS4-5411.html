			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 10 KYODO -- A growing rift among the  governing coalition parties on Sunday left in the dark efforts  to find a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  and the future shape of the coalition.    After the 56-year-old Hosokawa abruptly offered to leave the  helm of government on Friday, top executives of the seven-party  coalition began moving to choose a candidate for the next  premier at their caucus.    However, two ruling party heads raised doubts about the  procedure of picking a successor to Hosokawa and demanded that  top leaders of the coalition parties decide on a new premier.    Because of the demand, the coalition representatives' forum  before noon Sunday suspended efforts to find a suitable figure  to replace Hosokawa and left the rest up to their party bosses.    Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Tomiichi Murayama  subsequently proposed holding a meeting of the heads of the  coalition forces at noon Monday to break the selection stalemate.    But the offer met with a flat refusal from two major forces  within the coalition, accentuating deep division among coalition  partners.    "There is a consensus that the caucus of the ruling parties  is to discuss issues of mutual concern," Shinseito (Japan  Renewal Party) secretary general Ichiro Ozawa told reporters,  explaining his party's rejection of SDP chief's offer.    "If this is disregarded, it will be perceived as  dictatorial," the main strategist of the coalition added.    Ozawa also asserted that should heads of the SDP, the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and new party Sakigake  (Harbinger) hold talks themselves on the choice of a candidate  to succeed Hosokawa, it would constitute a private talk.    Koji Morimoto, chairman of Komeito's Diet Affairs Committee,  also told a news conference Sunday night that his party will not  accept Murayama's proposal to hold a meeting of the coalition  party heads on Monday at noon.    Although the chairman of the SDP, the largest coalition  contingent, had asked Hosokawa by telephone to call such a  meeting under his authority, the departing head of government  replied he is not in a position to do so because he has already  offered to resign, Murayama said.    Behind the growing division within the coalition, an  alliance  of parties spanning a wide political spectrum, is the question  of which party or parties will take control of the next  government, political analysts said.    While Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is widely considered the  most likely candidate for the next premier, the SDP and Sakigake  have been especially cautious about the choice, fearing it would  allow Hata's Shinseito and its closest partner Komeito to take  initiative within the coalition.    The SDP, for its part, has said that its chairman, Murayama,  is also qualified for the premiership, though not clearly  stating the party will field him as a candidate to succeed  Hosokawa.    Meanwhile, a move to reorganize the current framework of the  coalition has been growing.    Although the Shinseito-Komeito bloc wants to see Hata, who  doubles as deputy prime minister, to be picked as Hosokawa's  successor, it is also considering fielding former Foreign  Minister Michio Watanabe of the primary opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) as a candidate for the premiership.    If Watanabe defects from the now-deposed party and agrees to  run for the highest government office with the backing of  Shinseito, Komeito and other coalition forces, the SDP, whose  basic policies are still way apart from those of its coalition  partners, is expected to get the boot.    On Sunday, Watanabe signaled his readiness to bolt from the  LDP and join hands with all or portions of the coalition if  there is a comfortable number of LDP members to leave the party  with him.    During Hosokawa's eight months in office, the SDP has often  put the coalition on the spot due to its policy differences with  other coalition members over such issues as political reform,  the partial opening of Japan's rice market and tax system reform.    The party, along with Sakigake, also hampered Hosokawa's bid  to revamp his cabinet in protest against his apparent intention  to sack Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.    Sakigake is scheduled to hammer out an outline to form a new  government on Monday and likely to begin seeking a tie-up with  pro- reformers within the LDP. Sakigake is a splinter party of  the LDP, which was toppled from power last August after 38 years  of uninterrupted rule.    LDP president Yohei Kono also called on Sunday for the  establishment of a new coalition government by uniting  conservatives and liberals with his party as the core.    Kono did not deny the possibility of the LDP tying up with  the SDP but brushed aside speculation that Watanabe will quit  his party to join other forces.</p>

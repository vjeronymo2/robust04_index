			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pearson to set up multimedia arm - Ex-Virgin Games chief expected to join group to create new division Pearson, the media and publishing group, is setting up a multimedia division to co-ordinate its activities in the new business area where print and visual images increasingly converge. The company, it is believed, has hired Mr Nick Alexander - who used to run Virgin Games - to create the new division. Mr Alexander, who at present runs Sega Europe, the European arm of the international interactive games group, has either already resigned from Sega or is about to do so, to join Pearson. Pearson declined to comment. The move is a symptom of the increasing interest in the visual media at Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, following the decision to concentrate on information, education and entertainment. The growing interest in multimedia would involve Pearson's existing operations in educational publishing but the new division, it is believed, would be a focus for acquisitions in the area. At the same time both of Pearson's two main television interests, the 17.5 per cent stake in British Sky Broadcasting and the 100 per cent ownership of Thames Television, both appear to be holding out prospects of substantial growth. In the 1993 results, which came in yesterday at Pounds 209m at the pre-tax level, returns from both are modest. Thames, which cost a total of Pounds 100.7m in June 1993, contributed Pounds 6.5m in operating profits and BSkyB put in Pounds 6.9m - the first time that income from the satellite television venture has come through. In both cases, however, that seems to be only the beginning of the story. Thames may soon be valued at considerably more than its Pounds 100m purchase price. Apart from continuing orders from the ITV network for its programmes, such as The Bill, Pearson's 10 per cent stake through Thames in the Astra television satellite system may be about to be revalued. The Deutsche Bundespost is negotiating for a stake in the satellite systems, and valuations are believed to be about Pounds 50m for a 10 per cent holding. A contribution in the region of Pounds 35m is expected from BSkyB in this current year. A total of 3.3m homes are subscribing to at least one BSkyB service, and there is a total of 7m channel subscriptions, showing that a large proportion of BSkyB viewers are paying for several of the channel packages on offer. Lord Blakenham, Pearson chairman, said: 'In June we took the decision to concentrate our resources on our media and entertainment businesses, and by December Camco and Royal Doulton had become independent public companies.' He continued: 'As a media company we have great opportunities for deploying our brands and copyrights in a variety of expanding and overlapping media markets.'</p>

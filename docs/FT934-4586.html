			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / US spending trend could slow growth US consumer spending is growing faster than personal incomes, suggesting the pace of economic growth could moderate in the first half of next year as people rebuild depleted savings, official figures indicated yesterday. The Commerce Department said consumer spending rose 0.4 per cent in real terms between September and October, twice the rate of growth of real, after-tax personal incomes. In the past year, real spending has grown by 3.2 per cent against a 1.8 per cent increase in disposable incomes. The personal savings rate fell to 3.7 per cent in October, against an average of 5.3 per cent last year. Figures for new home sales in October indicated the housing recovery, while strong, was a little less robust than previously estimated. New home sales fell 6.5 per cent between September and October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 679,000. The increase in sales in September was revised down to show a gain of 14.8 per cent rather than the initially reported 20.8 per cent. In the first 10 months of the year, new homes sales were up 6 per cent from the same period last year.</p>

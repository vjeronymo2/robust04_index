			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Rifkind's miracle Fifteen years after Margaret Thatcher came to power, and nearly four years after she left office, Thatcherism has at last penetrated the British armed forces. It had been applied at least partially to defence procurement in the 1980s; but not until this year did the Ministry of Defence, with some help from the Treasury and the private sector, manage to discover more than Pounds 750m of unnecessary annual expenditure on support services, all of which can be saved without in any way affecting the efficiency and fighting quality of frontline forces. That, at least, is what Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, asked the House of Commons to believe yesterday, when he unveiled his defence costs study, entitled 'Front Line First'. In fact, he almost made an announcement of cuts worth Pounds 750m a year, to which he was committed by the 1993 Budget statement, sound like an increase in defence spending. First, he listed all the procurement projects which have been on hold since last December, and which would have had to be cancelled had the savings in support services not been found. Then he went on to announce extra items, for which money had been miraculously found because the savings identified actually went beyond what the Budget statement required. Some of these 'enhancements' will simply reverse the effect of earlier cuts, for instance by taking a frigate and a submarine out of mothballs and putting a squadron of Harrier aircraft back in the front line. Others are genuinely new, such as a big increase in operational training for the army and airforce, some Pounds 60m-worth of command, control and communications equipment for a new joint rapid deployment force modelled on the French Force d'Action Rapide, and a probable purchase of submarine-launched cruise missiles from the US. The savings, Mr Rifkind stressed, could be found because he and his staff were given eight months to look for them, and because they enlisted the help of people within the armed forces, down to middle-rank officers and below, as well as senior Treasury civil servants and private sector executives. A broad theme of the exercise is decentralisation, with budgetary responsibility devolved downwards to junior officers. All this sounds thoroughly laudable, but if such large sums were really being wasted, one can only wonder why on earth it was not done much sooner. Inevitably the suspicion arises, and has been voiced by both retired and serving officers, that risks are being taken which were hitherto considered unacceptable. To take one example, will not a concentration of all headquarters facilities in one place render the whole British defence effort vulnerable to a single act of terrorism? The real weakness of the study, however, is its lack of reference to any strategic assumptions about the mission of Britain's armed forces. Mr Rifkind holds that no such reference is necessary, since frontline strengths are unchanged and are designed to fulfil commitments already outlined in last year's white paper, 'Defending Our Future'. But that white paper only outlined them in very general terms, and fell well short of being the re-examination of Britain's military requirements, starting from first principles, which the fundamental geopolitical changes of the last five years would surely justify. Britain has yet to carry out an exercise comparable to last year's 'Bottom Up Review' in the US, or this year's Livre Blanc in France. It still needs one.</p>

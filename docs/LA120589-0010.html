			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Eastern Machinists Cite New Dialogue: The leader of the Eastern Airlines  machinists, whose walkout is in its 10th month, said there is new dialogue with  management but that his membership remains committed to the strike. "There's no  way you can just blink away the trauma that people have been through," Charles  E. Bryan, president of the machinists District 100, said in Hollywood, Fla.  Bryan said he had a three-hour meeting last Thursday in Washington with Eastern  officials and federal mediator Harry Bickford. All agreed "that nobody will put  any spins on it," Bryan said. "We met, and we'll have more meetings."  </P></p>

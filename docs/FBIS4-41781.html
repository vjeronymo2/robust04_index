			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 28 June TASS -- The 14th Russian  Army could be a guarantor against an outside aggression against  either the Dniester Republic or Moldavia as a whole, Dniester  parliament chief Grigoriy Marakutsa told ITAR-TASS.    Marakutsa favours the conclusion of an appropriate agreement  with Russia that would specify the status of her troops in the  region. "This may be a military base of Russia or of a  peacekeeping force of the CIS," said the leader of parliament of  the republic unrecognised by Moldavia.    A Russian Army came to the region in the days of Empress  Catherine the Second, and ever since has been the guarantor of  peace and stability, Marakutsa said. An overwhelming majority  of the population of left-bank Moldavia agree with this. They  know quite well who "dampened hot-heads and stopped bloodshed in  the Dniester area in the summer of 1992," he said.    "The 14th Army is not an expeditionary corps temporarily  deployed on foreign territory," Marakutsa emphasised. "The Army  officers are rooted in this land. Their houses, families and  relatives are here." His opinion is that those who press for  the earliest withdrawal of the Army from the Dniester area know  well that one can take away only its combat banner and a smaller  part of hardware but that people would not go.    Speaking about the role of Russia in a settlement of the  Dniester problem, Marakutsa pointed out that hardly any other  state could play a more positive role than Russia. "Not every  country would agree to expose its soldiers to danger to help a  stranger in misfortune. The role of Russia in this respect is  great and it will grow stronger," the Dniester parliament  speaker stressed.</p>

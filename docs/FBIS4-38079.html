			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the French foreign minister's statement  affirming France's readiness to host direct talks between the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de  Oro [Polisario] and Morocco, the Information Ministry of the  Saharan Democratic Arab Republic issued the following statement:    The Polisario Front [word indistinct] France's desire to  host  direct talks between the Front and the Kingdom of Morocco, which  was expressed by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to JEUNE AFRIQUE  weekly this week.    The statement added that the Front considers France to be  neutral, unbiased, and interested in the stability of the Arab  Maghreb region. It could therefore contribute to a  rapprochement between the two parties to the conflict in the  Western Sahara (?by providing a just basis for a resolution of  the conflict within the framework of the UN peace plan).    The statement said the Polisario Front remains [word  indistinct] at this critical time (?in view of) the UN peace  plan and Morocco's obstacles. However, the path of direct talks  would give the two conflicting parties a chance to overcome  their differences and help attain security and stability in the  region.</p>

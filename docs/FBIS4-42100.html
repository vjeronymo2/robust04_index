			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Portuguese Defense Minister Fernando Nogueira  said this morning that Portugal should only have two  intelligence services, otherwise it will be difficult to recruit  specialized staff.    [Begin Nogueira recording] As the government has advocated  for a long time -- fortunately the opposition now understands  this, and we had to wait until a consensus was reached on this  matter -- Portugal is not big enough nor does it have enough  resources to have three intelligence services, as provided for  by the legislation on intelligence services. Other European  democratic countries of similar size have only two intelligence  services.    In fact recent events demonstrate this. For example, the  lack of human resources in Madeira, in the secret services,  shows that if we created three intelligence services, we will  have even less people. Therefore, we will have the services on  paper but not functional services. Furthermore, it is not easy  to recruit qualified staff who understand the difficulties and  complexities of an intelligence service, who are fully aware of  the line dividing legitimate information gathering from  illegitimate practices. All this naturally leads to having two,  rather than three intelligence services. [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

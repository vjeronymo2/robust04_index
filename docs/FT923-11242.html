			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: The high priest of frivolity - Look out London, here comes Christian Lacroix UNTIL NOW British fans of Christian Lacroix, the exuberant Parisian designer, have had to cross the channel to see the full range of the master's clothes and accessories. To be sure, they could see a small selection of authentic Lacroix at Harrods and the Hans Crescent boutique A La Mode, but to the true aficionado this was more like a teasing taster when what they wanted was the full menu. All this is set to change. From August 3 they will be able to trot along to 8a Sloane Street, London SW1, where a brand new Christian Lacroix shop (a franchise owned by Roberto Devorik) will be selling the full Lacroix range. From haute couture to pret-a-porter, from petits bijoux to chaussures, from legwear by le Bourget to 'cravates pour l'homme', all the details that make up the look will be on sale. Lacroix, you may remember, is the most recent addition to the gilded circle of haute couturiers with salons bearing their own name. After coming to Paris from Arles he worked at Hermes and Jean Patou before Bernard Arnault, whose conglomerate, Financiere Agache, also owns Dior, financed the opening of the house of Lacroix just five years ago. From the beginning he attracted headlines. His were not clothes like any others. The frock-fanciers and fashion press divided into two camps - those who thought he was extreme, over-the-top, unwearable, and those who thought he was the best thing to happen to haute couture since fashion's high priest Yves St Laurent last blew away the cobwebs. For his visual repertoire Lacroix draws on his Provencal childhood - the colourful symbolism of the corrida, the fiery Provencal fields and sunsets, the folkloric dress, a rich ratatouille of cultural references that make his designs instantly recognisable to the cognoscente. He has been a marvellous complement to the perfect, tasteful, understated approach to fashion which reaches its apogee in the work of the Italian designer Giorgio Armani and which much of Paris aims to emulate. Tastefulness is not one of the thing that Lacroix rates highly. He is on record as saying 'bad taste is better than no taste,' and that for him 'vulgar is not pejorative, but ordinary is.' His designs show what happens when a designer is released from the constraint that taste imposes. He has huge fun with colour, with patterns, with textures. His collections are alive with visual puns, with wit and - a rare quality in the tres serieux world of haute couture - frivolity. What is the point of fashion, he seems to say, if it is not fun, extravagant, seductive, ephemeral? His clothes are not for the shy or retiring. Beloved of showbiz stars, of the International Herald Tribune's Suzy Menkes, of the East Coast and Texan 'Pay and Play Set', they are vibrant, colourful and above all highly feminine. The new shop will stock a small collection of haute couture numbers, as well as a video and photographs, that customers can admire, gasp at, try on and even order. Trying to get a clear idea of what a haute couture number really costs is like trying to get a true picture of the state of the Mirror Group pension fund - what I CAN tell you is that suits will start (start being the operative word) at about Pounds 2,000. The pret-a-porter collection is a little more affordable with suits starting at Pounds 950, dresses at Pounds 657, skirts at Pounds 120. Then there are the distinctive accessories which offer a little of the Lacroix glamour for much, much less. You could buy earrings for Pounds 49, brooches for Pounds 39 upwards, gloves for Pounds 135 (not just any old gloves, these may well be gauntlet or brilliantly coloured or highly embroidered), or shoes (again embroidered) for Pounds 102. And even more affordable, roughly 20 per cent less than the pret-a-porter prices, is the Pre-collection, offering cruisewear in winter and less formal spring and autumn wear.</p>

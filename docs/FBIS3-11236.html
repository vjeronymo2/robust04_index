Since 28 March 1982, we Salvadorans have been making great and  permanent efforts to establish and develop democracy in our  country. We have been successful in our endeavor. We have been  able to gradually legitimize the electoral system, which has  resulted in governments originating directly from the will of  the people. Within that framework of legitimacy, it was  possible to promote the process that led to the attainment of  peace in our country.    Without democracy, peace would have been impossible.  Democracy is the work of the people who made great sacrifices  for the sake of democracy. Peace, therefore, is also the work  of the people who have accepted it as something that belongs to  them. We must defend and strengthen it in a process that will  lead us to definitive political and economic stability with  opportunities of liberty and progress for all.    Within that process, Sunday, 20 March is a day of great  responsibilities and possibilities. The elections for president  and vice president of the Republic, for deputies to the  Legislative Assembly, and for municipal councils throughout the  country will take place on the same day as the result of a very  fortunate concurrence of the electoral calendar as established  by the Constitution. It is a day when all elected offices will  be renewed. To this we add the significant fact that these  elections are the first to be held free of the dark scenario of  the war behind us.    The electoral system has been improved by the constitutional  reforms, which fully guarantee that the elections will be honest  and functional, with the vote of each citizen in every part of  the country being valuable and secured and contributing to the  general will, which is what will decide who should lead the fate  of the country from the various posts in the years to come.    Thus, this is a great opportunity to continue consolidating  our democracy, and that is why it is such an important  responsibility to go to the polls to vote. That vote is the  only legitimate weapon of citizens who want to build a  fatherland with freedom, security, and stability.    This Sunday, young people, adults, and the elderly -- women  and men -- must go to the polls. With our votes we will decide  on the leadership of the next government. We will do it with  our votes, not with weapons. We will do it with the force of  reason, not with unreasonable force. Nobody should exclude  himself from this great task. Abstention is self-exclusion, and  nobody wins by it, much less the nation.    Dear fellow countrymen; everything is prepared so Sunday's  elections will be exemplary. The electoral and security  mechanisms are ready to guarantee the honesty and tranquillity  of the elections. In addition, the eyes of the world are on  these elections, which are taking place within the framework of  pacification that has merited the respect and admiration of the  international community.    In this context, we want to commend the work of the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal, which has efficiently fulfilled its role.  The legitimacy of the process and the free expression of  Salvadorans is guaranteed.    Fellow countrymen; all that remains to be done is for you to  go to your polling station next Sunday and freely cast your vote  according to your conscience and inclination. Go with your  family members, with your children, because an election such as  the one to be held on 20 March should be a lesson in civics with  mutual respect and joy. Among us we are building the fate of  our beloved El Salvador. Do it while thinking of your future  and the future of our dear fatherland.    Go and vote, as everyone who wants a better country will do.  We want a humane, harmonious, and peaceful country. Let us all  remember that we are all brothers at the polls for the sake of  El Salvador. May God enlighten your decision on 20 March.</p>

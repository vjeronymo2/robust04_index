			<p>BFN     [Text] Ningbo, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The Beilun Port of  this coastal city in Zhejiang Province, one of China's four  major deepwater harbors, has become a key transit port for  imported iron ore.    So far, 14 large and medium-sized iron and steel complexes  along the Chang Jiang river and interior parts of the country  have imported iron ore via the port.    The special wharf of the port began to serve the Shanghai  Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex, a large modern enterprise, in  1982 and later the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex.    To meet the needs of different iron and steel plants, the  Beilun Port has expanded its stockyards three times to raise its  storage capacity from the original 500,000 tons to one million  tons at present.    A survey shows that the port has handled 40 million tons of  imported iron ore in 20 varieties so far.    At present, construction of another iron ore wharf able to  accommodate 300,000-dwt [deadweight ton] ships is proceeding  well.    It will be able to handle between 28 million tons and 30  million tons of iron ore a year upon completion.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : A commenter expressed the view that the proposed regulations do not address the situation in which an individual who might be eligible for Social Security and SSI benefits files an application for Social Security benefits but does not ask about or express interest in SSI benefits and does not file an application for those benefits at that time. The commenter suggested that the proposed rules be amended to provide for the use of the filing date of the application for Social Security benefits in such a case to establish the filing date of an application for SSI benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Existing &sect;&sect;416.345 and 416.350, which are not affected by these final rules, already address the situation discussed by the commenter. Section 416.350 provides that when an individual applies for Social Security benefits, we will explain the requirements for eligibility for SSI benefits to the individual and give the individual a chance to file an SSI application if it appears that he or she might be eligible for SSI benefits as explained in that section. If the individual does not apply for SSI benefits at that time, &sect;416.350 provides that we will treat his or her filing of an application for Social Security benefits as an oral inquiry about SSI benefits for purposes of &sect;416.345. The filing date of the individual's Social Security application, therefore, may be used to establish the filing date of an SSI application in accordance with &sect;416.345. For these reasons, we did not adopt the change suggested by the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : One commenter questioned the requirement of proposed &sect;&sect;404.633(c)(4) and 416.351(c)(4) that ``[t]he misinformation must have been provided to you in response to a specific request by you to us for information about your eligibility for benefits or the eligibility for benefits of [another] *&blank;*&blank;* person *&blank;*&blank;* for which you were considering filing an application.'' The commenter believed that this provision, as well as proposed &sect;&sect;404.633(a) and 416.351(a), would require an individual who requests a deemed filing date of an application based on misinformation to show that he or she had a specific intent to claim benefits at the time the alleged misinformation was provided. The commenter believed that such a requirement would be inconsistent with section 10302 of OBRA 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was the commenter's opinion that in enacting this statute, Congress intended to place an affirmative duty on SSA to develop or encourage claims that could be filed, at least where a potential applicant presents material facts to the Agency and an employee makes an incorrect or incomplete response. Therefore, the commenter believed that the proposed rules should be revised to permit the establishment of a deemed filing date of an application where an individual does not inquire about possible eligibility for benefits but simply presents information to the Agency that might have alerted an SSA employee to a potential claim, and, because the employee does not consider and does not advise the individual of the potential claim, the individual does not file an application for benefits. As an illustration, the commenter described a situation in which information showing that a disability insurance beneficiary had children who were born after the beneficiary began receiving disability benefits and who, upon the filing of the required applications, could become entitled to child's insurance benefits based on the beneficiary's earnings record, was overlooked during a continuing disability review interview with the beneficiary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Sections 404.633(c)(4) and 416.351(c)(4) prescribe the circumstances in which the misinformation must have been provided in order to have caused the individual not to file an application for benefits. These sections do not require an individual to show that he or she had the express intention of filing an application for benefits at the time he or she was provided the alleged misinformation. Rather, these sections provide only that the alleged misinformation must have been provided in a situation in which the individual was considering applying for benefits and contacted SSA to inquire about his or her eligibility for benefits or the eligibility of another person for whom the individual had authority to sign an application. We believe this requirement, which is also reflected in &sect;&sect;404.633(a) and 416.351(a), is consistent with sections 202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) of the Act, which were added by section 10302 of OBRA 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (8): Influencing the economics of drug provision - Extracts from the Commission's policy outline The policy outline says that (the European drug industry's) 'ability to finance the research and development of therapeutically innovative medicines, which is a condition for its long term competitiveness, in particular seems to be relatively weak.' Pharmaceutical spending represents an important share of social security budgets, whose financing is a subject of concern in most member states at the very moment that they are required to contain public deficits in order to prepare for economic and monetary union. The Commission will see to it that any price control system is operated in such a way that the price setting mechanism is fully transparent and that all forms of discrimination are prevented. It would not be acceptable that national decisions relating to price fixing or admission for reimbursement are influenced by the origin of products and discriminate against products imported from other member states. In the case of medicinal products which are available without prescription - and which are not eligible for reimbursement by social security - it seems that, in some member states, the market is often competitive enough to ensure an affordable price level. In the case of reimbursed medicinal products, it could be interesting to consider other cost containment measures. Such methods would be based on competition between undertakings for those therapeutic categories where several treatments are available. Member-states should not be forced to accept excessive pricing of medicinal products which are not subject to competition, whilst ensuring that the pharmaceutical industry maintains its financial capacity necessary to support its R&amp;D activities. The Court of Justice has on many occasions ruled that parallel imports are legal, irrespective of the factors that determine price differences. Prescribing doctors, if better informed about the cost/efficacy ratio of medicinal products, will tend to prescribe generically.</p>

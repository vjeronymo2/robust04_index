			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Arts: Esteve-Coll to leave the Victoria and Albert Museum Elizabeth Esteve-Coll, the 56-year-old director of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, is to quit next September to take up the post of vice chancellor at the University of East Anglia. She will be leaving the V&amp;A in the middle of her second five-year term as director. 'It's never easy to leave a place where you are working with a really good team' Esteve-Coll said yesterday. 'But I can't resist a challenge and the UEA has an international research reputation'. She had a difficult start as director in 1988. Many of her senior colleagues disapproved of her attempts to bring in a wider public by popularising displays, and there were eight departures in a year. But she has stamped her look on the V&amp;A, courting sponsors to provide eight refurbished galleries, reintroducing regular exhibitions, and building up visits from school children from 9,000 to 75,000. This year attendances at the V&amp;A are over 40 per cent higher than in 1993, thanks mainly to the Faberge, Pugin and Street Style shows, and should total 1.35m. When Esteve-Coll took over they had fallen below 1m, thanks to the imposition of a suggested entrance charge in 1985. The race to succeed her has already started. With Lord Armstrong still chairing the trustees the new director will presumably be expected to continue Esteve-Coll's populist policies. The most obvious contender is Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland, who cut his teeth at the V&amp;A.  He recently co-operated with the V&amp;A in securing the controversial Three Graces, which the two museums will share, and has the necessary mix of knowledge, energy and imagination, plus excellent contacts. But his tendency to shoot from the hip may give the trustees pause. The V&amp;A, embracing all the decorative arts and with a history as a craft-fostering institution, has a tradition of appointing internally: Esteve-Coll was librarian before her surprising lift to director. The most obvious V&amp;A graduate, Charles Saumarez Smith, formerly the research director, put himself out of the running earlier this year when he accepted the top job at the National Portrait Gallery. Another V&amp;A insider, Simon Jervis, went to the Fitzwilliam. Most of the remaining departmental heads are fairly young and fairly new: if the trustees go for managerial expertise they might favour Jim Close, who is assistant director in charge of administration. Alternatively there is Timothy Stevens, a recent arrival from the National Museum of Wales who is assistant director in charge of collections. Among the specialist curators Philippa Glanville, head of metal work, must be a possibility.</p>

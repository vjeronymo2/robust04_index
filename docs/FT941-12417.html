			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Russian report urges pay and price controls Veteran economists who failed to convince President Mikhail Gorbachev to start market reforms have included wage and price controls in recommendations to the new government to help 'correct' President Boris Yeltsin's economic changes. A report drawn up by a team including Prof Stanislav Shatalin, father of the radical 500-Day Programme, and Dr Leonid Abalkin, a former presidential adviser who opposed the 500-Day plan, was commissioned by the government in its desperate search for 'non-monetary' methods to fight inflation. The report sums up all the hopes of opponents of liberal reforms that painful financial stabilisation can be avoided and that the government can reimpose controls for which it no longer has the levers. Arguing that liberalising energy prices in a still-monopolised economy would only fuel inflation and cut industrial production further, the report proposes fixing prices for raw materials and rail transport. Through these price controls - with taxes imposed on producers which sell for free prices to subsidise the companies which have to operate under fixed prices - it hopes to restructure Russia's skewed price structure. The liberals who have lost power say that the only way to eliminate the imbalances which mean that industrial prices are higher than agricultural prices is to force enterprises to behave in a more market-orientated way by reducing their state subsidies. The report also proposes to 'mobilise domestic savings' to help stabilise the economy but does not say how this can be achieved when high inflation discourages investment and pushes individuals and companies to keep their money in dollar-denominated bank accounts. It suggests combining unspecified wage controls with the indexation of salaries to keep up with a minimum subsistence level. It also emphasises reliance on the former Soviet republics as the main market for Russian companies, and proclaims the need for Russia not to rely on external assistance for reforms. The team urges rejection of voucher privatisation - due to come to an end on July 1 anyway - and calls for more active intervention by the state in how enterprises are privatised and restructured. Accusing the outgoing radicals of 'nave faith that monetarism will automatically lead to economic recovery', the report nonetheless urges a tough monetary and fiscal policy, and selective support for industry, both of which have been government policy for two years. Prof Shatalin admits that printing money to finance the extra expenditure would fuel inflation but justifies it by saying 'if the money leads to higher output and more goods, that will reduce inflation'.</p>

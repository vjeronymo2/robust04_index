			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: The inspector is right My wife and I were partners in a farm which we sold in 1988. A small capital gains loss was established and agreed with the Inland Revenue dealing with my returns at the time. I had assumed this was in my name to add to my allowances to be carried forward from year to year should the need arise. After some correspondence with my Revenue office, the tax inspector told me I was entitled to only 50 per cent of the loss as I was in partnership with my wife at the time. Is this ruling correct? If so, can my wife claim the other 50 per cent to set against any capital gains she may have in the future? Yes, your tax inspector is right; and yes, your wife can set the allowable loss on her share of the property against her future chargeable gains. Ask the tax office for the free leaflet CGT 15 (Capital gain tax: a guide for married couples). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: US inflation news prompts recovery LONDON joined in the general sigh of relief throughout Europe yesterday afternoon when the US Federal bond market rose strongly following heartening news on inflation on the other side of the Atlantic. After another nervous, futures-led session, the FT-SE 100 Index reversed an early fall to end 18.4 up at 3,096.0, the day's best reading. The December contract on the Footsie cleared 3,100 several times but could not move above 3,105. Having cleared the first hurdle of the week, the London market is now waiting for the US consumer price index, to be announced today. UK blue chips responded readily towards last night's market close to gains in the US dollar and bond markets, the latter quickly reflected in firmness in British government bonds. Equities had opened firmly in London, brushing off the setback in Tokyo and preferring to respond to the steadier trend on Wall Street. But an early gain of 14.4 on the Footsie was wiped out when a UK securities house, apparently turning nervous ahead of the impending statistics from across the Atlantic, sold the December futures contract heavily. After dipping to 3,072.2, minus 5.4, the market rallied on the US bond market's favourable response to the welcome news that US producer prices had fallen by 0.2 per cent in October, compared with fears of a 0.2 per cent gain. The US bond market's worries over inflation provided the basis for last week's shakeout in equities throughout Europe, so London was happy to follow the advance achieved yesterday afternoon across the leading European bourses. Although market volume jumped smartly towards the close, returning a Seaq total of 775.5m shares, compared with Monday's 557.7m, traders warned that the mood remained cautious. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, still a softer target than the Footsie for bearish strategies, finished 0.9 easier at 3,439.8. On Monday, when the market struggled to resist the overflow from Friday's sell-off, retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.3bn. London traders will be watching overnight for the closing reading on Wall Street, hoping that a strong close on the Dow Average will propel the Footsie through the 3,100 mark today. The dollar's strength encouraged blue chip internationals, with oil issues standing out very firmly, and only Zeneca remaining out of favour among the pharmaceuticals. BAT Industries found additional strength from confirmation, in the form of a move by RJ Reynolds, of the US, that cigarette prices are likely to rise. The soothing of inflation fears also restored faith in prospects for a base rate cut in the UK. Store and consumer shares attracted favourable comment from brokerage houses and regained their poise, while building and construction issues returned to centre stage. Market optimists drew support from evident signs of bed and breakfast activity, where shares are sold for tax reasons with the intention of repurchase in the next session. A rush of such deals yesterday suggested that fund managers are confident that the stock market shakeout has run its course, at least for the time being. But the near term outlook for London is still vulnerable to developments on Wall Street.</p>

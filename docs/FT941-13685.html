			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Diplomatic woes complicate Macedonia's reform efforts: The many obstacles to viable statehood Mr Savo Stankovic, Macedonia's leading exporter of printed circuit boards, points to the factory he is having built outside Skopje, the capital: 'If things were different, that plant would be on an industrial estate in Greece.' Until two years ago Computronica, Mr Stankovic's company, received most of its orders from Greek electronics suppliers. But after Greece refused to recognise the former Yugoslav republic, on the grounds that its name amounted to a territorial claim on the northern Greek province of Macedonia, his Greek customers 'telephoned to say they were under official pressure to stop doing business with Skopje'. 'Business was growing so fast I'd planned to apply for incentives offered under the Greek foreign investment law, for manufacturing high-tech products there. Instead, I was questioned by the Greek police during a business trip and then refused a visa.' Because bank loans were not available while Macedonia was struggling for international recognition, Mr Stankovic had to invest his own capital, together with funds provided by German customers, to build the Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.4m) plant at home. He says he already has orders, worth Dollars 650,000 a month, from Germany and Turkey. Mr Stankovic's experience underlines how Balkan politics have exacerbated the problems facing Macedonian businesses since the republic broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991. Just as Macedonia was starting the transition to a market economy, UN sanctions were imposed against Serbia, its main trading partner. Although Macedonia is now a UN member developing ties with several European Union member states, Greece continues to harass its neighbour, refusing entry to Macedonian passport-holders and delaying shipments of oil and other Skopje-bound goods that come through the northern port of Thessaloniki, Macedonia's closest outlet to the sea. Greece objects not just to Macedonia's name, but to its flag, which carries a sunburst symbol associated with the northern Greek dynasty of Alexander the Great, and its constitution, thought by the Greeks to endorse an expansionist vision of uniting with Greek Macedonia. The underlying fear is that Greece's Slav-speaking minority, never fully assimilated and with strong ties to Macedonia, could one day adopt a political platform calling for self-determination. Hopes that Greece's current responsibility as EU president for promoting a common foreign policy would stimulate a change in attitude were dashed at the outset, when Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou refused to rule out closing the border with Macedonia. However, last night Mr Papandreou said Greece was ready to hold talks with Macedonia under United Nations auspices if it offered 'practical examples' of being prepared to reach a compromise. Mr Papandreou, opening a debate on the Macedonia issue, sounded more moderate than in the past, making clear that Greece wanted Macedonia to survive as an independent state. The Greek government was willing to contribute to Macedonia's development, but still refused to recognise Macedonia under that name. Mr Kiro Gligorov, Macedonia's president, has said he is willing to sign an agreement guaranteeing the border with Greece. He adds: 'We want to start the dialogue with Greece in New York, under UN sponsorship, and work out a package solution covering all our differences.' Two years of diplomatic and economic isolation have taken a heavy toll, with gross domestic product falling by more than 30 per cent since 1991. Per capita income has dropped by half to less than Dollars 700. Industrial production is collapsing, with Macedonia's steel and nickel producers both close to shutting down because of difficulties in exporting. The textile industry is operating at 30 per cent of capacity, according to government officials. A severe drought cut agricultural output last year by more than 20 per cent and halted exports of early vegetables. On the advice of the International Monetary Fund, Macedonia took the unusual step of asking for donations from abroad to cover repayment of Dollars 85m in debt owed to the World Bank. Although the government hoped that Ecu50m (Pounds 39m) in aid promised last year by EU member states could be used to cover the debt, only Dollars 20m of that amount has been pledged so far, with the US contributing another Dollars 5m. However, Mr George Soros, the international financier, has come to the rescue, promising the Macedonian government a short-term bridging loan. The government has already agreed with the IMF on an economic reform programme, in return for a stand-by facility of Dollars 35m this year. Once its World Bank arrears are covered, Macedonia will be eligible for up to Dollars 140m in fresh loans for infrastructure projects. The best way to revive trade and eventually attract investment, the government says, is to bypass both Greece and Serbia, and build new communications links with Albania, Bulgaria and Turkey.</p>

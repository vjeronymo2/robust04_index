			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Junsheng (2621 0193 3932): "Concentrate Forces on </F> Investigation and Handling of Major and Serious Cases"]    [Text] From the beginning of this year, Hebei's discipline  inspection and supervision organs at all levels, with a firm  hold always, have taken the investigation and punishment of  party members and cadres who violated law and discipline as an  important measure of the anticorruption struggle. Leaders at  all levels were responsible for their assigned cases, personally  commanded the cases at the forefront, and focused forces on  major and serious cases. From January to April, the discipline  inspection and supervision organs in the whole province accepted  and handled 33,125 cases reported by the masses in their letters  and visits. They investigated and handled 3,429 cases on party  members and cadres who violated law and discipline, of which  1,790 cases were already concluded. A total of 1,775 people  were dealt with according to party and political disciplinary  actions, and 85 people were subjected to criminal sanctions.    Compared with last year, this year's investigation work had  four distinguishing features.    First, the numbers of the cases investigated and handled and  the discipline violators who were punished were large and showed  a large-scale increase. In this year's first four months, the  number of the cases investigated and handled rose by 71.36  percent over the same period of the previous year; and the  numbers of the people who were dealt with according to party  disciplinary actions, political disciplinary actions, and  criminal law were respectively 54.82 percent, 201.39 percent,  and 63.46 percent higher than the same period of the previous  year. The numbers of investigated and handled cases increased  by 1.31 times and 1.27 times over the same period of last year  in Handan city and Hengshui Prefecture, respectively.    Second, a batch of major and serious cases were investigated  and handled. From January to April, there were a total of 187  major and serious cases investigated and handled across the  province, an increase of 32.62 percent over the same period of  the previous year. Of the total, 75 cases involved leading  cadres at and above the deputy county head level, an increase of  368.73 percent over the same period of the previous year.    Third, there is a large proportion of cases on violation of  economic discipline in the total investigated and handled cases.  Discipline inspection and supervision organs at all levels,  focusing on economic construction, the central task, stressed  the investigation and handling of economic discipline breaches  to protect the smooth development of reform and opening up.  From January to April, they investigated and handled 1,681  economic cases, 49.02 percent of the total cases registered and  an increase of 41.4 percent over the same period of the previous  year, and recovered an economic loss of 399.45 million yuan for  the country. Recently, an extraordinary big case about bribery  during the contracting of construction projects was uncovered in  Handan city. Thirty-nine people were involved, the amount of  money violating law and discipline reached over 400,000 yuan,  and six cadres at the county level and four scientific and  technical cadres were arrested according to law. The discipline  inspection commission and procuratorate in Wuan city uncovered  an extraordinary big bribe- taking case in the city's industrial  and commercial bank and credit cooperative, and of the 17 people  involved in the case, six cadres at and above the deputy section  chief level took bribes totaling 512,000 yuan.    Fourth, a batch of major and serious cases committed by  groups and regional cases were cracked. Most of such cases  involved many people each, and many of them were characterized  by people in and outside a department or at higher and lower  levels collaborating with each other and were complicated and  difficult to deal with. Discipline inspection and supervision  organs closely coordinated with law-enforcement organizations  and commanded in unison to make breakthroughs in major cases.  The provincial discipline inspection commission and supervision  department alone investigated and handled four such cases. All  cities and prefectures also made breakthroughs in a batch of  major and serious cases. For example, Zhang Liejun, former  general manager; and Yang Kuizhong, Wang Xihuan, and Lee  Zhiqiang, deputy general managers of a general company in  Qinhuangdao city economic and technological development zone,  practiced fraud and issued forged receipts to draw 15,505.80  yuan in cash through a certain company and bank and shared 1,000  yuan each. They also used their subordinating company's money  earned from selling old electric wires to pay for their personal  contract deposits, 1,000 yuan for each. Besides, Zhang, Yang,  and Wang also accepted 2,000 yuan in bribes each. Now Zhang  Liejun, Yang Kuizhong, and Wang Xihuan have been expelled from  the party and dismissed from their positions as general manager  and deputy general manager. At the same time, the judicial  organ also investigated their crimes of embezzlement and  accepting bribes. Li Zhiqiang was placed on probation within  the party for two years and dismissed from the administrative  post as deputy general manager as punishment.</p>

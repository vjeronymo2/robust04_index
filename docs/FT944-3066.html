			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Eurosceptics set out poll plans The Conservative party's Euro-rebels yesterday launched a new challenge to the government by setting out plans for a private member's bill proposing a referendum on the UK's future in Europe. The bill, proposed by Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, would require the government to hold a referendum on UK membership of the European Union before the 1996 inter-governmental conference. Mrs Gorman's bill, which could be debated in the Commons within eight weeks, may create new embarrassment for Mr John Major's government amid signs that it will gain cross-party support. In recent weeks speculation that there will be a referendum on the next stage of European integration has grown because Mr Major has refused to rule one out. However, pro-European members of the cabinet, including Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, have reacted sceptically to the idea of a referendum, saying that the agenda of the inter-governmental conference in 1996 is still undecided. The bill proposes a consultative referendum - which would not be binding on the government - by the end of March 1996. Voters would be asked to endorse one of three outcomes: that the UK 'remain in the Union, but only so long as it remains an economic organisation of member states'; that it adhere to a federal organisation with a common currency; or that it 'withdraw altogether from the union'.</p>

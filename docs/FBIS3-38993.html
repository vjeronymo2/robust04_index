			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Robert Stoppacher report on news conference by Austrian </F> Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak on 10 February; place not  given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] The Antiterrorism Task Force has struck again.  A 24-year-old right-wing extremist has been arrested in  connection with the series of letter bomb attacks. Interior  Minister Franz Loeschnak confirmed this today. He did not want  to disclose any details on the man's role. [passage omitted]    Reportedly, the recently arrested man is part of the  leadership of the terrorist group called Extraparliamentary  Opposition Loyal to the People, with which Peter Binder and  Franz Radl Junior are also affiliated. These two right-wing  extremists have been imprisoned for many weeks. Loeschnak says  that they are supposedly behind the wave of terrorism. By the  way, the interior minister also talks for the first time of  concrete proof against the suspects, not mere circumstantial  evidence.    At any rate, right-wing extremism in Austria has altogether  become more violent. This is also shown by the criminal  statistics presented by the Interior Ministry, which, however,  in general indicates a gratifying reversal of the trend. After  years of increasing crime rates, the figures for 1993 show, for  the first time, a slight decrease. The number of crimes and  criminal offenses is just under 500,000, as compared to 502,000  the year before. [passage omitted]</p>

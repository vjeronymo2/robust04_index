			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES POLL;  </P> <P> MANY TO CUT SPENDING AS HEDGE FOR RECESSION  </P> <P> California residents are bracing for a recession by trimming spending plans for  new cars, vacations, Christmas gifts and restaurant meals, The Los Angeles  Times Poll has found, a behavior pattern that could intensify the current  economic slump.  </P> <P> Optimism about the California economy has been giving way to financial jitters  since last year, the survey shows. Majorities of the rich and poor, men and  women, residents of Southern California and the Bay Area all expect a recession  within the next year.  </P> <P> Still, Californians retain more faith in their state's economy than in the  nation's overall, which a majority says already has entered a recession.  </P> <P> "California is a great place to build a business and to live and for jobs,"  said John Rutledge, chairman of the Claremont Economics Institute, a private  firm. "But we're treading water for a while."  </P> <P> Many of those interviewed, however, said the economy was sinking rather than  treading water, both at the state and national levels.  </P> <P> Almost three-quarters said the United States would suffer a recession by next  year, with just more than half responding that a downturn was in progress now.  At home, the view was better, but only by a little: Two out of three said  California would tumble into a recession by next year; two out of five said the  downturn had arrived already.  </P> <P> The findings seem to highlight a stark reality: For all its economic strength,  the Golden State cannot shield itself from the economic forces that are  buffeting the national economy.  </P> <P> "California is a microcosm of the United States," said David G. Hensley, a UCLA  economic forecaster. "The factors that would push the United States into a  recession would push California into a recession. . . . I think it's going to  be a rough ride for everybody."  </P> <P> The Times' telephone survey of 2,564 Californians was conducted between Oct. 19  and Oct. 24, a time when the federal budget crisis appeared to be reaching a  peak. The findings are considered accurate to within 3 percentage points. The  survey was supervised by Susan Pinkus, assistant Times Poll director.  </P> <P> The poll also underscored the political controversy surrounding tax increases.  Even as politicians in Washington were crafting a tax-increase plan last week,  six out of 10 respondents said they opposed increasing taxes to cut the  deficit.  </P> <P> Yet few Californians seem to blame President Bush for the nation's economic  malaise; only 7% cited him as the source. Rather, Congress emerged as the  villain. More than one in four respondents faulted the legislative branch for  the country's economic ills. Oil prices were cited by 13% and "corporations  living on borrowed money" by 12% as other causes of America's economic  difficulties.  </P> <P> "People don't think he (Bush) created the economic recession. They believe  Congress is far more responsible," said William Schneider, a scholar at the  American Enterprise Institute and a political analyst for The Times. "But that  doesn't mean he's not getting blamed for something."  </P> <P> The "something" may be a lack of leadership in the budget process and a failure  adequately to explain the reason for higher taxes, Schneider suggested. Bush's  popularity has fallen sharply in recent weeks, according to national polls.  </P> <P> In California, optimism about economic prosperity also has fallen. Just a year  ago, 37% rated the California economy as in strong shape. By last week,  however, the figure had shrunk by more than half. Asked to rate the state's  economy, a majority of those polled described it as somewhere between good and  bad, with more leaning to a negative view.  </P> <P> "Because of the Middle East tension and rising gas prices and rising taxes, the  poll is reflecting a very deep sense of foreboding by the average family," said  Joseph A. Wahed, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "I'm not  surprised at all by the results."  </P> <P> The findings were generally consistent throughout the state, although views  about the economy varied a little among regions.  </P> <P> Orange County residents were least likely to describe California as in bad  shape today. Elsewhere in Southern California, residents took a slightly  gloomier view. People in the Central Valley were expecting the longest economic  slump, with one in three saying it would last more than 18 months. Just one in  five Orange County residents said the downturn would last that long.  </P> <P> More than two out of five Los Angeles respondents said the recession already  had started; the figure was slightly lower in other regions, but often close  enough to be within statistical margins of error. Findings in the Bay Area and  Los Angeles were similar for various questions.  </P> <P> A recession is generally defined as a period of six consecutive months in which  the economy is in decline. In such a slump, unemployment rises, wage gains are  sharply restricted and business profits suffer. But respondents to the survey  may have had a less technical definition in mind.  </P> <P> Over the years, California's economic diversity has been an insurance policy  against hard times, limiting the ripple effects caused by a downturn in any one  industry. Yet national problems involving savings and loans, commercial banks,  real estate, construction and the cost of energy appear to be taking a toll.  </P> <P> "Southern California will not escape the recession," predicted Stephen Levy,  director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo  Alto.  </P> <P> Certainly, economic anxiety is spreading, a factor that could prove significant  in the coming months.  </P> <P> Six in 10 of those surveyed said they expected to postpone, cancel or reduce  spending due to economic fears. These spending cuts would ricochet through the  economy, hurting a range of retailers, service providers and, ultimately,  manufacturers.  </P> <P> Almost one-third of those interviewed cited plans to scale back vacations, for  example. Car purchases and dining out also were cited by one in three as  targets for cuts.  </P> <P> By slightly smaller margins, consumers said they would scale back plans to buy  Christmas presents (27%), homes (26%) and major appliances (22%).  </P> <P> Such attitudes are considered important, because consumer spending amounts to  two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. When people opt to protect themselves by  hanging onto their dollars -- as they do in times of rising unemployment --  their actions can further weaken the economy. Analysts sometimes describe this  scenario as a self-fulfilling recession.  </P> <P> "For every guy that actually gets laid off, there probably are 20 guys who are  scared," said Rutledge, the Claremont economist, noting the widespread concern  in Southern California about layoffs in the defense industry. "And those guys  aren't buying sofas and tables. They're probably building a little cushion of  savings."  </P> <P> The California findings fit in with national data that highlight an  extraordinary wariness by consumers since the onset of the Persian Gulf crisis.  Consumer confidence has plunged to its lowest level in eight years, the  Conference Board, a business research group, said last week.  </P> <P> "Any further curtailment in spending could readily push us into a full  recession," warned Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer  Research Center in New York, which surveys 5,000 households a month.  </P> <P> While economic wariness runs deep, there also are some notable differences  within the California public, The Times Poll shows.  </P> <P> Just over one woman in 10 gives the state economy good grades, for example.  Twice as many men rated the economy highly.  </P> <P> Members of different population groups also have disparate opinions on whether  the state is now gripped by a recession. Among women, 45% said the state is in  such a slump. Of the men surveyed, just 37% shared that opinion.  </P> <P> A gender gap also appeared in the public's view of how long the slump would  persist. About 29% of women said it would last for more than 18 months. Only  23% of men said it would last that long.  </P> <P> Blacks and Latinos take a substantially dimmer view of the California economy  than Anglos do. Two out of five Anglos agreed that a recession had arrived.  Blacks were more pessimistic, with one out of two saying that was the case.  Latinos were slightly more optimistic than blacks, but more pessimistic than  Anglos.  </P> <P> Similarly, just 24% of Anglos said the recession would last longer than 18  months. For blacks, it was 39%; for Latinos the figure was 31%. Asked to rate  the financial strength of the "head of your household," almost half of Anglos  said it was good. By contrast, fewer than a third of blacks and Latinos  described their household finances as "good."  </P> <P> Despite such differences, the survey showed that economic worries are cutting  across much of the population. While Latinos seemed most inclined to tighten  their budgets -- with three out of four declaring they planned to do so --  majorities of blacks and Anglos planned to cut back, too.  </P> <P> "There is a real negative psychology at this stage," said Wahed of Wells Fargo.  "I don't think it will last forever. It will change as business conditions  change and the Middle East crisis is resolved."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TIMES POLL: ASSESSING THE ECONOMY  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times Poll interviewed 2,564 respondents in California, asking  about their plans for coping with the economic slowdown and their assessment of  the depths of the problems facing the state and national economies.  </P> <P> Do you expect to postpone, cancel, or reduce spending on any of the following  purchases because of the economic situation in the country: a home, car,  Christmas presents, major appliances, a vacation, dining out and entertainment  or some other item?  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:1.56IN:1.78IN:1.67IN:1.67IN:1.78IN:1.45IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="7"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE>

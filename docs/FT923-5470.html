			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Panic faces confidence vote: Serbs' move could jeopardise Geneva peace conference THE political future of Yugoslav prime minister Milan Panic yesterday hung in the balance after a no-confidence vote was tabled in the federal parliament. A vote of no confidence would jeopardise the continuation of United Nations/European Community-sponsored peace talks on the former Yugoslavia which start this week in Geneva. Such a vote would also strengthen Serbian nationalist extremists in the rump Yugoslavia. A western diplomat yesterday said: 'It is a question of whether it was just a warning shot across the bow or signals the end of Panic.' The motion followed a bitter public row between the Belgrade-born California businessman and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic at the London conference last week. The vote of no confidence was supported by 68 parliamentary deputies from the ruling Socialist party and its satellite Serbian Radical party, whose ultranationalist leader, Mr Vojislav Seselj, commands a paramilitary wing. Known as Mr Milosevic's favourite politician, Mr Seselj yesterday said all 30 members of his party backed the motion. According to parliamentary rules, the no-confidence motion will be debated in three days. Parliament is dominated by supporters of Mr Milosevic since the opposition in May boycotted elections. The deputies accused Mr Panic of going beyond his mandate at the London conference. The Yugoslav prime minister had called for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders on the southern Serbian province of Kosovo. He also angered Serbs by calling for the recognition of Croatia. He has pledged to end ethnic cleansing in Serbia, where non-Serbs make up a third of the 9.8m population. A delegation of 200 Serbs from Kosovo yesterday demanded to see Mr Panic because of 'his ambiguous position on the status of Kosovo', in what was clearly a co-ordinated attack. Mr Panic has vowed to lift United Nations sanctions and revive the collapsing economy in what is left of Yugoslavia, the truncated federation of Serbia and Montenegro. Deputies from Montenegro yesterday opposed the vote of no-confidence. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign secretary, said the Geneva conference could be the last chance for a settlement before the international community was forced to intervene militarily. The Bosnian government said yesterday its forces had broken out of a four-month Serb siege of Gorazde and were mopping up pockets of Serb fighters, Reuter adds from Sarajevo. Mr Ejup Ganic, a presidency member, said fighting was still raging outside the Moslem town 60km south-east of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, after about 100 Bosnian defenders had pierced Serb lines. There was no independent confirmation of his claim.</p>

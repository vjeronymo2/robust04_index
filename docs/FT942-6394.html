			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Evidence on costs fails to stem outsourcing growth Businesses are contracting out their data processing operations at an unprecedented rate in spite of growing evidence that many deals prove unsatisfactory and more expensive than in-house operations. The sharp rise in outsourcing - or facilities management - was the principal reason for an average 11 per cent rise in revenues among British computing services companies last year, about twice the rate of the previous year and a faster growth rate than elsewhere in Europe. The Holway Report, an annual analysis of the financial performance of UK computing services companies which is being published this week, says outsourcing revenues of the main computing services companies grew 25 per cent in 1992 and 33 per cent last year to Pounds 665m. The report says the value of new contracts awarded last year exceeded Pounds 3bn, equivalent to Pounds 400m a year. It says the value of the market will grow by at least 40 per cent in 1995. By 1997 the UK outsourcing market is likely to be worth more than Pounds 2bn annually. Companies are turning to outsourcing for a variety of reasons, but mainly to do with cutting the cost of data processing. Typically, a business sells its data-processing operations to a computing services company which undertakes to provide an agreed level of service for a fee. Anecdotal evidence that outsourcing does not always bring the anticipated benefits is given credence by a survey of 160 large European companies. This shows that poor preparation and inadequately drafted contracts were common and a frequent cause of disputes. One respondent said: 'The contract did not have strong enough performance measures. I think they took advantage of us and I do not blame them. We were not very professional.' Another said: 'The contract was too loose; every time we sneezed it cost us Pounds 10,000.' Mr Kevin Tomlinson of CMS, a British Steel outsourcing subsidiary, said: 'Outsourcing contracts are agreed in concept and delivered in detail and that is why they break down.' The survey, by Business Intelligence, a London-based consultancy, says the companies most likely to experience difficulties were those which approached outsourcing as a solution to a problem 'without adequate consideration of the wider implications'. The result, it warns, can be loss of control of critical IT resources, disruption to the organisation and a cost far in excess of retaining data processing in-house. 1994 Holway Report.

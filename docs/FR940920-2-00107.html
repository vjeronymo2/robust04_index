			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Duration of Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that any revised policy adopted by the NRC be limited to a two-year trial basis similar to that approved for open enforcement conferences. Another commenter suggested that the policy statement should be limited to a period necessary to determine if there is sufficient interest to justify the expense of opening routine meetings to the public. The NRC believes that its long-term experience with open meetings justifies opening staff meetings and that this practice has resulted in significant benefits to the public. Thus the NRC does not believe its policy should be limited for any particular period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters expressed concern regarding expenditures that would be required by the NRC and licensees to accommodate public observation of meetings. Two commenters expressed concern that additional expenditures would be incurred without commensurate benefits; for example, that public meetings may be held with no public attendance. Should this happen, these commenters suggested that these types of meetings be added as exemptions because no public interest in them would have been demonstrated. Others believed that the proposal should be abandoned because it would affect fee assessments under the agency's 100-percent user fee policy, resulting in a net loss in regulatory effectiveness and with no public benefit. The NRC does not envision more than a nominal increase in expenditures because the meetings in question will be held with or without public attendance, and are usually held at NRC facilities and meetings at licensee facilities are normally held in a facility readily accessible to the public. NRC's costs associated with operating the toll-free telephone line and the public-access electronic bulletin board are minimal and, to a great extent, offset by consolidating several current meeting notice telephone systems into one. Press notices of public meetings will be included in the agency's Weekly Press Release Compilation. Concerns related to fee assessments are routinely addressed as part of rulemakings for 10 CFR Parts 170 and 171. In February 1994, the NRC issued the ``Report to the Congress on the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Licensee Policy Review Required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992'' that addresses concerns raised regarding the NRC licensee fee policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> American Mining Congress Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC invited public comment on concerns that had been submitted by the American Mining Congress (AMC) on the September 1992, Interim Policy Guidance that had been used by the NRC Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, the Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data, and the NRC regional offices. The AMC stated that the proposed policy was generally responsive to its concerns. AMC's additional comments and the concerns of other commenters who referenced AMC's concerns are addressed in the preceding analysis of comments in Section II of this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

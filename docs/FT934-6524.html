			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Foschini posts 19% increase in profits Foschini, the South African retail clothing and jewellery group, overcame difficult trading conditions to record a 19.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to R88.3m (Dollars 26.2m) in the six months to September, from R73.9m a year ago. High productivity levels helped profit growth outstrip the 17.8 per cent increase in turnover compared to 1992 (no turnover figure supplied). Attributable income rose 37.4 per cent to R53.3m. The company paid a R52.4m interim scrip dividend. Based on a share price of R68, shareholders will receive an allotment of one new ordinary 5 cents share for every 59 held. With signs of an economic upturn, Mr Stanley Lewis, chairman, forecast 'satisfactory profits and earnings growth' for the full year. Mr Clive Hirschson, managing director, said all trading divisions had been satisfactory. The rate of store expansion has been stepped up with 15 new stores opened in October alone compared to 12 during the reporting period. Jewellery group Sterns, purchased in April, had been repositioned and was now well placed to make a profit contribution in the second half. During the period two Foschini directors were appointed to the board of UK clothing retailer Etam, 36.4 per cent owned by Foschini associate, Oceana Investment Corporation.</p>

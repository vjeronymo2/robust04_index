			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Flawed elections DEMOCRACY HAS lost in Kenya's first multi-party poll for 26 years. Should the government of President Daniel arap Moi retain power, its claim to legitimacy will be based on an election process that was not free and fair. The consequences for Kenya are unpredictable, but include a grave threat of instability. The failure of democracy in Kenya, once a role model for Africa, will have serious implications for stability in the region and for other transitions to democracy across the continent. At best Kenya's angry opposition might settle for a strong parliamentary opposition which the country did not have before. But the millions of voters who queued so patiently deserve better. The west could have done more to ensure that they got it; and in doing so, it would have given greater credibility to 'conditionality' - the policy that links aid to democracy and accountability in recipient states. Just over a year ago, Kenya's leading donors froze aid, calling for economic and political reform. Within a month President Moi lifted the ban on opposition parties. Had those governments followed up their concerns by combining practical assistance with insistence that the election machinery be taken out of the hands of the ruling party, Kanu, the electoral abuses that were to follow could have been avoided. In the run-up to the election more than 40 opposition candidates were prevented from presenting nomination papers, leaving the ruling party unopposed in 15 constituencies in the 188 member parliament. Then followed the suspicious 'defection' of more than 40 candidates to Kanu. Civil servants acted as party apparatchiks. State-controlled radio and television fell well short of impartiality. Opposition allegations that state funds had been diverted to Kanu are unproven but certainly warrant investigation. Kenya thus presents the Commonwealth, which is monitoring the election, with a critical test of the declaration made at its 1991 summit in Harare, Zimbabwe. This reaffirmed shared values of democracy and promised action in their support. Monitoring the elections of member governments is a valuable way of putting the declaration into effect. If in its report on the election, the Commonwealth group fudges its conclusion and fails to make clear that the conduct of the election has been unacceptable, it will not only have done a disservice to Kenya. The Harare declaration and the new Commonwealth will have failed its first real test.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Weaker car sales 'hit credit growth' Weaker new-car sales slowed down the growth of consumer credit in September, a report by the Finance &amp; Leasing Association shows today. Finance for new cars fell 2 per cent on a year-on-year basis to Pounds 333m in September and by 56 per cent on a month-on-month basis. The same factor is likely to affect next month's consumer credit figures - the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Friday that new car registrations fell 3 per cent last month compared with October last year, with a reduction in sales to private buyers the main factor behind the fall. Total consumer credit in September nonetheless increased by 24 per cent year-on-year to Pounds 1.55bn. Rises of more than 30 per cent were experienced in the first half of this year. Store cards were up 48 per cent compared with September last year. Personal loans increased 37 per cent year-on-year in but were 1 per cent down from the August level. Mr David Hardisty, Finance and Leasing Association chairman, said that although consumers were spending in the high street they were 'thinking long and hard' about bigger purchases such as cars and houses. Mr Alan Davies, chief economist of Barclays Bank, says in the bank's quarterly economic review today that consumer spending is likely to grow between 1 per cent and 2 per cent next year - lower than in the last two years. He says the economic recovery should continue well into the medium term in spite of the relative weakness of consumer spending, the possibility of interest rate rises and the predicted absence of significant net tax cuts in this month's Budget. Very rapid growth in consumer spending would threaten to produce an increase in inflation and put the sustainability of the medium-term recovery at risk. He says the favourable forecast results from the increasing strength of exports, higher investment levels and an inflation rate not seen for almost 30 years. Strong exports next year would underpin a strong recovery, and lead to a 'virtual elimination' of the balance of payments deficit.</p>

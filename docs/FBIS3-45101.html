During the meeting, Hsu thanked the men for their efforts in  promoting bilateral economic and cultural exchanges.    Kajiyama expressed regret he was not able to visit Taiwan  during his tenure as LDP secretary-general. He added that the  KMT's strong showing in the Nov. 28 city and county elections  offered a good lesson to the LDP, which lost in last year's  congressional race.    Kajiyama also told Hsu he was impressed with Taiwan's  continued economic vitality.    The three Japanese Dietmen arrived in Taipei Monday for a  five- day visit. They will meet with President Li Teng-hui,  Premier Lien Chan, and Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu during  their visit.</p>

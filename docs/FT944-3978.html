			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Conservative Rebels in the News: The whipless wonders It had been a hard slog. But the British government's business managers reckoned they had pulled it off. Minutes before Tuesday's crucial House of Commons vote on value added tax, one whip thought that the government would win by two votes. He believed chancellor Kenneth Clarke's last-gasp concessions, offering pensioners an extra Pounds 100m of compensation for the proposed increase from 8 to 17.5 per cent in the rate of VAT on domestic fuel, had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. But he reckoned without the whipless wonders. These are the Tory MPs who were suspended from the parliamentary party, with one resigning voluntarily, after a vote last week on the controversial European Union finance bill. Eight of the nine extended the rebellion to VAT  -voting against the government or abstaining. Their defiance consigned the government to defeat by eight votes, and blew a Pounds 1.5bn hole in Mr Clarke's Budget arithmetic. The rebels appear to have decided to defy the government at a secret meeting attended by eight of them during the VAT debate. This element of co-ordination has seen them labelled as a party within a party. In numbers, they are on a par with the Ulster Unionists which, with nine MPs, is the fourth largest party in the House of Commons. But as a force, they have little in common other than their hardline Euroscepticism. They are a disparate group: Sir Teddy Taylor is an engaging former Glasgow Herald journalist, with an encyclopaedic knowledge of EU spending, if not of some more pedestrian concerns (he once told a Sunday newspaper that he thought Ikea, the enormously successful Swedish furniture retailer, was a cocktail). Mrs Teresa Gorman is Westminster's vivacious version of Essex Woman - the brash and gaudy stereotype; Mr Richard Shepherd is painfully earnest; Mr Michael Carttiss is a ferociously independent East Anglian labourer's son with a complexion as ruddy as a sugar beet farmer's; Mr John Wilkinson, a former flying instructor, is energetic, but intense; Mr Christopher Gill is the soft-spoken chairman of a family sausage-making company; Mr Tony Marlow is a parliamentary thug, who exudes great personal animosity towards Mr Major; Mr Nicholas Budgen is a slight, Cambridge-educated barrister with a devastatingly dry wit, who, alone of the nine, supported the government in Tuesday's vote; and Sir Richard Body is a maverick agriculture specialist - reputedly the original Old Muckspreader in Private Eye - who supported the government in the Europe vote, but then resigned from the parliamentary party. Westminster wags have suggested that these MPs should perhaps be given a room to set up their own whips' office, if they are going to behave like a separate party. But the group is not so much a party within a party as a minority within a minority. By choosing to defy Prime Minister John Major's decision to make the European vote an issue of confidence, the rebels confirmed that the 30 or so hard-core Eurosceptics, who came so close to blocking the UK's ratification of the Maastricht treaty, have splintered into three factions. The first group decided months ago not to make trouble over the EU finance bill in the interests of party unity. The second fell into line when the confidence card was played. But the remaining Group of Nine apparently had such an aversion to earmarking more funds for the EU budget that it was prepared to risk triggering a general election. This recklessness risks undermining not only Mr Major's leadership, which the rebels might regard as a bonus, but also the Tory party's prospects of winning the next general election, due by mid-1997. It has reinforced the impression, already forming after last month's climbdown on Post Office privatisation, that ministers are powerless to push through their agenda. Even with the support of the rebels, Mr Major can muster an overall majority of just 14. When the opposition unites, it therefore takes just eight Tory troublemakers to disrupt the government's plans. Backbenchers are becoming adept at exploiting this. One minister this week referred to this state of affairs as 'government by clique'. The rebels' actions have also caused division within the party over the best way of handling the group. Rightwingers have called on Mr Major to readmit the nine to the parliamentary party as quickly as possible. But the whips' office is sore at what it sees as the rebels vindictiveness in signalling that they would support the government and then changing their minds. 'They could have started bridge-building on Tuesday,' snapped one business manager. The rebels seem to be taking the view that being ejected from the parliamentary party leaves them free to judge issues on their merits. But the party leadership has indicated that they must show clear and consistent support for the government in order to be accepted back. For the moment then, there is stalemate. This might not matter because the government's 1994-95 legislative programme seems to contain little more that is controversial - with the possible exception of the parts of the finance bill implementing the Budget. Meanwhile, there is some confusion over what the rebels are trying to achieve. Mr Marlow says the group is motivated by the belief that the party cannot be re-elected without a policy on Europe with which 'people can feel at ease'. But the Tory party's centre of gravity on Europe appears to be shifting. If Mr Major's recent hint at a possible referendum on European integration was hardened into a commitment, it would do much to allay the misgivings of the 100 or so mainstream Tory Eurosceptics. If the Group of Nine did not fall into line at that point, they would be widely dismissed as rebels without a cause.</p>

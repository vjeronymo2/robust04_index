			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Contracts of Pounds 150m for John Brown JOHN BROWN Engineering yesterday announced contracts totalling Pounds 150m for power station equipment in Oman and Britain, James Buxton writes. The Trafalgar House subsidiary is to extend and modify a power station and water distilling plant at Ghubrah in Oman by adding a 250MW gas turbine generation plant. The company, which is based at Clydebank near Glasgow, said it won the contract against strong international competition because it was able to complete the order before the heavy summer demand for electricity in 1995. The Omani order accounts for about two-thirds of the Pounds 150m total. John Brown also won an order for the design and full turnkey construction of a combined heat and power plant for Grovehurst Energy, a company jointly owned by UK Paper and St Regis Paper, for the supply of power to three paper mills in Kent.</p>

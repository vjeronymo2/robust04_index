			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts lurch lower after auction disappointment Most European bond markets drifted lower in a narrow range yesterday, remaining in the thrall of US Treasuries, where all eyes are on tomorrow's release of third-quarter GDP data. New supply in the UK, German and US markets, amid continued investor abstinence, also damped market sentiment. UK gilts weakened on the day, with the December long gilt futures contract on Liffe shedding  7/16 point to 99 9/32 . Prices lurched lower after the Bank of England announced the results of the auction of Pounds 2.5bn 8 per cent gilts due 2000. The biggest disappointment was the fact that the auction was only 1.2 times covered  - the lowest bid-to-cover ratio this year, and well below the 1.5 to 1.75 cover most market participants had forecast. The tail - the difference between the highest and the average accepted yield - was in line with forecasts at two basis points. Dealers were also disappointed that 93 per cent of the bids were allocated at the lowest accepted price of 96.01, yielding 8.84 per cent. The highest accepted price was 96.24. Dealers cited various explanations for the disappointing result. 'This is not an area favoured by overseas investors, who prefer the 10-year sector,' said Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets. UK life insurers and pension funds, which tend to go for longer maturities to match their long-term liabilities, also showed little interest in the issue, said one dealer. Increased fears of another near-term tightening in UK interest rates also put a damper on the auction's performance, said another dealer. Moreover, 'the Bank has issued a lot of tranchettes and the market has had to absorb a lot of supply in recent weeks,' said Mr Adam Chester, economist at Yamaichi International. 'This, on top of the previous supply, tipped the balance against the market.' German bonds ended the day slightly lower, but bund futures staged a smart rally in after-hours trading on remarks by Bundesbank vice-president Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum. He cautioned against inferring too quickly that a change in the terms for the Bundesbank's weekly securities repurchase agreements signalled a shift in interest rate policy. This sparked speculation that the Bundesbank will soon revert to variable-rate repos, its favoured way of conducting open-market operations, after 14 weeks of fixed-rate repos, paving the way for lower short-term interest rates. US Treasury bond prices back-tracked yesterday despite marginally favourable economic news, after the market failed to follow through on a well-received supply auction during the afternoon. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/16 at 93 5/8 , with the yield rising to 8.06 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 15/16 , to yield 6.892 per cent. Bonds on the long end opened firmer while the short end held steady, thanks to a mildly encouraging reading on durable goods last month. The Commerce Department reported that factory orders had risen 0.1 per cent in September, after a big gain the previous month. However, the market made scant progress on the data, with most traders braced for the year's sixth boost in short-term interest rates sometime next month. In addition, many were concerned that Friday's estimate of third-quarter GDP would suggest the economy was accelerating as it entered the year's final leg. Bonds across the board were hovering close to opening values until early afternoon, despite another poor performance by the dollar and an unsettling upturn in commodity prices. The damage came on the heels of the Treasury's auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. Although the previous day's sale of two-year notes had generated tepid demand, yesterday's auction drew fairly good interest among dealers and retail accounts. The issue was awarded at a lower yield than had been expected. But prices stumbled soon afterwards. With cautiousness prevailing ahead of GDP data coming out at the end of the week, bonds could not build any forward momentum in the wake of the well-bid auction. Russia's first issue of 12-month zero-coupon Treasury bills yielded an average of 450.05 per cent at auction, according to the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, Reuter reports. The finance ministry set the minimum price at 22.56 per cent of par while dealers' bids ranged from 9 to 50 per cent. Demand was for Rbs274.3bn against Rbs200bn on offer, but only Rbs60.5bn worth of the paper - 30.25 per cent of the issue - sold.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Gnutti Satisfied With Revised Steel </F> Plan"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 16 -- Industry Minister Vito  Gnutti on Thursday [16 June] said he was "fairly satisfied" with  the conditions set by the European Commission for the approval  of a revised restructuring plan for the steel industry.    "We must still define some points," Gnutti said after  meeting  the European competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, adding:  "There are no particular problems, it's a question of setting  times" for application of the agreement.    The European Commission yesterday came up with a new plan  allowing the Italian government to give steel companies 415  million ECUs (493.5 million dollars) to finance production  cutbacks through plant closings. Gnutti said his talks with Van  Miert were going very well and that the Rome government may  approve the plan and set aside the funds at tomorrow's cabinet  meeting.    The plan, which was declared all but dead last month, would  have Italy to reduce its production by some five to six million  [metric] tons, allowing the EU [European Union] to near its goal  of reducing overall capacity production by 19 million tons.  The plan will have to be approved by EU industry ministers who  will meet in Brussels next Wednesday.</p>

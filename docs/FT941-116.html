			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Observer: Hillary hitback 'We interrupt this newspaper to give you the facts,' read the full-page advertisement emblazoned in the New York Times. It cost Dollars 50,000; but the 100 who signed it, defending Hillary Rodham Clinton, clearly thought it a bargain. It was largely the handiwork of two Washington Democratic party consultants, Ann Lewis and Lynn Cutler, First Lady friends. They are also hitting the airwaves - where Hillary-bashing is most prevalent  -to launch a counter-attack, fighting the hands they perceive behind the attacks: those wanting to block healthcare reform, and those on the ideological right who want to put women back in the non-career closet. Otherwise, life as normal. The Wall Street Journal's leader writers continue fulminating over Whitewater. Yesterday they examined Hillary's successful foray into the commodities markets in 1978-79, complaining she pursued the kind of speculative greed which characterised the 1980s. Perhaps Hillary should have deliberately lost money in order to satisfy her critics.</p>

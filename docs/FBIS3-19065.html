			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special  coordinator on Cyprus, repeated that both sides are negotiating  seriously and constructively on the proposals for the  confidence-building measures. However, he expressed the view  that one cannot speak of significant progress in the  negotiations. Speaking after a meeting with President Glavkos  Kliridhis this morning, Lamb noted that even the people who  oppose aspects of the confidence-building measures should  realize that the proposals for the measures are a reality and  that these proposals are on the negotiating table. Responding  to a question, though, on the end-of-March deadline for  conclusion of an agreement on the confidence-building measures,  Lamb was unclear about maintaining it. He said that the  procedure must advance quickly but with care. Time, he noted,  is an important aspect but all should feel comfortable in the  negotiations and there should be no feeling that the process  moves hastily. The target, Lamb said, is not so much the  deadline but for progress in the procedure as quickly as  possible.</p>

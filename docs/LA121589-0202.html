			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> CHANCE SPAWNED WRITER GAGE  </P> <P> Author Nicholas Gage says his writing skills were unleashed in a chance  encounter with a salty-tongued teacher when he was a struggling, 13-year-old  refugee.  </P> <P> Gage writes in the Dec. 17 issue of Parade magazine how as a seventh-grader he  met Marjorie Hurd Rabidou in Worcester, Mass.  </P> <P> Told to choose a hobby, Gage said he "decided to follow the prettiest girl in  my class -- the blue-eyed daughter of the local Lutheran minister."  </P> <P> "She led me through the door marked 'Newspaper Club' and into the presence of  Miss Hurd, the newspaper adviser and English teacher who would become my mentor  and my muse."  </P> <P> Gage wrote an essay for the school paper about his mother, who was killed by  Communists during the Greek civil war. Hurd sent it to the Freedoms Foundation  in Valley Forge, Pa., where it won a medal.  </P> <P> Gage was a reporter for The New York Times and later recorded his mother's life  and death in the book "Eleni," and his father's story in "A Place for Us."  </P></p>

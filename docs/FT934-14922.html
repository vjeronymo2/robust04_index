			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Fighting fire with fire - US tobacco groups are under attack Faced with vocal anti-smoking lobbies and a revenue-hungry administration, the US tobacco industry has long had reason to hone its marketing skills. Arguably they are needed now as never before. The latest threat to the sector is the proposal for a federal tax of up to Dollars 1 (65p) a pack, a central part of the Clinton health plan. On top of this, one of the sector's most compelling advertising figures - R. J. Reynolds' Joe Camel - stands accused by the Coalition on Smoking or Health of enticing young people to smoke. The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing a request to ban him. All this comes on top of 'Marlboro Friday', the day in April when Philip Morris took the battle to its competitors by cutting the price of its Marlboro brand by 40 cents. The biggest change for manufacturers has been the switch to 'generic' cigarettes, which hold no brand value and sell cheaply. To the dismay of the cigarette companies, generic cigarettes now hold about 38 per cent of the market. With margins and brand share under attack cigarette manufacturers are relying increasingly on techniques such as direct mail to reach their potential clients. The leading US cigarette companies have compiled large databases on smokers, and target potential customers by sending free packs through the post. Another development has been the increased use of cigarette catalogue 'clubs'. Every pack of Marlboro purchased, for instance, contains a redeemable 'green stamp'. By accumulating sufficient stamps, customers can purchase anything from binoculars to lighters. 'First, smokers are induced to smoke more of that particular brand. Second, once they have the products, such as a tee shirt with Marlboro written on it, they become walking advertisements for the company,' says Edward Mally, a tobacco analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York. Another effective promotional technique has been R. J. Reynolds' introduction of a 'flavour seal' in its Winston packs. Made of polyester film, the seals have boosted market share of the brand by capitalising on the cigarettes' freshness. Advertising - which has seen its share of total advertising/promotion expenditure fall from about a third five years ago to 20 per cent today  - has not completely lost its effectiveness. The Marlboro man is one of the most widely recognised advertising symbols. Two years ago researchers at the Medical College of Georgia found that children between the ages of three and five were as familiar with Joe Camel, the cartoon figure representing Camel cigarettes, as they were with Mickey Mouse. Cigarette companies still evade bans on television and radio advertising, by sponsoring sports events and purchasing billboard space at televised events. The anti-smoking forces, though, are now are producing sophisticated television commercials themselves. Growing numbers of advertising vehicles are refusing to promote cigarettes. Houston and New York, for instance, have banned them from public transport. The anti-smoking lobby is also gaining success in curbing cigarette marketing aimed at women and minorities.</p>

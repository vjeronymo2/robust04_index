			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Italy embarrassed by leak of plans for privatisation MR Giuliano Amato, Italy's prime minister, has called in magistrates to investigate the leak of a highly confidential draft document outlining the government's privatisation plans just days before they are due to be delivered to parliament. The proposals, revealed on an Italian news agency on Thursday evening, suggest that Ina, the big state-owned insurance company, and Banca Commerciale Italiana, controlled by the IRI state holding company, could be privatised next year, along with a number of smaller holdings. Other companies on the list include Italtel, the IRI-owned telephone equipment group, and IRI's stake in Banca di Roma, now Italy's biggest bank in terms of branches. The plan also envisages sales of government holdings in a variety of industries, such as food, retailing and telecommunications, where it recommends the retention of minority stakes and guaranteed control, possibly through a 'golden share'. Sales or international alliances for some other, unspecified state-owned companies which are in poorer financial shape will have to await further restructuring, according to the plan. The privatisation document has been prepared by a team of six eminent bankers and economists, backed up by two top civil servants in the treasury. After being submitted to Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, the plans were sent to Mr Amato, and circulated to the budget and industry ministers. The leak, which is widely regarded as accurate, is an acute embarrassment to the government. In spite of some limited leaks earlier this week, it has managed to keep the lid on the privatisation proposals. Leaking the proposals, which are much more specific than originally expected, has already upset many executives of state-owned companies, who have been surprised to find themselves on the privatisation list. Consob, the country's stock market and companies watchdog, has also intervened, as many of the companies concerned are already partly quoted. Yesterday share prices of many of the companies concerned rose sharply. Mr Amato is expected to meet Mr Barucci, Mr Franco Reviglio, the budget minister, and Mr Giuseppe Guarino, the industry minister, for urgent talks today, before discussion of the proposals in cabinet next week. Barring further upsets, the document should be ready for parliament by the government's November 14 deadline. According to the plan, the sales should reduce the budget deficit by L7,000bn (Pounds 3.2bn) in 1993 and L20,000bn in 1994-1995. The privatisation proposals were immediately criticised by Italy's three trade union federations because of feared job losses and a lack of consultation. They also attacked the way the information was leaked. The leak has also rekindled speculation of sharp differences between ministers about privatisation. Mr Guarino is believed to be particularly unhappy about elements of the plan and to have revived his now discredited concept of creating a 'superholding' company to control public-sector holdings as an alternative proposal. The government has maintained that no action will be taken before the document has been debated fully in parliament. World Stock Markets, Page 23</p>

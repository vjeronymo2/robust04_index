"And I've had some good teams."  </P> <P> Cooper's career mark stands at 400-197, but it took a six-run rally in the  sixth for Hoover (3-0) to wipe out a 2-1 deficit.  </P> <P> Eight Hoover starters hit safely, including David Berkey, who was two for  three. Berkey recorded his first save in relief of Bryan Day (1-0), who pitched  five innings.  </P> <P> In other nonleague games:  </P> <P> St. Genevieve 8, Palmdale 2 -- Roland De La Maza scattered five hits and struck  out 12 at Branford Park. De La Maza (2-1) struck out seven in a row during the  first, second and third innings and had 12 in the first five innings.  </P> <P> De La Maza, who struck out 21 batters in a 10-inning victory over Palmdale last  year, has 31 strikeouts in 16 innings.  </P> <P> Royal 5, Murphy 4 -- Dennis Gildehauf scored from third base, breaking a 4-4  tie in the bottom of the eighth, when Murphy shortstop Larry Bator booted a  Steve Bernstein ground ball.

Hart will play host to El Segundo at 11 this morning.  </P> <P> Crespi 6, Millikan 5 -- Chris Romero singled to score Tim Weir and cap a  four-run Crespi rally in the seventh. That wiped out a four-run seventh by  Millikan, which parlayed a walk and four singles into four runs.  </P> <P> In the Crespi seventh, Scott Barton and Mark D'Antonio hit back-to-back one-out  singles, scoring Don Calabria. Back-to-back walks accounted for another run,  and D'Antonio scored when Andy MacDonald reached base on a fielder's choice.  After an intentional walk to John Dempsey, Romero singled to end the game.  </P> <P> Crespi (2-1-1) will play at Banning at 11 this morning for 13th place.  </P> <P> El Segundo 9, Westlake 8 -- Mike Lieberthal of Westlake hit a grand slam in the  fourth inning, but Westlake (2-2) surrendered three runs in the seventh to lose  at Westlake in a game marred by nine errors by each team.  </P> <P> With Westlake trailing, 9-7, in the bottom of the seventh, the Warriors loaded  the bases. Matt McHendry whacked a fly to center to score a run, but Mike Eby  was picked off first to end the game.  </P> <P> Westlake's Tim Falsken was two for three with a double. Lieberthal had five  RBIs, the other coming on a sacrifice fly.

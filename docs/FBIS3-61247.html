			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Igor Turyansky, ambassador extraordinary and </F> plenipotentiary of Ukraine to Turkey, by Valentina Pisanskaya;  place and date not given: "Bid Farewell to Illusions Once and  for All..."]    [Text] I met Igor Turyansky, ambassador extraordinary  and plenipotentiary of Ukraine to Turkey, at the beginning of  the regular Kiev-Istanbul-Kiev flight made by the Avialiniya  Ukrainy company.    Igor Mefodyevich was glad to grant an interview to  GOLOS UKRAINY.    [Pisanskaya] We have heard about the "Turkish miracle"--the  economic reforms which, if they have not transformed this not  very rich country into a civilized paradise, have at least led  its citizens onto the path of abundance. And indeed even with a  brief acquaintance with Turkey one is struck by its immense  commercial market. It would probably be logical for Ukraine to  arrange economic relations with this neighbor of ours as quickly  as possible.    [Turyansky] As logical as it gets... And I understood this  the first day I worked here: The immense prospects for economic  cooperation are practically not being realized, mainly because  of the passivity of Ukrainian entrepreneurs. But the Turks are  extremely efficient people. For them their word is like law. If  we have discussed some proposal on the telephone in the morning,  in the evening a fax of a joint agreement is sure to arrive.  They have an excellent understanding of our difficulties and are  trying to help. But we, unfortunately, are not prepared to  accept this help. And we are unprepared at the very highest  levels.    [Pisanskaya] And is Turkey prepared to cooperate?    [Turyansky] Yes. Business people here are well aware that  Ukraine is renowned for its metallurgical industry, coal, and  sugar. These are traditional items in our exports and the Turks  are interested in them. And it would not hurt Ukraine to have  the consumer goods which are plentiful in Turkey. Moreover, the  Turks are excellent builders and cooperation is possible here as  well.    [Pisanskaya] Have there been any concrete proposals from  Turkish enterprises?    [Turyansky] Of course. But they are being realized extremely  unsatisfactorily. For instance, in May a Turkish company  proposed to invest $50 million in Ukraine. Within two days I had  sent the documented information to Kiev. And what do you think  happened? Specialists from the Eksimbank did not arrive for  negotiations until the end of October...    [Pisanskaya] It took Turkey 13 years to carry out its  reforms. What do you think--will it take Ukraine just as long?    [Turyansky] Ukraine does not have that possibility. We are  so  far behind in our development that we have to make haste. And to  do this we must say farewell to our illusions once and for all.  We must have patience and build partnership relations with the  surrounding world.    [Pisanskaya] What part of Turkey's experience in economic  reform may be used by Ukraine?    [Turyansky] I would put the question differently. The now  late president of Turkey, Turgut Ozal, during my meeting with  him named several factors that are keeping Ukraine from moving  forward. They include, first, the dependency on a single source  of energy. He was convinced that energy sources must be  diversified. And he gave an example: At the beginning of the  reforms Turkey was unable to cover the cost of imported energy  sources with exports--this took 120 percent of them. Now Turkey  is paying for its energy sources with just 18 percent of its  exports.    Second, Ukraine is still not relying on small and  medium-sized enterprises. Is it really so difficult to  understand that if a person has something of his own he does not  have time to wave flags and banners and he will no longer have  to take it away from someone else?    Incidentally, in the sphere of services and trade the Turks  work from 0700 until 2300. They are aware that each client means  a kopek in their pockets.    [Pisanskaya] You tell me about the great prospects for  Ukrainian-Turkish cooperation, and yet it has already turned out  that our politicians and entrepreneurs have been and still are  oriented more toward Western countries...    [Turyansky] You see, it is not so much that they have been  oriented that way as that they have been expecting that the West  will help us, give us something. This is a mistake. It is  possible to give, but only a little.    Relations with Turkey are no panacea either, but it is  extremely advantageous partner and, the most important thing, it  is interested in cooperation, and we are linked by excellent sea  transportation arteries. Regular air communications have now  been opened up. But for now we are losing great opportunities  for cooperation. It is already uncomfortable to look in the eyes  of Turkish entrepreneurs who, on my recommendations, are  traveling to Ukraine and returning from there with empty hands  without even having found any interest in their proposals.    [Pisanskaya] But there are lively communications with bazaar  merchants--the so-called wild financial-trade tourism. Is there  a problem with this?    [Turyansky] There is. Each year about a half million people  travel from Ukraine to Turkey--to buy some things and to sell  some things. I thought that everything had already been shipped  from Ukraine to Poland. It turns out that this is not the case.  Hammers, nails, watches, cigarettes--you can see everything in  the Turkish bazaars. And even when our compatriots are guests  they sometimes act as though they are at home, and sometimes so  rudely that it is difficult for the embassy to straighten things  out. Some people lose their passports and money, others have  them stolen, and others connive to save money on their ticket  home. There are also those who bring in contraband and violate  customs rules. There are now 15 citizens of Ukraine serving time  in Turkish jails.    But the telephones in the embassy are never quiet and the  doors never close for other reasons as well--the entrepreneurs  of Turkey are trying to set up relations with us. I believe that  this interest will serve both countries for a long time to come.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / People: Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs has been operating in the UK equity market for over seven years and has recently been expanding its coverage of specific sectors by hiring top-rated analysts such as Neil Blackley, Capel's former media analyst. However, until now it has not had a general UK equity strategist to pull together the recommendations of its various sector specialists. Goldman Sachs has appointed Andrew Bevan, 37, as its senior international bond economist. Bevan, who joins from Bear Stearns, fills the slot left vacant earlier this year when Jeremy Hale followed David Morrison to Tiger Fund Management, a US-based hedge fund. Michel Plantevin, formerly md/senior partner of the Paris office of Bain &amp; Co, has been appointed an executive director and head of Goldman Sach's strategic advisory group in Europe.</p>

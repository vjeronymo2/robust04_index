			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, May 23 (AFP) -- At least 10 pro-democracy  activists were arrested in Lagos Monday [23 May] during voting  for a constitutional conference proposed by the military regime,  a human rights group said.    The detainees included Tokunbo Afikuyomi, a special  assistant  to foreign minister Babagana Kingibe, Bola Tinubu, a former  senator, and Olusegun Maiyegun, a former president of the Lagos  University students' union, the Committee for the Defence of  Human Rights said.    It added that on Sunday in Port Harcourt, the capital of  southeastern Rivers state, a minority rights advocate, Ken Saro-  Wiwa, was also arrested. Press reports said he was arrested in  connection with four murders.    A former president of an association of Nigerian authors, he  was to have taken part in Monday's election as a representative  of the Ogoni people, a minority group in the state. They have  over the years complained of marginalisation and fraud by oil  companies operating there.    In another statement, Beko Ransome-Kuti, the national  chairman of the Campaign for Democracy, an umbrella grouping of  about 40 pro- democracy and human rights organisations,  commended Nigerians for what he called their boycott of the  election.    The boycott, he said, was the "unanimous verdict" of all  Nigerians that a successful election would remain a "mirage"  until the results of last year's vote, annulled by the military,  are released.    Now that Nigerians have boycotted Monday's election, he  urged  the regime of General Sani Abacha to resign by May 31 to avert  "a national catastrophe."</p>

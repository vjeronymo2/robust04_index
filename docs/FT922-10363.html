			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Wharf hotels offshoot in HKDollars 593m rights issue HARBOUR Centre Development, the listed hotel subsidiary of Hong Kong's Wharf Group, announced a rights issue to raise HKDollars 593m (Dollars 76m) before costs. The proceeds will be used to finance the recent acquisition of two 5-star hotels in the US and to build up a war chest for further hotel purchases. Harbour Centre, part of the empire of the late shipping tycoon Sir Yue-kong Pao, is to offer one new share for every two held, at HKDollars 5.65. This represents a 36 per cent discount to last night's closing price of HKDollars 8.80. The company said it believed the hotel market in the US offered excellent value, with properties selling at discounts of up to 40 per cent to their pre-recession valuations. Within the past five months, Harbour Centre has invested USDollars 86m in the purchase of the Omni Houston Hotel and the Marriott Mandalay hotel in Dallas. The company is confident these offer significant capital appreciation potential. Wharf (Holdings), which owns 57 per cent of Harbour Centre, has agreed to take up its share of the rights issue. Wharf owns the Omni hotel management group, which will take over management of the newly-acquired hotel in Dallas.</p>

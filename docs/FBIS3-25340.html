Mr. de Klerk was speaking at a news  conference in Pretoria a short while ago. Johan Claasen reports:    [Begin recording] [Claasen] According to Mr. de Klerk the  refusal by certain political groups to participate in the  elections could theoretically lead to a postponement. He does  believe, however, that support for an election on the 27 April  is sufficient to assure that it will take place. He called on  all parties to register for the elections as soon as possible.  He said that even though time is extremely limited there is  still room for negotiation.    [De Klerk, in English] Practicality suggests that we are now  talking merely about reaching agreements within a few days, at  the most a week, and calling Parliament together rather soon.    [Claasen] Referring to the demands of King Goodwill  Zwelithini, Mr. de Klerk says there will be definite proposals  on the table on Thursday, which hopefully, will be acceptable to  the king.

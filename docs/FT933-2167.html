			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Poland's ex-communists seek partners POLAND'S politicians yesterday began a search for government coalition partners in the wake of Sunday's election victory by the former communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) which won a fifth of the votes and more than one third of the seats in the lower house of parliament. Preliminary results put the farmers PSL movement into second place, with a 15 per cent share of the vote. This party, which collaborated with the communists in the post-war years, is the dominant force in rural areas where 40 per cent of Poland's voters live and work. Final results giving a breakdown of the 460 seats are expected tomorrow and it is then that President Lech Walesa will name a party leader to form the next government. He has already stated that he will choose the largest single party, although he has no constitutional obligation to do so. Yesterday Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the 39-year-old leader of the SLD said that he was 'elastic' about possible talks with coalition partners. But he made no secret of the fact he would prefer to work in the next government with the Democratic Union (UD), a mainstream Solidarity-based party which won only 10.5 per cent of the vote. According to one western banker in Warsaw, a coalition between the UD and the SLD would provide guarantees 'that privatisation would continue, maybe in a slightly different form with possibly a greater accent on employee buy outs'. The rural-based PSL is regarded as the most suspicious of privatisation. Leaders of the UD met last night to discuss their next move. Earlier in the day, however, many reacted to the initial election results with talk of going into opposition and leaving responsibility for the next government in the hands of the PSL and the SLD. Poles in general yesterday greeted the news of the victory by parties with a communist past calmly and foreign exchange vendors reported no signs of a rush to purchase currency in response to fears of higher inflation. Demand remained strong on the Warsaw stock exchange, albeit at a lower price level.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           POLISH ELECTIONS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lower house: 460 seats  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Results forecast*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Party                             % of      Seats     1991 vote                                   vote**              and seats  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Left Democratic Alliance (SLD)    20.6       173       12.0%/58 Polish Peasants Party (PSL)       15.2       128        8.7%/49 Democratic Union (UD)             10.5        69       12.3%/57 Union of Labour (UP)               7.3        42        5.0%/26 Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN)           5.7        24        7.5%/46 Non-party Movement for Supporting Reform (BBWR)           5.4        20            ***  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Partial official results and Polish television forecasts. **Parties with less than 5 per cent of the vote cannot hold seats. ***Party did not exist.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

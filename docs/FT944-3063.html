			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Charities to get tax plan exclusion The government yesterday promised to alter the finance bill to exclude charities and their subsidiaries from provisions announced in the Budget to close a loophole used by some foreign companies with subsidiaries in the UK, Jim Kelly writes. Charities expressed their concern after the Budget that they appeared to be caught by the provisions and could face big tax bills as a result of new rules on 'thin capitalisation'. Under the new rules UK subsidiaries would no longer be able to avoid corporation tax by using profits to make interest payments. These have not previously been taxable. The plan to tax such payments would affect UK companies only where the company receiving the interest was not paying corporation tax. Sir George Young, financial secretary to the Treasury, in a reply to a written parliamentary question, said: 'The thin capitalisation proposals were not intended to have an adverse effect on the voluntary sector.

I therefore intend amending the provision at the committee stage of the finance bill to exclude charities and their subsidiaries from its scope.'</p>

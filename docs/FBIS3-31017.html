			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav </F> Jovanovic by Richard Schneider in Belgrade; date not given:  "Solution for Bosnia Through Geneva, Not Through Bombs"]    [Text] [Schneider] Foreign Minister, the call of the world  public for military intervention against the Bosnian Serbs has  become louder than ever. Are you alarmed by that?    [Jovanovic] It is not new that the question of military  intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been made topical. For a  long time, it has been part of a tested strategy in the policies  of several Western countries. A strategy that aims at putting  psychological and political pressure on the Serbs in Bosnia,  while the need for some of these countries to offer their  services to the Islamic bloc, in order to achieve a balance in  their relations, is another element of this course of action.  At any rate, the wish for such intervention is absurd because  at present neither a basis nor a justification for it exists,  all the more so since in this civil war it is precisely the  Serbs who have had to defend themselves constantly against  attacks from the Muslim side for a relatively long time.    [Schneider] Do you not think that this sounds somewhat  cynical after the horrible massacre in Sarajevo last Saturday?    [Jovanovic] Only if the blame can be laid on the Serbs by an  objective side. But this is not the case here, which was also  confirmed by British UN General Richie after he had had a close  look at the scene. In his report to the UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] he explicitly points out that it is impossible to say  whether the shell was fired from a Serbian or a Muslim position.  As you know, the latter is said to have already happened  before, precisely before important UN resolutions or peace  negotiations, so that one could suppose that there is method in  it.    [Schneider] A Muslim from Sarajevo would probably answer you  now that UNPROFOR's attitude toward the Serbs has always been  friendly...    [Jovanovic] Therefore, I deliberately talked of an  "objective side" before. Here I mean, for example, an expert  commission consisting of Serbs, Muslims, and UNPROFOR people.  Believe me, the FRY has the greatest interest in finding and  severely punishing those who are responsible for this massacre  of innocent civilians. A criminal act like this is an infamous  blow against the general peace process and, for that reason  alone, it has to be speedily cleared up.    By that time, I can only appeal to the parties involved not  to permit any manipulation of this tragic event by politicians  or the media. Possible intervention, whatever the excuse for it  may be, would only mean more war and far less peace. The  solution for the Bosnian problem is to be pursued through the  negotiations in Geneva and not through bombs.    [Schneider] Should this course not be possible in the  foreseeable future, do you actually see the danger that the  Bosnian civil war will also spread to Macedonia or Kosovo?    [Jovanovic] The civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina might only  spread to other areas if -- to put it cautiously -- those  foreign "factors" whose interests are also otherwise involved in  this war wished it. The temporary orientation of the attention  of the public and the mass media toward Kosovo and Macedonia or,  to be more straightforward, the downright provocation of war in  these regions, could be a variant in the game of interests of  these factors.    At any rate, my country is not interested in prolonging the  civil war in Bosnia by a single day, to say nothing of spreading  it to other areas.    [Schneider] However, Zhirinovskiy's recent visit to Bosnia,  his inflammatory nationalist speeches, and the exuberant  applause of the Serbs there have again caused serious doubts in  the West about Yugoslavia's desire for peace. How do you -- to  change the subject for a moment -- assess Zhirinovskiy's success  in the election and his chances in Russia?    [Jovanovic] The rise of the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia, headed by Mr. Zhirinovskiy, is an important fact and a  special phenomenon. It is a phenomenon that requires more  profound studies and a more serious explanation than is possible  in an answer to a journalist's question. At any rate, his  chances to continue to influence his country's domestic policy  life and foreign policy will also depend on whether his party  finds the right answers to the real needs and problems of  today's Russia and how good they are.    [Schneider] Let us finally come back again to the present  Yugoslavia: Must the separate peace agreement that was recently  concluded with Croatia and that the Croatian media celebrated as  recognition not appear to the Krajina Serbs as a betrayal  because of their problems with President Tudjman?    [Jovanovic] What you call a separate peace agreement is an  agreement between the FRY and the Republic of Croatia on the  mutual opening of official representations and offices. It is  not recognition, but an important, constructive step and the  clear beginning of a normalization of the present situation,  which is to be concluded by the establishment of full diplomatic  relations.    However, as I have said: This agreement is only the  beginning of this road. It does not prejudice the solution of  the existing problems, particularly not the problem of the  Serbian Krajina. However, the agreement will certainly  facilitate the gradual solution of these problems and help to  establish peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina more quickly.    [Schneider] Foreign Minister, thank you for the interview.</p>

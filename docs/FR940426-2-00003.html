In the extraordinary event that the Borrower materially breaches its obligation to comply with this requirement, USAID reserves the right, among its other rights and remedies, to accelerate the loan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fees:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Offers should specify the placement fees and other expenses, including USAID fees, and Paying and Transfer Agent fees. Lenders are requested to include all legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses in their placement fee. Such fees and expenses shall be payable at closing from the proceeds of the loan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Closing Date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As early as practicable, but not to exceed 60 days from date of selection of lender. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Selection of investment bankers and/or lenders and the terms of the loan are initially subject to the individual discretion of the Borrower and thereafter subject to approval by USAID. Disbursements under the loan will be subject to certain conditions required of the Borrower by USAID as set forth in agreements between the USAID and the Borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The full repayment of the loans will be guaranteed by USAID. The USAID guaranty will be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America and will be issued pursuant to authority in Section 222 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the ``Act''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lenders eligible to receive the USAID guaranty are those specified in section 238(c) of the Act.

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON IRVING BRANCH LIBRARY  </P> <P> When the library administration surprised me by announcing its proposal to  abandon the Washington Irving branch library, I realized that the fight to save  the library would be an uphill battle. What I didn't anticipate was that we  would receive a death knell from The Times.  </P> <P> In the future, no coverage whatsoever would be an improvement over a  patronizing editorial statement with an unreasoned conclusion.  </P> <P> ANTON DE VEREAUX  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

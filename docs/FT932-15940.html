			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Arts: Today's Television Phil Drabble, presenter of 'One Man And His Dog', presents the first of his four-part series My Wilderness Reprieved (8.00 BBC2) about 'the future of our rural environment'. Owner of a wildlife reserve, Drabble identifies dangers which he believes may result from the countryside being exploited. Just A Gigolo is a comedy starring the ubiquitous Tony Slattery playing an out-of-work teacher who falls into the escort business (8.30 ITV). Kristin Scott Thomas stars as a reluctant nun in Body And Soul, a six-part drama starting on ITV (9.00). Released from the convent to attend her brother's funeral, she 'shows herself to be an astute business woman as she begins to take over the family mill'. Presenter David Jessel and the team who made 'Rough Justice' for the BBC have formed their own company to make similar miscarriage-of-justice programmes for Channel 4 to be called Trial And Error (9.30).</p>

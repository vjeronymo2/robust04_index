As a result, the tax revenues of the province  increased by a big margin. On the afternoon of 11 January, He  Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, went to  the provincial tax bureau to extend greetings to the bureau and  also stated that in the new year, the bureau should make  consistent efforts to achieve the reform of the tax system, make  efforts to promote production and increase revenues, and strive  to make greater achievements.    At the meeting hall of the provincial tax bureau, Comrade He  Zhukang heard the work report made by the responsible comrade of  the provincial tax bureau and also held talks with some tax  cadres.    In the past year, the tax organs at various levels and the  broad masses of tax cadres across the province conscientiously  implemented the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the  sixth provincial party congress, persistently administered the  tax affairs according to laws, strengthened the management of  tax collection, vigorously organized tax collection, positively  promoted production to increase revenues, realistically  strengthened the construction of the cadres contingents, and  better accomplished various tax revenue tasks. According to  statistics, the provincial tax department collected and handed  over to the state treasury 7.168 billion yuan of local-level  industrial and commercial taxes, showing an increase of 43.4  percent over the previous year and overfulfilling the fiscal  target of elevating the tax collection work to a new height.  The growth rate had not been seen in the past few years. The  tax management forms and the tax inspection methods were  improved. The scale of experiment with the management of tax  affairs on a commissioned basis was expanded. All this helped  promote the setup of the pattern for collection and management  of taxes suitable to the socialist market economic system. We  made noticeable achievements in consolidating the tax revenue  order. The overall front has further improved its practice and  made achievements in especially eliminating the unhealthy trends.    During the talks, the participants set forth opinions and  suggestions on installing organs, collecting and managing tax  revenues, and promoting production to increase revenues  following the implementation of the new tax system and on the  new problems that will possibly emerge.    Comrade He Zhukang wrote down what he was told. After  hearing their speeches, he pleasantly said: Our province's tax  revenue work has been good. The tax revenues steadily  increased. Particularly in 1993, the tax revenues increased by  a big margin thanks to the efforts made by the broad masses of  the tax affairs workers. On the one hand, the tax department  has vigorously increased its revenues; and on the other, it has  positively supported the local economic development. So, it has  made great contributions. It also stands in the forefront of  deepening reform and correcting the unhealthy trends within  trades. It has made many successful explorations and  accumulated many typical experiences. The provincial party  committee and the provincial government have constantly been  satisfied with the tax revenue work. On behalf of the  provincial party committee and the provincial government, I  came here today in order to extend cordial regards and heartfelt  thanks to you and also ask you to pass our regards and thanks to  the broad masses of tax workers across the province.    Comrade He Zhukang said: The 1994 reform and tax tasks are  very heavy. First, we should grasp revenues. This is of  extreme importance to ensure a sustained and fast economic  development and the implementation of a series of new reform  measures. Second, we should achieve the reform of the tax  system and ensure the implementation of the new tax system. We  should strengthen study and propaganda to have the tax workers,  the personages of all social circles, and the broad masses of  the people to accurately understand and support this reform. We  have to do a lot of work to implement the new tax system and to  exert great efforts to do our work well from the beginning of  the year. The next-step work will easily be done when we  achieve the work of the first year. Otherwise, there will be  more difficulties. We should conscientiously conduct  investigations and study when coming across with the problems in  the course of implementing the new tax system and explore  methods for solving the problems cropping up in the course of  practice. Simultaneously, we should timely report to the higher  levels and ask their instructions so as to reasonably solve  problems. The reform of the tax system is a matter relating to  not only the tax departments but also the party committees and  governments at various levels. Therefore, the party committees  and governments at various levels should go all out to support  the reform of the tax system to ensure the smooth progress of  this reform.    Comrade He Zhukang stressed: As a key economic lever, the  tax collection work plays a better role in macroeconomic  regulation and control. Therefore, strengthening the  macroeconomic regulation and control plays a proper role in  setting up the socialist market economic system. Great changes  will take place after implementing the new tax system. Some  problems have not been expected. Particularly, we should  urgently study methods to solve the problems relating to the  existence and development of a large number of town and township  enterprises and small-scale tax payers. Some of the existing  macroeconomic regulation and control methods are not suitable  any more. Thus, the tax departments are required to become a  new actor as soon as possible, readjust its work ideology,  boldly explore ways and methods for macroeconomic regulation and  control under the new system, and strive to promote a sound  development of the economy.    Comrade He Zhukang said: After the reform of the tax system,  the tax organ should be divided into two bureaus, such as state  tax bureau and local tax bureau. However, their goal still  remains unchanged. That is, they should better promote the  development of reform and the economy. Both state and local tax  bureaus are very important. We should foster the idea of  "taking the whole country into account." We should consult and  coordinate with one another if there are problems, proceed from  the overall situation, and make concerted efforts to achieve the  tax revenue work.    Comrade He Zhukang concluded: Today, the participants set  forth many good opinions and suggestions on the tax revenue  work. From now on, we hope that you will be able to put  forward, at any time, your own opinions and suggestions on the  work of the provincial party committee and the provincial  government and on the local economic development. The party  committees and governments at various levels should pay high  attention to your opinions and suggestions to ceaselessly  improve their work.    Present at the talks were responsible comrades of the  relevant departments of the provincial party committee and the  provincial government.</p>

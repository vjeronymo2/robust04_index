			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: 20% pay rise for Carlton chairman Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, was paid more than Pounds 630,000 last year, an increase of just under 20 per cent. Mr Green, who is in the process of becoming one of the most powerful people in UK television following Carlton's agreed takeover of Central, received only a 3.5 per cent increase on his basic salary. The overall package included a bonus of Pounds 207,000 linked to the company's earnings per share record. This compared with a bonus of only Pounds 120,000 last time. The Carlton chairman and joint founder earned twice as much as the next highest paid directors. Three directors, presumably including Ms June de Moller, group managing director, and Mr Nigel Walmsley, chief executive of Carlton Television, earned between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 315,000 in 1993. In the annual report, published yesterday, Mr Green wrote of a significant year for the company, with turnover increasing to Pounds 1.09bn and pre-tax profits to Pounds 126.1m. He emphasised that together Carlton and Central make up the largest part of the ITV network with 30 per cent of ITV advertising revenue and broadcasting to 36 per cent of the UK population.</p>

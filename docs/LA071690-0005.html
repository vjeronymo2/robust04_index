			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KAIFU IS QUITE RIGHT TO WORRY  </P> <P> Japan has an image problem. Even Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu admits to it.  </P> <P> In Atlanta last week, Kaifu announced an initiative aimed at shoring up Japan's  sagging image among grass-roots Americans. Although his "Communication  Improvement Initiative" lacked specifics, Kaifu said programs, such as Japanese  language classes for Americans, would be developed to advance "true mutual  understanding." Japan has succeeded in selling Toyotas, Walkmans and  videocassette recorders to Americans, but will they buy a new image?  </P> <P> Polls reveal that while most Americans are friendly toward Japan, they are  increasingly worried about Japanese investment here and are less hospitable  toward it. Sadly, among some U.S. minorities, Japan is perceived as racist.  </P> <P> Such attitudes have unleashed new xenophobia toward Japan. The widespread  popularity of such sentiments is reflected in books, movies and even in  advertisements that pit American interests against Japanese. And some of this  animosity against the Japanese smacks of racism, too.  </P> <P> To some extent, Japan's economic success drives home our own failure to balance  the books. The huge federal deficit is aggravated by a $49-billion trade  deficit with Japan that many Americans attribute in part to Japan's  unwillingness to open its markets. For its part, Japan has worked hard to  defuse the volatility in U.S.-Japan relations. It is the No. 1 foreign buyer of  U.S. securities and agriculture. The nation recently agreed to a massive  increase in public spending and market-opening measures in trade talks with the  United States. Since last fall, "corporate good citizenship" has been the buzz  phrase among Japanese executives in the States who are contributing millions to  American charities.  </P> <P> But it will take more than donations and language lessons to polish Japan's  image. Japan, for example, needs to open its rice market and make it easier for  U.S. retailers to open stores in Japan. The truth is that Japan's problem isn't  only one of image but of reality as well. Kaifu was wise to address it. It  won't go away easily.  </P></p>

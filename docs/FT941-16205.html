			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Global investors move in to take profits Some of the world's favourite equity markets were shaken last week, the odd laggard reviving as strategists switched allegiance, and investors took profits after the record breaking end to last year. Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore showed falls of 6.9, 5.9 and 2.5 per cent respectively and, in Europe, Germany lost 2.1 per cent and Italy 4.1 per cent in local currency terms, as measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices. The outstanding gain, in sheer size if not in percentage terms, was the 2.8 per cent in Japan. In Asia, these falls have to be seen in perspective. Malaysia and Hong Kong scored local currency gains of 133 and 120 per cent in 1993, and even Singapore put up a rise of 69 per cent, so there was ample scope for profit-taking. Strategists, meanwhile, were incisive. After gains of 17.6 per cent in the World Index, and 40 per cent in Europe ex the UK last year, Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley reduced his global and European model portfolio equity weightings from 47 to 44, and from 45 to 43 per cent. 'For the first time in a year,' he said, 'we are now overweight in cash in both portfolios . . . we continue to believe that markets are driven mainly by liquidity and have now reached unsustainably optimistic levels.' At Nomura, Mr Nicholas Knight took a three to six months look at Asian markets and reversed last year's downgrading of Japan, increasing its weight from 15 to 22 per cent via reductions in Australia, Canada and Hong Kong. Europe, excluding the UK, was downgraded from 15 to 8 per cent by Mr Albert Edwards of Kleinwort Benson, who also lifted the Japan allocation, from 30 to 42 per cent in this case. Mr Edwards thinks that US short term rates are set to rise sharply, bringing to an end the rallies in global markets led by US liquidity. Last week, Italy saw more bad news about corruption and political uncertainty ahead of the vote of confidence scheduled for tomorrow. However, the country's economic performance has improved markedly over the past six months and Mr James Cornish, European strategist at NatWest Securities, is maintaining a watching brief on the market: 'If Italy had total political stability, no corruption and no Mafia, it would certainly be a buy,' he said yesterday.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    % change   % change                  % change in local currency*      sterling* in US Dlrs*             ------------------------------------------------------------             1 Week   4 Weeks     1 Year  Start of  Start of   Start of                                              1993      1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +0.39     +4.25     +45.60    +42.42    +34.62     +32.52 Belgium      +1.47     +4.32     +33.88    +34.69    +26.35     +24.38 Denmark      +2.69     +7.38     +42.43    +47.70    +39.65     +37.49 Finland      +6.27     +7.96     +87.84   +108.24    +92.20     +89.23 France       +2.12     +6.01     +30.82    +30.49    +24.17     +22.23 Germany      -2.05     +1.85     +41.48    +41.56    +34.36     +32.28 Ireland      +7.23    +11.50     +57.37    +68.46    +50.58     +48.24 Italy        -4.12     +0.55     +36.27    +39.25    +22.99     +21.07 Netherlands  +2.07     +6.01     +40.86    +43.33    +36.59     +34.47 Norway       +4.73    +11.40     +40.47    +48.54    +39.42     +37.25 Spain        +0.70     +4.58     +46.54    +50.13    +20.59     +18.71 Sweden       +4.49     +9.62     +41.59    +46.06    +28.47     +26.47 Switzerland  +3.06     +6.80     +48.85    +48.00    +49.82     +47.49 UK           +1.29     +6.34     +23.90    +23.31    +23.31     +21.40 EUROPE       +1.08     +5.47     +33.31    +33.64    +28.70     +26.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    +0.60     +4.83     +37.44    +35.95    +37.91     +35.77 Hong Kong    -6.89     +9.00    +104.07   +105.26   +108.95    +105.70 Japan        +2.83     +1.45     +14.73    +13.89    +29.16     +27.15 Malaysia     -5.92    +11.74    +119.58   +119.24   +121.63    +118.20 New Zealand  +1.64     +6.55     +48.37    +47.87    +62.79     +60.27 Singapore    -2.53     +6.73     +62.31    +64.67    +71.88     +69.22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada       +2.54     +3.29     +26.78    +25.39    +22.46     +20.55 USA          +0.65     +1.15      +8.59     +7.33     +9.02      +7.33 Mexico       +2.91    +10.21     +42.40    +48.44    +51.50     +49.15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa +4.48    +14.14     +62.60    +66.54    +92.23     +89.24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  +1.12     +2.98     +19.64    +18.92    +23.21     +21.30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on January 7th 1994.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright, The Financial Times Limited, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co, and NatWest Securities Limited.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AMBASSADOR OWNERS TO FIGHT SCHOOL PLAN  </P> <P> The new owners of the historic Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles vowed Thursday  to fight any attempt by the Los Angeles Unified School District to put a new  high school on the Mid-Wilshire District property.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Wilshire Center Partners, originally known as Anglo-Wilshire  Partners, completed the purchase of the 23.5-acre property for $64 million from  the J. Myer Schine family.  </P> <P> The sale went through despite city plans to build a 2,000-student high school  on the site. The district has said it will buy the property or, if necessary,  begin legal proceedings to claim it under its power of eminent domain.  </P> <P> Wilshire area community groups have objected to the school plan.  </P> <P> "We agree with the Los Angeles Mid-Wilshire community that the best use of that  site is not a high school," said New York developer Scott Malkin, one of four  partners in Wilshire Center. "We will fight any attempt to put a high school on  the site. The fact we closed the transaction demonstrates our commitment to the  property."  </P> <P> School board President Jackie Goldbert said: "I'm sorry to hear that, but I am  not surprised. . . . The school district is very committed to putting a school  on the property."  </P></p>

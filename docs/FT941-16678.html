			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Limit makes Pounds 22m increase in commitments to Lloyd's London Insurance Market Investment Trust, the biggest of Lloyd's 21 corporate members, yesterday announced a Pounds 22m increase in its commitments to the Lloyd's insurance market. Limit has raised Pounds 280m from institutional and retail investors and will provide backing for 101 syndicates managed by 33 managing agents and will provide nearly a third of the Pounds 1.6bn in Lloyd's capacity supplied by corporate capital. The final allocation of Pounds 502.5m compares with Pounds 480.5m previously agreed with managing agents when Limit, which was sponsored by Samuel Montagu and James Capel, issued its listing particulars in November last year. The managing agents to which additional capacity has been allocated are Wellington, Kiln, DP Mann, RGB, Spreckley Villers Burnhope and Venton. Limit is supporting three syndicates not included in its listing particulars. Two of these - 1038 and 1184 - were previously part of the Merrett Group, whose Lloyd's underwriting interests were transferred to separate agencies late last year. The third new syndicate, 1215, was created through the recruitment of the underwriting team of 418, another Merrett syndicate. Syndicate 1215, managed by Janson Green agency, may accept the reinsurance to the close of syndicate 418's 1991, 1992 and 1993 pure underwriting years but it will not assume responsibility for 418's underwriting liabilities in respect of 1990 and prior years. The agency most favoured by Limit is Murray Lawrence, nine of whose syndicates have been allocated Pounds 50m of Limit's capacity. Other agencies favoured by Limit include the Brockbank Group (Pounds 45m) and Bankside Syndicates (Pounds 40m).</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Economics Notebook: A spring in the step of fiscal debate Late spring is the season when finance ministers stray from home. Last week, they came from all over the globe for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington. Next weekend, European Community finance ministers converge on Oporto, Portugal, for one of their twice-yearly informal gatherings. On May 18 and 19, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will host finance, trade and foreign ministers from its 24 industrialised member nations at its annual ministerial meeting. One short-term purpose of this peripatetic hob-nobbing is to prepare the annual economic summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries - to be held in Munich in early July. The more important longer-term goal is to help frame and co-ordinate economic policies in the G7 (the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada) over the coming decade. The G7 process of cajoling and consensus-building is far from perfect. But it can probably take the credit for preserving the world from extreme protectionism over the past two decades of monetary and economic turbulence. Although much can still go wrong, the leadership and assistance provided by the G7 countries probably constitute the best hope of integrating Russia and other former communist countries into the world economy. But, while the problems and challenges posed by the collapse of communism have grown, so have the difficulties of economic management among the G7 and in the other industrialised countries. Although hopes have risen over the past month of economic recovery in the US, Germany, Britain and Canada, the world economy is still too fragile to be left on auto-pilot. The Munich summit should, therefore, be an important event, and not just for the G7. The influence group members exercise on other countries is large and growing. The danger is that, for the second year running, a man from Moscow will steal the show. Last year's London summit was upstaged by the arrival of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, then president of the Soviet Union, for talks on the final day with the summit seven. This year, Russian president Mr Boris Yeltsin is expected to join the G7 leaders after their main discussions. That should be just after the planned July 1 adoption of a unified rouble exchange rate which could spell high drama in the Russian economy. By contrast, Germany, this year's summit host, wants the G7 leaders to discuss a two-part growth strategy for the western industrialised countries in Munich. Details of the proposed strategy are sketchy so far. But according to Mr Horst Kohler, a state secretary in the German Finance Ministry and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief international economic negotiator, the G7 should tackle short-term worries about growth with confidence-building measures, and focus more on structural problems in the world economy to help increase its long-term growth potential. Serious structural problems include: The relationship of savings, investment and interest rates. To secure growth, it will be necessary to increase savings and depress inflationary expectations. Only then will finance be forthcoming for investment needs of the industrial countries, Russia, eastern Europe and the developing world at affordable real interest rates. The weaknesses of education and training systems, especially in the US and Britain. Entrenched industrial subsidies and labour market rigidities, preventing a better allocation of world resources. The fact that these last two problems are prevalent in Germany shows the talks in Munich will have to be frank to achieve anything. High budget deficits will also be a theme. They have been recognised as a serious impediment to growth for at least a decade. But the budgetary ill health of all G7 countries, except Japan and possibly France, illustrates how actions have fallen short of generally accepted policy prescriptions. However, if last week's meeting of G7 finance ministers in Washington is any guide, the big industrial countries may return to fiscal rectitude. They are gradually abandoning their recent flirtation with expansionary fiscal policies as an antidote to recession. Only Japan was urged to spend more on public works to boost its economy. This probably reflected frustration by other countries about Japan's rising trade surpluses at a time of slowing domestic growth rather than a long-term assessment of what might be best for the global economy. Significantly, it was Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, who led the questioning of Germany's high public-sector deficit. He also warned of a tough round of public expenditure negotiations in the UK between now and the Autumn. The G7 discussions also highlighted how difficult it is for ministers to speak the same language when striving for consensus. The size of Germany's public-sector deficit was disputed between the UK and US, on one side, and Germany on the other. The UK and US claim the deficit amounts to around 6 per cent of gross domestic product when all elements of the public sector are taken into account. If true, that would give Germany the EC's second biggest annual deficit after Italy. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, cited IMF figures that put the deficit at about 3.5 per cent of GDP. Even if all off-balance sheet items were included, the deficit would not exceed 5 per cent of GDP, he said. G7 fiscal policy is bound to be a key issue of debate at Munich and in the years ahead. The least the seven finance ministers should do now would be to instruct their officials to work out a harmonised method of calculating deficits so fiscal debate does not turn into unnecessary dispute.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata today denied reports that the seven-party  ruling coalition is on the verge of collapse over the selection  of a new prime minister to succeed Morihiro Hosokawa who  resigned last Friday [8 April].    Hata, who is also leader of the Japan Renewal Party, the  coalition's core force, told a press conference in Tokyo that  the eight-month-old alliance has not broken up because meetings  of the representatives from the ruling parties are still being  held.    "It is true that various emotions are entangled," Hata  said,"but if we go back to the starting point of why we  established the coalition, I believe we can restore it."    The coalition is splitting into two camps over who should  succeed the outgoing prime minister.    The camp led by the Renewal Party today rejected a call by  Social Democratic Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to hold a  meeting of all the seven parties' leaders to discuss the choice  of Hosokawa's successor.</p>

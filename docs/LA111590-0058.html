			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVE DISTEL: PLUMMER EXCELLING IN 3 WAYS  </P> <P> William (Refrigerator) Perry became famous around the world a few years back  when the Chicago Bears let the offense borrow him from the defense and then  handed him the football.  </P> <P> Of course, part of William's charm was that he could wear the Equator as a  belt.  </P> <P> The Chargers now have a character doing almost exactly what Perry did. They too  have a defensive starter who has become an offensive goal-line specialist.  </P> <P> You've seen that funny number in the backfield.  </P> <P> 50.  </P> <P> You don't expect anyone wearing the number 50 to be in position to handle a  ball unless the game is basketball . . . or the guy is a pitcher. In football,  centers and linebackers wear numbers in the 50s.  </P> <P> Gary Plummer is a linebacker.  </P> <P> He is the mystery man who wears 50 in the Chargers' offensive backfield.  </P> <P> Or maybe he's not such a mystery man any more. You can be assured that the  Kansas City Chiefs, this week's opponents, are fully aware that Plummer is not  in the backfield to serve as a bodyguard for Marion Butts or Rod Bernstine or  Ronnie Harmon.  </P> <P> The idea in using a guy like Plummer in the backfield is that he presents the  potential for surprise. A lot of teams, for example, use interior offensive  linemen as tight ends or wingbacks in short-yardage situations, but seldom are  they taken seriously as people who could hold the ball if it was handed or  thrown to them.  </P> <P> So the Chargers take the inside linebacker and run him onto the field with the  offense and turn him loose with the ball.  </P> <P> Understand, now, that Plummer has not exactly become a workhorse in the  offensive backfield. What he is, to be sure, is a workhorse on the field,  period. He does these cameos in the backfield in addition to handling his  regular chores as a defensive starter and more regular chores as a special  teams performer.  </P> <P> In a different way, Gary Plummer is a triple threat.  </P> <P> He has led the Chargers in tackles since he joined the team as a free agent in  1986. This fact alone should come as a bit of surprise, because this is not  exactly a no-name defense. What's surprising is that none of the big names,  such as Billy Ray Smith or Lee Williams or Leslie O'Neal or Gill Byrd, led this  team in tackles.  </P> <P> This free-agent guy does. The Chargers' leading tackler played JC football at  somewhere called Ohlone College, which no longer plays football; walked on at  Cal, which only recently seems to have rediscovered how to play football; and  started his professional career with the USFL, which has gone the way of  Ohlone. This background would not suggest this guy came to the Chargers a  can't-miss prospect.  </P> <P> All the guy does is his job . . . and two or three other people's.  </P> <P> That Plummer became a fullback, a position he has never played in all of his  life, came about because of the one-back offense. All of the backs were  basically tailback types and the coaches wanted a fullback type for  short-yardage situations.  </P> <P> "They asked the defensive staff who they'd recommend," Plummer said, "and they  said myself and Henry Rolling. I learned all the goal-line plays, but I never  thought much would come of it."  </P> <P> However, the box score now tells us that Plummer has caught one pass (for a  touchdown) and run once (for a touchdown). The pass was against Pittsburgh and  the run was last Sunday against Denver, both from the one-yard line.  </P> <P> "It was just a dream that I'd ever score," he said. "When it happened against  Pittsburgh, it was like a little moment of glory for all the blue-collar  workers . . . because I consider myself to be a blue-collar worker."  </P> <P> That moment would pale compared with the touchdown run against Denver in front  of a sold-out home crowd. This game, eventually a 19-7 victory, was up for  grabs before Plummer's dive into the end zone.  </P> <P> About the only thing he didn't do well was spike the ball.  </P> <P> "I like to see linebackers show extra-curricular skills," mused Billy Ray  Smith, Plummer's linebacking sidekick, "but we're going to have to have a  session to work on that spiking."  </P> <P> True to his nature, Gary Plummer thanked Coach Dan Henning and offensive  coordinator Ted Tollner for having the confidence to hand him the ball.  </P> <P> Also true to his nature, he is still just a blue-collar guy. This defensive  starter turned offensive surprise has not found himself inundated with  endorsements or late-night (or early morning) television appearances.  </P> <P> This is not William Perry revisited.  </P> <P> "I think people got into the Fridge thing because he weighed 370 pounds,"  Plummer said. "I'm about 130 pounds shy of that."  </P> <P> Again, he is just too ordinary a guy for such commotion.  </P> <P> However, this has brought about subtle changes in the Plummer household.  </P> <P> "Yes," he said, "it has had its drawbacks. My wife complains that she can't do  the housework any more when the offense is on the field."  </P> <P> Yes, the only time Leigh-Anna Plummer can be sure her husband is not on the  field is halftime. When he comes home with a trombone, she will know she has to  watch then, too.  </P></p>

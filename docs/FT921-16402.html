			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / PM seeks summit to discuss Soviet break-up MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, is proposing a summit of the United Nations Security Council's permanent members later this month to discuss the international security implications of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Diplomatic soundings on the possibility of holding such a summit have already been carried out by Britain, which took over the rotating presidency of the Security Council on Wednesday. Officials said the matter was still in a tentative stage, however, pending reactions from the other council members - the US, China, France, and Russia which is due to take over the former Soviet Union's permanent seat. The idea behind Mr Major's proposal is that a meeting of all the Security Council heads of state and government, probably to be held in New York, could formally recognise Russia as the successor state to the Soviet Union in the UN. It would also give the leaders, including Russian president Boris Yeltsin, an opportunity for an early contact with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the new UN secretary-general. The proposal would also allow the permanent council members to have a discussion with Mr Yeltsin about a problem which is causing great concern worldwide: the effective control of the former Soviet Union's nuclear weapons following the country's dissolution into independent republics. The decision by the leaders of the new Commonwealth of Independent States in Minsk last Monday that unified control over the former Soviet nuclear arsenal should be maintained by the Russian president has only partly reassured the rest of the world. In a radio interview on Wednesday, Mr Major said he was worried that the smaller independent former Soviet republics might sell off some of their nuclear weapons and technology to foreign buyers. Mr George Robertson, Labour's shadow foreign minister, said in a radio interview yesterday: 'It is entirely sensible that we take a look, at UN level, at the way the world's affairs are now configuring. We cannot assume that the old world order is going to remain in place especially when there is a new entity controlling 35,000 nuclear warheads.'</p>

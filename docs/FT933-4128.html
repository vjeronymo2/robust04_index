			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Percentage of Indian civil service jobs to be reserved for 'deprived' citizens India's ruling Congress (I) party has said that 27 per cent of civil service jobs are to be reserved for socially deprived citizens, writes Shiraz Sidhva and agencies in New Delhi. But it denied yesterday that the move, announced on Wednesday, was purely for electoral gain with polls due in five states over the next few months. The announcement came three years after nearly 100 people killed themselves in protest over a similar proposal. Some 22 per cent of government jobs are already reserved for India's so-called disadvantaged castes.</p>

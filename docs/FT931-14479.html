			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ottawa buys 15% of Hibernia development THE CANADIAN government has come to the rescue of the country's most ambitious energy project by buying a 15 per cent stake in the Hibernia oil and gas development off the coast of Newfoundland. The purchase, which is likely to be reduced to 8.5 per cent, is in addition to CDollars 1bn (USDollars 700m) in official grants and CDollars 1.7bn in loan guarantees to attract private-sector participation in the CDollars 5.2bn project. Ottawa had to intervene or let Hibernia die when no outside investors stepped forward to buy the 25 per cent interest abandoned by Gulf Canada Resources last year. Gulf, which advised its partners to mothball the project, halted financial contributions last week when total spending on Hibernia passed CDollars 1bn. The government will cut its stake to 8.5 per cent once formalities are completed for Murphy Oil of Arkansas to buy a 6.5 per cent interest. The remainder of Gulf's interest will be split between two existing partners, Mobil Oil Canada and Chevron Canada Resources. Petro-Canada will retain a 25 per cent interest. The government has been under strong political pressure to rescue the project which is widely seen as indispensable to the economy of Newfoundland, where unemployment is running at about 22 per cent.</p>

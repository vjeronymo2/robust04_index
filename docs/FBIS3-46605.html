			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Singapore will eliminate tariffs on 406 products as  part of the concessions on the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT). The elimination of these 406 tariffs will mean  that more than $2.5 billion [Singapore currency] worth of  imports annually will be able to enter Singapore duty-free from  tomorrow. The duty foregone from these imports is estimated at  $60 million.    The products include birds' eggs, candy, biscuits,  artificial  sweeteners, clothing, flourescent tubes, headgear, leather  handbags, imitation jewellery and furniture. The huge GATT  accord, formally approved on Dec 15 by 114 nations, is expected  to eliminate trade barriers and lower tariffs around the world.  For the first time, there will be rules to govern trade in  agriculture, textiles and services.    Protection of intellectual property rights wll be  strengthened, barriers to foreign investment levelled and a new  World Trade Organization set up to police the new deal. The  agreement is widely expected to stimulate more trade, thereby  pulling world economies out of recession and promoting new jobs.  Trade is also being liberalised in ASEAN under the AFTA  agreement. Under the plan, intra-regional tariffs on all  manufactured and processed products will be capped at 5 percent  by the year 2008.</p>

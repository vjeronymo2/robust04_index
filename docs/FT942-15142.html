			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Markets: Fretful City distrusts even good news - London Nothing better indicates the mood of the City of London than its response to unexpected developments. When traders are upbeat - as they were during the market's surge at the turn of the year - bad news is shrugged off, on the basis it merely demonstrates further scope for improvement. When sentiment is less bullish, even apparently positive moves can cause unease. So it was on Thursday, when the Bundesbank unexpectedly lowered Germany's key interest rates. An already weak FTSE 100 dipped even further and although it later clawed back some ground, it still closed 14 points down on a day which one might have expected to be good for equities. That fall was more than recovered yesterday when hopes of lower UK interest rates were revived by news that last months's underlying annual inflation rate fell from 2.8 to 2.4 per cent - its lowest figure since 1967, and much better than had been expected in the City. One striking factor is that the markets fear interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic are near the bottom of their long-term cycle - so any reduction merely makes it more likely that the next movement will be upwards. This determination to look on the gloomy side does not just contrast with the feverish mood up until February - it also seems a long way removed from the outlook of many executives. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, says companies are highly optimistic about prospects for increased sales and new orders, in spite of fears that this year's tax increases might damage the recovery. The charts shows that the balance of companies expecting an increase in net sales over the next three months is 60 per cent - its highest level since the second quarter of 1989. The recent corporate reporting season has also delivered some pleasant surprises. Analysts at NatWest Securities say that of the 157 large companies to have presented results since February, a balance of 30 were ahead of market expectations. Blue Circle Industries and RMC Group, which respectively dominate the British market for cement and ready-mixed concrete, both confirmed the strength of the recovery in construction by reporting profits above expectations. The continuing buoyancy of the German building market particularly helped RMC, while Blue Circle has resumed exports to the US for the first time in several years. Forte, the hotel and restaurant group, said it was seeing an increase in business from corporate customers, although UK consumer spending was still fragile. This upbeat note partly offset disappointment that the group wrote down the value of its net assets by Pounds 412m to Pounds 3.4bn, after revaluing its properties. A fear haunting the market in recent months has been that Britain's famously profitable supermarkets might be facing historic decline. They are under attack from aggressive discount retailers and have started to writedown and depreciate their expensive buildings. Some reassurance came from Tesco, the UK's second-biggest grocery retailer, which reported a drop in pre-tax profits but said the underlying profits were level. Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said gross profit margins had been forced down significantly last year, but had recently shown a pleasing improvement. Tesco had stemmed the flow of customers to the new generation of cut-price discounters, such as Germany's Aldi and Denmark's Netto, by introducing 100 basic products at very low prices. Sir Ian said: 'The competition is not going to get any easier. But it's not all about price. It is about quality, service and convenience as well.' The lesson that companies do not have to sell solely on price had already been hammered home by Burmah Castrol, which increased pre-tax profits in spite of continuing lack of demand for its fuels and chemicals businesses. Burmah's lubricants business increased its market share sharply in a shrinking global market, mainly thanks to marketing which reached record levels. The group has even persuaded some US motorists to pay Dollars 4 a quart for synthetic oil, compared with the Dollars 1.25 they are used to paying for ordinary stuff. Another UK business hoping that Americans and other foreigners will be willing to pay top prices is Hamleys, the famous but expensive toy shop in London's Regent Street which plans to come to the market with a capitalisation of about Pounds 40m. Hamleys was founded in 1760, and about 50 per cent of its customers are tourists. The management wants to capitalise on the Hamleys name and has opened outlets in London's Covent Garden and Heathrow's Terminal 4. Sceptics doubt whether Hamleys will be able to charge such stiff prices outside its admittedly marvellous flagship store - particularly in a sector where retailers such as the US group Toys-R-Us have discounted prices. This question of what constitutes value for money goes to the heart of the apparent contradiction between stock market nervousness and growing business confidence. Partly it is just timing: the market had already priced in a recovery, and is now more concerned about the likelihood that interest rates will start rising again, even if the UK rates can be nudged down a shade more. In spite of its 10 per cent drop from February's peak, the FTSE 100 does seem to have found a floor at about 3,100. While the market's optimism seemed extreme at the beginning of the year, the recent swing in sentiment looks equally overdone. If the current fretting over interest rates settles down, a significant advance from this level is possible.</p>

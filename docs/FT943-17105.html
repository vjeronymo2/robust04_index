			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Serbs repossess heavy arms Serbs have pulled heavy weapons out of United Nations-monitored storage in Croatia and moved some tanks into neighbouring Bosnia, a UN official said yesterday. The report fed fears of an escalation in fighting as international mediators began trying to 'sell' the warring parties in Bosnia a new peace. Serbs took almost 20 tanks and artillery pieces from storage over the past several days, said UN spokesman Mr Paul Risley. Some were moved across the border into the Bihac area of northwestern Bosnia, where a rebel Moslem leader's troops are fighting government loyalists. 'We are concerned there by the presence of several tanks and heavy weapons belonging to the military of the Serb authorities in Knin, which have recently been deployed across the border,' he said. Knin is the self-styled capital of regions captured by Serbs and held since a six-month war in 1991. They refuse to submit to Croatian authority and hope to unite their regions with Serb-held parts of Bosnia and Serbia proper.</p>

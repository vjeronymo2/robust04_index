			<p>BFN     [Text] Political sources in Sanaa said today that fierce  battles have resumed for the second consecutive day between  Yemeni Army units positioned north of Sanaa. This fighting  follows the collapse of the cease-fire declared last night.    According to the sources, heavy artillery and tanks are  being  used in the fighting between units loyal to President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and units who support Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid.    Well-informed sources in Aden confirm the news of the  fighting, saying that the southern forces, stationed north of  Sanaa, are in control of the situation. These forces seized 30  tanks belonging to the northern forces and destroyed 15 others,  according to the same sources.</p>

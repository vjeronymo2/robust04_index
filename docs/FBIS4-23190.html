			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 28 SAPA -- Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF,  Afrikaner National Front] Chairman Ferdi Hartzenberg on Saturday  [28 May] said he and President Mandela had agreed that the same  norms would be applied to deal with outstanding cases of amnesty  for rightwingers that had been used in the case of the African  National Congress. Dr Hartzenberg told a news conference he  intended to raise the amnesty issue again at his meeting with Mr  Mandela in Pretoria on Monday.    It might be necessary to adjust the cut-off dates contained  in legislature for amnesty, Dr Hartzenberg said.    Distancing the AVF from violence, Dr Hartzenberg announced  that the organisation would establish a team to directly  negotiate with the government on an Afrikaner Volkstaat  [homeland].    He was speaking after an AVF Executive Council meeting in  Pretoria to review the AVF's position after the elections. A  volks [people's] republic committee had been established to do  the necessary planning and formulate input for negotiations, he  said.    Dr Hartzenberg likened the position of Afrikaners to that of  the Palestinians before their settlement, saying Afrikaners had  lost their freedom and did not have a land.    The Afrikaner had two choices: They could struggle, destroy  and use violence to reach a settlement or they could reach a  settlement without following that route. "It would be wise  (verstandig) to reach a settlement without violence."    During negotiations with Mr Mandela, they agreed that this  was the correct method, Dr Hartzenberg said.    Asked why the AVF did not join General Constand Viljoen's  Freedom Front [FF] to obtain a volkstaat through the "volkstaat  raad" [homeland council] dr hartzenberg said the constitution  and the April accord between the FF, government and the ANC,  ruled out complete self-determination for Afrikaners.    Analysis of the votes cast during the elections indicated  that more people abstained from voting than those who did vote  for the FF route, he added.</p>

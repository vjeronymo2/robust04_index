			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  APHIS is proposing that cartons in which fresh litchi from Taiwan are packed must be stamped ``Not for distribution in FL,'' in order to prevent the introduction of the pest  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eriophyes lichtii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  into Florida. This safeguard will be ineffective, as shipments of imported fresh litchi could be repacked upon arrival into the United States and then diverted into Florida through interstate commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Fresh litchi from Taiwan could be repacked and diverted into Florida in violation of our regulations. We have no information, however, supporting or disproving the assertion that this will occur. We will make every effort to enforce this and all of our regulations. It would be impractical for APHIS not to promulgate a regulation simply because it might be violated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  APHIS has not accurately characterized the potential economic impact on litchi growers in Florida of allowing fresh litchi to be imported from Taiwan into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Based on information recently provided in these comments and from elsewhere, we have determined that allowing fresh litchi to be imported into the United States from Taiwan may have a significant economic impact on litchi growers in Florida. We have performed a more detailed economic analysis, set forth below. However, APHIS has no authority to restrict trade based on its potential economic impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  APHIS should not allow fresh longan to be imported into the United States from Taiwan because of the potential introduction of exotic pests and the possible adverse economic impact on domestic longan producers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Fresh longan fruit is not allowed to be imported into the United States from Taiwan under &sect;319.56. We have not proposed to allow fresh longan fruit to be imported into the United States from Taiwan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting, without change, the provisions of the proposal as a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective less than 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Immediate implementation of this rule is necessary to provide relief to those persons who are adversely affected by restrictions we no longer find warranted. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule should be effective upon publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , we have performed a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, set forth below, regarding the economic impact of this rule on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule will amend the regulations governing the importation of fruits and vegetables by allowing a number of previously prohibited fruits and vegetables to be imported into the United States from certain foreign countries and localities under specified conditions. The importation of these fruits and vegetables has been prohibited because of the risk that they could introduce injurious plant pests into the United States. This rule will revise the status of certain commodities from certain countries and localities, allowing their importation into the United States for the first time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These revisions are based on biological risk analyses that were conducted by APHIS at the request of various importers and foreign ministries of agriculture. The risk analyses indicate that the fruits or vegetables listed in this rule, under certain conditions, may be imported into the United States without significant pest risk. All of the fruits and vegetables, as a condition of entry, will be subject to inspection, disinfection, or both, at the port of first arrival as may be required by a USDA inspector. In addition, some of the fruits and vegetables will be required to undergo mandatory treatment for fruit flies or other injurious insects as a condition of entry, or to meet other special conditions. Thus, this action will provide the United States with additional kinds and sources of fruits and vegetables while continuing to provide protection against the introduction into the United States of injurious plant pests by imported fruits and vegetables.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the fruits and vegetables to be allowed importation into the United States, domestic production and related import information is available only for artichokes, asparagus, blueberries, sweet cherries, dasheens, plums, pink and red tomatoes, and litchi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have used both published elasticities and price flexibilities to estimate the potential economic effects of allowing artichokes, asparagus, blueberries, sweet cherries, dasheens, plums, and pink and red tomatoes to be imported into the United States; both examine the relationship between changes in supply and subsequent changes in price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Domestic production and import information was not available for the other commodities that could be imported into the United States as a result of this action, because these other commodities are not produced on a large scale domestically. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing these other commodities to be imported into the United States will not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Artichokes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1987, 67 domestic producers harvested artichokes; all but one were in California. It is likely that most of these producers would be classified as small entities using Small Business Administration (SBA) criteria (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less). In 1992, domestic producers harvested 118 million pounds of artichokes for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $39.2 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> G N' R LANGUAGE ON ABC DRAWS HEAT  </P> <P> ABC was swamped with complaints after members of the heavy-metal band Guns N'  Roses uttered profanities during Monday night's live telecast of the American  Music Awards. While the profanities were heard by millions of viewers watching  the show in the East, the segments were deleted from the tape-delayed West  Coast version.  </P> <P> The band members, no strangers to controversy, won two awards. The first was  for favorite heavy-metal group; the other for best heavy-metal album, "Appetite  for Destruction." The band was cut off the first time when guitarist Slash used  a profanity. Slash and another band member were cut off again when they began  using profanities while accepting the second award.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, ABC issued an apology: "We regret that last night's live telecast  of the American Music Awards contained some offensive language. This has not  happened before in the 17 years this awards show has been on the air. We will  take precautionary measures to see that it does not happen in future  telecasts." JEFF KAYE  </P></p>

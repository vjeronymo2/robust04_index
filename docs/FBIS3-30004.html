Hata  told Vice Premier Zhu Rongji that although Sino-U.S. ties seem  to have improved recently, he thinks there are still some  problems concerning renewal of the MFN status.    As one of the "tangible measures" to be taken to ensure  renewal of the MFN status, Hata implied that Beijing should  improve its human rights record, the officials said.    China's MFN status, which must be extended every year under  U.S. law, ends in June. Washington has linked further extension  this year to a "significant overall improvement" in China's  human rights record.    Zhu told Hata that relations between Beijing and Washington  have made progress since U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese  President Jiang Zemin met in Seattle in November, the officials  said. The meeting between Hata and Zhu lasted about 50 minutes  and was followed by a dinner, they said.    Also during the meeting, Hata urged China to submit as early  as possible official lists of projects to be covered by Japan's  yen loans so that Tokyo and Beijing could determine the  projects, the officials said.    He was quoted as saying Japan places importance on  protecting  the environment when extending loans.    When Hata visited China in early January, Japan and China  agreed to divide Japan's loan periods from five years to  three-year and two-year periods beginning with fiscal 1996  starting April that year.    Beijing has sent unofficial lists to the Japanese Government  of the projects to be handled under the yen loans but has yet to  submit official lists, the officials said.</p>

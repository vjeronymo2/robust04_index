			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Milosevic turns necessity into a virtue DEPUTIES assembled at the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament yesterday to debate the international peace plan for the country appeared more annoyed than awed by the arrival of their patrons Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic and his Yugoslav counterparts at their mountain stronghold of Pale. The Bosnian Serb leadership stood on the terrace of the Heavenly Valley Hotel waiting for the long motorcade of sleek black Mercedes limousines to snake up Mount Jahorina. The soldiers chanted a song of resistance against the Turks set to an American square-bashing tune. Just a few miles away, Serb artillery trained on Sarajevo over the past year has all but destroyed the Bosnian capital. A crowd watched as Mr Milosevic, who has newly donned the mantle of international mediator, and his closest international ally, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, reviewed the Bosnian Serb guard of honour. Mr Radoslav Brdjanin, a hardline deputy from Banja Luka, north west Bosnia, remarked: 'They do not understand we are fighting their battle for them. We are defending Belgrade, when our soldiers die on the frontlines in Grbavica,' he said in reference to a Serb-held suburb of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. Mr Milosevic called on the assembly to back the international plan to divide Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic lines. 'The decision for peace has no alternative because it is in the interests of Bosnian Serbs and Serbs in general,' he said. Mr Dobrica Cosic, the Yugoslav president, warned Bosnian Serb deputies that they faced a stark choice between a military defeat or achieving their political aims in peacetime. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, echoed his patrons from Belgrade and sheepishly toned down his message of defiance. Early in the day deputies admitted the presence of their influential guests might sway the decision on the peace plan. Even Mr Karadzic, who recommended the plan, described it as a catastrophe. But rather than show deference to their weighty guests, they mainly complained about the plan which requires Serb forces to give back nearly half the territory they currently control. 'It is easy for Milosevic to call on us to return our land. Bosnian Serbs have died defending it,' said a member of the government speaking on condition of anonymity. He described how Mr Milosevic had 'used the Bosnian Serbs to unite Serb territories and under international pressure had abandoned his plans'. One way or the other Mr Milosevic will try to turn the outcome into a personal victory. In less than a month he has been transformed into a peacemaker. In a Byzantine twist, the west, which accuses him of being the one person most responsible for the war in Bosnia, has come to rely on him as the emissary of peace in Bosnia. He appeared to be the only one who could bring the deputies to heel. Since the Bosnian Serbs rejected the plan last Monday despite Mr Milosevic's last minute intervention, he reportedly cajoled them and threatened to cut off their supply lines if they refused to back the peace plan. Arriving with Mr Mitsotakis, he gave the appearance of a statesman dwarfing the worn and weary Bosnian Serb leaders. He has once again shown his chameleon-like ability to manipulate a crisis to his advantage. But Mr Milosevic appeared ready to risk widening the rift between Serbs on one side of the frontier and the other. Mr Milosevic, since he came to power in 1987, riding a wave of Serb nationalism, has billed himself as the defender of all Serbs. But he has never tolerated dissent from his proteges, even from Serbs outside of Serbia, the very people he has claimed to protect. 'I thought he was a great fighter for Serbia. Now, I see he does not care and is willing to have us bombed,' said the official of Srpska Republika, the self-styled Serb state which covers some 70 per cent of Bosnia. In 1992 Mr Milosevic orchestrated the ousting of Mr Milan Babic, a rebel leader from Croatia who opposed the despatch of UN peacekeepers to Krajina, Serb-held territory in Croatia. This time, it has not been so easy. Too much blood has been spilt to effect a simple change of leadership to get approval for the plan. Mr Cosic yesterday put it simply: Yugoslavia could no longer afford to fight the war. If need be, Mr Milosevic will not hesitate to jettison the Bosnian Serbs if they prove too heavy a burden for Serbia and Montenegro, already under tight sanctions and under threat of military intervention.</p>

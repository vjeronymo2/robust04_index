			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT OLD HAWAII  </P> <P> Jerry Hulse's story July 15, "Hawaii, My Old Friend," was great for a lot of  reasons, not the least of which was his listing of the inexpensive lodgings in  out-of-the-way places. I'm a little tired of publications assuming we can all  spend, or even want to spend, $250 a night on a room.  </P> <P> RICHARD SULLIVAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

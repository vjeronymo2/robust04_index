			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Markets: Do not buy a used forecast from this man - London Markets 'THE YEAR 2000 is less than 100 months away - or that, I am told, is the latest treasury forecast,' said John Major yesterday. He did well to display caution. In their present mood, most stock market dealers would require a personal letter of authentication from Pope Gregory before accepting such a treasury calculation. Their misgivings about the treasury surfaced, in spectacular fashion, on Monday, when the FT-SE 100 index dropped 103 points, its worst one-day fall since the October 1987 crash. Then, London was reacting to Wall Street's desperate dive; this time, it was displaying its misgivings about UK government policy, and its worries about sharp falls in continental bourses. The two concerns were linked, in investors' minds at any rate. The tension between interest rates in Germany and the gathering recession both there and in much of the rest of Europe had led to the currency turmoil which ejected Britain from the ERM. Though in mid-September the stock market had welcomed that departure - because it appeared to free the UK from the deflationary cage into which ERM membership had locked - by last weekend investors had grown increasingly worried about the policy which would replace that cage. As the pound continued to fall, the fear was that a government adrift had forfeited the opportunity to ease monetary policy significantly, and would instead find itself having to defend a sterling parity around DM 2.40 almost as fiercely as it had defended DM 2.95. That would rule out the possibility of further interest rate cuts. By the end of the week, much of this gloom had lifted. The FT-SE 100 index, which closed on Monday at 2446.3, had recouped almost all those losses by the end of the week, closing on Friday at 2,541.2. The credit for this improvement was popularly given to the Chancellor, who addressed the Conservative party conference on Thursday. In fact, however, the lion's share of the credit should go to the Chancellor's old bogey, the German Bundesbank. It became clear in the course of the week that the Bundesbank's easing of monetary policy had been more substantial than the grudging quarter-point cut in the Lombard rate extorted from it on the weekend of Italy's devaluation in early September. On Friday, Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, said that German money supply growth could slow after November because of the economic slowdown. In the past, the Bundesbank has usually cut rates rapidly once it has decided that inflationary dangers have passed; if this comment is preparing the ground for that shift, the markets have reason to rejoice. Spurred on by these thoughts, sterling recovered, and so did the stock market. The pound's low point on Monday was just under DM 2.37; by Friday afternoon it was trading at over DM 2.51. It was just as well that the Bundesbank had come to Norman Lamont's rescue, for he did little to help his own cause. In a speech that the charitable described as lack-lustre, he was unable to give his new policy much backbone. A written statement went little further, though it did indicate a significant, formal, retreat from John Major's earlier policy of aiming for zero inflation. The new range for 'underlying inflation' (excluding mortgage interest) is to be 0 to 4 per cent, initially in the upper end of the band, later at the level - presumably 2 per cent - achieved by Britain's industrial competitors. On Friday, by happy coincidence, the underlying measure fell to 4 per cent, at the top of the Chancellor's new band. Individual sectors of the stock market have reflected the swings of optimism and pessimism about the future course of interest rates. Industries sensitive to interest rates, such as banks and insurance companies, benefited most from the escape from the ERM, then retraced some ground. The chart shows a Warburg calculation of the price-earnings ratios of five sectors in relation to their recent historic highs and lows. Some traditional cyclical stocks such as builders or chemicals are priced well above their lows. Some of the stocks which rely on consumer confidence, badly dented by the currency turmoil of September and the recent wave of redundancies, are doing less well: hotels and leisure are closer to the bottom of their recent range, in p/e terms, as are transport stocks. One of the traditional defensive sectors, health and household stocks, is in the middle of its historic range, after the shares' relative under-performance earlier this year. Another defensive stock - Ranks Hovis McDougall, the baker - found itself under attack on Monday, as Hanson made a Pounds 780m hostile takeover bid, offering 220p a share in cash. After rejecting the bid on the grounds that it lacked commercial logic, and was anyway too cheap, RHM's chairman held 'useful' talks with Lord Hanson. The share price, which rose 66p on Monday, to 241p, subsequently went nowhere, closing the week at 242p. In 1988 RHM fought off a bid offering 465p. Investors could be forgiven for putting RHM's arithmetical ability in the same class as that of the treasury. Another sufferer from arithmetical misfortune was Hongkong Land, which has been bidding to take its 15 per cent stake in Trafalgar House to just under 30 per cent. Its aim is to muscle its way on to the board, then pressure the company's management to find some way of unlocking the value of its businesses. Alas, so convincing did it make its overture sound that institutional investors decided to stay along for the ride, preferring to hold on to their shares and holding down the likely Hongkong Land stake to under 20 per cent. Whether that is enough to give the Keswicks - who run Hongkong Land and its sister company Jardine Matheson - the opportunity to change things at Trafalgar House remains to be seen.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other additional data contained only a brief summary of the historical use of hexachlorophene and primarily cited publications in the medical literature (Ref. 5). The references provided no new information. Consequently, the agency has determined that hexachlorophene will continue on prescription status subject to the existing regulation in 21 CFR 250.250.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order for hexachlorophene to be switched to OTC status, the concerns expressed by the Antimicrobial I Panel that hexachlorophene does not have an adequate margin of safety for OTC use (39 FR 33103 at 33117) should be addressed. After reviewing the submitted data, the agency concludes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety of this ingredient for OTC use on infants has not been demonstrated. For OTC status for use by adults, any further submission of data should specifically address the safe OTC use of hexachlorophene in adults.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the discussion above, the agency is proposing that hexachlorophene remain available by prescription only, except when used as a preservative at concentrations of 0.1 percent or less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency's detailed comments and evaluation of the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> References <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Plueckhahn, V.

Comments on Iodine and Iodophors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14. One comment pointed out that poloxamer-iodine complex appeared to be incorrectly included in the Category II list under ``health-care personnel handwash'' (43 FR 1210 at 1227), while it is properly listed in Category III for use as a ``health-care personnel handwash'' (43 FR 1210 at 1229). The comment stated that deletion from the Category II list would correct the error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency concurs with the comment that poloxamer-iodine complex for use as a health-care personnel handwash was incorrectly listed as Category II (43 FR 1227) and that the listing as Category III (43 FR 1229) was correct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. One comment submitted data on the safety and effectiveness of a ``mixed iodophor'' consisting of iodine complexed by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Ref. 1). The comment stated that this information had been previously submitted in May 1974, but that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredient had not been mentioned in the Panel's report or in the agency's proposed monograph and requested that the agency include it in the monograph. The comment pointed out that the iodophor, formulated as a liquid hand scrub, is intended for use by surgeons, food handlers, and others for whom reduced bacterial skin flora is of public health significance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the comment's statement that the data were previously submitted, the agency has no record of any submission of these data in 1974. Because this hand scrub was not previously reviewed or categorized as an OTC topical antimicrobial drug product, the agency reviewed the product's marketing history and considers it appropriate to include this product in the OTC drug review. The agency has evaluated the data submitted by the comment (Ref. 1) and determined that iodine complexed by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate is safe for use as a surgical hand scrub and health-care personnel handwash, but that there are insufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data available to determine its effectiveness for these uses. Therefore, the ingredient is being classified in Category III.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

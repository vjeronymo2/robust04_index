			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / People: No Rathbones left on Rathbone board Management changes after the Rathbone Brothers agm have left the private client and asset management group with a new post of managing director and without a Rathbone on the board. Roy Morris, 52, who has been managing director of the group's Liverpool operation, becomes group managing director. In a separate move, Sebastian Rathbone, 61, has resigned from his post as vice-chairman of the group, though he will remain a non-executive director of the main trading subsidiary which deals with investment banking and fund management. Morris says his new role would involve spending more time in the London office, but reflected the importance of the Liverpool operation, which contributed more than half the group's profits last year. One of his tasks, he said, would be to achieve more integration between the two UK offices. He joined Rathbones 37 years ago and has been based in Liverpool ever since; he is 'looking forward to expanding my horizons'. Rathbones' yet-to-be-appointed vice-chairman will probably be non-executive. As for keeping the family connection, Morris commented: 'We're looking to have younger Rathbones in the group in the near future.'</p>

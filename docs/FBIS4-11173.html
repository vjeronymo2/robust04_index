			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 22 Apr (EFE)  -- The Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] has ordered  hundreds of Indian guerrillas to return to their communities  tomorrow as a peace gesture. The EZLN's decision to "call off  the red alert" among its troops starting tomorrow and to resume  consultations within the rank-and-file was announced in a  communique released today in San Cristobal de las Casas.    The communique says that "if the favorable climate for a  dialogue continues," the EZLN will resume consultations with its  rank-and-file on the agreements negotiated with the Mexican  Government in late February -- agreements outlining pacification  plans for Chiapas. "The EZLN affirms its desire for a political  response to the just demands that keep the fire of its struggle  alive. The EZLN continues to demand liberty, justice, and  democracy for all Mexicans." [passage omitted]    In the communique, the EZLN acknowledges the "honest and  determined" efforts of Manuel Camacho Solis, mediator Bishop  Samuel Ruiz, and the civilian society to "make reason prevail  over the use of force" and to meet the demands of the Indians.  The EZLN is also pleased with the release of the 16 people who  had been held since January under false charges that they were  Zapatists. The EZLN "interprets this as a good sign that talks  for a fair and respectable peace should be resumed."    In addition, "Subcommander Marcos," the Zapatists'  mysterious  ideological leader, issued a communique severely criticizing  those who have slandered his armed movement and who have scorned  the rebels' poverty. The subcommander berated and described as  "stupid" the opinions of several analysts who said the EZLN had  delayed the consultations to have the peace talks postponed and  to expand the armed conflict.

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A STRAIT PROTEST  </P> <P> I demand that The Times find someone to review country music who knows what  he/she is doing.  </P> <P> I attended the George Strait concert and I'm very disappointed with Robert  Hilburn's Aug. 14 potshots at a singer just named country entertainer of the  year!  </P> <P> I am not a barefoot country bumpkin. I am a professional in Beverly Hills who  grew up in L.A. There are a lot of us who appreciate the values, morals and  smooth presentation of country music.  </P> <P> CAROL SANCHEZ  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

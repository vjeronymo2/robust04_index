			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA agreed that the proposed requirement for readjustment limits was potentially vague and misleading. However, NHTSA believed Midland-Grau's recommendation about the FHWA alternative had merit. NHTSA stated:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As for Midland-Grau's recommendation to use FHWA's regulations for ``Driver Out-of-Service Criteria'' for brake adjustment, NHTSA has decided to reference these provisions in Standard No. 121 because they are relevant to in-use heavy truck operation regulated by FHWA. Because amendments to Standard No. 121 require the use of brake adjustment indicators which require the display of underadjustment, a reference to adjustment limits is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 57 FR at 47796.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Petitions for Reconsideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All the petitioners raised identical concerns about the incorporation of the FHWA requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Design Specific Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rockwell stated that the FHWA adjustment criteria that NHTSA incorporated would eliminate most air disc brakes from the market. The petitioner said that until 1988, FHWA's readjustment limits for the brake adjuster were in the form of guidelines. These guidelines provided separate requirements for air disc brakes, recognizing that air disc brakes need a slightly longer maximum stroke limit for each chamber size than that specified for drum brakes. For example, Rockwell said, for a type 30 chamber, the old FHWA ``minimum criteria'' provided for a maximum stroke of 2 inches for drum brakes and 21/4 inches for air disc brakes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rockwell stated there are fundamental differences between air disc brakes and drum brakes that account for why the FHWA guidelines permitted air disc brakes to have a slightly longer pushrod stroke limit than drum brakes. The petitioner explained:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In both types of systems, the pushrod stroke length is proportionate to the clearance between the brake lining and the rubbing surface (the drum or the disc). On drum brakes, the clearance and therefore the pushrod stroke gets longer as the brakes become hot and the circular drum wall expands in diameter by as much as one-eighth inch at 800 degrees F. By contrast, a disc brake pushrod stroke gets shorter as the brake gets hotter, because the expansion of the hot rotor brings it closer to the pads which are also expanding in the direction of the rotors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rockwell said that when FHWA adopted its rule for readjustment limits (53 FR 49402, December 7, 1988), the rule did not continue to provide separate specifications for air disc brakes, as it had previously done in its guidelines. Rockwell argued that ``by omitting the separate table for disc brakes, and requiring drum brakes and air disc brakes to meet the same adjustment criteria, the FHWA Final Rule had the effect of imposing a more stringent requirement on the air disc brakes than it imposed on drum brakes.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rockwell said that it has asked FHWA to reconsider the agency's 1988 rule and that FHWA has agreed to reopen Docket MC&hyph;90&hyph;7 for additional comment on the issue of the appropriate requirements for air disc brakes. FHWA anticipates that a notice will be issued in the near future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rockwell stated that the effect of incorporating the FHWA readjustment limits would be to prohibit future sales of the air disc brake in certain applications. The petitioner argued that this would be anomalous in view of what Rockwell believes is an excellent safety record for the air disc brake system. Rockwell said that the system has been in use on the road for over 10 years, and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [S]ince 1985, Rockwell has been the sole North American manufacturer of air disc brakes. Many using customers have purposefully selected the air disc brake because of its unique performance features. High performance requirements of fire service vehicles, frequent braking requirements of refuse vehicles and minimal brake fade requirements desired by tractor/trailer operators hauling hazardous and flammable cargos are typical air disc brake applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Transportation Safety Board in their April 1992 Heavy Vehicle Airbrake Performance Safety Study noted: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Air disc brakes have several advantages over drum brakes. When subjected to intense braking demands, disc brakes do not suffer the same performance degradations as do drum brakes. Disc brakes also reduce down hill runaways as well as brake imbalances caused by varied brake adjustments on the same vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Design Restrictions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioners raised concerns that the incorporation of the FHWA requirements could hinder technological development, such as that of long stroke brake chambers. (On August 2, 1993, NHTSA published an NPRM to facilitate the use of long stroke brake chambers. 58 FR 41078). Rockwell stated:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

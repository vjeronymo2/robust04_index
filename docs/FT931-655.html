			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Jiang ascends the triple throne: Beijing is again engaged in delicate transition from one generation of leaders to the next TRAVELLING west from the vast Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing along Chang An ('Heavenly Peace') boulevard, you pass on your right huge, studded vermilion gates flanked by a pair of heavy, stone imperial lions. The masses do not dawdle outside these gates, since they would be waved away by smartly attired honour guards of the People's Liberation Army, who snap to attention as black limousines, their windows heavily tinted to hide the identities of the occupants, slide back and forth into the traffic, guided by police outriders. This is the entrance to the ZhongNan Hai (Middle and South Lakes) compound of the Chinese leadership from where the destiny of one-fifth of mankind is guided and where momentous decisions have been taken that have literally rocked the world, including the order in June 1989 to the army to put down pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen square just a few hundred metres to the east. These days, as winter turns to spring in the Chinese capital, things appear relatively calm, although beneath the surface, unease persists; not so much, one suspects, because of lingering animus about the events of June 4, but because China is once again engaged in a delicate transition from one generation of leaders to the next. For the moment, hopes of a smooth transition have been vested in a leadership group that includes Mr Li Peng, the Premier, and Mr Jiang Zemin, the apparently affable Communist Party boss, Chairman of the Central Military Commission and now President, or head of state. Not since Mao Zedong dominated state and party institutions in the 1950s has one man, apart from the briefly-anointed Hua Guofeng (there was no position of president when he served as premier and party boss in the 1970s and early 1980s) had the three roles of head of party, state and military. Thus, the 67-year-old Mr Jiang at the weekend attained a trio of leadership positions that will nominally place him at the very pinnacle of authority in the world's most populous country. As he contemplates his bounty from the high-walled seclusion of the ZhongNan Hai compound, Mr Jiang probably cannot quite believe his good fortune. Nor, it must be said, can many Chinese and foreign observers who are not persuaded that he is of the 'right stuff' to guide his country further into uncharted waters: from a centrally-planned state under rigid communist party diktat to a modernising market-oriented economy under looser central control. Indeed, the fact that he needs to accumulate, or have thrust upon him, responsibilities for the party, state and army is seen not as a sign of strength, but of weakness. Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader who has probably exercised more power in post-revolution China than anyone except Mao himself, has never been premier, president or party boss: he has not needed titles to assert his authority. Mr Jiang, who is being referred to in China's official propaganda as the 'core' of the leadership, was not even a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the normal springboard for even higher office, when he was hastily moved from Shanghai, where he was mayor, to Beijing in mid-1989, just weeks after the Tiananmen massacre. Among his qualifications for the job, apparently, was his lack of direct involvement in the decision to crack down on the protesters. His official profile reveals that he was born in August, 1926 in Yanzhou City, Jiangsu Province in eastern China not far from Shanghai. The son of intellectuals (his communist father Jiang Shangqing is said to have died at the hands of the Kuomintang), Mr Jiang graduated as an engineer from Shanghai's Jiaotong University in 1947, a year after joining the communist party. After the 1949 revolution, there followed a series of fairly humdrum jobs, including boss of a foodstuffs factory. One highlight was his posting to the Soviet Union in 1955 to work in the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow where he learned a smattering of Russian. Chinese propaganda makes much of Mr Jiang's linguistic skills (he is also said to be able to speak English and Romanian) and his musical abilities. Thus Xinhua, China's news agency, in a recent profile, painted a picture of a cultured leader 'capable of appreciating literature, arts, music and painting'. China's new president is married to his childhood sweetheart, Wang Yeping, the former head of a Shanghai engineering research institute. The couple have two sons. There is at least one grandchild. While seeking to present Mr Jiang as an avuncular figure worthy of the love and respect of the masses, the Xinhua biography pointedly mentioned, as might be expected of the putative father of the nation, that he is 'strict with his children'. Little is known of what fate might have befallen him during that defining moment for many of China's leaders, the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976; but it seems that he weathered those storms fairly adequately. Mr Jiang, one suspects, has invariably managed to be politically correct, whatever winds might have been blowing at the time.</p>

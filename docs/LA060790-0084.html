			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NO EXCUSE FOR SHOOTING DOG  </P> <P> Many of the people sending in letters recently about the postman shooting the  dog that was supposedly attacking him either have not been following the case  very closely or have selective memories. The letter of John Gensley of  Calabasas on May 17 comes to mind.  </P> <P> While I agree that the court sentence was excessive, no one has a right to  simply walk up and shoot an animal. Gensley conveniently forgets that the  postman never filed formal complaints against the dog's owners. He claims that  he made complaints, but none were on record. The dog was also in its own front  yard, not running loose. The autopsy also showed the dog was shot from behind,  hardly an attack posture. Gensley also seems to be one of those who feel people  have a right to carry weapons illegally in order to indulge their vigilantist  whims. And speaking of children as victims, what about the little boy whose pet  was shot before his eyes?  </P> <P> MELINDA M. MULLIN  </P> <P> West Hills  </P></p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK, China resume HK airport talks BRITAIN and China resume talks today on Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport project amid signs that China might be prepared to agree terms of a new financial package. Talks about the financing of the HKDollars 165bn (Pounds 13.9bn) project have been stalled since last October when Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, publicised his plans for the colony's political development. Although much construction work for the new airport is under way, China has refused to grant approval to the Hong Kong government's plans for financing the Airport Authority, the manager of the new airport, or approve a financial package for funding a planned railway which will connect the airport to Hong Kong's central business district. Since bilateral talks on the colony's political development began more than a month ago, China has removed some of the blocks to Hong Kong's economic development. This has raised hopes in the colony that China may be prepared to agree the financing of the airport and the railway. Earlier this week Mr Chen Zou'er, a senior official with Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said he hoped the airport could be built by June 1997, when sovereignty over the colony is transferred from Britain to China. Mr Chen reiterated China's position that the project should be cost effective and that it should not constitute a financial burden to the post-1997 government of the colony. Beijing has come under increasing pressure from the business community in Hong Kong - many of whom have been co-opted by China to advise on Hong Kong affairs - to separate the economic aspects of the colony's future from the bilateral dispute about political development. Two weeks ago Beijing waved through three business franchises which span the 1997 change in sovereignty and moved, in short order, to resume talks on the airport and working level discussions within the Joint Liaison Group on other matters relating to the transfer. Hong Kong government officials, while acknowledging the improvement in the atmosphere, said they remained unsure whether Beijing wanted to settle the airport dispute before it had settled the issue of Hong Kong's political development. 'It really depends if they want to do a deal or carry on using the airport as a carrot or a stick,' said one. 'We really do not know.' A month ago the government passed to China a third option for financing the airport and its railway. This provides for a readjustment of the equity and debt structure of the project in a way the government hopes will meet the concerns that China raised over the previous two proposals. Its first financial plan of March last year envisaged debt for the airport and railway of some HKDollars 73bn. Its September proposal cut combined debt to HKDollars 23bn after allowing for an equity injection of HKDollars 40bn, to be funded equally by the present and future governments of Hong Kong. The third proposal, which is a variation of that of September, provides for less equity and more debt. Details of this option are being closely guarded by both sides.</p>

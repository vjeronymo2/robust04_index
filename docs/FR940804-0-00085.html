			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The substantive prohibitions and coverage of title I,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title II, and section 504 overlap to a significant extent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is, therefore, a potential for duplicative efforts by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the many Federal agencies responsible for ensuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with these laws in their processing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaints. Thus, pursuant to section 107(b) of the ADA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department and the Commission are promulgating this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> joint final rule to establish procedures for coordinating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processing of complaints that fall within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overlapping jurisdiction of section 504 and title I of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ADA. For convenience and clarity in processing complaints,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule also incorporates the provisions established by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department's title II rule at 28 CFR 35.171(b)(2)&hyph;(3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for coordinating the processing of complaints against public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities: (i) that fall within the jurisdiction of title II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and title I (but are not covered by section 504); and (ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are covered by title II, but not title I (whether or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not they are also covered by section 504). This reiteration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of title II procedures does not amend or change the title II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation as previously published. The Commission does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> express an opinion on the title II procedures set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> herein, since they merely repeat a previously published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation over which the Commission has no direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority. The Commission and the Department of Labor also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have published joint rules implementing section 107(b) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ADA as it pertains to title I and section 503 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rehabilitation Act. See 29 CFR part 1641, 41 CFR part 60&hyph;742 (57 FR 2960, January 24, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments and Revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission received ten comments in response to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published jointly with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department of Justice on April 21, 1992. 57 FR 14630.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Commission received comments from various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected Federal agencies on both the proposed regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and on the draft final regulation, pursuant to interagency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordination under Executive Order 12067. The Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the Department of Justice have carefully considered all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the comments and made various revisions in response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them. A number of commenters expressed reservations about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the feasibility of the procedures set forth in the NPRM and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested various alternative procedures. Several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters strongly urged that procedures similar to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set forth in the regulation promulgated to coordinate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing of complaints of employment discrimination filed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against recipients of federal financial assistance be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted. See 28 CFR part 42; 29 CFR part 1691 (hereinafter,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the title VI/title VII regulation). The title VI/title VII  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation established procedures for handling complaints of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment discrimination filed against recipients of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal financial assistance subject to title VI of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Civil Rights Act of 1964, title IX of the Education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments of 1972, the State and Local Fiscal Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act of 1972, as amended, and other provisions of Federal law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that prohibit discrimination on grounds of race, color,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> religion, sex, or national origin, in programs or activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving Federal financial assistance, when there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overlapping jurisdiction under title VII of the Civil Rights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act of 1964.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the NPRM's ``first filed approach,'' the EEOC and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any section 504 agency with jurisdiction over a charge or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaint would process those charges or complaints that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were actually filed with it, pursuant to title I of the ADA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or section 504, respectively. In the case of a charge or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaint that was physically filed with both the EEOC and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 504 agency with jurisdiction, the agency that first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received the complaint or charge would process it, absent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special circumstances, while the second agency would defer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing pending the conclusion of the first agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation. Numerous section 504 agencies expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern about the practical difficulties inherent in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM's approach, including ascertaining which agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually received a charge or complaint first in the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a charge or complaint filed with both the EEOC and a section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 504 agency. Accordingly, as suggested by a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters, the final regulation adopts an approach similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to that of the title VI/title VII regulation. Under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule, a complaint solely alleging employment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discrimination against a single individual (hereinafter, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual complaint) that is filed with a section 504  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency with jurisdiction over the complaint will ordinarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be transferred to the EEOC for processing, unless the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complainant specifically requests processing by the section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 504 agency. Section 504 agencies, however, will retain for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing any complaints that allege: (i) a pattern or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice of discrimination in employment; or (ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discrimination both in employment and in other services or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices of a respondent that are covered by section 504.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a comprehensive analysis of the new procedures, see the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion of &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .6, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM presented two options regarding the legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard to be applied by section 504 agencies, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble to the NPRM discussed the rationale for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option. Although numerous comments on these options were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received in response to the NPRM, recent amendments to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rehabilitation Act have resolved this issue. See section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 506 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;569, 106 Stat. 4344. Therefore, as provided in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment, the final regulation directs section 504 agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to apply the standards of title I of the ADA. See the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion of &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .12, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters also requested that time frames for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing of complaints be added to the final regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because, in certain cases, individual agencies may have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that preclude meeting fixed time frames for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain stages of the complaint investigation process, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion has not been adopted. For example, when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure of the complainant's identity is necessary for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the investigation of a section 504 or title II complaint,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department requires receipt of a signed consent form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the complainant prior to notifying a respondent that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department has received a complaint of discrimination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the final regulation retains the more general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that agencies act promptly and in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with applicable law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Various commenters also noted the inefficiency of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that a section 504 agency refer a complaint to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Civil Rights Division for a determination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdiction when the agency does not have section 504  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdiction, but does have title II jurisdiction. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response, the regulation has been revised to require that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaint be referred to the Civil Rights Division only when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the section 504 agency that initially receives the complaint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has neither section 504 nor title II jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ingushetia has again accused North Ossetia of  boycotting the process of normalizing the situation in the area.  A letter to the chairman of the Council of the Federation  Vladimir Shumeyko says the tactics of North Ossetia during the  past year and a half has been procrastinating a settlement by  senseless talks, the failure to carry out approved protocols and  agreements.    The first round of the talks which were supposed to work out  documents for the 2 April meeting of the presidents of North  Ossetia and Ingushetia should have taken place in Terek,  Kabardino-Balkaria on Tuesday. However, according to Interfax  reporters the Ossetian side was late an hour and a half for the  negotiations. The Ingush side regarded this as a demonstration  of disrespect and left for home.    The Ossetian side was late for the meeting because of a car  crash in which two persons were injured and taken to hospital.  The Ingush side waved off the explanation as groundless.</p>

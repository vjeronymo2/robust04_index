			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Letter: Auditors too often blamed instead of the directors Sir, I am writing about the comments in the Lex Column on January 12, regarding the Trafalgar House AGM. As a shareholder and a registered auditor, I think I am well placed to view 'both sides of the coin'. I agree with much of what is said, including that the Caparo judgment does restrict auditors' liability too much. However, it seems to me that too often it is the auditor who is blamed in these situations rather than the directors who are, after all, responsible for the accounts. Auditors' liability is unlimited at present and so it seems are our professional indemnity insurance premiums. I agree with your view that the auditors' duty of care to shareholders should be widened and also that, at the same time, there should be some form of limited liability on auditors. However, limiting auditors' liability may have a perverse effect if an unscrupulous auditor (there may be some) decided the continuing audit fee was worth more than getting caught and incurring the limited penalty.

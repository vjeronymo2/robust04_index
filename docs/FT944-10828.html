			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Team Lotus silent on rescuer Executives of Team Lotus, the grand prix racing team, arrived in Australia yesterday for the final race of the season refusing to identify the team's new owner, which has saved about 100 jobs at the team's headquarters in Ketteringham, Norfolk, John Griffiths writes. Team Lotus, which has no connection with Group Lotus, the engineering group and maker of sports cars, had been in administration since mid-September. The team's buyer may not be identified for several weeks but is expected to launch a renewed attack on the world championship next year.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Curry dashes hopes to increase private rented accommodation Mr David Curry, the housing minister, yesterday dashed hopes that a class of investment trust to increase private rented accommodation would be introduced in the Budget, Robyn Chalmers writes. The trusts aim to boost institutional investment in the private rented sector. They would be free from capital gains tax and pay corporation tax at the lower rate of 25 per cent. Mr Curry said that no industry estimates had been provided on levels of subsidy needed. Once an estimate had been concluded he would be prepared to explore the option in line with the government's stated aim of encouraging growth in the sector.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: The Equitable posts Dollars 29m shortfall in fourth term THE EQUITABLE, the large and troubled US insurance group in which France's Axa holds a 49 per cent stake, yesterday reported an after-tax loss of Dollars 28.9m in the final three months of 1992. This was a sharp reduction on the Dollars 246.9m deficit registered in the same period of 1991. The Equitable, which recently completed a lengthy 'demutualisation' process which turned it into a shareholder-owned company, said that, if results were confined to 'continuing operations', the 1991 final quarter deficit stood at Dollars 161.3m, with the 1992 figure remaining at Dollars 28.9m. The fourth-quarter results mean that The Equitable is posting a Dollars 128.6m deficit for the year after tax, compared with a Dollars 898m loss in 1991. However, both these figures are muddied by special items; the 1992 figure comes after a Dollars 101.3m extraordinary charge to cover demutualisation expenses, and the 1991 result comes after a Dollars 28.3m extraordinary item and a Dollars 561.9m loss from discontinued operations. The insurer said the loss from continuing operations, and before extraordinary charges, improved from a Dollars 307.8m deficit in 1991, to a Dollars 32.2m loss last year. Within the core insurance division, The Equitable reported an annual after-tax loss of Dollars 7.5m, compared with a Dollars 44.8m deficit in 1991. The 1992 figure excludes a loss on investment transactions of Dollars 22.7m, and Dollars 15.6m of restructuring charges. However, the company's continuing investment services operations - which include the Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette brokerage business and the Alliance Capital fund management arm - turned in after-tax profits of Dollars 192.5m, up from Dollars 111.6m.</p>

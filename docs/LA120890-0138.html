			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS LOANS TO UPGRADE BUILDINGS  </P> <P> The City Council has unanimously approved a loan program to upgrade buildings  in the downtown area in order to meet new earthquake standards adopted in  March.  </P> <P> The Redevelopment Agency proposed the loans as an incentive for property owners  to make repairs by 1994 to those buildings that city engineers deem hazardous,  according to agency manager Terry Galvin.  </P> <P> The repair schedule was approved at Tuesday night's council meeting.  </P> <P> Under the program, building owners will receive a $25,000 deferred loan that  must be repaid when the property is sold. If rehabilitation costs exceed that  amount, they are eligible for an additional $25,000 to $100,000, but the owner  must come up with matching funds. This additional, interest-free financing  requires repayment over a 10-year period beginning two years after completion  of the work.ROSE APODACA  </P></p>

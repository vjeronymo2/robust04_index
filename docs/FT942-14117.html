			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Engineer outlines his Italian renaissance - De Benedetti groups are riding post-election stock market euphoria There is little love lost between L'Ingegnere (The Engineer) and Il Cavaliere (The Knight) - alias, respectively, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Olivetti, the Italian computer company, and Mr Silvio Berlusconi, media magnate and prospective Italian prime minister. However, Mr Berlusconi's victory in last month's election, at the head of the right-wing Freedom Alliance, has brought mainly good news for Mr De Benedetti. Within the last two weeks, on the back of post-election stock market euphoria, Italian companies in which the De Benedetti family has an interest have announced plans for large share and convertible bond issues. At the same time, eight Italian and foreign banks have set up a stand-by credit of Dollars 280m for Olivetti. In Paris, Cerus - Mr De Benedetti's French holding company with interests in automotive components, financial services and packaging - is seeking FFr858m (Dollars 145m) through a rights issue. The Italian industrialist, who last year suffered the indignity of a day in jail during an investigation into kickbacks Olivetti paid to Italian politicians, seems to be bouncing back. The early 1990s have been difficult for all the principal De Benedetti companies, both from a public relations and a financial point of view. Olivetti, hit by the downturn in the computer market, lost L650bn (Dollars 384m) in 1992, although it succeeded in raising L903bn through a rights issue last spring. Cerus, dragged down by its loss-making banking operation Dumenil Leble, lost FFr1.55bn in 1992. The impact was felt down to the roots of the De Benedetti family tree. The two Italian holding companies - Cir, which has stakes in Olivetti and Cerus, and Cofide, with its large holding in Cir - both announced net losses for 1992. The De Benedettis, who own nearly 40 per cent of Cofide, were forced to grin and bear it. However, according to analysts, 1993 may have been the turning point. Both Cofide and Cir have just announced net profits for last year. Olivetti and Cerus expect to break even, respectively at operating profit and net profit level, during 1994, and complete far-reaching rationalisation plans. Just before the polls closed in last month's election, Italy's outgoing technocratic government awarded the licence for the country's GSM mobile telecommunications network to the Omnitel/Pronto Italia consortium led by Olivetti. Victory was sweet for Mr De Benedetti, especially as the computer group's principal opponent was a consortium headed by Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest company. That announcement triggered most of the fund-raising announced in the last fortnight. Olivetti estimates that its one-third share in the consortium will commit it to a L1,000bn investment in the mobile telecoms network over the next two to three years, during which the new division will lose money. The convertible bond issue announced at the beginning of the month could raise L500bn to L600bn, and the stand-by credit will help cover the rest, if necessary. To maintain its stake in Olivetti and in Cerus after the share issues, Cir has also asked shareholders for between L500bn and L600bn through a convertible bond issue. The surplus cash should cut borrowings built up when Cir subscribed to last year's Olivetti rights issue. In the same way, Cofide has announced a L154.2bn rights issue to cover its share of the Cir issue. Cash is not only being poured from one De Benedetti bucket into another. Not counting cross-subscription by the different groups to related companies' share and bond issues, an estimated L1bn of new money could still be raised, assuming shareholders approve the operations at meetings in the next few weeks. That cash could be used to improve the holding companies' ability to back organic growth or acquisitions by their subsidiaries as the Italian and European economies begin to strengthen. Mr Rodolfo De Benedetti, Carlo's son and the chief executive of Cir, says one should not look at the recent operations as part of a grand De Benedetti group strategy. 'We're a group in the sense that there's a common shareholder between all these companies, but we are not a group in the sense of a conglomerate,' he explains. Nonetheless, analysts detect an opportunistic flair in the plans which they say is one man's inspiration. 'Obviously these are decisions which come from a precise industrial strategy devised by l'Ingegnere,' comments Mr Matteo Ghilotti of Euromobiliare, the Milan merchant bank. As for the potential for further jousts with Mr Berlusconi, Mr De Benedetti's people are tactfully tight-lipped. But there seems little doubt that if a new Italian government fails to create the conditions for De Benedetti companies to pursue the first faint signs of recovery, the engineer will be quick to criticise his erstwhile rival.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Traders stunned by Bundesbank failure to cut discount rate THE announcement yesterday that the German central bank was not prepared to cut its key discount rate stunned the European government bond markets, which had factored in a reduction of half a percentage point. German government bonds surged on the news, judging the move as a boost to the Bundesbank's credibility in what is increasingly being seen as a battle of wills between speculators and central banks. Bund futures for September delivery traded 35 pfennigs higher at 96.26. French debt prices jumped on the belief that the franc would have to either realign within the European exchange rate mechanism or decouple and cut rates independently. As the franc tumbled, the 10-year Notionnel futures contract rose 30 centimes to 120.48 and hit 120.80 in after-hours dealing. Spanish government bond futures traded in Barcelona gained half a point to 93.25. However, Ecu bonds fell sharply, with the Ecu bond futures contract traded on the French Matif tumbling 32 basis points to 114.48. Dealers had spent the morning gazing at their screens as they waited for the Bundesbank to make an announcement. Barely anyone was prepared to trade, and those that did found it difficult to get a price, particularly in the usually-liquid bund futures market, which saw only 12,000 contracts traded by the early afternoon. Then, at 1.15pm GMT, the Bundesbank announced it was leaving its discount rate, which sets the floor for bank lending, unchanged at 6.75 per cent. It also said its next securities repurchase agreement rate would be fixed at the existing 6.95 per cent, a clear signal that the tight monetary policy will continue. The only sop was a half-point cut in the upper-level Lombard rate, to 7.75 per cent. Mr Wiltse Bailey, an economist with Banque Nationale de Paris, said reports of the death of the ERM were exaggerated. 'French base rates can be held at 8.4 per cent, so the small- and medium-sized companies who have had the most problems will not be affected by the rise in overnight rates,' he said. 'There may be some increase in tension and further tests on Belgium and Denmark, but the ball is in the market's court now. For the Bundesbank, there was a credibility question over giving in to market pressure following the latest data on M3 and inflation. It has refused to buckle and it is a battle of wills now.' After a meeting which lasted nearly four hours, the German central bank put out a curt press statement detailing the changes it was making. It said: 'This measure . . . continues the policy of cautiously reducing interest rates.' As always, it refused to comment on the way the voting went, and said no council members were available for comment. While the meetings are shrouded in secrecy, a few of the 16 council members have hit out at further rate cuts against the background of higher money supply growth and inflation. Most significantly, Mr Johann Gaddum, vice-president designate of the Bundesbank, said last week that if the M3 money supply figure was outside the target range of between 4.5 and 6.5 per cent, there was no justification for a rate cut. His comments were made just before M3 for June came in at 7.1 per cent. OUTSIDE the increasingly strained ERM, UK government bonds continued to soar. Gilts shrugged off any supply worries following Wednesday's Pounds 3.25bn auction of eight-year stock and ignored the potential shock wave from the Christchurch parliamentary by-election. Gilt futures for September gained more than half a point to test record highs at 109. ITALY, also outside the ERM, saw its government bond futures contract shoot 0.80 higher to 105.71. AUSTRALIAN bonds reached a new high in response to the second-quarter current account deficit, which came in at the bottom of expectations. The long end performed most strongly as inflationary pressures remain low. August 2003 T-bond yields crashed through 7 per cent to 6.90 per cent, pushing prices up by more than a percentage point. AN UNEXPECTEDLY weak second-quarter gross domestic product report, and a big rise in weekly jobless claims, provided a firm boost to US Treasury prices yesterday. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 3/32 at 107 3/16 , yielding 6.568 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32 at 100 7/32 , to yield 4.118 per cent. Trading was heavy. The eagerly-awaited GDP numbers delighted bond traders and investors. The 1.6 per cent rise in GDP was well below market forecasts, which had been looking for growth of 2.2 per cent. Sentiment was also buoyed by the news that the implicit price deflator, a closely-followed measure of inflation, rose only 2.6 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 3.3 per cent in the first three months of the year. Prices, especially at the long end, rose sharply after the data was released. This was because market participants believed the unexpectedly weak second-quarter growth would definitely rule out any chance of an interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve. Only last week, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had predicted second-quarter GDP growth of at least 2 per cent, and had warned that rates might have to go up if inflation picked up too strongly. Treasuries were also aided by a larger-than-expected 43,000 rise in weekly jobless claims, and by a report in the Washington Post that the Fed had not eliminated the possibility of a cut in interest rates. GREECE is raising the rate on its one-year dollar-linked drachma bond to 4.25 per cent from 4.10 per cent, Reuter reports. The rate on the three-year dollar-linked drachma bond will rise to 5.80 per cent.</p>

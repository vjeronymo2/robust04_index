			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with African National Congress spokesperson Carl </F> Niehaus by SABC reporter Rodney Trudgeon on the "Radio Today"  program -- live]    [Text] [Trudgeon] The ANC [African National Congress] has  announced various prominent members of society to represent the  organization in the April elections. However, many of these  candidates, including a former Springok rugby player, have not  yet accepted their nominations. On the line now, we have ANC  spokesman Carl Niehaus. Mr. Niehous, good morning. How  predictable are these nominations? Were most of them expected?    [Niehaus] Good morning. Actually, the nominations have been  a very wide group of people that all the different Mass  Democratic Movement organizations in South Africa have come  forward with. So one would get a much wider net than just  simply members of the ANC, and I suppose in that context some of  the names that have been proposed may be surprising to members  of the media.    [Trudgeon] How significant is it that a lot of these pople  have not yet accepted their nominations?    [Niehaus] Well, I think that indicates that the lists that  have now become public are only provisional lists; that one  cannot at this stage say that any particular person is yet going  to stand as a candidate for the ANC, or is in fact going to be  elected to Parliament. All of that depends on whether those  candidates are prepared to accept their nominations, and then of  course there are still provincial lists conferences this coming  weekend, where the 14 different regions of the ANC's nominations  will be consolidated into the 9 provinces, and then of course  there will be a national list conference on 15 January, where  the final lists will be consolidated, and they will be made  public on 18 January. So only on 18 January will we be able to  present to South Africa a final list of candidates which will  stand for the ANC and would have actually accepted their  nominations.    [Trudgeon] Now a feature of the nomination list is, quite a  few media and sports personalities. I'm thinking of people like  Bruce Fordyce, Felicia Mabuza-Suttle, Jacqui Mofekeng, the Miss  South Africa. This aspect of the list has in fact been  criticized, for example, by the National Party.    [Niehaus] Well, you know, the National Party can express  their criticism, but the fact of the matter is that there are  many people, prominent persons in South African society, who  associate themselves far more with the ideals of nonracialism  and democracy, as the ANC has fought for it through all the  decades, and one will probably find that some of these prominent  personalities will accept nomination. That is also not anything  new. Throughout the world, for example in the United States,  there have been, from time to time, members of the cultural  community, actors, etcetera, who have shown their support for a  particular political organization, because they share those  ideals. But I must emphasize that many of the persons who are  mentioned there -- sportsmen, actors, etcetera -- have not yet  been approached, and their nominations still have to be checked  with them, and only after they have made a decision can one  actually say that they have accepted it, and that they are  prepared to associate themselves, on that particular level, with  the ANC.    [Trudgeon] Perhaps one of the most important omissions,  which  I notice newspapers and the media have taken up in general, is  that Winnie Mandela is absent from both lists. Is there any  significance in that?    [Niehaus] Well, I don't think one should read too much  significance in it. The lists that you have received now are a  list for the provisional parliament candidatures of the PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region, and also the PWV  region's nominations for the National Assembly. But there is  also a general National Assembly list which has been voted on,  but that counting has not been finished yet, and therefore it  has not been made public, and on that list, as one of the  nominees, Mrs. Mandela did appear. So her name can still  appear, depending on how the voting went on the national list  for the National Assembly.    [Trudgeon] There has also apparently been sweeping support  for Peter Mokaba, the youth leader.    [Niehaus] Yes. That is the situation, that there has been  strong support for Mr. Mobkaba.    [Trudgeon] Mr. Niehaus, one of the criticisms leveled at  your  list came from Wits [Witwatersrand University] political analyst  Professor Tom Lodge, who mentioned that the list is perhaps a  little short of business talent. Now I know you have people  like Sam Motsuenyane being nominated. How do you feel about the  lack of business talent?    [Niehaus] Well, I don't think there is a lack of business  talent. Again, it is unfortunate that categorical statements  about these lists are being made at a stage when, really, only  the list of the PWV region is now public. There are namy, many  other provinces and regions that have made nominations, and  there are also a considerable number of busines people on the  national list for the National Assembly. So I would caution  that analysts must wait until the final list comes out, before  they can make those kinds of deductions.    [Trudgeon] It's also significant that some of the people who  have been nominated are not really standing, because they  belong, now, to other organizations. I'm thinking of Rev. Frank  Chikane, and also Mr. Zwelakhi Sisulu, who has been appointed  Mr. Harmse's assistant here at the SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation].    [Niehaus] Well, what has happened is that we left the  nomination process open, so that anyone could be nominated, and  then we leave it up to those particular individuals, in  consultation with the ANC, to accept their nominations or to  decline. Rev. Chikane has already indicated that he declines  because he is not eligible to stand for any political  organization, because of his position as a member of the  Independent Electoral Commission. I believe the same will  account for Mr. Sisulu, who is now the deputy to Mr. Harmse, or  at least the nominated deputy to Mr. Harmse at the SABC.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / French and US end Aids research feud: Americans agree to climbdown on royalties for HIV testing kits French and US health researchers said yesterday they had reached a settlement in the bitter medical feud which erupted in the 1980s over who should reap the commercial and scientific rewards for discovering the Aids virus. The agreement, between the US National Institutes of Health and France's Pasteur Institute, will provide the French with a bigger share of the royalties from the sale of testing kits for HIV, the virus that causes Aids. The deal represents a climbdown by the Americans who also acknowledged officially that 'scientists at NIH used a virus provided to them by (the Pasteur Institute) to invent the American HIV test kit'. Dr Harold Varmus, NIH director, said the agreement should 'normalise the sometimes rocky relations' between his agency and the Pasteur Institute. The French called the accord 'a satisfactory conclusion' to the concerns raised. Yesterday's settlement replaces a 1987 agreement which gave the two sides equal credit for discovering the virus and was supposed to divide the royalties from the testing kits equally between the US and France. In fact, since the agreement NIH has received about Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.1m) in royalties and the Pasteur Institute about Dollars 14m, because more US testing kits are sold than French kits. This discrepancy - and the 1991 acknowledgement of Dr Robert Gallo, the US researcher credited with discovering HIV, that he had accidently used a French virus sample in developing his test - angered the French who threatened to sue to recover royalty payments. Dr Gallo was cleared of any misconduct by an internal review last year. But yesterday's acknowledgment by NIH means that Dr Luc Montagnier, the French co-discoverer of the virus, will receive more scientific credit. Under the latest agreement, each country will be allowed to keep the first 20 per cent of royalties from the sale of kits. However, the remaining royalties will be pooled and divided under a new formula - 50 per cent will go to France, 25 per cent to the US and 25 per cent to the World Aids Foundation, an international research charity. The Pasteur Institute will receive 'several hundred thousand more dollars per year' as a result of the new deal, an NIH spokesman said.</p>

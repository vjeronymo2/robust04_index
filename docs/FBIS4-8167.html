			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Robert Krasowski: "Everyone Is Waiting for the </F> President's Move; Budget '94--Will Lech Walesa Use the Veto?"]    [Text] The president has two more weeks in which to  make a decision on the Budget Law. Many politicians from the  governing coalition fear that Lech Walesa will wait until the  last moment, so as not to lose a bargaining chip. After the  decision made by the Democratic Union [UD], everyone knows that,  even if the veto is used by the president, it will be  overturned. According to the most drastic scenario, the veto  could be a pretext for dissolving the parliament.    Shortly after he received the draft of the Budget Law, the  president stated that he has many reservations with regard to  it, and that is why he does not know yet whether he will sign  it. According to the president, the budget, which was prepared  by the left-wing government, was adapted to the country's  economic capabilities. That is true enough, but it also  completely contradicts promises made before the elections.    "The nation will feel cheated again," Walesa says.    Two weeks passed since that time, and, throughout the  period,  the president did not make a decision. Sejm Speaker Jozef  Oleksy tried to persuade the president on Thursday [7 April] to  make a decision as soon as possible, so as to enable the  coalition to "know where it stands."    According to the Small Constitution, the president has 30  days in which to take a stand on a budget, which means he has  precisely two more weeks to keep the coalition in suspense.  According to many politicians from the coalition, the president  will procrastinate until the last moment because the threat of a  veto may be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations regarding  filling the posts of deputy prime minister for economic affairs  and of finance minister.    But, following Saturday's statement by UD, to the effect  that  the party will not support a possible presidential veto, it has  become obvious that the coalition will have no problem  whatsoever pushing the budget through. Only the date of its  enactment could be a problem. A few days ago, Defense Ministry  [MON] chief Piotr Kolodziejczyk tried to persuade the president  to submit the budget to the Constitutional Tribunal. According  to Kolodziejczyk, the Budget Law interferes with MON's powers to  an unacceptable extent by telling the ministry what kind of arms  equipment it is supposed to purchase and where. If the  president vetoes the budget and sends it to the Tribunal, the  Sejm will not be able to adopt the budget until after a verdict  has been rendered by the Tribunal.    A dissolution of the Sejm is the most radical scenario; it  is  being mentioned by some politicians. The Small Constitution  provides that the president is empowered to dissolve parliament  if it fails to adopt a budget within three months. Actually,  the Sejm did manage to adopt it this time, but an argument could  be raised that enactment of the budget by the Sejm involves not  only its adoption by the Sejm and debates on the Senate's  amendments, but also taking a stand on a possible presidential  veto. Under this interpretation, three months passed a long  time ago, but, according to legal experts, no justification can  be found for the above argument in the Small Constitution.</p>

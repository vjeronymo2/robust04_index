			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMFY JOE COULD HAVE WON THIS FROM EASY CHAIR;  </P> <P> QUARTERBACK: MONTANA IS AS RELAXED AS EVER, THANKS TO FAMILY, FRIENDS AND  WALSH'S PLAYS.  </P> <P> These were a few of his favorite things:  </P> <P> His kids' picture in his locker. Dwight Clark's jersey in the one next to his.  The Denver Broncos in his crosshairs. Bill Walsh's playbook at his fingertips.  </P> <P> Walsh, himself, a lot farther away than that?  </P> <P> Scouting report for future 49er foes: Whatever you do, don't ever let Joe  Montana get as comfortable as he did Sunday when he capped his -- anyone's? --  most memorable season with another grand game.  </P> <P> He went 22 for 29 for 297 yards and threw five touchdown passes, a Super Bowl  record. He has a career total of 11 touchdown passes in Super Bowls, another  Super Bowl record. He was named the game's most valuable player for the third  time. You guessed it, another Super Bowl record.  </P> <P> At age 33, his regular-season passing rating, 112.4, was an NFL record. In  three postseason games, he completed 78.3% of his passes for 11 touchdowns and  no interceptions.  </P> <P> In three postseason first halves, en route to what would become three routs, he  completed 79.4% for nine touchdowns.  </P> <P> Like, what was left in the way of compliments?  </P> <P> "He's probably the greatest quarterback ever to play this game," Coach George  Seifert said.  </P> <P> "Well, he's not looking up at anyone, that's for sure," said Steve Young,  caught in the anguish/admiration of backing up a legend.  </P> <P> But comfort can be hard to come by, so let's start with the picture.  </P> <P> It has Joe's two young daughters and his infant son, posed with Joe's three  Super Bowl rings. Underneath is engraved, "OK, Daddy, The Next Ring Is For  You."  </P> <P> Montana's wife, Jennifer, had it made up.  </P> <P> "I have only one thing to say to her," said Joe, laughing Sunday night. "She  can have that one. I'll take the next one."  </P> <P> About the jersey . . .  </P> <P> Dwight Clark, now retired, was Montana's closest friend on the 49ers, then or  since. Clark made The Catch of Montana's pass to win the NFC title game against  Dallas in 1982. The 49er equipment man recently took to hanging Clark's old  jersey where Montana could see it. The first thing Montana did after this game  was put on a sweat shirt from Clark's restaurant to plug it through the  postgame interviews.  </P> <P> "Just a ghost from the past," said Montana, grinning. "A good one."  </P> <P> About Walsh, Young, and this roll that Joe's on . . .  </P> <P> It wasn't always this way. Can anyone remember how badly the 1988 season was  going for Montana, right up until the last month?  </P> <P> The '86 season had ended with then-Giant Jim Burt blasting him into Never-Never  Land. The '87 season ended with an upset loss to the Vikings.  </P> <P> In the off-season, there were reports that Walsh and owner Eddie DeBartolo  wanted to trade Montana to the Chargers for Billy Ray Smith; that the Chargers  turned it down.  </P> <P> The '88 season began with Walsh declaring a competition for the No. 1 spot  between Montana and Young.  </P> <P> In Game 11 of the '88 season, the Raiders beat the 49ers in Candlestick Park,  9-3. Montana looked awful. The 49ers were 6-5 and looked out of it.  </P> <P> What, him worry?  </P> <P> Joe says he never got down.  </P> <P> "I worry emotionally because I'm his wife," Jennifer said. "It hurts to know  when he's capable of doing so much and yet not having the opportunity because  he was being shuffled back and forth. I thought that was unjust. But it's like  Joe said, 'That's not anybody's fault but Bill's.' And you have to have respect  for your coach.  </P> <P> "Whether he agrees with Bill's decisions or not, he's always had the utmost  respect for him. And that's what he'll say over and over. You never heard it. I  didn't hear it around the house. He never bad-mouths Bill."  </P> <P> And yet, mustn't there have been some resentment?  </P> <P> "It wasn't resentment," Jennifer said. "It was just, he didn't understand any  of it because he felt he'd had a great season the year before (1987), which he  did. He didn't feel there was any justification for putting Steve in, and  moving Joe back and forth. But I don't think there were any hard feelings."  </P> <P> In a great irony, between Walsh and Montana, the mentor who designed the scheme  and the wizard who ran it, there was always a certain tension.  </P> <P> If Montana really wasn't smoldering, well maybe that was just Joe.  </P> <P> He's modest to a fault. Jennifer says he almost blushes when she compliments  him. He's amiable, easygoing, laid-back off the field almost to the point of  being comatose.  </P> <P> "He's a nice down-to-earth guy," says a teammate, "but he has the personality  of a piece of bread."  </P> <P> In the last month of the '88 season, Montana pulled himself together. He led  the 49ers to their late-drive, come-from-behind Super Bowl victory over  Cincinnati. He rolled right through the '89 season. He rolled through Super  Bowl week, when his ex-wife Cass sold the story of their breakup to the  National Enquirer, and he got dragged in on a drug story, although no evidence  involving him had ever surfaced.  </P> <P> He kept right on rolling Sunday night. By his reckoning, the Broncos only  knocked him off his feet once or twice. He had them down for the count by  halftime.  </P> <P> "That's something I'm working on," Young said. "You can get overly emotional.  You throw a bad pass, you don't see someone you should see, you make a mistake  in the heat of the moment.  </P> <P> "I think he's one of the best at it -- he'll just immediately pace the  sideline, thinking about the next series. I mean, we're up 50-something to 10  and he's pacing the sideline, thinking about the next series.  </P> <P> "The tough times take a lot out of everybody. The good times take a lot out of  everybody. I don't think he lets it outwardly show. People get used to him  being the steady force on this team. Because of that, we'll get in games where  we'll be down by a few touchdowns, or like this last controversy. You always  look at Joe so if he's down or something -- oh my gosh! Something's really  wrong! But that's never happened.  </P> <P> "You notice in our postgame party, there's no champagne. We said the Lord's  Prayer. I mean how many Lord's Prayers have you had in championship locker  rooms? I mean, this is a business-as-usual kind of thing. Half the guys in the  locker room are probably walking around saying, 'Let's go do it again,' because  we're just that efficient. I think we kind of show ourselves for the people we  follow."  </P> <P> So what's it like for Young?  </P> <P> "It's lousy sometimes, because you equally want your shot with this offense.  And then at other times, it's inspiring. I think it's a paradox. I'll just  leave it at that.  </P> <P> "If there's any hope for me to play here, I want to be here. Maybe Joe can play  'til he's 40, but I know I can play 'til I'm 40, too."  </P> <P> Sunday night was one of the inspiring ones.  </P> <P> Montana was asked what he plans to do next.  </P> <P> "I'm going to take a nice nap," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JOE MONTANA'S SUPER BOWL RECORDS  </P> <P> GAME  </P> <P> Touchdown passes -- 5 vs. Denver, 1990.

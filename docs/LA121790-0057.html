			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER HOPEFUL OF LAST-CHANCE TRIP TO BAGHDAD  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III expressed optimism Sunday that the United  States and Iraq will settle their quarrel over dates in time for him to visit  Baghdad for a last-chance attempt to avert war.  </P> <P> At the same time, however, Baker told reporters traveling with him to a North  Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he is convinced that the American  public and the world community will blame Iraq instead of the United States if  proposed high-level contacts collapse in the dispute over a difference of only  nine days.  </P> <P> "We hope something can be arranged," Baker said when asked if he believes that  the impasse will be broken. Iraq proposed Jan. 12 for Baker's visit to Baghdad,  but President Bush said that any date after Jan. 3 is too close to the U.N.  Security Council's deadline for Iraq to end its occupation of Kuwait.  </P> <P> "We are offering any one of the following dates as a possible date for the  meeting in Baghdad: Dec. 20, Dec. 21, Dec. 22, Dec. 23, Dec. 24, Dec. 25. . .  ," Baker said, slowly intoning every date between Dec. 20 and Jan. 3, including  Christmas and New Year's Day.  </P> <P> A senior State Department official later told reporters aboard Baker's aircraft  that the secretary of state would go to Iraq on Christmas Day if Iraqi  President Saddam Hussein asked him to do so, although he would much rather be  at home on the holiday.  </P> <P> Baker also refused to rule out a compromise date between Jan. 3 and Jan. 12.  </P> <P> "It's customary and even traditional when you are talking about holding  diplomatic discussions and meetings that the two sides should agree on when and  where those meetings will be held," he said.  </P> <P> When the U.N. Security Council voted Nov. 29 to authorize the use of force to  drive Iraq out of Kuwait, the 15-nation council fixed a deadline more than six  weeks into the future to give diplomats a last chance to settle the crisis.  </P> <P> Since the U.N. vote, however, nothing much has happened on the diplomatic  front, and the most dramatic initiative -- Bush's proposal for Iraqi Foreign  Minister Tarik Aziz to come to Washington and Baker to visit Baghdad -- is in  danger of falling apart.  </P> <P> Asked if there will be any additional attempts to find a peaceful solution,  Baker said only, "Stay tuned."  </P> <P> However, he rejected suggestions that Congress, the U.S. public and allied  nations might question the U.S. resolve to "go the extra mile" in search of  peace if the Aziz and Baker meetings are aborted over a narrow point of  protocol.  </P> <P> "We are being very forthcoming," Baker said. " . . . It does seem to me that  people will understand that, so far at least, there is an effort on the part of  the Iraqi government to manipulate the President's good-faith offer of  discussions.  </P> <P> "The international community has made it as clear as they can that they are  serious about the authorization for the use of all necessary means (to force  Iraq out of Kuwait)," he said. "There doesn't seem to me, at least, to have  been any walking away from that or any suggestions by any members of the  international coalition than the (U.N.) resolution meant something other than  specifically what it said."  </P> <P> Baker said he plans to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis with the foreign  ministers of the 15 other NATO countries during the alliance's annual winter  meeting today and Tuesday.  </P> <P> Unlike special NATO meetings earlier in the crisis, Baker said he will not make  any new requests for the allies to increase their military or financial  contributions to the anti-Iraq coalition, although he will remind the foreign  ministers that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney recently asked NATO defense  ministers to provide additional ships and aircraft to transport troops and  materiel to the gulf.  </P> <P> Baker also said the NATO ministers will discuss accusations that the Soviet  Union has tried to cheat on the recently signed Conventional Forces in Europe  Treaty by undercounting the tanks, artillery and combat aircraft that are  stationed in Europe. He said the meeting also will consider charges that Moscow  has tried to evade the treaty by moving some tanks and other weapons into  Soviet Asia, which is not covered by the agreement, although he said this  action apparently is not a technical violation of the agreement.  </P> <P> On a related subject, Baker said the United States has warned the Soviets that  if they use police repression to prevent "the emergence of rudimentary markets"  in the country's crumbling planned economy, it would reverse the warming trend  in U.S.-Soviet relations. However, he said Washington has no objection to  enforcement of "reasonable laws."  </P> <P> Asked to elaborate, he said the United States objects to the use of police  power to prevent farmers from holding their produce off the market in hopes of  a better price because such behavior is driven by market factors even though it  technically violates Soviet law. But he said it would be appropriate for Soviet  police to crack down on hijacking and theft.  </P> <P> "We've made the determination that instability in the Soviet Union is not in  our interest nor in the interest of the world," he said. "We want to see the  reform process continue. We take note of the degree to which it proceeded with  a great deal more rapidity than anyone thought was possible. We take note that  the central authorities in the Soviet Union meant it when they said they would  not use force to prevent Central and Eastern Europe from reforming."  </P></p>

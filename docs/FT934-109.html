			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Salomon's trader has to pay up Mr Thomas Murphy, former senior Salomon Brothers bond trader, has been ordered by the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay Dollars 300,000 in civil penalties for his part in the Treasury auction scandal which nearly brought the Wall Street securities firm to its knees in 1991. He was also barred from the securities industry for two years, and prohibited from taking any proprietary or supervisory roles in the business for five years. In consenting to the judgment, Mr Murphy neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations that he submitted false customer bids in three auctions of US government securities in 1990 and falsified books and records of the bids. Two weeks ago Mr Paul Mozer, a former colleague on Salomon's bond trading desk, was jailed for four months and fined Dollars 30,000 after pleading guilty to lying to Treasury officials over the bids. The scandal erupted in Aug-ust 1991 when it was found that the bond desk had bid for government securities on behalf of customers without their knowledge, and that Sal-omon executives had known about such bids for months before telling the authorities.</p>

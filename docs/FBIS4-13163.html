			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister has launched a series of  consultations with senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] elements,  including the chief of staff and the Intelligence Branch chief,  as to Israel's consent to withdraw on the Golan Heights.  Intelligence Branch Chief Uri Sagi has made two trips to  Washington recently, and one of his visits has been kept secret  until now.    The meetings are part of the drafting of a working paper  entitled The Israel-Syria Peace Package, and it outlines the  Israeli stands on an agreement with Syria.    Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports that the  proposal will be submitted to U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, who is slated to arrive in the region in about 10  days.    Likud elements asserted that by proposing to withdraw from  the Golan while al-Asad-inspired katyushas are being launched at  the Galilee, Rabin is behaving with obduracy.</p>

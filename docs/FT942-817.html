			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Dutch parties fail to agree An historic attempt to form a Dutch government without the Christian Democrats failed yesterday, creating a chance for outgoing prime minister Ruud Lubbers to return to power despite his party's heavy losses in the May general election. Talks lasting six weeks among the other three main political parties were called off after they failed to agree on cuts in the Netherlands' social security system. The right-wing Liberals wanted heavy spending cuts, which were opposed by Labour and left-of-centre D66. The Christian Democrats and their forerunner parties have belonged to every Dutch coalition since the first world war and have never been pushed into opposition.</p>

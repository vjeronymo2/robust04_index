			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Management: University challenge at De Montfort / A look at issues forcing departments to think in terms of cost-efficiency and rapid expansion / Public Services Management De Montfort University in Leicester has a grand vision. Its aim is to be 'internationally competitive' and 'everywhere excellent'. Bold words from an institution known as Leicester Polytechnic until two years ago. But De Montfort is well on the way to making a reality of this vision. It is western Europe's fastest growing university, according to the World Bank, and attracts investment from both the UK government and the private sector for projects such as its new, massive and imaginatively designed engineering faculty building. The university is also making a new role for itself in local communities. Kenneth Barker, vice-chancellor, believes that higher education 'has been too busy chasing Nobel Prizes instead of giving industry and the community the service they really need'. This breezy attitude to the opportunities created by higher education expansion has manifested itself in a sheaf of plans to boost recruitment. De Montfort's marketing department has ex-tended for a second year the most expensive university advertising campaign mounted in the UK. Innovations to course structure are also planned to chisel away lingering perceptions of De Montfort as a former polytechnic. Mike Brown, an executive pro-vice-chancellor and one of the key managers in the university's expansion, has held discussions with independent schools about allowing pupils to start a De Montfort degree course in their last year at school. The university's cause will also be helped by serving industry as directly as possible. A limited company, Leicester Expertise, now markets the university's know-how to companies, and has helped funnel consultancy fees to the university's technical specialists. All this institutional change has been managed during rapid expansion. In 1987, 8,000 students were on Leicester Polytechnic's roll: in the current academic year that figure is nearer 18,000 while new campuses in Lincoln and Bedford will bring numbers up to 25,000 this year. Managing change on this scale is not easy. The main elements in De Montfort's strategy, according to Brown, are an innovative executive structure modelled on private-sector companies, and an approach to cost control that makes individual departments directly responsible for both costs and revenue. Beneath the board of governors, which includes Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, is a vice-chancellor who doubles with the role of 'chief executive', and then four executive pro-vice-chancellors, including Brown, whose jobs are chiefly managerial. Below them come 'cost centres', which include both support services, such as those for accommodation and catering, and academic cost centres. These include the university's 'schools' - applied sciences, arts and humanities, built environment, business, combined studies, computing studies, design and manufacture, engineering and manufacture, health and community studies, and law. These cost centres are 'the first point where academic aspirations meet resource reality', Brown says. 'The philosophy was to have the academic and the resources units coinciding, headed by someone who was an eminent academic with the ability to manage.' Each school was required to set targets for the next five years, in the form of a series of performance indicators. Brown ensured they were aware of their costs and the attributed income they brought in each year - including government tuition fees, government and corporate research funding. He also made it 'quite clear' to the schools that if they could not justify their existence in financial terms they would be shut. In fact, several schools have seen a sharp increase in the effective profits they have generated - in one case exceeding Pounds 1m. This was not the victory of commercial incentives over academic freedom: De Montfort's growth strategy allowed for the possibility that some departments might deserve a cross-subsidy, to help nurture the standing of the entire institution. Brown's contribution was to establish a mechanism that made the cross-subsidies transparent, and forced academics to think in terms of cost-efficiency. Without this discipline, De Montfort's sharp expansion would almost certainly not have been possible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Paz Lopez-Hermida] </F>   [Excerpts] Officials are quite optimistic that in the near  future Chile may join either the North American Free Trade  Agreement (TLC, or NAFTA) or achieve a bilateral trade agreement  with the United States.    Before choosing between these two options, which is already  being negotiated in Washington, Chile must commit itself to  improving its intellectual property system, among other things.  This probably involves one of the most complex issues of  Chilean legislature, affecting thousands of people.    For the time being, nothing has been decided on the changes  that must be made. The studies that are being made center on a  TLC chapter referring specifically to intellectual property and  the negotiations that Chilean officials have been conducting  with the White House. No matter what is decided, intellectual  property is an important issue that must be studied. Mexico is  well aware of this, as when it negotiated its entrance in NAFTA  last year this was one of the issues that raised the most  difficulties.    The issue that will cause the most difficulties is probably  that of medicine patents. Chile was the first Latin American  country to implement regulation for the protection of  pharmaceutical inventions. This will be the "letter of  presentation" for achieving a treaty.    The United States is, however, demanding from its commercial  partners regulations that are rejected by some local sectors.    One of the issues to be amended in the current legislation  refers to the period of time during which a patent holder is  granted a monopoly to exploit one product. The TLC establishes  that the duration of this monopoly must be 20 years from the  time the patent is requested. In Chile this period lasts for  only 15 years from the time the patent is granted. The Economy  Ministry has explained, however, that this issue should not  raise many problems, because in practice the proceedings  involved for the issuance of a patent may take up to 2 or 3  years. This means that in Chile a patent may last for up to 18  years from the time it is requested.    There are problems concerning the second issue that should  be  amended in Chilean legislation in view of the TLC. It concerns  the recognition of patents granted abroad before the Chilean  regulation was enforced. When the patent law was approved in  1991, it was explained that it was not applicable to existing  medication because one of the requirements for requesting a  patent is that it should be an innovation at the international  level. This article is precisely the one the United States  wants changed.    The Association of Pharmaceutical Industries and  Laboratories  (Asilfa) is opposed to this possibility. Asilfa Chairman Miriam  Orellana said that such an amendment would erase from the market  a large percentage of inexpensive medicines, which would affect  consumers. To justify her argument she cites the case of  Mexico, which in 1991 had to accept a clause retroactive to  1987. Orellana said: "Prices experienced a considerable  increase, and the promises of greater foreign investment fell  through when many companies shut down their local factories  because imported products were preferred."    However, it is not only a question of drafting amendments.  There is no Chilean legislation on some of the issues demanded  by the TLC, and we will be compelled to make commitments during  the negotiations. Experts say that there are many technical  details that must be studied.    Among them is the industrial secrets issue, which in the  United States is controlled by extensive and strict regulation.  It deals with any technical knowledge of important value to a  company and which that company does not want revealed. [passage  omitted]    In Chile some laws state that an employee cannot divulge  confidential information of the company he works for, but we  must draft legislation that includes stricter measures on  company secrets.    Another issue absent from Chilean legislation is that  concerning integrated circuits. The United States asks for  special legislation covering integrated circuit designs that  currently allow the operation of any electronic device.  Integrated circuits are not included in the law because the  current level of national technology does not allow a true  incursion into this field. It is obvious, however, that for  more developed countries these constitute a major business.    Beyond any conflicts of interest that may arise, most people  believe that any amendments to the legislation should aim at  decreasing the piracy of legally patented works. [passage  omitted]    Many believe that the secret lies in officials not  discussing  issues separately, but as a package. The idea is that although  we have to yield on some issues, in others we can make Chilean  interests prevail.</p>

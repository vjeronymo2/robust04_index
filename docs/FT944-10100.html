			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Gambian rebellion put down Gambia's young military rulers yesterday foiled a coup attempt by junior army officers in the west African tourist haven in which three plotters were killed in a shootout. Lieutenant Yahya Jammeh, the 29-year-old military strongman who toppled veteran president Sir Dawda Jawara in a bloodless coup in July, accused the officers of plotting to install a government with no civilians and planning to blow up fuel storage tanks if they failed. Some 130,000 tourists, half of them British, flock to Gambia's palm-fringed Atlantic beaches each year. A Britannia Airways Boeing 767 flight en route to Gambia turned back yesterday after the Foreign Office advised Britons not to visit the country.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Letter: Real competition would save coal from being marginalised Sir, David Lascelles ('Coal on his Christmas list', November 30) quotes our evidence to the trade and industry select committee: 'What we need is price decreases, not price increases.' The threat to ICI's chlorine production is evidence enough. But why do we assume that saving UK coal by increasing its share of the energy market would raise prices to consumers or cost taxpayers? Sufficient evidence is available confirming that coal, under private-sector management, could not only under-price the 'dash for gas' but compete with imports. If coal had been privatised before electricity, no fix would now be required. The industry should be offered for sale immediately, with a transitional government 'dowry' while productivity is improved further. Second, the electricity market should be liberalised, not stitched up even further. Overcapacity, as in any other market, should be reflected by downward pressure on prices. In a genuine competitive market, only the lowest cost power would sell. The economics of gas versus coal would then be subjected to the market test. Deferring the extension of the contract market below 1MW from the 1994 timetable would be unacceptable. Large multiple site users such as retailers, banks, hotels, and local authorities - organisations with many sites each below 1MW but, in total, large electricity consumers - look forward to shopping around. The solution of Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is to establish the genuine competition in coal, gas, nuclear and electricity, which government promised but has so far failed to provide. Energy policy would then not be 'in a mess', our coal would not have become marginalised and prices to consumers would be lower.

			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN GETS 25 YEARS IN SHOOTING THAT KILLED 2 AND WOUNDED 6  </P> <P> A judge sentenced Roman Gabriel Menchaca to 25 years to life in prison Friday  for conspiracy in a gang-retaliation shooting last year that left six people  wounded and two dead, one a 17-year-old and the other a 4-year-old on the way  to the movies with his family.  </P> <P> Sitting in the back of Superior Court Judge Tully H. Seymour's courtroom were  two rows of young Menchaca supporters, dressed alike in bright, white T-shirts  imprinted with large black letters that read: "Not Guilty."  </P> <P> Authorities have called the Sept. 16, 1989, shooting in Garden Grove the worst  gang-related incident in the county. Two young men in the back of a pickup  truck opened fire on La Bonita Avenue just after dark, causing more than a  dozen people to flee or duck for cover.  </P> <P> Killed were 4-year-old Frankie Fernandez Jr., sitting in the back of his  family's car, and Mike (Smokey) Navarro, 17, who may have been a primary target  of the assailants. Prosecutors claim that Menchaca and other 5th Street gang  members were retaliating against the 17th Street gang, which includes La Bonita  in its turf, for an earlier shooting of a 5th Streeter.  </P> <P> Convicted of murder in the shooting were Louis P. Valadez, 28, and Robert P.  Figueroa, 20, who face automatic prison terms of life without parole when  sentenced next Friday. Also convicted of murder in the incident was a  15-year-old juvenile, scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 2.  </P> <P> The juvenile and Menchaca, now 20, were accused by witnesses of being the two  gunmen. However, a jury deadlocked on the murder count and instead convicted  Menchaca of conspiracy to commit murder, which carries an automatic 25-year  term unless modified by Seymour.  </P> <P> Micki Comacho, mother of the slain Navarro, made an impassioned plea at  Friday's sentencing:  </P> <P> "I've known Roman since he was 8 or 9 years old; why did he want to hurt me  this way," she said. Then she turned to Menchaca and added, "If you wanted to  hurt my son, why didn't you take me instead. Then he would have hurt, then he  would have suffered."  </P> <P> Menchaca attorney C. Thomas McDonald also made a brief but biting statement to  the judge.  </P> <P> "This verdict is based on the perjured testimony of rival, vindictive gang  members who will say or do anything to convict a rival gang member," the  defense lawyer said.  </P> <P> But Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef told Seymour that "the only way to educate  these gang members is to give them the maximum sentence and publicize it to  their cohorts."  </P> <P> Authorities feared that the shooting incident would go unsolved until three  young women who had been a part of the 17th Street gang came forward --  breaking the gang's "code of silence" -- to identify the attackers.  </P> <P> Security in the courtroom was heavy because of a bitter verbal confrontation  between the rival gangs and their families when the three were convicted two  months ago in Harbor Court in Newport Beach. But Friday, most of the people  present supported Menchaca.  </P> <P> The families of the two victims left the courtroom without incident.  </P> <P> At the trial in Harbor Court, the victim's supporters said that it would be up  to 5th Street gang members to decide if a war between the two communities was  to continue. But Friday, the 5th Street supporters complained that 17th  Streeters have been the only ones to retaliate, spray-painting their gang name  all over the neighborhood.  </P></p>

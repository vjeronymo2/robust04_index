			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 9 (AFP) -- Senior PLO official Mahmud  'Abbas arrived Saturday in Cairo to add impetus to the  negotiations with Israel on the launch of self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho, Palestinian sources said.    The sources said 'Abbas, also known as Abu-Mazin, was to  meet  Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa as part of efforts to clear  the obstacles. 'Abbas was a signatory to the September 13  PLO-Israeli autonomy accord.    The PLO executive committee member will stay on in the  Egyptian capital for the negotiations due to resume here on  Sunday.    He will work to keep an April 13 target for the Israeli army  to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho,  to be replaced by a Palestinian police force.    The PLO accuses Israel of placing obstacles in the way of  applying the autonomy accord, which originally was to have been  launched on December 13.    'Abbas was also expected to meet delegates of an  international observer force to be deployed in the mosque  massacre town of Hebron, under a March 31 agreement with Israel,  the sources added.    The Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel last  Wednesday adjourned negotiations to finalize a deal on an  Israeli withdrawal.    The talks have snagged on a PLO demand that Israel set a  date  for the withdrawal before an advance party goes to the  territories to prepare the ground for the Palestinian police.</p>

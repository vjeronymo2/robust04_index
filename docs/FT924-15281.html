			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / El Al claims may promptinsurers to boost rates The El Al crash will leave insurers with multi-million dollar insurance claims. Coming hard on the heels of last week's loss of a Pakistan International Airlines A-300, expected claims of more than Dollars 62m (Pounds 34.8m) will add to pressure for increases in insurance premiums paid by airlines. El Al's insurance is led by syndicate 48 at Lloyd's of London. Lloyd's said yesterday that 50 per cent of the claim would be met by Lloyd's and London market insurers, with local Israeli companies picking up a portion of the remainder. Alexander Howden, the brokers who handle the account, confirmed that the hull was insured for Dollars 62m. The aircraft was carrying between 110 and 120 tonnes of cargo although an international convention (which limits compensation to Dollars 20 per kg) will restrict the size of any potential payout to about Pounds 2.3m. Claims due to the death of three crew and one passenger are limited by international convention. The greatest area of uncertainty surrounds personal injury awards to the relatives of the more than 250 people feared killed on the ground. Dutch courts do not make awards in compensation for bereavement or for any 'pain and suffering'. Compensation awards could be higher if victims are able to take their complaints to US courts. Potential targets for litigation could be Boeing, the manufacturer of the aircraft, and Pratt &amp; Whitney, the US engine manufacturer. Claims could well have an impact on the international aviation insurance market. According to Mr William Barham of the brokers Willis Corroon, over three quarters of the world's airlines renew their annual policies in October and November and a number are currently negotiating renewal terms. 'It is conceivable that those insurers who haven't already negotiated terms may seek to increase rates,' said Mr Barham. Underwriters imposed sharp increases in rates last autumn but this year overcapacity and competition between insurers has limited the size of increases. Willis reported last month that 'early renewals show hull rates as before or only slightly increased with liabilities receiving token increases of less than 10 per cent.' Hugh Carnegy adds from Jerusalem: The crash was the first disaster of its kind to hit El Al. The aircraft which crashed was one of two dedicated cargo aircraft operated by El Al, both Boeing 747s. The airline has not previously suffered any serious accident through mechanical failure and stringent security measures on both passenger and cargo flights have hitherto prevented any mid-air sabotage. It is understood to spend Dollars 30m-Dollars 40m a year on security.</p>

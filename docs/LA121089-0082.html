			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING WAVES, REMAKING WORLDS;  </P> <P> MALTA: MARKING THE MEETING WHERE SUPERPOWER PROSPECTS FOR COOPERATION OUTWEIGH  COMPETITION.  </P> <P> The Malta summit was clearly a success for both Presidents George Bush and  Mikhail S. Gorbachev. They placed U.S.- Soviet relations on a more even keel.  Yet the inability of superpower leaders to control, or even foresee, the  buffeting storm that compelled a change in plans seemed to symbolize the limits  of their power in dealing with such elemental political changes as those now  sweeping Europe.  </P> <P> In historical perspective, Malta may come to be seen as the first post-Cold War  meeting to create a new relationship between East and West, a new Europe, even  a new world. The summit did not "end the Cold War," but illuminated a maturing  in which prospects for cooperation outweigh continuing superpower competition.  </P> <P> Malta has not been the only significant summit. For all its overdramatization,  the first Richard M. Nixon-Leonid I. Brezhnev summit in 1972 opened up a  prospective detente. Though it was unsustained, it was a foundation. The first  Ronald Reagan-Gorbachev summit, in 1985, marked a change from the confrontation  of the early 1980s -- a shift only Reagan could have managed without sharp  domestic struggle. The Reagan-Gorbachev summits renewed a process Bush and  Gorbachev can carry further.  </P> <P> While Malta marks a step forward, the future management of East-West relations  will increasingly depend on Europeans rather than superpowers.  </P> <P> For all their historical and cultural ties to Europe, and their geopolitical  clout, the United States and the Soviet Union remain peripheral to the heart of  Europe. Neither can exclude the other from Europe -- as people on both sides  have tried in the past. Even today, some, blinded by Cold War thinking, argue  that Gorbachev is trying to divide the United States from Europe, when it is  patently clear he wants the United States in Europe. This is far from the last  bilateral superpower summit, but the future will ineluctably bring multilateral  summits.  </P> <P> Bush was not called on at Malta to respond to Gorbachev's earlier proposal for  an early summit meeting of leaders from 35 nations, all joined in the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). But both Gorbachev and  Bush saw the CSCE process as the framework for dealing with the issue of German  reunification.  </P> <P> The creation of a new security regime for Europe is also a growing requirement  as military force has become less central to security. Judging from his  post-summit comments at Brussels, Bush apparently does not yet see as clearly  as Gorbachev the new role the two alliances can play in cooperatively  contributing to achieve mutual security -- but the process is under way. And  Bush did suggest joint U.S. and Soviet support for convening a multilateral  summit to sign a Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) agreement once negotiated,  preferably in 1990.  </P> <P> Malta was originally billed as an "interim summit" and, for all its symbolic  significance, it was. No agreements were concluded, or even negotiated. Yet the  meeting provided for a joint resolve to press ahead on the strategic-arms  negotiations (START), an interim U.S.-Soviet agreement to cut chemical weapons  arsenals and the CFE conference.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's proposal to open negotiations on global naval-arms control and, in  particular, to ban tactical nuclear weapons at sea, did not gain Bush's  acceptance. The issue will not, however, fade away. Gorbachev also raised the  subject of military doctrine -- an item not in Bush's brief, but on the agenda  for experts' talks in February in the CSCE framework. These talks will probably  spur a discussion of "deterrence" and may well spark some controversy before  yielding greater mutual understanding.  </P> <P> Bush seems more optimistic than others -- more than Secretary of State James A.  Baker III and even Gorbachev -- on the possibility of completing START  negotiations by mid-June. But a jump-start to revive negotiations is in order  even if agreement cannot be reached by June -- and, of course, with enough will  it could.  </P> <P> In U.S.-Soviet affairs, the focus at Malta was economic. Bush took the  initiative by doing what he could to bolster the Soviet economy. He offered  steps to normalize trade relations by granting most-favored-nation status. He  also promised to seek the end of legislative bars to credits -- though the size  of future credits may not be large. More broadly, Bush promised to support  Soviet observer status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade --  bringing Moscow into the world economic structure. Gorbachev was clearly  pleased.  </P> <P> The area of greatest uncertainty at Malta involved "regional conflicts" -- the  pockets of geopolitical friction between allies and clients of the two  superpowers. Most noted has been the matter of Nicaragua sending arms to  insurgents in El Salvador -- but the differing views, while real, were limited.  Gorbachev agreed with Bush on free elections in Nicaragua, on opposing the  transfer of arms to Salvadoran rebels and on resolving conflicts by political  means.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said the Nicaraguans had assured the Soviets they were not sending  arms. Bush insisted, with good basis, that the Nicaraguans were -- but accepted  Gorbachev's account and blamed Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega for lying. (Bush  may have been aware of the discovery, from recently captured SA-7 anti-aircraft  missiles, that these were not manufactured in the Soviet Union.)  </P> <P> The two leaders agreed on supporting peace efforts in Lebanon. Bush evidently  urged Gorbachev to establish relations with Israel -- already in the works.  They agreed that exchanges of intelligence and other cooperation against  international terrorism are useful.  </P> <P> Much was done. But the most important result is a rapport evident in the  leaders' collaborative fielding of questions at the unprecedented, and  unplanned, joint press conference.  </P> <P> Those who have criticized the summit as a "giveaway" by Bush are wrong on all  counts. He didn't "give up" pursuit of conventional-force reductions nor "give  in" by reviving START-CFE as a multilateral negotiation. Gorbachev has already  made major concessions in CFE and obviously wants it; START is no less a U.S.  interest than a Soviet one. The U.S. steps toward normalizing economic  relations are due.  </P> <P> Bush has clearly decided that to aid Gorbachev is in the interests of the  United States and the world, as well as the Soviet Union. That is no  "giveaway." It is new thinking by Bush in response to new thinking, and deeds,  by Gorbachev -- and should be welcomed. At Brussels, Bush himself emphasized  that Gorbachev's response to the situation in Eastern Europe and his readiness  to accept disproportionately larger conventional-arms reductions in Europe  "deserves" and "mandates" new thinking on our part. A competition in new  thinking would be a more significant result of Malta than dramatic rhetoric  couched to sound like more than it really meant.  </P></p>

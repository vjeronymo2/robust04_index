			<p>BFN     [Text] Kathmandu, June 14 (AFP) -- King Birendra of Nepal  has called for parliament to open its seventh session on June 29  during which the future of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala  is likely to be decided.    In what observers said Tuesday is likely to be a stormy  session, the ruling Nepali Congress (NC) will have to decide its  differences, with the pro- and anti-Koirala camps still at  loggerheads.    The prime minister is also expected to push for a change in  party rules to allow him to hold two posts -- prime minister and  party president -- which would give him control, they said.    Internal problems aside, the government also faces a renewed  threat of public protests from the opposition Nepal Communist  Party-ULited Marxist and Leninist.    Rebel NC MPs are also threatening to vote against an  important financial bill unless Koirala resigns.</p>

The Chinese economy may become  the engine of the world economy in the next century. Flavio  Cotti does not want to encourage a throng of small and  medium-sized Swiss businesses to look for salvation in China,  but Swiss companies should look into the matter. They still  have time to hop aboard the "Chinese train," even if it has  already gotten under way.    On Friday [25 February], the head of the Federal Department  of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) addressed members of the Swiss-Chinese  Economic Chamber who were holding their general meeting in  Zurich. China is currently one of the three leading economic  powers in the world. With $195.7 billion in direct foreign  trade, it became the world's eleventh largest trading country in  1993.    China is regionalizing its economy, the federal councillor  continued. At the same time, the Chinese economy has become  internationalized. The government intends to increase direct  exports to $230 billion in the year 2000 and $700 billion in  2010. The OECD estimates that by 2030 the country will account  for some 20 percent of world trade.  <H5>  Global Concept </H5>   Bern is currently working on a global concept for its  relations with China. This will primarily consist of lending  increased political support to the activities of the private  economy. Greater account will also have to be taken of the  phenomenon of regionalization and regular links will have to be  established with the provincial and local authorities in regions  experiencing outright growth.    Major efforts will have to be undertaken to make the Chinese  market more accessible to Swiss firms. The information  regarding this market should be updated, Flavio Cotti stressed.  The idea of reactivating cooperation between existing bodies --  Swiss-Chinese Chamber of Commerce, OSEC [Swiss Office of Trade  Expansion], etc. -- should also be considered.  <H5>  Accent on Southern China </H5>   Swiss representations in China will be able to activate the  support provided on site. The Hong Kong consulate general will  be able to play a more active role in prospecting the southern  market. Sixteen Swiss companies have already been installed in  Shanghai, not including those in the region which manufacture  light industrial products for export. The creation of a  consulate general on site would be justified.    Switzerland wants to work on protecting intellectual  property  in China, on reducing tariff barriers, and on eliminating  non-tariff obstacles to trade. It also intends to promote  China's rapid integration into GATT. It would also be desirable  "that privileged relations between Swiss and Chinese authorities  take root and prosper."    Politically speaking, Bern wants to have more regular and  in-  depth talks with Beijing on "all" major issues of mutual  interest. The head of the DFAE alluded to human rights, an issue  which should be discussed in greater depth.    Swiss investments made or planned in China total some 1.5  billion Swiss francs. Some 60 mergers already exist and some 70  businesses are directly present on the Chinese market.</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GUESS WHO PAYS  </P> <P> Who pays for the President to travel to the various states to campaign and  raise funds for Republican candidates? I phoned to ask my congressman and was  told, "you do."  </P> <P> The President's plane, Air Force One, Secret Service men, all of his entourage  and equipment are very costly to use -- and at our expense. All taxpayers are  being made to pay for a very one-sided promotional campaign.  </P> <P> SYLVIA SIEGLE, Laguna Hills  </P></p>

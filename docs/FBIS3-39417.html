The decision  for a military intervention by NATO was not as simple as many  citizens imagined, Kinkel said today at the Ash Wednesday  meeting of the FDP in Bayerbach [Bavaria]. In the event of a  military strike, however, there would be "no lack" of support  from the German government within the limits of its legal  possibilities.</p>

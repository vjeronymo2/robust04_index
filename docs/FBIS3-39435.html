Defence  Procurement Minister Jonathan Aitken said the Skynet 4 Stage 2  satellites would replace the existing satellites as they  approach the end of their operational life. They will become  operational in 1998 and will be for the sole use of the UK's  military forces.    British Aerospace is the prime contractor for the work. The  main sub-contractors are Matra Marconi Space (UK) for the  satellite communications equipment and U.S. giant McDonnell  Douglas and Europe's Arianespace for the launch rockets.    "This is an important contract which will ensure the  continued well-being of the UK's space industry and contribute  to its long-term future," said Mr Aitken.</p>

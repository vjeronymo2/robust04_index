			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Blacks Leisure falls into the red after property write-down BLACKS LEISURE, the fashion retailer and sports wholesaler, yesterday incurred a loss before tax of Pounds 564,000 in the year ended February 27, its first deficit for five years. The outcome compared with the previous year's pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.7m. The loss was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 600,000, mainly relating to the write-down of properties. Blacks recently sold the LA Gear distribution business for Pounds 2.35m, reducing year-end gearing from 35 to 8 per cent. It also closed the loss-making textile converting and merchanting operation which gave rise to an extraordinary charge of Pounds 9.6m, which includes goodwill previously written off to reserves. Mr Simon Bentley, chairman and chief executive, criticised the new accounting rules which stipulate that both extraordinary and exceptional items should go above the line. 'Under FRS 3 it would have looked as if we had made a Pounds 10m loss when in fact we were making an operating profit'. Retail, which sells camping and sporting goods, suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 858,000, compared to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.9m. Mr Bentley described the result as 'disappointing' but not unexpected given what was happening to the company's markets. The distribution operation saw pre-tax profits decline from Pounds 4m to Pounds 2m. The company blamed the fall on the fact that many of its retail customers over-stocked and were therefore reluctant to place forward order commitments. Group administration costs and net interest fell from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 1.7m. Losses per share of 1.63p compared with earnings of 9.82p. The final dividend is cut from 2.25p to 1.5p making a total of 2.25p (3.35p).</p>

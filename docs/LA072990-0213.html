			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> Jewel Plummer Cobb, who has presided over Cal State Fullerton for the last nine  years, steps down from the presidency Tuesday. Cobb's retirement -- and that of  three other California State University presidents who are 65 or older -- was  requested by now-ousted CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds.  </P> <P> Cobb took over the presidency at Cal State Fullerton on Oct. 1, 1981. Changes  during her tenure include a marked increase in female and minority staff and  students, tougher academic standards, the first hotel on a state college campus  and a satellite campus in fast-growing South County.  </P> <P> Cobb's successor, Milton A. Gordon, must contend with a financially troubled  athletics program and the recruitment of qualified faculty to high-priced  Orange County.  </P> <P> Cobb will settle in Los Angeles, where she plans to do educational consulting  work and continue her research as a cell biologist.  </P></p>

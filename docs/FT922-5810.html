			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Expected Ilva loss ends hopes of listing ILVA, the Italian public-sector steel company controlled by the IRI state holding company, is expected to report a loss of up to L450bn (Dollars 371m) when its 1991 results are announced next week. The figure, which has to be approved by IRI, would banish hopes by the company, created from the ashes of the ill-fated Finsider steel group, to float part of its shares on the stock exchange this year. Under Italian bourse rules, companies must show three straight years of profits before they can list their equity. Ilva, which took its present form in 1988, made net profits of L208bn in 1989 and L115bn in 1990. Its 1991 results, which have been severely hit by the current crisis in the European steel industry, have been eagerly awaited by bankers and politicians as a further indication of the government's privatisation plans. The decision to show a loss for 1991 represents a substantial change of strategy for Ilva. The company had until recently been conducting a series of substantial asset sales to create a large capital gain to counterbalance losses on the industrial side and close the year with a modest profit. Mr Giovanni Gambardella, Ilva's chief executive, said yesterday it had instead decided to allocate the capital gain, amounting to around L450bn, to a special 'restructuring fund' to help overcome its current difficulties. Ilva realised around L150bn from the sale of its Rome headquarters. Further gains have come from the disposal of its 49 per cent stake in the Sidermar shipping group and various electricity generating activities. Meanwhile, capital gains of L150bn have been derived from the transformation of its Piombino long-products division into a separate company. Despite Ilva's failure to meet the bourse's profitability criterion. Mr Gambardella left the door open for a possible future quotation. That could come via a reverse takeover into a company already listed on the stock exchange, a technique commonly used in Italy. One candidate would be Dalmine, the north Italian tube-maker in which Ilva has a 66 per cent stake. However, Ilva officials said the use of a quoted, but dormant, company from another part of the public sector was the more likely solution.</p>

Announcing the diplomatic step, Australia's foreign minister,  Gareth Evans, said Canberra made no presumption about the  so-called name dispute between Greece and the republic.    He said Australia would follow the United Nations in  referring the country as the former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia. Senator Evans said Australia believed the new state  should refrain from using the name Republic of Macedonia until  the name issue was resolved with Greece.</p>

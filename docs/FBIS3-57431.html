			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 25 January broadcasts its regular program  "Details" presented by Nikolay Svanidze who comments on the  Russian Federation defense budget, which is currently in the  pipeline. This is followed by an exclusive interview with  Russian Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin.    Kokoshin begins by saying that in its present situation  Russia needs a new armaments program but drawing it up is  extremely difficult. Asked by the announcer if the Finance  Ministry had been putting obstacles in the way of the program,  Kokoshin said: "I would not like to criticize this particular  ministry because I have a full understanding of their position:  They had a clear task of reducing inflation by monetarist  methods, and this resulted in chronic underpayments in  practically all the main spheres covered by the budget,  including the Defense Ministry. We had some disagreements in  1993, sometimes quite bitter, but at the same time, I realize  that their life is not easy either. It is another matter that  we need to look for new forms of more stable financing."    Svanidze then recalls that President Yeltsin had promised to  pay state-owned enterprises all the money owed to them by the  state by 1 February, and asked Kokoshin if that promise would be  fulfilled. Kokoshin says: "I believe that it will be fulfilled,  but the question is to what extent. Just now complicated work  -- or I might as well call it violent struggle -- is in progress  about who should get their money first and how much of it. We  order for defense."    Asked by the announcer about his personal standpoint when  discussing the budget in the government, and if he was capable  of reconciling the requirements of the defense industry with the  awareness that it is a burden on the national economy, Kokoshin  replies: "We have no wish to form our budget through robbing our  own country, and I can tell you that in the past too much money  was invested in the defense industry, and often those were  rather imprudent investments. Now the pendulum has swung in the  opposite direction. I think one of my tasks, and those of my  colleagues, is to prove that the pendulum should be brought to a  more balanced position, and that our Armed Forces should be  equipped as they deserve."    Finally, Svanidze asks Kokoshin how he thought the current  government reshuffle would affect the defense budget. Kokoshin  replies: "In my opinion, the approach we had before was really  too monetarily oriented, and I have also argued -- both at the  open and closed sessions with Boris Fedorov and with other  adherents of this approach. I think it insufficient, to put it  mildly, and I hope that we will at last begin to stimulate  industry.</p>

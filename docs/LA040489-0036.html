			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION OUTLAYS EDGE UP IN FEBRUARY  </P> <P> Construction spending was nearly flat in February as a small increase in  government projects was offset by slower work on housing and other  non-government buildings, the Commerce Department reported Monday.  </P> <P> Spending for new construction took place at a seasonally adjusted annual rate  of $423 billion, inching up from $422.8 billion during the previous month.  Construction spending had risen 0.4% in January.  </P> <P> February's performance was the weakest since construction spending declined  0.2% last August. Analysts said rising interest rates and caution about the  economic outlook were holding back building activity.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing interest rates upward in  an effort to slow economic growth and restrain inflation. Recent government  reports on the economy's performance in February have suggested that growth may  be slowing as the expansion extends into its seventh year.  </P> <P> Economist John Savacool of the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said people  don't expect the economic recovery to continue indefinitely and are becoming  more cautious about construction projects in anticipation of the next downturn.  </P> <P> "Most people say: 'There's a recession coming. We don't know when, but we've  got a feeling there's going to be one,' " Savacool said. "I wouldn't expect too  much of any substantial construction activity until we get into the early part  of the new year."  </P> <P> In February, spending on residential construction declined 0.2% to a seasonally  adjusted annual rate of $203.4 billion. The pace of building activity on  single-family homes was unchanged, while spending on apartment construction  rose 5.8% and home improvements decreased.  </P> <P> Housing is one of the most interest rate-sensitive parts of the economy,  although the availability of adjustable-rate mortgages has helped to ease the  impact of rising rates.  </P> <P> Fixed-rate mortgages last week were averaging 11.19%, compared to 9.87% a year  earlier. Rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages also have risen sharply,  with lenders asking an average initial rate of 9.31% last week, up from 7.53% a  year earlier.  </P> <P> Non-residential construction declined 0.3% in February to a seasonally adjusted  annual rate of $97.8 billion. Spending on industrial projects such as factories  was down 1.9%, hotel and motel spending was down 4.2% and work on offices rose  1.8%.  </P> <P> Spending on government construction, meanwhile, rose 0.7% to a seasonally  adjusted annual rate of $82.7 billion. The largest category of government  construction, highways and streets, was down 3.3%.  </P> <P> Most other government categories posted gains or were unchanged, with spending  on construction of educational facilities rising 4.8%.  </P></p>

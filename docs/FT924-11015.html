			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Bush to contact Rabin over Middle East flare-up President George Bush yesterday said he would telephone Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli premier, to discuss the latest Middle East flare-up, but hoped the violence would not compromise the peace negotiations in Washington, writes George Graham in Washington. 'I think they have now gone far enough that no incident will derail the talks,' he said. All sides in the peace talks said yesterday they would press ahead despite growing tension in Lebanon and the occupied territories. 'We want to speed up the talks precisely in order to avoid this kind of violence,' said an Arab delegate.</p>

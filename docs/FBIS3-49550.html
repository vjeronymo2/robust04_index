			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Lajos Fur by unidentified </F> reporter on 10 January; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] You once stepped aside as a party  politician, but now you have again become active. What are your  aims?    [Fur] I started a large-scale tour around the country from  October and November, and during this tour I will visit all  counties and have discussions with the leaders and members of  the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and hold lectures, since a  great, a very great test [the election], is coming.    I think that if the population, the citizens of the country,  realize how much the MDF and the coalition government have done,  and that within the range of possibilities they have done the  best way that could be done, the Hungarian Democratic Forum will  win the elections, perhaps not with such a high percentage of  votes as it obtained in 1990, but I am sure that the respective  proportion of votes will be above 20 percent.    [Reporter] Would you accept the post of party chairman?    [Fur] I usually do not evade challenges of my fate,  particularly when they are sensible challenges. If I have to  face such a challenge, I will try to meet it.</p>

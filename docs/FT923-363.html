			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Storm clouds gather over Genoa harbour - How Italy's maritime trade is caught between an archaic monopoly and EC reforms WHEN Mr Ezio Alcide Rosina, the chief executive of Italy's state-owned Finmare shipping group, docked his latest vessel, the Via Ligure, at Genoa's old harbour, he hardly imagined the struggles ahead. Berthing the bright green ship, the first of five specially commissioned roll-on roll-off ferries, in the country's biggest and most unionised port was deliberately provocative. The previous day, Finmare had tried, and, failed, to inaugurate a service to Sicily from Voltri, a vast new port to the west of Genoa's old docks. 'I wanted the people to see the ship and what we planned to do,' said Mr Rosina. Finmare's reasoning was faultless. Rather than using Italy's overcrowded motorways, container lorries would drive onto the wide decks of the German-built vessel for the overnight journey to Sicily. That was almost three months ago. Since then, the Via Ligure's log has summed up the troubled summer at Italy's biggest port. Caught between an archaic monopoly, guaranteeing dock unions' exclusive rights, and a European Community deadline to abolish restrictive practices, the Via Ligure and a handful of other vessels have turned into stalking horses for reform. Last month, successive attempts to load cargo prompted strikes, barricades and legal action from unions and employers in a battle of wills decisive for the future of Italy's maritime trade. All that has been missing so far is the violence seen in the UK in the early 1980s, when Mrs (now Lady) Margaret Thatcher liberalised port employment in Britain. With legislation to remove union privileges, theoretically to be put forward this week, such conflict may be next on the list. Mr Giancarlo Tesini, Italy's transport minister, explains why matters have become so confused. The government planned legislation following a European Court of Justice ruling that the dock-workers' monopoly contravened EC rules. However, Genoa's dockers persuaded a local court that the EC law was inapplicable, and the monopoly could continue. Matters grew more complicated after Sir Leon Brittan's competition directorate issued a 60-day warning to the Italian government at the end of July to comply with Community rules or face a formal procedure. Meanwhile, Genoa port employers took legal action to break the monopoly. Mr Tesini has responded with a draft law abrogating the dockers' monopoly and opening the way for greater private-sector involvement in Italy's state-run ports. The bill should be passed by the end of this month, although that deadline looks likely to slip. Should parliament delay, he says the government may transform it into a decree law, by-passing time-consuming debate. But with the EC deadline imminent, the conflict between employers and dock workers may hot up. Private shippers claim that Genoa's tradition of restrictive labour practices and mismanagement by compliant left-leaning port authorities account for its steady decline. Cargoes have slumped and the number of dockers has plunged over the past decade to about 1,000. Employers see abolition of the dockers' monopoly as Genoa's last chance to regain its position as one of the leading ports in the Mediterranean. But it is the development of a huge new container facility at Voltri, the Via Ligure's base, which has fuelled the fires. Unlike Italy's other 144 ports, Voltri's management has been entrusted to a special company, Voltri Terminal Europa (VTE), in which the Fiat group has a 95 per cent stake, with the rest held by the Genoa port authority. In practice, VTE is not covered by the dockers' monopoly, enabling it to use non-union labour when it opens next year. Having started service before Voltri's main facilities entered operation, Finmare's roll-on roll-off terminal became the flash point. While VTE's management defends the right to choose its own workers, the dockers' union has tried to extend its monopoly. Tension eased earlier this month after Mr Tesini issued a special decree underlining Voltri's autonomy, ahead of resolution of the wider dispute over dockers' rights. To ease tempers, VTE has taken on two union members alongside its own staff for a limited period, and the Via Ligure is back at work. 'The dockers must realise they are defending a privilege that no longer has any reason to exist. The rules have changed,' says Mr Tesini. However, he avoids confrontational language. 'I don't want to declare war on the port workers.' Hence his reluctance to speculate on whether dockers will accept the demise of their monopoly. Imposition of the new law in the face of possible union opposition 'is up to the forces of the Ministry of the Interior, it's not a matter for the transport minister'. Rather than threatening force, he prefers to focus on other ports, where labour relations are already much more flexible. 'Just look at Ravenna,' he says. For Mr Tesini, the Adriatic port offers a snapshot of how labour relations in all Italy's docks must change, with a more entrepreneurial union role and private-sector interests involved in managing day-to-day activities, with the state-appointed port authority remaining as an umpire in the background. Only by encouraging labour flexibility and letting private companies run their own terminals can Italy's ports remain competitive, he stresses. But it remains to be seen whether the softly, softly approach will be enough to persuade Genoa's militant dockers to give up their monopoly without a fight.</p>

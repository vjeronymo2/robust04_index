			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Peace talks between Angola's government and UNITA rebels have been delayed and  guerrillas have again broken a cease-fire, the official Angolan news agency  Angop reported. The agency said a third round of talks scheduled for Zaire was  postponed because Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, the mediator, was abroad.  No new date was announced for negotiations centering on how to monitor the  shaky, five-week-old cease-fire between Angolan government forces and the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, led by Jonas Savimbi.  </P></p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / UK Gilts: Price rises show signs of running out of steam THERE were distinct signs last week that the recent rise in gilts prices at both ends of the yield curve are starting to run out of steam, even though the market continues to gain strength. The large fall in yields recently has made gilts look expensive relative to other European government bonds, given uncertainties about sterling after the UK's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. Furthermore, worries about funding of the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR), which have largely been absent from the market in recent weeks, are set to return soon, as indications pile up about rising government deficits in the next year or so. As evidence has strengthened that the longest UK recession for 50 years seems likely to continue for some time, the government has come under increased pressure to cut official interest rates, now at 8 per cent. A further 1 or 2 percentage points off base rates seems highly likely over the next few weeks, especially given the lack of need to peg the pound to specific targets after the ERM departure. The perception that short-term rates are coming down has lifted prices at the short end of the yield curve, while long yields have come down on indications that inflation is unlikely to be a problem in the UK for the next year. Last week, long gilts saw a fall in yields of nearly 20 basis points, while yields for short-dated bonds fell by rather less: around 5 basis points. The changes continued the trend in the market over the past month, during which the difference between yields of 10-year gilts compared with yields of 10-year German bunds have narrowed substantially to about 100 basis points, the lowest figure for several years. At the same time, the yield spread between these gilts and 10-year French bonds has come down to around 10 basis points. However, in the view of Mr John Shepperd, a bond specialist at S. G. Warburg Securities, the rise in prices for gilts has just about run its course. He reckons a correction in the market place may be about to start. Behind this thinking is partly that investors are starting to take account of the high levels of government deficits over the next few years. With many City economists estimating that the PSBR will run to more than Pounds 40bn in 1993-94, the government will need to sell large quantities of gilts to fund the deficits. This is especially since Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, appears to have no plans to order a switch in policy to make gilt sales to banks and building societies count towards funding the deficit. The large volumes of gilts coming on to the market will depress prices, at the same time making gilts more attractive to would-be buyers, especially overseas. The need to entice more foreigners into buying gilts was underlined by figures last week from the Bank of England, which showed that in September, overseas investors were net sellers of gilts to the tune of Pounds 600m, after having sold Pounds 1.2bn worth in August. While non-UK investors are hardly falling over themselves to buy gilts at the moment, the opposite is true for many banks and building societies. Many are borrowing at relatively low short-term base rates and then re-investing the money by lending to the government through buying long-dated gilts at significantly higher yields. In this way, banks and building societies have taken advantage of the substantial steepening in the upwards-sloping yield curve in recent weeks. In this environment, according to Mr Peter Warburton, an economist at Robert Fleming, Mr Lamont may have missed a trick by failing to change policy rules to make gilt purchases by banks and building societies count towards funding the PSBR. Not only would this have eased funding problems, it would have had a much-needed stimulatory effect on the economy by increasing the money supply. Mr Warburton was among several observers of the gilt market to be disappointed that Mr Lamont made no mention of changes in funding policy in his Mansion House speech last week. The Bank of England continued its recent run of issuing index linked gilts by announcing that Pounds 300m of such bonds will be available for trading from today. The securities are Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked Treasury stock due 2009, and Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked Treasury stock due 2024.</p>

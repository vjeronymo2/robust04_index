			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Banham attacked over council plans: Controversy dogs reform proposals in north-east The Local Government Commission is expected today to recommend the abolition of Humberside and North Yorkshire county councils and the retention of Lincolnshire. Sir John Banham, commission chairman, faces widespread opposition to his proposal to create three new local-authority areas, to be called 'Ridings' even though they will not correspond to the long-standing North, East and West Ridings of Yorkshire that were abolished when Humberside was created in 1974. In Lincolnshire, he is expected to confirm his provisional recommendation that the two-tier status quo, with a county council and eight smaller district councils, should be maintained, in spite of guidance from Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, that he expects all-purpose unitary authorities to be created. The Association of District Councils will call for Mr Gummer to reject the option, suggesting that smaller unitary authorities could be created. Hull and York would become unitary authorities under the plans for north of the Humber. Local Conservative MPs have attacked the 'Riding' label, as the old Ridings included large tracts of the county, including Leeds, Kirklees and Sheffield, which are now run under metropolitan authorities. The original proposal for the North Riding - which was to include Richmond, Northallerton and Scarborough - was denounced as 'Shambleshire' by the Association of District Councils on the grounds that it would be unmanageably big. The East Riding was to include Beverley, Goole and Selby, while the West Riding would be based on Harrogate and Skipton. Sir John also faces calls from Cleveland for his resignation after it was revealed in a local newspaper that he had told the Plymouth-based Western Morning News that he favoured the idea of one large unitary council for Cornwall. Sir John, a Cornishman, said that if a county-wide Cornwall council were abolished, 'the representation of Cornwall would go by default and it would more difficult for Cornwall to punch its weight in the south-west'. Mr Ronald Allan, editor of the Middlesbrough-based Evening Gazette, which has campaigned against Sir John's proposal that Cleveland should be split into four unitary authorities, pointed out that Teesside's population was almost identical to Cornwall's. He said: 'The fact that Sir John has used the arguments that he rejected for Teesside to push the case to retain Cornwall as a county shows that there is absolutely no logic to this whole commission.'</p>

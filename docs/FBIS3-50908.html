			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Panorama" newscast] </F>   [Text] Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, chairman of the National  Comission for Human Rights [Comision Nacional de los Derechos  Humanos -- CNDH], who is in Chiapas State, has begun to receive  complaints of alleged civil rights violations filed by the  residents of San Cristobal de las Casas and other towns. He  said all complaints will be investigated, including the case of  corpses found in the city of Ocosingo with signs of having been  tortured. The corresponding autopsies have already been  requested. Madrazo Cuellar indicated CNDH's goal is precisely  to ensure respect for the human rights and lives of the civilian  population.    [Correspondent Juan Carlos Santoyo] While the Catholic  Church  says that strife in Chiapas has entered a phase that may end the  fighting, the CNDH, through its Chairman Madrazo Cuellar,  acknowledged the situation in this area of Chiapas State is  still abnormal and tense. Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal  de las Casas, clearly stated: I am not responsible for those who  come to preach as Catholic Church ministers in Indian regions.  After saying that whole familes have begun to flee the fighting  and hunger in different towns in upper Chiapas, he reaffirmed  the Catholic Church's willingness to open the doors of temples  to let in refugees and even rebels who lay down their weapons or  are wounded.    He was asked very clearly: Does the danger exist that once  the conflict is over there will be widespread violations of  Indians' human rights? This is his reply:    [Begin Ruiz recording] The danger that arbitrary action may  occur during a second phase exists. For that reason, I think  the CNDH, with which we specifically discussed this second  phase, constitutes for the people a very important element so  that the largest number of human rights organizations may  observe the situation. These groups also provide help through  the participation of foreign observers, who may not be directly  involved because they are not Mexicans but clearly constitute a  guarantee that definite steps are taken to avoid human rights  violations. The peril exists, and the CNDH -- this is also the  view abroad -- will provide a certain degree of security. We  are confident this phase will be conducted in the most proper,  reasonable, and due manner. [end recording]    [Santoyo] The bishop added the time has also come to put the  conflict into the hands of civilians and let the Army out of it.  He also said refugee centers have opened in Palenque,  Villahermosa, and Campeche, at which the people fleeing the  clashes are slowly arriving. After meeting with Bishop Ruiz in  his office, the CNDH chairman noted that one indication that the  army has acted in accordance with the law is that civil rights  have not yet been suspended.    The National Indian Institute announced the implementation  of  different projects and programs to support Indian communities  all over Chiapas. It added that priority will be given to  prevent outside or foreign influence in the actions and  traditions of our countr's Indians from undermining the  tranquillity and social peace that reigns in this area.</p>

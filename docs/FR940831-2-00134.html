			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The St. Lucie County Port and Airport Authority submitted to the FAA on January 26, 1994, the noise exposure maps, descriptions, and other documentation produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from October 11, 1991, through January 21, 1994. The FAA completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by the St. Lucie County Port and Airport Authority. The specific maps under consideration were 1992 ``EXISTING CONDITIONS'' NOISE EXPOSURE MAP and 1997 ``FUTURE CONDITIONS'' NOISE EXPOSURE MAP in the submission. The FAA determined that these maps for the St. Lucie County International Airport were in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination was effective on February 2, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps in limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in Appendix A of FAR Part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The St. Lucie County International Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to the year 1997. It was requested that FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as described in Section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on February 2, 1994, and was required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period shall be deemed to be an approval of such program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submitted program contained six (6) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The FAA completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Administrator effective July 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Outright approval was granted for all six (6) of the specific program elements. The approval action was for the following program elements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s200,xs100 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Measure and description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1NCP pages <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=2 --> Operational Measures <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=2 --> NA&hyph;1_Modify Flight Tracks. All jet aircraft departing the airport on Runway 9 will be requested to maintain runway heading until reaching an altitude of 2,000 feet or until crossing the shoreline to reduce the number of residences affected by noise east of the airport. Airport management will request the air traffic control tower chief to prepare a tower directive to implement this action. FAA Action: Approved as a voluntary measure  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Pgs. 12&hyph;3, 12&hyph;4, 14&hyph;1 and 14&hyph;6; and Exhibit 12.1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NA&hyph;2_Implement Noise Abatement Departure Procedure. Aircraft departing the airport on Runways 9 and 14 will be encouraged to use the National Business Aircraft Association's ``close-in'' departure procedure or the aircraft manufacturer's recommended procedure. Airport management will prepare a pamphlet to describe the noise sensitive areas around the airport and explain the need for a noise abatement departure procedure. These will be distributed to pilots through the fixed-base operators. FAA Action: Approved as a voluntary measure  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Pgs. 12&hyph;5, 12&hyph;7, 14&hyph;1, 14&hyph;2 and 14&hyph;7; Table 12.1; Exhibit 12.2; and Appendix C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NA&hyph;3_Continue Noise Complaint Procedure. Noise complaints will continue to be recorded by the airport manager's office to identify when, where and how often noise complaints occur. The complaint will be forwarded to the airport director for a determination of whether additional action is required. If the Aircraft was positively identified by the caller, airport management will attempt to notify the aircraft owner about the complaint and, if applicable, request that they follow the airport's noise abatement procedures. FAA Action: Approved <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Pgs. 12&hyph;2, 14&hyph;2, 14&hyph;5, and 14&hyph;7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=2 --> Land Use Measures <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=2 --> LU&hyph;1_Revise Land Use Control Areas. It is recommended that the St. Lucie County Planning Department, with airport management assistance, review the airport's land use control areas to reflect current and proposed airfield development to provide the basis for zoning guidance and land use recommendations within future runway approaches. This information should be incorporated into the county's land development code. FAA Action: Approved as a local land use prerogative. This measure calls for amendment of the existing land use control areas to include areas off the ends of a proposed new runway and to include a shift in the land use control area due to a runway extension <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Pgs. 13&hyph;2, 13&hyph;5, 13&hyph;6, 14&hyph;2, 14&hyph;5 and 14&hyph;8; and Exhibit 13.1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LU&hyph;2_Revise Land Use Recommendations. It is recommended that St. Lucie County revise their land use zoning to conform with the recommended zoning in the Part 150 Noise Study. The land use zoning recommended for St. Lucie Village in the previous Part 150 Noise Study would be deleted. FAA Action: Approved as a local land use prerogative. The County's zoning would be updated to provide for additional preventive mitigation within the area of jurisdiction of the County. The NCP States that the airport operator has had no success in gaining the cooperation of the village in changing land use designations within the Village's jurisdiction and has withdrawn the measure from its previously approved NCP (page 14&hyph;5). The 1992 NCP Indicates (pgs. 10&hyph;1 and 10&hyph;4) that no noncompatible land uses are within the existing or future DNL 65 dB contour. Approval of this recommendation to revise land uses does not extend to approval of acquisition of property shown on Exhibit 13.2. The County has not recommended these properties for acquisition in this NCP (pg. 14&hyph;3) and does not include noncompatible land uses within the DNL 65 dB contour <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Pgs. 13&hyph;2, 13&hyph;7, 14&hyph;2, 14&hyph;3, 14&hyph;5 and 14&hyph;8; and Exhibit 13.2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LU&hyph;3_Review Site Designs. It is recommended that development proposals within two miles of the airport continue to be reviewed by airport management prior to the issuance of building permits. This will allow airport management to advise the County planning department whether the proposed development is or is not compatible with the airport's projected noise levels. FAA Action: Approved as a local land use prerogative. This action was approved in the 1988 NCP and has been ongoing for several years <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Pgs. 13&hyph;2, 14&hyph;3, 14&hyph;5 and 14&hyph;8. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Administrator on July 29, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the submittal, are available for review at the FAA office listed above and at the administrative offices of the St. Lucie County Port and Airport Authority. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Issued in Orlando, Florida on August 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> Charles E.

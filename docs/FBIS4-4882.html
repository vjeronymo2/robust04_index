			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA] fighting  for independence of the island from Papua New Guinea [PNG] has  dissociated itself from a suggestion that secession is no longer  achievable. In a statement issued in Sydney, the leader of the  BRA, Francis Ona, attacked the rebel government's United Nations  representative, Mike Foster, for comments he made in an  interview on Papua New Guinea Radio. Sean Dorney reports:    [Begin recording] [Dorney] In what appeared at the time to  be a conciliatory statement, Mr. Foster told the NBC (National  Broadcasting Corporation] of PNG, the war would drag on  indefinitely unless there was some give and take.    [Foster] We don't believe that the request for unconditional  surrender is realistic and we don't believe either that the  complete and immediate secession is realistic but somewhere in  the middle there is a shared ground and I think for the sake of  the whole of the Pacific region we should cease the arm conflict  and begin the discussions that can lead to peace and restoration  of understanding and human rights values.    [Dorney] However, Mr. Foster has now been attacked by the  secessionists, who accused him of creating confusion and  misunderstanding. Francis Ona is quoted as saying he'll  maintain struggle for independent Bougainville. [end recording]</p>

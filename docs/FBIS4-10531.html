			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by Mexico's Clandestine Indian </F> Revolutionary Committee-General Command of the Zapatist Army of  National Liberation (EZLN) in Mexico on 10 April: "Emiliano  Zapata Will Not Die by Decree: EZLN"]    [Text] To the people of Mexico,    To the world's peoples and governments,    To the national and international press,    Brothers:    The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General  Command of the Zapatist Army of National Liberation hereby  addresses you to say the following:    Today, 10 April 1994, marks the 75th anniversary of General  Emilio Zapata's assassination. An attempt was made to drown his  cry of Land and Liberty! through the betrayal of Venustiano  Carranza. Today, the usurper Salinas de Gortari, the  self-described "president of the Mexican republic," lies to the  Mexican people, saying his reforms of Article 27 of the  Constitution reflect the spirit of Gen. Zapata. The supreme  government is lying! Zapata will not die over such a haughty  decree. The right to land for those who till that land is  irreversible, and the war cry of Land and Liberty! still has not  found rest in these Mexican lands. Under the blanket of  liberalism that has darkened our lands every peasant who fights  for his agrarian rights is jailed and murdered. Salinas'  reforms to Article 27 of the Constitution represent a betrayal  of the fatherland, and the usurper of federal executive power in  Mexico should be prosecuted for this crime.    Brothers, today is the 100th day of the new dawning of our  voice; from the mouths of the rifles of faceless men and women  spoke the voices of landless peasants, farm workers, small  landowners, and Mexican Indians. The voices of those who have  nothing and deserve everything had to follow the path of their  smallest men, the most humiliated, the most persecuted, the most  forgotten. The voices of true men spoke for the Mexicans who  are dispossessed of their lands, dignity, and history.  Everything seemed lost during our people's long night. The  land gave nothing but pain and death, but 10 years before this  day certain good people sowed in our grieved land the hope that  true men would return to life. The seed of their words found a  good place to be born in the Mexican mountains. Their silence  was cultivated. Their passage was night which turned to day.    At the dawning of our cry of "Enough!" the land yielded the  fruits that had been sown. Instead of grief, anger was born;  instead of humiliation, dignity emerged; instead of regrets, we  reaped weapons. Thousands of men and women unearthed, from the  very land that only gave them poverty, the tender fire that  would fill their hands; they covered their faces, erased their  pasts, left behind their names and lands and followed the steps  of war. None of us men and women of nocturnal passage will have  a tomorrow. There will never again be peace for our yearnings.  Never again will our bones and blood have rest.    For whom are these men and women walking? Who drinks their  blood? For whom is the light in their words? Who will gain  life from their death? One hundred days. Ten years. Whose  hands, besides those of the men and women who cannot be here  with you today, will pick up the flag their blood tore from the  hands of the powerful? Who will fall in with their dignified  stride? Who with them, with us, can speak with only a look, a  voice and fierce tenderness? Who cries out with us? Who does  not abandon us? Who struggles with us? Who listens to our dead?    Not the usurper, who sells his pride at the National Palace.  That pride is not the pride he sells to us. It is not pride  that is murdering us. It is not pride that is dispossessing us.  It is not pride that humiliates us.    You do, brothers. For you, our blood. For your night our  timid light. For your life our death. Our war for your peace.  For your ears our words. Your grief, brothers, will seek  relief in our struggle. For you everything, brothers; for us,  nothing.    Brothers, before you, in that palace where lies reign  today, lives he who denies us and whom no good person has asked  to be there. The powerful gentleman who snatches our lives away  everyday should leave. He must go, brothers. His voice should  not be a mandate for us. Nothing good comes from his doors.  There are lies in his face and deceit in his words. He must  go, brothers. This is the cry coming from the mountains; this is  what our blood is saying; this is what our dead are requesting.  He must go. Tell him that, brothers: He must Go!    Let no one else arrive at that palace you have in front of  you if it is not by the mandate of the others; he who sits in  that chair must give orders while obeying; he who speaks from  that balcony must have the truth in his words; he who calls  himself our chief must be that while obeying. Tell him that  this, brothers, is what we want.    We cannot be with you on this day, brothers; our steps  follow  the night into the mountains; our faces are still gagged, and  our words are very distant. Take us for one moment, Mexican  brothers! Give us your voices a moment and allow your mouths to  speak our words. At this very instant, in the mountains of  southeastern Mexico, thousands of men and women who have been  rejected, who have no names or pasts are reviving in their  chests the first cry of the beginning of the year. Our hearts  are happy, because Emiliano Zapata has come again, in your  steps, to the square [zocalo] in Mexico. We, small and  forgotten, raise the image of Zapata in the other heart of the  fatherland: the mountains of the Mexican southeast.    Cheers, Mexican brothers! Let our cry be yours:    Long live Emiliano Zapata!    Death to the supreme government!    Freedom!    Justice!    Democracy!    Respectfully, from the mountains of the Mexican southeast.    Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command  of  the Zapatist Army of National Liberation.    Mexico, April 1994.</p>

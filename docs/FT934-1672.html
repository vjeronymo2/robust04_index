			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Arjo Wiggins Appleton The departure of another Anglo-Saxon director at Arjo Wiggins Appleton comes as a further blow to a company which seems to specialise in nasty surprises. Mr Gordon Bond had done a good job at Appleton in the US, exhibiting energetic marketing skills which are not conspicuously abundant throughout the rest of the group. Brought back to Europe to run the printing and writing divisions, he had been in the post for less than a year before yesterday's resignation. This latest boardroom rumpus may owe more to style than substance. The company was certainly at pains yesterday to counter the more alarmist rumours. Yet following the earlier resignations of Mr Henry Wendt and Mr Stephen Walls, the market has grown intolerant of such mishaps. The 9 per cent drop in AWA's shares illustrates the scale of disappointment. Such worries will linger until the merged Franco-British enterprise exhibits greater stability. Yet there is no reason to doubt the underlying economics of the business. AWA has articulated a cogent strategy which should bear fruit as the European paper cycle swings upwards. The market is undoubtedly tightening. The capacity slack is being taken up and sales volumes are recovering. There is widespread talk that pulp prices may rise next year and even some expectation they may stick. This year's surge in AWA's shares suggested that the market had anticipated every scrap of good news. Yesterday's shock highlights how AWA can be relied upon to throw in something bad.</p>

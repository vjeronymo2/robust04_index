			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Arts: New plays of lesbian love / Review of the Humana festival in Louisville The American obsession with 'otherness' was on prominent display at the recent 18th annual Humana Festival of New American Plays. Nearly all the festival's 10 plays, presented at the Actors' Theatre of Louisville, spun off of some socio-political issue - lesbian and gay issues being the most common concern. A tone of politically correct sanctimony was averted by the high overall artistic standards. While the festival lacked an outstanding success - Tony Kushner's Slavs], expected to fill that bill, proved a disappointment - the general quality of the plays and the adventurousness of the programming were an advance on previous festivals. Slavs] (Thinking about the Longstanding Problems of Virtue and Happiness), is Kushner's first play since the international success of his Pulitzer Prize-winning epic Angels in America. The new play partly comprises scenes cut from Perestroika, Angels' second half. While full of freshly comic scenarios and his trademark dazzling flights of prose, Slavs] is more a disjointed grab-bag of scenes than a fully realised play. Its first scenes, schtick-laden sketches in which ageing apparatchiks literally politic themselves to death, are funny but forgettable. The play's real interest kicks in when we meet Katherina (Kate Goehring), an idealist cursing her way through a functionary's job, and her lover Bonfila (Mary Schultz), a paediatric oncologist. Exiled to Siberia, Bonfila encounters an outbreak of radiation sickness and in the play's most effective, final scenes, we follow a young victim to heaven. Kushner's engagement in these last scenes is clear, but his earnestness mingles uncertainly with the broadly comic tone of the play's first half. Lisa Peterson directs with pace and a flair for the broadly theatrical gesture, but the production is hindered by weak acting among the older male performers. Schultz and Goehring, however, are first-rate. Kushner's play was performed in a double bill with Trip's Cinch by Phyllis Nagy, an American playwright living in London whose Butterfly Kiss recently premiered at the Almeida. Trip's Cinch is similar in tone and theme to David Mamet's Oleanna and inspired by the William Kennedy Smith and Mike Tyson date rape cases. Plays such as this, and the issues they are meant to inform, are fuelled by ambiguity, but Nagy's drama lays it on too thick. With so few clues given to the audience about how to interpret the events on stage, our reaction is less prurient fascination than indifference. The festival's most effective production, Wendy Hammond's Julie Johnson, is impressive less for any innovations in theatrical form than for the freshness of Hammond's voice and a remarkable performance by Lily Knight as the title character, a working-class wife and mother who decides she 'doesn't want to be stupid no more'. She kicks out her husband, enrols in night classes, and discovers a passion for computers and for her best friend, a coffee shop waitress. The dilemma the women face in reconciling their new-found sexual identity with the restrictive standards of their community is compelling and, eventually, moving. For all its emotional credibility, Julie Johnson never departs from the formulaic structure of a television movie-of-the-week, a weakness which director Jon Jory counteracts with an aggressively theatrical production - black-garbed stagehands move pieces of scenery on and off stage; rock music blares during set changes. Humana's annual presentation of 10-minute plays, a disappointment at past festivals, found life in the genre this year. Jane Anderson's The Last Time We Saw Her is a little bombshell of precise naturalism. A young businesswoman tells her boss that she is gay and that she wants her co-workers to know about it. The ensuing conversation turns quietly ugly, but just who is in the wrong? Susan Miller's My Left Breast is a part-confessional, part-inspirational autobiographical monologue covering Miller's breast cancer and a difficult break-up with a female lover. While Miller's good humour and bravery are remarkable - there are few women around, for better or worse, who would be willing to expose a mastectomy scar to a roomful of strangers - her message, that we must bear the good with the bad, is hardly new. The festival's most stylistically adventurous offering was 1969, a collaboration between director/writer Tina Landau and seven young performers. A collage of songs, dialogue, speeches, and movement, 1969 is an attempt to evoke both the universal pains and rewards of growing up, and to capture the mood of the late 1960s in middle America. Landau directs and the cast performs with precision and passion, but the plot is too predictable - nerdy high school senior realises he's gay and runs off to an idealised New York - and the writing seldom rises above the banal. High production values are among the Humana Festival's traditional pleasures; set designer Paul Owen, who has designed nearly every play in festival history, is an unsung genius of American theatre. Another of the Festival's delights is its community spirit - a relief for the jaded big city theatregoer and a reminder of the values that inspired the regional theatre movement and keep it alive.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Gonzalez in show of unity SPANISH Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has overcome a major hurdle in his bid to win a fourth term in general elections scheduled for June 6 by constructing an apparently united front within his ruling Socialist party. Mr Gonzalez, who is currently running neck and neck with centre right opposition leader Mr Jose Maria Aznar in opinion polls, has drafted his deputy prime minister, Mr Narcis Serra, into the planning committee for the June poll. Mr Serra is a staunch defender of monetarist policies and of a market economy. But Mr Gonzalez has also appointed Mr Alfonso Guerra, the former deputy prime minister and the leader of the party's left wing, to be the campaign's general co-ordinator and the head of the committee vetting party candidates. The nominations, which have been unanimously endorsed by the party's 200-member federal committee, contrast with the deep divisions among the socialists earlier this month. Mr Gonzalez was prompted into calling a snap election last week by a confrontation between the members of his government, including Mr Serra, and members of the party machinery, led by Mr Guerra.</p>

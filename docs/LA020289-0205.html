			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> SENATORS DELAY TOWER VOTE AFTER NEW CHARGES EMERGE;  </P> <P> PANEL WILL CHECK DATA WITH FBI  </P> <P> Senators moving to check "additional information" with the FBI postponed a vote  today on John Tower's nomination as defense secretary, a step that sparked  speculation about his confirmation chances.  </P> <P> Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and senior Republican John  W. Warner of Virginia announced at a committee session dealing with an  unrelated matter that more data has come to the panel about Tower and that some  members want a further look at the former Texas senator's file.  </P> <P> "The chairman and I have been looking at some additional information that has  come to the attention of the two of us . . . and we feel it important to see  that each one of these bits of information is carefully checked out," Warner  said. "(Nunn) and I will be meeting with the FBI and others today."  </P> <P> Neither senator would elaborate and both quickly left the committee room, but  Warner cautioned: "I wouldn't read anything into it at this time. . . . I would  not attach any credibility or non-credibility to the information."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grilled on Private Life  </P> <P> Nunn, who had said earlier that a vote was probable today, said that he now  does not know when the committee may vote -- and that the full Senate would be  unlikely to be able to take up the nomination until next week.  </P> <P> Tower, 63, had endured four days of public and private hearings before the  committee he once chaired, hearings that saw him grilled closely about his work  as a defense consultant after he left the Senate four years ago and about  allegations that he was a womanizer and a heavy drinker.  </P> <P> The hearings had apparently concluded Wednesday with his public declaration  that he has no alcohol problem. The Texan conceded, "I feel like I'm glad it's  the end of the hearings."  </P> <P> Nunn's announcement of the postponement came on the same day that the  Washington Post's gossip column carried a report on Tower's behavior at a  Wednesday lunch at a posh hotel with girlfriend Dorothy Heiser.  </P> <P> The report said Tower "playfully lunged at Heiser, his arms reaching toward her  under the table, and said, 'I'm going to fondle you.' She gave a little shriek  and jumped slightly and said, 'Don't you do that.' He stopped and they resumed  eating."  </P> <P> Nunn had suggested some discomfort with the nomination late Wednesday, telling  reporters after the hearings that he had not made up his own mind. But the  chairman nonetheless said then that he expected Tower to win confirmation.  </P> <P> "I have had and continue to have concerns not on the basis of his competence"  but on the basis of his private life and conflict-of-interest questions, Nunn  said. "I am wrestling with those."  </P> <P> Conservative activist Paul Weyrich said Tuesday that he had seen Tower  intoxicated and in the company of women other than his wife "on numerous  occasions," but when called into a private meeting he was unable to convince  senators that he had anything more than "hearsay" evidence.  </P> <P> The twice-divorced Tower, whose 1987 divorce was particularly acrimonious, was  offered the opportunity by Nunn to respond publicly to his critics Wednesday  after he, too, spoke privately with the committee.  </P></p>

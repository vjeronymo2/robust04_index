			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 840.11(g)(4)(i)/842.11(e)(i). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These sections are being adopted as proposed. They require that before a site could meet the definition of ``abandoned site,'' the permit covering the surface coal mining and reclamation operation must be either revoked or expired. The existing rules allow a site to be classified as abandoned on the basis that permit revocation proceedings have only been initiated and are being pursued diligently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final provision will have two effects. First, a person who has not or will not respond to enforcement action issued by the regulatory authority and who cannot or will not meet his/her obligations to abate violations or complete reclamation will not be entitled to resume coal production under a valid permit. Second, the constraints of section 517(c) of the Act would be lifted for abandoned sites since the fixed inspection frequency requirements of that section apply only to surface coal mining and reclamation operations covered by each permit. The preamble to OSM's final rule at 30 CFR 773.11, Requirements to obtain permits, articulated and codified the concept that a surface coal mining permit is required only where surface coal mining operations defined under section 701(28) of the Act are occurring and that if this authorization to extract coal expires or is revoked, it amounts to the absence or the non-existence of the permit that once was in force (i.e. the minesite is no longer considered to be covered by a permit). Of course, this does not affect the permittee's legal obligation to reclaim a site that has been abandoned, since, in accordance with 30 CFR 733.11, that obligation continues until all reclamation is completed, regardless of whether the authorization to conduct surface coal mining operations has expired or has been revoked. See 54 FR 13814 (April 5, 1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Wildlife Federation and the Kentucky Resources Council, Inc. (hereafter NWF) concurred with this change to the definition of abandoned site to the extent that the plain language of the term ``abandoned site'' suggests that there should not be an existing permit that is renewable or revisable by the operator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Joint National Coal Association and American Mining Congress on Surface Mining Regulations (NCA/AMC), the National Coal Association (NCA) and the Kentucky Coal Association supported this revision saying that the proposed rule differs significantly from the abandoned sites rule remanded in 1990 because the proposed rule defines ``abandoned sites'' to include only those sites whose permits have either expired or been revoked. Because the Act's inspection requirements only apply to operations under permit, they believe that the revised definition can no longer be considered inconsistent with section 517(c) of the Act and consequently, the district court's earlier criticism of OSM's statutory interpretation is no longer valid. They added that neither the language nor legislative history of the statute indicates any intent that the regulatory authority continue to expend its resources to inspect an abandoned site where no activities listed in section 701(28) of the Act are currently conducted and enforcement action has proven futile in compelling the correction of prior violations. Finally, they believed that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia gave tacit approval for OSM's revised reading of the ``covered by each permit'' language of section 517(c) because the court clearly would have rejected OSM's announced efforts before the court to undertake a curative rulemaking using this revised reading if it perceived such a reading as inconsistent with the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM agrees with the commenters, except for the proposition that the U.S. Court of Appeals decision concerning the remanded 1988 abandoned sites rule amounts to tacit approval of the Secretary's ``covered by each permit'' reading of Section 517(c). The Secretary requested the appeals court to vacate the district court's opinion remanding the 1988 abandoned sites rule because he believed that step was necessary before engaging in a new rulemaking based on the interpretation that abandoned sites for which the permits have expired or been revoked are not subject to section 517(c) of the Act. In declining the Secretary's request to vacate, the appeals court stated ``We express no view about the validity of the Secretary's proposed reading. The significant point on this appeal is that the district court's decision does not stand in the way of the Secretary adopting it in a new rulemaking.'' Whether or not the revised reading set forth as a basis for this rule would be sustained by the appeals court will only be known if this rule becomes ripe for a decision before that judicial body. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A State regulatory authority (SRA) said it would make more sense to require the permit to be revoked/expired ``or'' actually be forfeited. This could be accomplished by replacing the word ``and'' by the word ``or'' and deleting the phrase ``has initiated and is diligently pursuing forfeiture of'' in subparagraph (ii). The commenter explained that bond forfeiture proceedings may not always be accomplished concurrently with permit expiration, that if a permit expires there may not be a reason to immediately forfeit the bond and by requiring both expiration and forfeiture to occur simultaneously could be a waste of manpower and funds. This comment is not being adopted. As discussed above, allowing a reduction from the inspection requirements of section 517(c) of the Act under this rule is based on the premise that revocation or expiration of a permit is a necessary prerequisite in order for an abandoned site not to be considered ``covered by a permit.'' If, as the commenter suggests, bond forfeiture is an alternative to revocation or expiration, an abandoned site could not escape the constraints of section 517(c) of the Act since bond forfeiture does not necessarily require permit revocation. In view of the often prolonged process of bond forfeiture, this final section of the rule does not require that bond forfeiture be completed, but rather that it be initiated and diligently pursued and thus, the rule will have more immediate applicability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 840.11(g)(4)(ii)/842.11(e)(4)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To qualify under the definition of ``abandoned site,'' the existing rules require that the regulatory authority has initiated and is diligently pursuing forfeiture of, or has forfeited, the performance bond. These sections are being revised by adding the phrase ``any available'' before the phrase ``performance bond.'' This change is minor and is intended to recognize that there is a relatively small number of sites that are or were permitted, but for which a performance bond was never required or no longer exists. The absence of a performance bond has no bearing on whether a site should be classified as abandoned for inspection purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

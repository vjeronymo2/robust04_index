Three civilians were killed in the Serb suburbs of Grbavica  and Lukavica on Tuesday, Bosnian Serb Army sources said.    Commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, General  Francis Briquemont on Tuesday evening accused the Moslem forces  loyal to Alija Izetbegovic of being the first to open artillery  fire on Serb parts of the city immediately after U.N. envoy  Yasushi Akashi had left the city.    However, foreign news agencies on Wednesday quoted his  spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman as saying that the  Moslem forces had only returned fire.    UNPROFOR reports show that the Moslem side on Tuesday fired  200 shells while the Serb side responded with 600 grenades.    The Moslem side fired a great many shells from artillery  positions in the vicinity of civilian objects in central  Sarajevo, the French news agency AFP quoted Aikman as saying.    Bosnian Serb army sources have recently warned that the  Moslems are using civilian facilities as military positions for  attacks on serb positions.    The sources believe that the Moslem plan is to provoke the  Serb forces to neutralize those positions in order to accuse the  Serbs of shelling civilian facilities, including hospitals.    At the NATO summit in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday, the  German delegation said there were proofs that the Moslem  artillery had shelled the city airport late last week in order  to prevent the departure of their leader Izetbegovic to Bonn for  talks with President of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia  Franjo Tudjman.    In the area of Sarajevo, Moslem units continued unprovoked  attacks on all Serb suburbs from various weapons, the Bosnian  Serb army sources said.</p>

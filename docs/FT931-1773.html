			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: P&amp;O P&amp;O is in the seemingly paradoxical position that it pays its stockholders too much while rewarding them too little. From one perspective, it was a considerable relief that the company maintained its year-end dividend underpinning the doubling of the share price that has occurred since September. From another viewpoint, though, it has merely exacerbated P&amp;O's financial strain by distributing the bulk of its earnings. Last year, P&amp;O paid out dividends of Pounds 178.6m from distributable profits of Pounds 191.9m. With gearing hovering above 60 per cent, P&amp;O needs an economic upturn in order to secure a decent return on its substantial past investment programme. One option might be to tap shareholders for more funds - as P&amp;O did in 1991 with a Pounds 604m rights issue. But the group may now have found another means of keeping the cash merry-go-round in motion. Yesterday's sale of its catering business to Granada reveals the worth of just one of its many hidden gems: a business with net tangible assets of Pounds 49.2m was sold for Pounds 360m. With a diversified portfolio crammed with assets of more than Pounds 4bn, P&amp;O may well be tempted to make more disposals to realise shareholder value. The rest of the business service division may follow. Property sales also look likely when markets harden. The question is whether P&amp;O really is set upon achieving shareholder value in this way.</p>

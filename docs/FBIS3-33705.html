			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamdan al-Hajj] </F>   [Text] Marwan Dudin, deputy head of the Jordanian  delegation to the Jordanian-Israeli peace talks has called on  the Arab League member states to meet without delay to discuss  the amendment unanimously adopted by the U.S. Senate, which bans  U.S. arms sales to countries boycotting U.S. companies that deal  commercially with Israel.    In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR, Dudin said it has  become important that the Arab parties meet to discuss this  subject very seriously so that the Arab measures will have a  collective meaning, as did the original Arab League decision on  the Arab boycott of Israel.    However, he said it is not strange that the U.S. Senate  adopts such decisions that are supportive of, and openly biased  toward Israel. This decision also shows disrespect for the  broad relations between Arab countries and the United States.    He wondered how the U.S. Administration would be able to  reconcile the Senate decision with the desire to activate U.S.  arms sales to the Arab countries, especially the rich ones whose  arms purchase figures are astronomical.    Dudin ruled out the possibility that the U.S. Administration  could implement this decision unless implementation is  accompanied by U.S. pressures on Britain, France, Russia, and  other countries that compete with the United States in supplying  Arab countries with weapons.    He expected the U.S. Administration to circumvent this  decision by arguing that the peace process is at an advanced  stage, and its success will lead, sooner or later, to the  lifting of this boycott of Israel.    He said, however, that from the practical point of view, the  decision may have one direct effect; it will intensify pressures  on the Arab parties to the Arab-Israeli negotiations to expedite  reaching reconciliation arrangements with Israel that are below  these parties' aspirations, and said such an effect is very  likely.</p>

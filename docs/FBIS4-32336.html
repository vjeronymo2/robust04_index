			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sz.P."-attributed report: "The Expected Members of the </F> Horn Government"]    [Text] According to our information received from leading  Socialist circles, it has not yet been decided who will fill  certain state secretarial positions where the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] is to provide the minister, and even the  names of some ministers are not yet known. As has come to  light, according to the conditional agreement, out of the future  government's 12 ministries, three will be headed by the Alliance  of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. It can be taken as certain that Gabor  Kuncze will be the interior minister and Ferenc Wekler will  probably be his state secretary. Karoly Lotz, who was a deputy  for the SZDSZ in the previous Parliament, too, is expected to  head the Transport Ministry. It can be taken as certain that  Gabor Fodor is to head the Ministry for Culture [and Education],  and probably MSZP Deputy Chairman Gyorgy Janosi will be his  Socialist political state secretary. Laszlo Kovacs, chairman of  the former Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, will head the  Foreign Ministry in the next cycle. The political state  secretary in the Foreign Ministry will also be a Socialist. The  name of Ferenc Somogyi, a former administrative state secretary,  was raised but, according to our informant, his nomination is  not yet clarified. Laszlo Bekesi will head the Finance  Ministry. Laszlo Pal is the likely industry minister and,  according to our information, Tatabanya deputy Gabor Szalay will  be the Free Democrat political state secretary. The former Expo  commissioner Etele Barath is expected to head the Environmental  Ministry and the MSZP will also provide the political state  secretary, parliamentary group expert Katalin Szili is a  possible candidate. The Socialist Laszlo Lakos is certain to  head the Agricultural Ministry. The SZDSZ will provide the  political state secretary, possibly Zoltan Kiss. Mrs Kosa,  Magda Kovacs will probably be the labor minister, and MSZP  executive member Sandor Csintalan could be her state secretary  but, according to our information, he has so far refused the  nomination. The renamed Health and Welfare Ministry  [Egeszsegugyi es Szocialis] will be headed by Pal Kovacs. MSZP  executive member Mihaly Kokeny could be his state secretary.  The situation at the Justice and Defense Ministries is somewhat  unclear. According to some of our sources, Kalman Kulcsar is  still a serious candidate for the Justice Ministry, and in this  case, Pal Vastagh could head the Defense Ministry. Bela Katona  could also get a position in the Defense Ministry's leadership.  According to our information, the MSZP has not yet found a  nominee for the position of minister without portfolio  supervising the secret services; the fate of this position is  unclear at the moment.    We have also acquired information regarding the chairmen of  parliamentary committees. The Constitutional Committee would be  headed by Peter Hack of the SZDSZ, the Defense Committee by Imre  Mecs (SZDSZ), and the Foreign Affairs Committee by Istvan Szent-  Ivanyi, also of the SZDSZ. Of the committees headed by the  Socialists, Judit Csehak will probably be the chairwoman of the  Welfare Committee, Csaba Tabajdi the chairman of the Human  Rights Committee, Sandor Orosz of the Agricultural Committee,  and Ivan Vitanyi of the Cultural Committee.</p>

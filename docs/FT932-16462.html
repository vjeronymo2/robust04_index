			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Executive pay growth slows further EXECUTIVES' pay rises slowed further over the 12 months to April 1, according to the Noble Lowndes group of management consultants and actuaries. But although employers are applying the brake, they are not pushing it as hard as they were six months ago. The group's index shows that the average pay for all ranks of executives increased by 5.7 per cent in the 12 months ended last Thursday, compared with 8.6 per cent in the 12 months to April 1 last year. Of the latest 5.7-point gain, however, more than half has come in the six months since September. The index - which also includes the value of benefits such as cars and pensions as well as salaries and bonuses - is based on a survey of 5,362 managers in 422 companies in the UK. Noble Lowndes says that the proportion of managers whose pay is completely frozen is now 6.3 per cent, compared with 7.1 per cent a year ago. The great majority of the remainder have had rises of at least twice the government's 1.5 per cent ceiling on public-sector increases. Among the managers, chief executives and directors of big companies with sales turnovers of more than Pounds 600m have continued to improve their differential over other groups.

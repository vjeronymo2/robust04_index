			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BRAY DEFEATS IRISH CHAMPION IN 3-ROUND HEAVYWEIGHT BOUT  </P> <P> Heavyweight boxer John Bray of Van Nuys won a unanimous three-round decision  over Irish national champion Sean O'Reagan on Friday at Caesars Atlantic City  during a U.S.-Ireland amateur dual meet.  </P> <P> The United States won the meet, 7-3, in the first head-to-head meeting between  the nations since 1985.  </P> <P> Bray, 18, who had not fought since losing in the final of the Western Olympic  Trials last May, said that the layoff had hurt him. He also pinned some of his  problems on failing to maintain his prefight strategy.  </P> <P> "I got away from my game plan," Bray said. "First I was going to box him, but  then I thought I could hurt him. I thought I could have taken him out with my  right hand, but it didn't happen." STEVEN HERBERT  </P></p>

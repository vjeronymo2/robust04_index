			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Arts: Volpone - Theatre By some strange fluke, there is a rush of Venetian premieres in the Midlands this week, New productions of Jonson's Volpone at the Birmingham Rep, and at Stratford-upon-Avon of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice and Goldoni's The Venetian Twins. (Even Matthew Hart's new work for Birmingham Royal Ballet featured Venetian blinds.) In several ways, Bill Alexander's Volpone staging is a sequel to the Othello with which, in March, he launched his new Birmingham Rep regime. And where does Act One of Othello take place? Venice, city of intrigue, lawsuits and (in the Renaissance) finance. Jonson's satirical farces are tight, neat, unromantic affairs, far from Shakespeare's larger-spirited, more varied, ironic and lyrical comedies. As long as you cut it judiciously, Volpone is a remarkably playable comedy, and it adapts smartly to different stagings. This Volpone is as fine as Nicholas Hytner's 1990 staging at the Almeida in London. Where Hytner evoked the intimacy of Venice by having water swishing around the perimeters of the small stage area, this one evokes the city's scale, with an arching bridge looming high above the Rep's large stage. The designer, Kit Surrey, has taken his basic Othello set - huge tiles lining floor and walls - and dyed it brown and gold. This production's skill lies in contrasting public and private scenes, in telling the story with robust vitality, and in giving surprising comic emphasis to several supporting characters. Corvino (Jamie Newall), whose grossly misogynistic treatment of his wife Celia can be so disturbing, is here a comic monster. The scenes involving Sir Politic Would-be and his wife (all omitted by Hytner) are here made hilarious. Everything is so lucid and onward-moving that it hardly matters that several central roles are miscast. Or that Alexander has cut not only such songs as Jonson's Catullus translation 'Come, my Celia, let us prove' but also Volpone's three special minions - his dwarf, hermaphrodite and eunuch. Or that Alexander and Surrey somewhat diminish the play by locating it (like Jonathan Miller's Merchant of Venice) at the turn of the last century, with cafe society, boaters, and frock coats. Bernard Horsfall plays the title role like a skinny Falstaff - scurrilous, lofty, urbane, an amusing still hub of the action, warmest when in in his cups. But he is a Volpone/fox neither cunning nor predatory. He lacks the acid for such remarks as 'women and men of every sex,' and he is too obviously the passive dupe of the parasite fly, Mosca. In which role Gerard Murphy is not just wrong - impossible to imagine him either buzzing or flying - but also over-indulges all his worst hark-at-me mannerisms: the odd back-of-the-mouth tone formation; the unspontaneous delivery of even so simple a line as 'Do so'. By contrast, Andrea Mason's Celia is coarse and under-refined, her elocution as weak as her maquillage is strong. Yet these and other flaws hang light in the scales. I loved the detailed ensemble playing in the big trial scene, the sense of Venetian open-air chat, the vivid sweep of the whole satire. As in Othello, 20 extras help to swell the big scenes. And Alexander's decision to bring the front of the Rep stage right forward beyond the proscenium arch continues to pay dividends. Stagings now project here so surely that I relish the whole balance of steep auditorium and deep stage. In three months Alexander has made the Rep, whose acoustic I used to dread, a theatre I look forward to revisiting. Birmingham Rep until June 26</p>

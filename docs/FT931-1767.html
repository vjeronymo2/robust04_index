			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Granada buys caterer from P&amp;O: Sutcliffe included in Pounds 360m sale of groups with Pounds 500m sales GRANADA, the television and leisure group, is increasing its business services activities with the Pounds 360m acquisition of catering, work wear and other companies from P&amp;O. Sutcliffe, the largest company being acquired, is the third largest contract caterer in the UK behind Compass Group and Gardner Merchant. For Mr Gerry Robinson, who joined Granada as chief executive in 1991 from Compass, the purchase takes Granada into contract catering and gives opportunities to save money through joint purchasing with Granada's motorway catering business. 'It's an excellent strategic fit,' Mr Robinson said. 'My own knowledge of catering also makes it a very safe affair,' he said. The other companies being acquired include Spring Grove, the UK's third largest textile rental operator. P&amp;O chairman Lord Sterling said all the businesses being sold were UK based and the money would develop P&amp;O's international business. The companies being sold had combined turnover last year of Pounds 500m and made trading profits of Pounds 29m. Sutcliffe had trading profits of Pounds 15.2m on turnover of Pounds 358m. It had more than 2,000 contracts, of which more than 90 per cent were on a 'cost plus' basis. Sutcliffe's operating margins of 4.3 per cent compared with about 10 per cent for Compass, Mr Robinson said. The acquisitions would be 'at least' earnings neutral this year. Granada hoped to improve margins in Sutcliffe and Spring Grove by improved purchasing and control of overheads. Following the acquisition, Granada's TV rental division would account for less than 50 per cent of trading profits for the first time for 'many years', the company said. Granada will use Pounds 212m of existing resources, and is raising a further Pounds 148m through a vendor placing to institutions at 350p a share. The issue was well received by the stock market, where the shares gained 20p to 385p. The placing was underwritten by Hoare Govett and Swiss Bank Corporation. Borrowings for the deal will increase Granada's net debt to Pounds 350m, equal to gearing of more than 80 per cent. Mr Henry Staunton, finance director, said gearing would fall to about 50 per cent next year. Lex, Page 22; P&amp;O results, Page 24</p>

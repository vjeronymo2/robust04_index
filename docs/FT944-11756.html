			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Red tape in perspective The Deregulation and Contracting Out Act, which became law yesterday, is an extraordinary hotchpotch of a measure. If properly applied, it could make a modest improvement to Britain's competitiveness. But its most important contribution to that goal may be to put an end to the misconceived notion that deregulation tout court is a panacea for the ills of the British economy. The deregulation act does everything from establishing a new legislative procedure for sweeping away outdated rules and procedures affecting business to reducing the accounting and reporting requirements on small charities, allowing betting on Sundays and permitting children into the bars of suitable pubs. The important provisions are the powers which will allow ministers to abolish or reform regulations they consider outdated and burdensome where this can be done without removing 'necessary' protection, and the five new powers to improve the fairness, transparency and consistency of enforcement procedures. In both cases, the legislation is drawn in general terms, so it is hard to tell in advance how much difference it will make. Throughout the parliamentary debates on the legislation the Labour party condemned it as a 'constitutional outrage', because of the powers given to ministers to frame proposals for the repeal or amendment of regulations. Concern was expressed that health and safety might be compromised by excessive deregulation. Right of appeal On the other hand, some business leaders believe the provisions do not go far enough, and are aggrieved at the failure to provide a simple and statutory right of appeal against enforcement orders, particularly those emanating from local councils. The trade and industry department has gone no further than a 'model appeal mechanism' which has still to be drawn up and will be incorporated in future legislation. In practice, the constitutional outrage is unlikely to materialise. Nor is the wholesale escape from local regulation which some companies seek. The government claims that 40 per cent of the health and safety regulation which affects the 'generality' of business should be removed. Yet it is equally insistent that it is not going to remove necessary protection either for employees or for local communities and claims the support of the Health and Safety Commission for most of its recommendations. That can only mean that most of the regulation to be swept away involves petty bureaucracy, rules that are anyway in disuse, or regulations which impact on only a small proportion of businesses. So it appears from the deregulatory changes already decided upon, which include halving the waiting period for claiming VAT for bad debt relief and scrapping 85,000 employment survey forms a year. Euro-regulation More of the same is welcome. It is also important that a standing watch is kept on the rise of Euro-regulation - either in its direct form of unnecessary obligations imposed by Brussels or its indirect form of overzealous application of EU directives by UK officials. Yet there is no point pretending that such action is going to transform the business climate and sharply improve Britain's competitiveness. To do that, governments need, over the long term, to find a way of containing public spending and taxation, while promoting better education and skill training - and the local and national infrastructure that companies and individuals need to flourish. The priorities are familiar, but no less urgent for that. Britain's record on vocational training remains abysmal - and recent reports on the progress of the new General National Vocational Qualifications do not lead one to suppose that a miracle cure has yet been found. The Training and Enterprise Councils have still to prove themselves as employer-led vehicles for training. More needs to be done to equip the unemployed with skills, and to make it attractive for companies to employ them. Some form of 'modern apprenticeship' for young employees with poor skill levels is essential. The list could be continued. At the end of the day, the country would be better off, even if too many forms were issued, so long as far more employees could complete them in decent English.</p>

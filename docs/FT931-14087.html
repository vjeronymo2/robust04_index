			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Thyssen to increase prices in April as sales fall 16% THYSSEN Stahl Group, Germany's biggest steelmaker, yesterday reported a 16 per cent fall in sales to DM2.5bn (Dollars 1.57bn) in the first quarter of the year to September 30 1993. The group also announced it would increase its steel prices by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent on April 1, depending on the products, and by an additional 5 per cent on July 1. The increases would return prices to their July 1992 levels, Mr Wolfgang Kohler, a member of the board, said. Low steel prices have been blamed for helping to push European steel groups into recession. Mr Ekkehard Schulz, chairman of the board, welcomed British Steel's recent decision to increase prices, calling it 'a step in the right direction'. Thyssen Stahl Group was formed last October following the merger of Thyssen Stahl and Thyssen Edelstahl, the special steel division, in an attempt to cut costs and restructure production. Mr Schulz said that the merger could save at least DM200m. Pre-tax profits at Thyssen Stahl dropped for the fiscal year ending September 30 1992 to DM158m from DM651m in the previous 12 months. All of the group's divisions were in the red, except for those producing stainless steel and rails, Mr Schulz said. Thyssen Edelstahl recorded a DM313m loss against a DM63m deficit in the previous year. Sales dropped by 8 per cent to DM3.1bn. Sales of long products dropped by 6 per cent in the first quarter of the fiscal year to September 30 1993. Mr Karl-Heinz Rosener, director of Thyssen Edelstahl's board, said this was due to over-capacity in Europe, which had led to a 'ruinous price war.' Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, which manufacture long steel products, were accused by the German company of 'dumping' products in the European Community. Further job cuts are expected as part of the new group's restructuring efforts. Nearly 4,000 workers will be laid off over the current fiscal year. Group redundancies are expected to reach 8,000 by September 30, 1994. The group already has nearly 12,000 employees on part-time work. The consolidated group's total labour force is 57,500. Mr Schulz also called on the EC to devise pan-European measures to reduce capacity and to reduce subsidies enjoyed by some European steel producers. He added that the recent prognosis by the German Steel Association, which predicted that crude steel production in western Germany would drop by 5 per cent in 1993 to 35m tonnes, was 'too optmistic'.</p>

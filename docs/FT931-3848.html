			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Week in the Markets: Gold edges above seven-year low GOLD ended the week, in the words of one analyst, 'clinging manfully to the ropes by the skin of of its gold-capped teeth.' It closed on the London bullion market yesterday at Dollars 327.75 a troy ounce, down Dollars 2.20 on the week but holding above the successive seven-year lows seen earlier. The market went into reverse from the beginning of the week, shedding Dollars 2.80 on Monday and retreating to Dollars 326.05 on Wednesday. It was fixed at consecutive seven-year lows on Tuesday and Wednesday. The fall was heralded last week by the decline of South Africa's commercial rand to 3.19 against the US dollar, pointed out Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe. At Dollars 328 a troy ounce, South African producers were able to sell their gold forward at R1,050, leaving them a healthy profit. The retreat below the recent trading range between Dollars 327 and Dollars 332 led many analysts to predict further falls. Mr Lawrence Eagles, of GNI the London futures broker, said the market was looking very bad technically, and predicted a rapid decline if Dollars 325 was breached, possibly to below Dollars 300 by the end of the year. While support has held at Dollars 325 this week, there is little apart from Far Eastern demand to support the gold market, which has lost its lure for investors in the West. 'There is a total lack of interest,' said Mr Euan Worthington of SG Warburg. 'People have other games to play.' Much of the demand in the Far East has come from China. A recent report from American Precious Metals Advisors of the US suggested that the country absorbed 800 tonnes (26m troy ounces) last year. This more than offset the 650 tonnes sold by central banks, including 400 tonnes by the Dutch. The threat of further central bank sales continues to hang over the market, while any rally is likely to be met by further producer sales - particularly from South Africa. Events in Russia, where Boris Yeltsin is fighting for his political survival, have helped to boost platinum metal group prices because of fears of supply disruption. Platinum ended up Dollars 6.95 on the week at Dollars 351.25. But any so-called 'safe-haven' money is expected to go to the US dollar  - and the stronger the dollar, the worse for gold. As one London dealer told the Reuter news agency yesterday: 'Gold looks awful which ever way you look at it.' On the London Metal Exchange copper has shone dimly in a week of little interest for the base metals. Three-month metal closed yesterday at Pounds 1,546.25 a tonne, up Pounds 48.50 on the week. In dollar terms it moved above the Dollars 2,200 level. Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett, said that of all the base metals, copper had the most robust fundamentals. Stocks on New York's Comex had declined by 14 per cent from their mid-February peak to 97,116 tonnes, giving a clear signal that the US was emerging from recession, he said. However, Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist with RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, said this week that while the US economy was recovering, the German and Japanese economies were not. He pointed out that Western Europe and Japan accounted for roughly half the Western World's consumption of non-ferrous metals. 'Even with the US recovery gathering momentum, therefore, prices of metals and minerals are unlikely to depart far from their present trading ranges until late in the year at best,' he predicted. In the softs markets cocoa has continued to slide, again giving delegates to next week's International Cocoa Organisation council meeting plenty to chew on as they struggle to reach a compromise that might lead to a new agreement with economic clauses. The London May contract closed yesterday at Pounds 689 a tonne, a fall of Pounds 20 on the week and Pounds 73 off the recent peak. The retreat has mainly been attributed to the failure of last week's talks on the cocoa pact in Geneva. Profit taking by a few speculators who were gambling on the talks succeeding turned into technical selling as chart levels were breached. 'There has been long liquidation by the speculators, the trade, the funds and the industry,' said Mr Tony Chadwick, of Prudential Bache. The situation had been worsened by the fact that the market had absorbed a lot of selling from producer countries during the recent rally. Consumer and producer delegates in Geneva were able to agree only that 350,000 tonnes of cocoa should be withheld from the world market. They will be trying next week to agree on how a withholding scheme should be financed, and at what level prices should be defended. Any progress could lead them back to Geneva. The New York raw sugar market, which has been pushed over 10 cents a lb by cuts in the estimated level of Thai production because of drought, went into retreat at the beginning of the week. But yet another cut in the Thai production forecast to 3.51m tonnes - the lowest level for five years - moved the market smartly up again. The fall in estimates for Thai production has been quite dramatic - from an early season forecast of 5m tonnes it came down to 4.44m tonnes at the end of last month and 3.86m tonnes last week. Thai production is likely to remain the key factor in the sugar market, with some analysts expecting a move above 11 cents soon.  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close)                                 Tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium      +22,700  to   1,699,700 Copper            +450  to     339,400 Lead            +2,150  to     237,300 Nickel            +648  to      85,530 Zinc            +5,500  to     579,575 Tin               +595  to      18,990  --------------------------------------</p>

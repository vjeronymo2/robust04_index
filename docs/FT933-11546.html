			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Delays cast doubt on Brazilian sell-offs DOUBTS are growing among Brazilian investors about President Itamar Franco's conversion to the privatisation cause in the face of a series of delays, including the postponement of two sales this week. All of Brazil's four finance ministers during the 10-month-old Franco government have cited acceleration of privatisation as a crucial policy. Mr Franco, a former opponent of privatisation, moved to back the policy after realising that supporting the state sector was draining Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) a year from the Treasury. Yet the reality is that while much of Latin America is speeding ahead with bold programmes, Brazil's plans have been grinding to a halt. Only two companies have been sold this year and eight sales have been postponed, leaving more than 120 companies in state hands. Mr Franco has transferred the power of final approval over minimum price to the Senate, which is expected to add to the delays. No important companies have been put on the 'for sale' list, despite consensus that selling off some of the big parastatals such as Vale do Rio Doce, the state mining company, would help to plug the fiscal deficit. One of the main reasons for the slowdown is division within the Franco team. Some ministers, such as Mr Paulino Cicero, the energy minister, while resigned to privatisation as a whole, object to the sale of specific companies. Five working groups are studying measures to speed up the process, make it more lucrative and protect against creation of private monopolies. Direct sales or share offers through Banco do Brasil may replace the auction method. Further changes may result from recent congressional approval of legislation allowing private sector concessions to run public services and a vote to lift the 40 per cent limit on foreign ownership. Some analysts suspect the studies to be delaying tactics. However, Mr Igor Cornelsen, director of Chartered West LB in Sao Paulo, said: 'I think they want to privatise but they don't know how to and they don't trust investment bankers to tell them how.' The new rules are expected to be announced in September. In the meantime, the delays are not only allowing anti-privatisation lobbies to muster forces, but are also costing the government money. The sale of the Cosipa steel mill has just been delayed to August 11 at the earliest. The mill is costing the government Dollars 1m a day in debt interest. Sale of the PQU petrochemicals company was also postponed. A row has erupted between Mr Franco and the foreign ministry after the president publicly attacked the country's most senior ambassadors overseas for failing to defend the government against the international outcry over the massacre last Friday of seven street children. Mr Franco said he was 'highly dissatisfied' with his ambassadors in London, Washington, Rome, Paris and New York among others and was considering replacing them.</p>

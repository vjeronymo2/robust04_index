			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Robust Growth in Trade With China"] </F>   [Text] Trade with the Chinese countries (China, Taiwan, and  Hong Kong) boomed in 1993. Exports grew by 40 percent, even  faster than imports, which rose by 36 percent. The trade  deficit with the Chinese countries rose during the same period  to about 3.5 billion guilders, around 850 million guilders more  than in the same period the year before. This was apparent from  trade figures for the Chinese countries covering the period  January-October 1993.  <H5>  Exports To China </H5>   Exports to China passed the 1 billion guilder mark in 1993.  All F-100's are now included in the figures for Netherlands  exports to China. If the Netherlands export figures are  corrected to compensate for this incidental item then the  increase in exports would be "just" 50 percent. In that case,  exports -- corrected for airplanes -- would not exceed 1 billion  guilders in 1993. In addition, the growth in exports to China  is supported by the semi-finished products sector. This sector  multiplied its exports sixfold for a total of 145 million  guilders. The main articles involved are iron and steel  products (blast furnaces). It is also striking that exports of  chemicals to China dropped slightly.    Exports to Taiwan and Hong Kong rose virtually across the  board.    There are no real ups or downs. By far the Netherlands' most  important export products to these countries are capital goods.  <H5>  Imports of Machines </H5>   The growth of imports from the Chinese countries was  primarily found in the sector of machines and transportation  equipment and other end products. The first category concerns  chiefly consumer durables, such as consumer electronics and  household white goods, as well as capital goods such as  computers and computer parts, in which the growth in electron  tubes and transistors is striking. This growth is supported  primarily by imports from Taiwan. In the sector of other end  products, the growth in imports of clothing, footwear, and toys  is striking. This growth is supported by imports from China and  Hong Kong.    The CBS [Central Office for Statistics] is assuming that  annual figures for 1993 will be released before 1 May.</p>

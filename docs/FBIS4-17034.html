			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] According to EVRAZIA news agency, the ethnic  cleansing of Georgians continues in Sukhumi.    Thirty Georgians, mainly old people, were evicted from  Sukhumi on 15 April. Those people who do not obey the  separatists' demands to leave their own homes invariably  disappear.    Confrontation between the so-called pure-blooded Abkhazians  and the Abkhazians of Georgian descent, grows day by day.  According to the separatists, Georgian Abkhazians must not be  trusted. In their opinion they [Georgian Abkhazians] are fickle  and if the situation should change, they will side with the  Georgians. Therefore, the so-called pure Abkhazians are  creating specialized armed formations for liquidating Georgian  Abkhazians. These formations do not spare other nationalities  either. A clear example of the above-mentioned is the mass  carnage of the Greek population in the village of Odishi by the  separatists. [passage omitted]</p>

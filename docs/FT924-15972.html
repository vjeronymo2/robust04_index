			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Arts: Designer sufferings - Cinema CITY OF JOY (12) MGMs West End BITTER MOON (18) Odeon Haymarket CARRY ON COLUMBUS (PG) Odeon Leicester Sq GAS FOOD LODGING (15) Metro, Renoir In City Of Joy Patrick Swayze plays an American doctor who has a moment of truth in the operating room. A patient dies; the doctor's inner world collapses; then he goes off to India to find himself. That is putting it crudely. But then this film directed by Roland Joffe from Mark Medoff's screenplay based on Dominique Lapierre's book of stories about Calcutta spends 130 minutes putting it and almost everything else crudely. For this is the cinema of moral improvement; and improvement, for directors like Joffe, involves a great deal of hitting the filmgoer over the head. First, we must have two stories of spiritual self-reclamation, not one. Paralleling Swayze's Indian salvation quest is the story of Hasari (Om Puri), a poor Bengali drought-driven from his farm to become a rickshaw driver in the city. (And he brings a wife, Shabana Azmi, who goes through her own feminist self-realisation programme.) Secondly, every ten-ton cliche about the Westerner lost in the East must be invoked as Swayze spends his first days in Calcutta behaving as if he has strayed onto the moon. 'Do you have a hamburger?' he asks perplexedly at a street cafe. And he is even more perplexed by Dr Pauline Collins, an Irish Mother Teresa who would like to recruit him for her 'City Of Joy Self-Help School and Dispensary'. (The lame and the lost, side by side with life-enhancing music by Ennio Morricone.) But out here in Calcutta, the disillusioned uncommitted American is still making up his mind. Although he has a Dollars 30m movie marking time around him, he is paralysed by self-pity. How to animate him? Joffe and Medoff know. Bring on a couple of cardboard villains to catalyse the plot. Pin Calcutta's problems of poverty and pain on two protection racketeers, the Sydney Greenstreet lookalike Shyamanand Jalan and his snake-like son Art Malik, who are bullying the Self-Help Centre and threatening to de-rickshaw Mr Hasari. Soon the sufferings of a city are tidily reduced to a set of standardised snarls and fisticuffs; and here comes the monsoon in time to melodramatise Hasari's climactic crise de rickshaw. This burst of plot pushes things along nicely, so we can now move into the Ultimate Uplift phase of a Joffe film when serious spiritual messages are spelled out for the deaf and dumb. First Dr Swayze must make the right choice from the three life options outlined by Doc Collins: 'To run, to spectate or to commit.' Then the torment-tempered Hasari, who has turned over a new leaf and discovered his wife underneath, must let the latter find herself through work. And finally a reproduction of Gericault's painting 'The Raft Of The Medusa', which has been mysteriously dragged through several scenes, must be spotlighted as a Major Metaphor. Explains Swayze, the painting is a parable of hope. The dying cling heroically to the raft while the other figures gaze off into the distance symbolising human optimism. Ah great art: it is so simple when you explain it. City Of Joy feels like a Sunday School sermon slumming it as a movie. Alternately pie-eyed and patronising, schematic and sentimentalised, it repeats the pattern of Joffe's previous films: the large-screen spectacle and cast of hundreds belying the puny message about human hope that we end up with. In The Killing Fields the Cambodian struggle was reduced to a moral play-off between selfish West (Sydney Schanberg) and brave compassionate East (Dith Pran). In The Mission Western evangelism was vanquished, after two hours of token brouhaha, by noble savagery. And in City Of Joy a group of characters who begin by telegraphing their lost status to us as crudely as comic-book characters end up being redeemed, no less crudely, each by his own designer suffering. Roman Polanski's Bitter Moon, though no less risible at times than City Of Joy, at least suggests that human beings are complex organisms; and that people who go to India to find themselves often lose themselves long before they get there. Take Nigel and Fiona (Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott-Thomas). Cruising through the Med on a luxury liner - their ultimate destination India and its 'inner serenity' - they meet a nutty American in a wheelchair called Oscar (Peter Coyote). Also present: Oscar's disturbed, beautiful, possibly nymphomaniacal French wife Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner). Soon Oscar is drowning whisky by the tank-load while he regales the disconcerted Englishman with his marital sex history. S and M; golden showers; multiple orgasms; whips; guns. It is all too much for Nigel who keeps interrupting with 'Steady on, old boy' or 'For God's sake, man]' and begs Oscar to get a grip on himself. Sadly this is all that Oscar, crippled by one of Mimi's more imaginative escapades, can now do anyway. How long before we come to a menage a trois or possibly even quatre? Not long: 2 1/4 hours by my watch and they fly by in this black comedy based on Pascal Bruckner's novel Lunes De Fiel. How many of the movie's giggles are intentional we cannot know. Did Polanski mean his Nigel and Fiona to be quite such chinless wonders from the inner reaches of Belgravia? Did Mr P and his co-screenwriters Gerard Brach and Alan Brownjohn mean Oscar's voice-off narrations to be quite so orotundly loopy ('Eternity for me began one July day in Paris . . .', 'We were soon headed for sexual bankruptcy . . .'). But then again those hundred-odd photographs of great litterateurs on Oscar's Paris wall - Hemingway, Stein, Fitzgerald - must be a gag anyway. And that image of the electric toaster that pops its load, in one French flashback, just as Oscar is about to pop his load - surely another jape? We would be astonished if Polanski's tongue were not firmly in his cheek here and elsewhere. I found this film monstrously funny: a Ship Of Fools hi-jacked by the Marquis De Sade, a Poseidon Adventure turned turtle from upright family entertainment to murky erotic adventurism. There is something perversely splendid about a movie that keeps gazumping its own excesses. And there is something straightforwardly splendid about Peter Coyote's performance: a drawling, savage, acerbic showpiece that swiftly establishes Oscar as second cousin to Albee's Martha in Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? Carry On Columbus is the week's third film in quest of India and the year's third film in quest of Columbus. It may be the worst in each set. This voyage hardly sets sail before its crew - Jim Dale as Columbus, Julian Clary, Bernard Cribbins, Aexei Sayle - are attacked by savage comparisons with the old Carry Ons and by man-eating memories of Kenneth Williams, Sid James and Co. A few early puns raise a faint smile. 'What makes you think he's up to it?' quavers Leslie Philips' King of Spain about Columbus; 'I've seen his testimonials' coos June Whitfield's Queen. But the film is soon bare of wit in the script (by Dave Freeman) and barer still of that wild, honking energy in the acting that once, circa Nurse, Doctor and Up The Khyber, covered the naked bits in the dialogue. According to Gas Food Lodging, a small-town mood piece by first-time film-maker Allison Anders, Laramie, New Mexico, is a strange town. It consists of women bursting into tears and men taking unfair advantage of their distress. Two sisters trying to take the swift non-scenic route to maturity - the young Shade (Fairuza Balk) being urged on towards self-discovery by the older Trudi (Ione Skye) - are hindered by watchful Mum (Brooke Adams) and helped by the rabid male population. Between tender talk scenes in the family trailer home there are assorted pick-ups, near-rapes and pregnancies, plus a increasing sense of seen-it-all-before. Chief redeeming merit: the director's peripheral vision. This takes in all the wonderful dime-store El Dorados masqerading as interior decor in these parts. Surrounded by Jesus pictures, dayglo rocks and luminous crucifixes, you too might hitch a ride out of town with the first eligible rapist.</p>

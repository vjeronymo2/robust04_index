			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> GROUP TO FIGHT MALATHION SPRAYING  </P> <P> A newly formed coalition of residents opposed to spraying malathion to control  the Mediterranean fruit fly plans to demonstrate next week outside the Board of  Supervisors chambers, group leaders announced Friday.  </P> <P> Members of Orange County Citizens Against Malathion Spraying, a grassroots  group of residents from 10 cities, will also attend the board's Tuesday  meeting, along with medical and scientific experts opposed to the spraying.  </P> <P> "There is a groundswell movement all across Orange County," said Bob Taylor, a  spokesman for the organization, which formed Thursday night. "We're going to be  out there in force. We see this as a real showdown."  </P> <P> Taylor and others suggest that the malathion spraying represents a serious  health threat, is an improper approach to preventing the spread of the Medfly  and invades the privacy of residents in the spray zones.  </P> <P> Leaders hope to persuade the supervisors to revoke an emergency declaration  that has permitted the spraying. In addition, they want to pave the way for  city attorneys from Orange County municipalities to file legal challenges to  the next planned sprayings, scheduled for mid-February.  </P> <P> "They're experimenting on us," Taylor said. "Just because this is a low dose  doesn't mean it's not harmful. . . . It's one thing to spray a few bushes in a  selected way, it's another thing entirely to spray across whole counties."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Huntington Beach City Atty. Gail C. Hutton charged Friday that the  state government is reneging on its agreement to produce witnesses for the  city's effort to halt spraying.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Hutton noted, state Assistant Atty. Gen. Andrea Ordin pledged to  make pilots and other witnesses available to answer the city's questions. But  on Friday, Hutton said, she learned that the state is only going to allow the  city to ask basic background questions of helicopter pilots and other workers  involved in the spraying operation.  </P> <P> Hutton said the city wants to learn from the pilots whether the aerial spraying  is extending to areas that don't need to be sprayed.  </P> <P> "We've been told that much of the spraying is extended just as a convenience  for the pilots," Hutton said.  </P> <P> The city is scheduled to argue its case in a Sacramento court Feb. 15.  </P> <P> But those legal efforts may be just the beginning. In Garden Grove, city  officials are appealing to nearby cities and other communities to join in a  proposed lawsuit aimed at stopping aerial application of malathion.  </P> <P> City spokesman John Bushman said letters were sent Thursday to 10 neighboring  cities -- Anaheim, Brea, Cypress, Fullerton, Huntington Beach, La Habra, Los  Alamitos, Santa Ana, Stanton and Westminster. The letter also went to two dozen  Los Angeles County communities that have been sprayed with the pesticide.  </P> <P> Bushman said the cities might consider hiring an outside attorney to handle the  suit, rather than using city attorneys.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Michael Virga.

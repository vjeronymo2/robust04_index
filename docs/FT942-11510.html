			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Burns set to leave NFC in September NFC said that Mr Robbie Burns, managing director of its UK transport and logistics business, will leave the company in September, at the end of the group's financial year. Mr Burns, 45, was the driving force behind NFC's successful Exel logistics business and was the main internal candidate last year for the post of group chief executive. When Mr Peter Sherlock, a former director of Bass, was awarded the top job, the board took the risk of losing Mr Burns, who is only three years younger than Mr Sherlock. Mr James Watson, NFC's chairman, said yesterday: 'I am sad to be losing such a long-standing colleague, but I fully understand the appropriateness of the timing at this stage in Robbie's career.' Pending appointment of a successor, Mr Sherlock will assume responsibility for the UK transport and logistics business. NFC also announced the further expansion of its European logistics side through two German deals, worth Pounds 10.2m. The group said Exel Logistics Deutschland had entered into an agreement to market jointly national logistics services in the German temperature controlled sector with Frigoscandia, the world's leading cold storage chain which is owned by Aga, the Swedish industrial gas group. NFC has bought Rickhoff, a temperature controlled distribution operation based in northern Germany, and Rima, its operating subsidiary based in Magdeburg, eastern Germany, for a maximum Pounds 4.4m and Pounds 1.7m of debt. It has also acquired the distribution business of Frigoscandia B+G Speditions and Frigoscandia Transport for a maximum of Pounds 1.4m and assumed Pounds 2.7m of debt. In the UK, Exel Logistics has won a contract to manage the supply chain of Homepride Foods' range.</p>

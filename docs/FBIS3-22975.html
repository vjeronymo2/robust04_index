			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 15 Feb (MENA)--An official security source at  the Interior Ministry has stated that a primitive device placed  outside one of the International Kuwaiti Alexandria Bank windows  in Suriya Street in al-Jizah went off at 2015 today. The  explosion shattered the window and the windshields of two cars  parked opposite it; there was no other damage or casualties.    The security source said the device was primitively made and  was similar to those made by children to make popping sounds.  The source added that this proves that the act was only meant  to attract media attention, which remnants of the deviants are  trying hard to do to show that they still exist.    The source said that the security services are warning the  deviants that they will face a strong and decisive  confrontation. [passage omitted condemning terrorism] The  security services will not hesitate to confront these attempts  decisively. At the same time, the source said, all security  services sense the people's confidence that the police will put  an end to these petty criminal attempts, which show how weak the  deviant terrorist groups are.    The security source said that Egypt's nationalist forces  stand behind the security forces, defending by all means the  culture and history of the nation. They will never allow a  stray criminal group to sabotage the homeland.</p>

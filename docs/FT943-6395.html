			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Poland expects debt deal to boost investment Poland expects to see private investment inflows worth 'well over Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) a year' in the wake of its commercial debt reduction agreement due to be completed this month, Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, the country's deputy premier and finance minister said yesterday. Mr Kolodko was speaking after Poland had received the final assents needed from 600 holders of the country's Dollars 14bn of commercial debt for the agreement to go ahead. 'Last Friday the last major holder agreed to the buy-back component,' Mr Kolodko said. This meant the debt reduction would amount to 49.5 per cent of the commercial debt stock. Overall at the end of April Poland's net foreign debt stood at Dollars 44bn. The country's debt to western governments grouped in the Paris Club was cut by 50 per cent in a 1991 agreement. 'We have had an abnormal external credit situation since 1980 when the debt crisis first hit us and now we are returning to normal financial relations,' Mr Kolodko said. The agreement, which is due to be signed in Warsaw on September 14, means that the country's Dollars 14bn commercial debt will be cut by Dollars 6.6bn with another Dollars 2.4bn worth being bought back by the Poles at a rate of 41 cents to the dollar. The rest of the debt will be exchanged into 30-year par and discount bonds worth a total of Dollars 4.6bn. The bonds are to be secured against the sum of around Dollars 900m deposited in the US Federal Reserve in US treasury bonds which will be used to redeem the Polish government paper once it falls due in October 2024. The Dollars 1.9bn initial cost of the agreement is to be financed by Dollars 1.3bn worth of loans from the IMF and the World Bank with the balance coming from the NBP, the Polish central bank's reserves. Interest payments next year will cost Dollars 368m while the agreement, which is more generous to the Poles than originally thought because of the high buy-back component, will cost an average of Dollars 450m annually in interest payments over the next 30 years. As late as mid-July the Poles only had the assent of 92 per cent of holders of the debt, while 95 per cent was needed for the key buy-back component to be implemented. One major creditor, believed to be the Dart family of Florida in the USA, who holds Dollars 600m or 7 per cent of the debt, was then refusing to accept the reduction deal. 'We explained to them that they had no option but to join the agreement and they assented last Friday without any additional conditions,' Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, the Polish debt negotiator said yesterday, without confirming the identity of the creditor.</p>

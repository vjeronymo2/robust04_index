			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nestle on target for advance in earnings Nestle, the world's largest foods group, said sales in the first 10 months of 1993 were up 5.2 per cent to SFr46.6bn (Dollars 31.3bn). It attributed the rise to a slight acceleration of growth in the second half. Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman, said directors were 'satisfied' with progress this year in the face of sagging sales in Europe, the group's principal market area. He indicated that the sales growth trend for the full year was established, and that net income would also rise to a similar extent. The net margin would remain at last year's level of 5 per cent of sales, he said. He expected further sales and profit growth in 1994. He dismissed suggestions that consumers were turning away from branded products. 'To the extent that these products offer the consumer innovation and convenience, and provided that their prices are competitive, they will continue to benefit from consumers' loyalty,' he said. Mr Reto Domeniconi, finance director, said Nestle had been able to raise its prices an average 2.4 per cent in the first 10 months (except in countries with hyperinflation). The real internal growth of Nestle's sales remained a weak 1.2 per cent in the first 10 months, well below the 3.3 per cent in the whole of 1992. Most of the rest of the 5.2 per cent growth came from acquisitions. Sales in Europe, where the group has traditionally made half its sales, were down one per cent to SFr21.8bn. Sales in North and South America gained 10 per cent to SFr16.9bn, and those in the rest of the world jumped 14 per cent to SFr7.9bn. Mr Maucher said the group's heavy investments in developing countries were paying off. 'We are the only large food group to have a quarter of our sales in countries other than the US and Europe,' he said.</p>

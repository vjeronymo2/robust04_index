			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ORIOLES PONDER A TRADE;  </P> <P> TEAM IS HESITANT TO MAKE A CHANGE IN WINNING LINEUP  </P> <P> They have come this far, so the question is, how far can they go? They are  taking it one day at a time, the Baltimore Orioles say, but their season is  more than half over. It's time for the club's front office to confront its next  critical set of decisions.  </P> <P> As one coach put it, "When do we declare war?" Not on the field, where the  Orioles already boast a 5 1/2-game lead in the American League East, but off  the field, where pennants often are decided through a trade.  </P> <P> Because the youthful Orioles resemble no other contender in recent major league  history, their approach to the stretch drive might not follow the classic  pattern. General Manager Roland Hemond, in fact, has indicated he isn't seeking  a move to put the Orioles "over the top."  </P> <P> At this point, no one in the organization is anxious to disrupt the club's  seemingly flawless chemistry, a rarity in this era of big contracts and bigger  egos. But much can change in the hot summer months, and Hemond knows one trade  could mean the difference.  </P> <P> The Orioles considered themselves a rebuilding club when the season began, but  inevitably, their focus must shift. Every team, realistic or not, dreams of  winning its division. The opportunity doesn't come often, and it can't be taken  lightly, opposing general managers say.  </P> <P> "You go for broke," Boston General Manager Lou Gorman said. "The Red Sox have  won only one world championship in 80 years. How often do you get close? What  guarantee is there that you'll be there next year? You've got to take the  chance."  </P> <P> Said Milwaukee General Manager Harry Dalton, "If it looks like they can win the  thing with one more addition, I think they'd be very active (in the trade  market). When you smell it, when you feel like you're awfully close, it's tough  not to do whatever you can to get it."  </P> <P> Hemond dismisses such talk as premature, but in subtle ways he's already  operating with the mindset of a contender. Last September, the Orioles tried  not to tinker with their triple-A roster, forfeiting talent to keep Rochester  in a pennant race. This year, they've manipulated Rochester without regret.  </P> <P> Pitcher Jose Bautista was demoted one day after beating the defending American  League champion Oakland A's, simply because Manager Frank Robinson needed a  fresh arm. Pitcher Pete Harnisch was summoned as insurance if Jay Tibbs went on  the disabled list, which eventually happened.  </P> <P> Those moves were telling, but they hardly rated as acts of war. Hemond still is  conducting a police action. Maybe he'll get away with it, maybe he won't. "The  best thing is not to make any dramatic moves at this time," he said. "The  players we've given opportunities have given us production."  </P> <P> But will it last? Since the Red Sox collapsed in 1978, no American League East  team has taken a lead of 3 1/2 games or more into July and failed to win the  division title. History, however, is not an accurate measure for this team. The  Orioles' season is too improbable, too magical, too unreal.  </P> <P> "It's kind of weird," pitcher Dave Schmidt said. "At the start of the year, we  were rebuilding. We were going to play the young guys no matter what, to get  them experience. Now that we're in a race, we'll see if that tune doesn't  change a little.  </P> <P> "This is a team that could not only contend now, but down the road. It's my  opinion you don't tinker with it at all. I don't see changing philosophies this  quickly just because we're in a pennant race. The original plan has gotten us  to this point.  </P> <P> "The greatest thing that could happen would be to win with a rebuilding team  that is supposed to contend in two or three years. . .and still looking two or  three years down the road, seeing where we are then."  </P> <P> "I don't look at it and say, 'We can win with this group,' " Robinson said. "I  look at it and say, 'This group has done fine so far. They're maintaining it.'  We'll go as far as we can without tearing this system apart.  </P> <P> "If we find someone who can make us a better ballclub, then we wouldn't  hesitate to do it. We're not getting lulled into a false sense of security. But  we're not seeking a trade just for the sake of a trade."  </P></p>

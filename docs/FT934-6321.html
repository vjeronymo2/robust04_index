			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Stora swings back to black Stora, Europe's leading pulp and paper group, swung strongly back to profits in the third quarter of 1993, with a sharp reduction in financial costs offsetting persistent price weakness in its main markets. Profits after financial items for the three months were SKr264m (Dollars 31.5m), compared with a SKr333m loss in the same 1992 quarter. The turnround took profits for the first nine months to SKr294m from a SKr496m deficit a year ago. Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, Stora president, said the market situation was 'largely unchanged', with prices stabilising at low levels during the third quarter. 'The general economic picture in western Europe is weak, particularly in Germany,' he said. The benefit of the weaker krona lifted sales for the first nine months to SKr37.7bn from SKr35.4bn. However, operating income only increased by SKr8m to SKr850m. The real impact on the result came from the drop in financial costs, to SKr556m from SKr1.39bn. The group has benefited from lower interest rates and a better trend within its financial services arm. Cost-savings and new efficiency measures have helped the group compensate for lower prices. The company said it had already cut costs this year by SKr1.7bn. It expects savings for the full year to amount to SKr2bn, the same as in 1992. The group did not give a full-year forecast, although it will show a clear improvement on last year's SKr1.42bn loss. Deliveries of the group's main products in 1993 are expected to be largely unchanged on last year. MoDo, another Swedish forestry group, said losses had nearly halved in the first nine months of 1993, to SKr476m from SKr925m a year earlier. It said price pressures, losses from French operations, and heavy interest costs were keeping it in the red, even though the weaker krona and rationalisation had enhanced its competitiveness. The group effectively predicted a full-year loss of around SKr600m by saying its final-quarter deficit would equal the SKr123m level struck in the third quarter.</p>

These treatment standards also apply to soil and debris contaminated with these wastes, although a variance process is available for such soils (see discussion on variances in the Background section of this rule under the heading ``E. Treatment Standards for Hazardous Soil''). The preamble of the proposed rule describes the generation and characteristics of the newly listed wastes in greater detail (58 FR 48119). Today's standards are concentration-based limits for wastewaters and nonwastewaters, numerically identical to the UTS promulgated elsewhere in this rule for the nine constituents regulated in these wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute requested that EPA allow the use of these wastes as fuels in blast furnaces and other applications where coke, coal and coal tar are used as fuels. The commenters were requesting EPA to extend the existing recycling exclusion_which allows these wastes to be combined with coal feedstock residue as it is charged to the coke oven, added to the coal recovery process or mixed with coal tar before this coal tar is sold as a product or further refined. Extending this exclusion is beyond the scope of this regulation; it was not included in the September proposal as an option for managing these wastes. The Definition of Solid Waste Task Force is examining the broad range of these types of issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other comments received concerning the proposed treatment standards for coke products' wastes came from the waste treatment industry. Several waste treatment companies supported applying universal standards to these waste streams and the UTS concept in general. However, one commenter provided data in support of extending the standards originally applied to K087 to these wastes. EPA evaluated these data but found no reason not to apply UTS to these wastes. EPA's evaluation of these data is presented in the Background Document for these wastes. In separate comments, two waste treatment companies objected to the benzene nonwastewater standards as unnecessarily high and pointed out that their facilities could achieve benzene limits below that proposed in the UTS. EPA does not believe these data really reflect better treatment. Rather, the commenters appear to have generated a waste matrix in which benzene is detectable at lower levels. EPA is promulgating the benzene nonwastewater standard as proposed, believing that it reflects an appropriate and broader assessment of benzene detection limits in combustion residues. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

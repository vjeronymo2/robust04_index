			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCMARTIN JURORS DELIVER SECOND SEALED  VERDICT  </P> <P> Jurors in the McMartin preschool molestation case turned in a second verdict  Tuesday and rejected a suggestion that they cancel their Christmas vacation.  </P> <P> The verdict was sealed in an envelope and placed with another verdict delivered  last week. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders said on Monday  that he would not read any of the verdicts before jurors leave Dec. 15 for  their Christmas break. He gave them the option of working through the planned  two-week holiday, but they chose not to.  </P> <P> The jurors are considering 65 separate charges against Raymond Buckey, 31, and  his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, who are accused of molesting children at  their family-owned preschool in Manhattan Beach. They have been deliberating  for a month and have submitted only two verdicts. However, it was unclear how  many counts the jurors addressed so far, since one envelop could deal with more  than one count.  </P></p>

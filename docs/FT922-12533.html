			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy The continued exuberance of the London equity market can be put down to several factors, one of them being the record-breaking performance of Wall Street. Much the most important, though, is the belief that the UK consumer has been unleashed by last week's election result. The latest survey from the Confederation of British Industry certainly confirms that ahead of the election, retail demand was knocked flat. In the survey period - from three days after the budget to the day before the election - year-on-year retail volume was down for the first time in eight months. The timing of the survey means that retailers' expectations for this month are of doubtful value, since if they believed the opinion polls they presumably thought Labour would get in. Even so, most looked for a better if still poor month, with the important caveat that the high level of stocks meant that orders were likely to be flat. All in all, it still sounds as if consumer confidence was on the mend even before the election result was known. The real problem will come in deciding how far a strong April is simply a function of a weak March. In the month immediately after the Gulf war, the official government figures showed non-food retail volume jumping 7 per cent. Two months later it was back below where it started. While it is hard to believe that will happen this time, the nagging thought remains that the first normal month showing the underlying trend will be May. The official May retail sales figure will not be out until early July. For a market hanging on the consumer's whim, that is a long time to whistle in the dark.</p>

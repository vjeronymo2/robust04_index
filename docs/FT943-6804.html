			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: GE Capital plans to buy Japanese credit business GE Capital, the finance arm of the US electronics group, is planning a move into the Japanese consumer finance market through the purchase of a consumer credit business from Minebea, the ball bearings company burdened by over-expansion during the late 1980s. Mr Taketo Yamakawa, managing director of GE Capital's Japanese affiliate, said the company had been studying ways to enter the Japanese market for more than a year. Last May, it had started talks with Minebea, which had been looking for buyers for Minebea Credit, its consumer credit subsidiary with outstanding loans of Y180bn (Dollars 1.8bn). GE Capital will buy Minebea Credit's consumer loan credits of Y120bn, while the credit company will retain its Y60bn mortgage finance business. GE plans to build its Japanese operations around the consumer credit business, which is growing sharply due to the need for cash among consumers because of the prolonged recession and falling earnings. Earlier this year, Ford, the US carmaker, became the first foreign company to set up a consumer credit business in Japan. While the purchasing price for the consumer credit business has not been disclosed, the agreement has come as a relief for Minebea. The company was forced to post a special loss of Y18bn last March due to the equity infusion to the consumer credit affiliate. The parent company also provided loan guarantees to maintain the affiliate's cash flow squeezed by the sharp fall in the land collateral value backing its property-linked loans. Minebea still owns around 70 companies, which it acquired or set up during the 1980s. However, the aggressive diversification has become an increasing burden, and last year, the ball bearings company was forced to sell NMB Semiconductor, its lossmaking semiconductor affiliate to Nippon Steel, the leading steel manufacturer.</p>

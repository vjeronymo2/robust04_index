			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR CAKE IS IN THE MAIL;  </P> <P> DO-IT-YOURSELF CATALOGUE FOOD  </P> <P> Desserts in holiday gift catalogues always look tempting. But their prices can  be hard to swallow. The solution? Make the desserts at home.  </P> <P> What follows are recipes for some of the desserts available in this year's crop  of mail-order gift catalogues. Some are recipes directly from mail-order  companies, one comes from a local restaurant, and the rest are facsimiles of  catalogue desserts developed in The Los Angeles Times Test Kitchen. All make  delicious gifts.  </P> <P> Be sure to prepare the more perishable desserts at the last minute. The Gift  Catalogue Strudel made with apples and ricotta cheese should be made no sooner  than one day before giving. The Lemon Cake, Gift Carrot Cake, Chocolate Fudge  Cake and Macadamia Nut Bread all store well in the refrigerator for about a  week.  </P> <P> There are a few things to remember if you're mailing the desserts. The obvious:  Be sure to allow plenty of time for mailing cakes cross-country -- especially  during the holidays. The post office has delivery schedules you can check to  calculate how many days your package will spend in transit. Using the proper  mailing container is essential for on-time delivery. Tins are best for cookies.  Heavy boxes will probably do fine for firm cakes. Perishable desserts such as  strudel should be packed apropriately with dry ice and sent through a next-day  delivery service. If in doubt about the proper packing equipment, leave the  packing to a professional.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LEMON GLAZE CAKE (Facsimile)  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound, 2.25-ounce) package yellow cake mix  </P> <P> 1 (3 1/2-ounce) package instant lemon pudding mix  </P> <P> 4 eggs  </P> <P> 3/4 cup oil  </P> <P> 3/4 cup water  </P> <P> Lemon Icing  </P> <P> Combine yellow cake and lemon pudding mixes with eggs, oil and water.

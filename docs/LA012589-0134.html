			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BERGEN BRUNSWIG TO CLOSE 2 WAREHOUSES IN COUNTY, TRANSFER WORKERS TO CORONA  </P> <P> Bergen Brunswig Corp., a pharmaceutical distribution company based in Orange,  said Tuesday that it will close its two warehouses in Anaheim and Buena Park  next year and transfer up to 125 local workers to a new facility in Corona in  Riverside County.  </P> <P> A third distribution center in San Bernardino will also be closed as part of a  plan to consolidate and modernize operations in Orange, Riverside and San  Bernardino counties.  </P> <P> Urs Aeberli, who will be manager of the Corona warehouse, said population  growth in the region has generated a demand for pharmaceutical supplies that is  straining Bergen Brunswig's facilities.  </P> <P> The Corona warehouse, expected to be completed in April, 1990, will be the  largest of Bergen Brunswig's 37 distribution centers nationwide at 231,000  square feet.  </P> <P> Corona was selected as the site for the new facility because it is centrally  located to serve the three-county region, Aeberli said.  </P> <P> Company spokesman John T. Fay Jr., said the company's strategy is "to increase  efficiency by having much larger and more automated facilities." He said the  company's long-term goal is to cut the number of distribution centers to 20 by  building one or two large, automated centers every year and closing old ones.  </P> <P> The new warehouse will be 20 miles from the existing warehouse in Anaheim and  25 miles from the one in Buena Park.  </P> <P> Aeberli, who lives in Riverside, said most of the company's Orange County  warehouse workers do not consider their future transfer to Corona a hardship.  He noted that many of the people who work at the Orange County facilities  already live in Riverside County.  </P> <P> Bob Besst, an inventory coordinator in Bergen Brunswig's Buena Park warehouse,  lives in Stanton, only 5 miles from work. He said he and some co-workers are  considering moving closer to Corona to take advantage of lower real estate  prices outside Orange County.  </P> <P> "I have a 30-year-old house now, and for the same price I can get a larger  house in the Riverside/Corona area that is brand new," he said.  </P></p>

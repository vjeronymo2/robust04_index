			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- President Carlos Menem yesterday [12  April] rejected the possibility of an agreement between the  Justicialist Party and the Frente Grande [Grand Front, FG] on  constitutional reform at the Constituent Assembly and also  judged unlikely an alliance between the Radicals and the  opposition front.    Provisional Senate head Eduardo Menem pledged that the  government will respect the Olivos Pact on reform signed by  President Menem and Radical Party Chairman Raul Alfonsin after  FG head Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez suggested that the  agreement should be set aside. Democratic Progressive Party  Deputy Alberto Natale also urged the Radicals to "open up the  Olivos Pact package."    Alfonsin warned that a campaign to "distort" the contents of  constitutional reform had been launched and said that it would  be "disappointing if Alvarez joins in."    Alfonsin described Alvarez' call on the Radicals to abandon  the points agreed on by the Olivos Pact "absurd."    Menem, who denied cabinet changes, told a local radio  station  that the government was "on the alert" for a possible alliance  between the FG and the Radicals and accused Deputy Jesus  Rodriguez -- who is promoting the idea within Alfonsin's party  -- of having an "ancestral hatred for Peronism."    But Menem defended Alfonsin, who has come under fire from  anti- reform sector's within his party. "Alfonsin stood up in  what is a difficult moment for Radicalism," Menem said.    The head of state said that the Justicialist Party will  stick  to the Olivos Pact and that it would only seek agreements with  the pro-reform provincial parties and not with the centre-left  Frente Grande.    On the same day the President denied that the Peronist  defeat  at the hands of the FG in the Federal Capital could trigger a  Cabinet reshuffle, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo told a local  radio station that Sunday's election result should be seen as a  triumph for the government.

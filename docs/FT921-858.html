			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Poll casts doubt on Cresson's future: The possible 'fall guy' in France's imminent government reshuffle SPECULATION on an imminent change of government in France, already acute after the humiliating defeat of the ruling Socialist Party in last Sunday's regional elections, has assumed extra intensity after tantalising hints dropped on Wednesday evening by Prime Minister Edith Cresson. In an impromptu exchange with TV reporters, Mrs Cresson asserted that there would be a government reshuffle, though she was unable to say how far it would go or when it would take place. Asked about her own future, Mrs Cresson gave an even more Delphic reply. 'There will be,' she said, 'some day, a change of prime minister. What day? I cannot tell you that either.' The plausible inference is that there is likely to be a government reshuffle quite soon, probably next week after the second round of the cantonal elections on Sunday. But Mrs Cresson's profession of ignorance as to the details may have been quite genuine. Ever since last Sunday's electoral disaster, President Mitterrand has been engaged in intense consultations to assess the full significance of the vote. It is clear that he will respond in some way to the massive vote of no confidence. But he may not yet have decided whether he can make do with a limited government reshuffle, to include some of the ecologists whose break-through was a notable feature of the protest vote in Sunday's elections; or whether he needs a full-scale change of government, starting with a new prime minister. Four names are widely canvassed to replace Mrs Cresson, whose record-breaking unpopularity must bear some of the blame for the scale of last Sunday's defeat. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is credited in the opinion polls as the strongest potential socialist candidate in a future presidential election. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, can claim the credit for France's successful anti-inflation policy - though some may blame him for the rise in unemployment. The considerable popularity of Mr Jack Lang, the minister of culture, appears unaffected by the discredit of his prime minister and his party. And the unusually seraphic smile with which, on Wednesday evening, he denied all knowledge of a change of government, has only intensified speculation that he might be Mrs Cresson's successor. Finally, there is Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, the non-party social affairs minister. In nine years as secretary-general to the presidency, he proved his impressive administrative abilities; in the regional elections he out-performed most of the card-carrying Socialists; and the unquestioned credibility of his concern for grass-roots social issues must be an asset in a new-look government. Before making up his mind, President Mitterrand will wait to see what happens in today's inaugural sessions of the 22 newly elected regional councils when they elect the council presidents (equivalent to regional chief executives). The conservative opposition parties used to control 19 of the 22 regions, and they did better than any other single party on Sunday. But their share of the vote was eroded by the surge by minority parties, and they will only be able to retain control through coalitions. A key test of Sunday's vote, therefore, will be whether they succumb to the temptation to form alliances with the extreme right-wing National Front, despite solemn undertakings not to do so. This dilemma may put considerable strain on the alliance between the two component parties in the conservative Union pour la France (UPF), the centre-right UDF umbrella grouping led by former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and the RPR Gaullist party led by Mr Jacques Chirac. President Mitterrand will want to refine his judgment of the regional elections still further by waiting for the second round of voting on Sunday in the cantonal elections. Here the Socialists are likely to do less badly than in the regional elections, because the majority voting system favours larger parties.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Observer: Rolling along Successional goings-on at Dresdner Bank have been more than unusually delphic this time round; the next chief executive has been named only days after insurance giant Allianz's complicated shareholding links with Germany's second bank finally provoked the cartel authorities to order a cut in its stake. The choice of 56-year-old Jurgen Sarrazin - who takes up the reins after the 1993 agm - has surprised many. At Dresdner since 1960, and now responsible for international commercial banking, Sarrazin shares with his predecessor, Wolfgang Roller, origins in the eastern state of Saxony - although the tall polished banker displays less of the legendary Saxon striving ambition than the physically less imposing Roller. He has been labelled a compromise candidate, whose main offering seems to be continuity. Younger and fresher alternatives might have been finance director Bernd Voss, 52, or Bernhard Walter, 50, who has masterminded the successful push into the east. However much Dresdner protests that Allianz's shareholding confers on the bank more, rather than less, independence, it seems it may have been rushed into the question of succession by other events. The departure upstairs of Roller, 62, to head the Dresdner supervisory board from May 1993 may not be unconnected with the arrival this year of the steely Wolfgang Schieren - Allianz supervisory board chief  - as a candidate for Dresdner's supervisory board. Letting the matter ride might have helped Schieren inhabit the position that is now securely Roller's. The Dresdner/Allianz relationship was always drawn along by competition with the numero uno of German banking, Deutsche. Being number two certainly has its complications.</p>

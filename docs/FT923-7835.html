			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Prices fall sharply in Germany A STEEP drop in German wholesale and producer prices in July will take some of the sting out of west Germany's troublesome inflation rate and reduce the chance of higher interest rates, private economists said yesterday, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. They were commenting on Federal Statistics Office data which showed that wholesale prices plunged 1.3 per cent in July from June and were down 0.9 per cent from a year earlier - the first year-on-year decline in two years. The result was well below independent forecasts of a monthly rise of 0.6 per cent and marked a sharp swing from June's year-on-year increase of 1.2 per cent. July producer prices fell 0.1 per cent from June and were up 1.1 per cent year on year. That was down from a 2 per cent year-on-year rise in June and a third of last July's 3.3 per cent rise. Mr Ulrich Beckmann, economist at Deutsche Bank, said: 'The stronger mark and lower import prices are the key reasons for the drop.' Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank deputy president, said on German television yesterday that the slowing in inflationary pressures reflected in the two indicators was 'pleasing' but warned it was due in part to import prices weakened by the strong D-Mark. 'That is not a stability generated by domestic factors,' he said. 'It is partly the result of import prices and exchange rates.' Western Germany's annual inflation rate dropped to 3.3 per cent in July from 4.3 per cent in June, the lowest since May 1991. The steep decline was caused by petrol taxes - which rose sharply last July - dropping out of the yearly comparison. Mr Tietmeyer said the Bundesbank would review German interest rate levels in a few months.</p>

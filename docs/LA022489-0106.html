			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALIAN GUILTY IN VIET BOAT CASE, TO GET REPRIMAND  </P> <P> Capt. Alexander G. Balian, former skipper of the U.S. warship Dubuque, was  convicted today of dereliction of duty for failing to give adequate aid to a  boatload of Vietnamese refugees adrift in the South China Sea last June 9.  </P> <P> The six Navy captains who heard the case ordered that Balian be issued a letter  of reprimand for his handling of the refugee incident. The panel could have  sentenced the 26-year Navy veteran to up to three months confinement, fined him  as much as $8,994, the equivalent of two months' pay, and dismissed him from  the Navy.  </P> <P> In a bitter, half-hour speech to reporters this morning after the sentencing,  Balian said he had made a "scapegoat" by top Navy officials in Washington and  complained about "really dirty" behind-the-scenes maneuvering in the Navy legal  system. He called himself a "hero," who "was hung out to dry" and said he will  appeal the conviction through Navy legal channels.  </P> <P> Balian also urged Navy legal officials to take action against four crew members  of the Dubuque for mistakes he believe they made on the ship during the refugee  incident and for lying on the witness at his court-martial here. He would not  name the four, however.  </P> <P> Further, he urged that Phung Quang Minh, the refugee who took control of the  foundering junk, be brought to justice. "I don't feel that enough emphasis was  placed on the conduct of the tyrant on that boat," he said.  </P> <P> The captains deliberated for nearly six hours Thursday and today before  announcing their finding this morning. They acquitted Balian of the more  serious charge of disobeying orders stemming from an incident during the  encounter with the junk in which Dubuque crew members allegedly shook a rope  hanging from their ship, causing a refugee to fall into the ocean.  </P> <P> Balian, 48, a highly decorated veteran of the Vietnam War, was expressionless  as he stood, wearing his dress whites, and faced the panel of captains.  </P> <P> The court-martial, rare for an officer of Balian's rank, focused on the  long-held Navy doctrine that a commanding officer is responsible for the  actions of his crew as well as his own decisions.  </P> <P> Balian was the commanding officer of the Dubuque, an amphibious transport ship,  when it encountered the foundering junk in the South China Sea. He gave the  refugees food, water and directions to the nearest land but decided not to take  them aboard. The refugees drifted for 19 days after the Dubuque passed them by  and said they resorted to cannibalism to keep alive.  </P> <P> The prosecutor, Lt. Cmdr. Raymond H. Carlson, said in his closing argument  Thursday that Balian's action was "inexcusable." He said Balian was so  concerned with hurrying to an assignment in the Persian Gulf that he decided  against picking up the refugees before he assessed their condition and the  seaworthiness of their vessel.  </P> <P> "Only a fool could think that this vessel could effectively sail anywhere,"  Carlson said. "Capt. Balian is no fool."  </P> <P> Carlson said Balian's assignment in the Persian Gulf was not so pressing that  he could not have taken the refugees aboard the Dubuque.  </P> <P> "Providing humanitarian assistance is a mission of the Navy, clearly and  unequivocally," Carlson said. "On the 9th of June he was not concerned, as he  should have been, with the humanitarian assistance mission of the United States  Navy."  </P> <P> Balian's lawyer, Dan Donato of San Diego, argued that Balian, a native of Los  Angeles, had made a reasonable decision based on information reported to him by  his executive officer and members of his crew.  </P> <P> He said they assessed the situation from a launch in which they approached the  refugees and told him that the refugees' vessel was seaworthy and that they  needed no medical attention. Balian ordered that the refugees be given food,  water and directions to the nearest land.  </P> <P> Approximately 110 refugees boarded the vessel at Ben Tre in southern Vietnam  last May 22 for what they believed would be a four- or five-day voyage to  Malaysia. But the craft's engine failed on the third day out. Only 52 survived.  </P> <P> By the time the Dubuque encountered the refugees, about 20 of them had died of  dehydration and starvation, or had drowned while attempting to swim to passing  ships. After the Dubuque steamed away, some of the refugees killed two of their  companions for food, according to survivor accounts. The bodies of three others  who died were also consumed, a survivor said.  </P> <P> Balian said that at the time of the encounter he believed the refugee craft to  be seaworthy, and that the supplies he provided would sustain the refugees for  the seven days it would take them to reach land.  </P> <P> Balian said he realizes that he should have taken the refugees on board his  ship. He blamed his crew for giving him erroneous and incomplete information.  </P> <P> Donato argued Thursday that it was "not unreasonable to assume that if you give  them food and water, you've restored them to the vitality they need to  continue."  </P> <P> "Capt. Balian as commanding officer could reasonably expect to be assisted by  the members of his crew," his lawyer went on. "He could not possibly do it all  himself. I think he had a right to depend on them and rely on them."  </P> <P> Navy officials have said there are no plans to press charges against any other  members of the Dubuque's crew.  </P></p>

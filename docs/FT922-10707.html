			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Arts: The audience bites back - Television Serving regularly as the guest on Pete Murray's phone-in programme on London's LBC Talkback Radio to discuss the week's television is both an informative and sobering experience. As the voices of the public come and go in your headphones you realise what an extraordinary role television plays as companion and comforter in the lives of so many people today, and how strongly attached people become to their favourite programmes, especially soap operas such as Coronation Street and Neighbours. The fabled types who really believe in the characters, to the extent of sending flowers for fictional weddings, never seem to phone, yet passions are certainly aroused. Last week a whole succession of callers protested bitterly about a scene in EastEnders where a character made sandwiches for Passover out of white sliced bread, butter and cold lamb. Clearly the anger was caused not by damage to the credibility of the character, but by what was seen as the ignorance of the producers. For a professional critic perhaps the most interesting revelation is the way in which so many viewers seem to combine a dedication to the programmes with a deep contempt for the programme makers. This applies not only to soap operas or game shows, but all the way up and down the scale of subject matter and seriousness. So called 'ordinary members of the public' are willing  - indeed keen  - to be far more scathing than any paid critic would normally expect to be. Last week I expressed reservations about three new programmes, all from the BBC as it happens, all involving mystery or detection: Resnick, Thacker and Mr Wakefield's Crusade. Among the words I used were 'mannered' and 'contrived'. The next caller was almost speechless with scorn. 'Mannered?' he screeched, 'Contrived? All those programmes were absolute crap]' On such occasions the professional critic may find himself defending that which he previously attacked. Were there no saving graces? In Resnick, leaving aside script and acting for a moment, didn't the perpetual rain, the brownish light, and the deliberately odd camera angles at least add up to a recognisably different visual style? And at a time when the sheer quantity of television was making it difficult for any individual programme to remain memorable, wasn't that an achievement of sorts? No. It was all pretentious claptrap. What was more the caller was fed to the back teeth with dramas in which key passages of dialogue were rendered inaudible by other noises. On this point we all (Pete Murray, guest, and caller) agreed: none of us was hard of hearing, yet all spent our time in front of the set these days asking companions 'What did he say?' and getting the response 'Don't know. Couldn't hear'. The culprits are directors and producers who, knowing the script by heart, allow actors to mumble and, during the dubbing of sound effects and music, don't even notice that the crunching gravel or the quivering violins are obliterating the line which was meant to reveal the identity of the murderer or the motive. But absolute crap? Certainly the incidence of studied idiosyncracy in television mysteries has become tiresome. In Thacker everyone in sight was slightly barmy, from Graham Crowden's character who collected giant insects, to the yokels who were hunting for an ancient afterbirth. (Incidentally the theme of rustic malevolence and the intruding stranger has frequently been done better, most memorably in John Bowen's 1970 BBC drama Robin Redbreast). If possible Mr Wakefield's Crusade seems even more determinedly dotty. Here we have a millionaire whose only pastime is buying stamps at the Post Office, where a fellow customer dies at his feet. Wakefield steals a letter from the corpse and begins a murder hunt . . . maybe. Certainly there is much in these productions to irritate. Yet it is surely a little ungrateful to condemn everything which happens to be somewhat out of the ordinary. In Thacker, which looked like a pilot for a series, it was good to find Leslie Phillips continuing his late career break, away from silly-ass clubmen and satisfying, too, to find that his character  - the Humber driving ex-colonial  - was, unpredictably, the one dishing out the violence when necessary. In my book Mr Wakefield's Crusade wins points for the presence of Richard Griffiths as an interfering porter in a block of mansion flats, for the absence of steam trains and Fair Isle pullovers, and for the BBC's usual high production values. Television viewing would surely be far worse if, as the expansion of the medium continued, the programme makers simply produced more and more of the same tried and tested stuff  - and we would have far more reason to complain. That said, it is worth pondering why there seems to be more experimentation, and consequently more contempt from the phone-in callers, in drama than elsewhere. Newish ideas are sometimes tried in comedy: in the last few years there has been a trend towards simple studio shows which need neither costumes nor sets, series such as Whose Line Is It Anyway? and Have I Got News For You. These appear to be the equivalent, for the younger generation, of the series previously done by stand-up comedians. Yet the old conventions carry on: Harry Enfield's Television Programme is similar to the shows once done by Harry Worth and Dick Emery, though Enfield may yet prove superior to both. And of course the half hour sitcom, God save the mark, continues to come at us. BBC1's Don't Tell Father which started on Sunday evening is another series about snobbery and English class consciousness which could have been made any year since about 1962. Or 1862. Side By Side which began on BBC1 on Monday is yet another. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the essential difference is between fiction and non-fiction, and that there is much less need felt among programme makers to strain for novelty in current affairs or documentary programmes than in drama or comedy. Even here, of course, fashion does play a part and sometimes a powerful and annoying one. For instance the trend is once again swinging in favour of 'verite' documentaries. Producers seem to think that in abandoning reporter, voice-over, graphics and so on they are being non-manipulative, but viewers tend to feel that they have been left in the dark to work things out for themselves. Last week's True Stories on Channel 4 about a small psychiatric hospital called The Cassel, though good in some ways, occasionally left you wondering whether the person speaking was a doctor, a nurse or a patient. However, with most factual programmes the producers know that if the story they have to tell is powerful enough, few of us will even notice the style being used. Jonathan Lewis's Assignment about the atrocities committed by the Japanese during the Second World War, for example, was stylistically unremarkable but quite impossible to forget. What it comes down to in the end is the difference between a piece of work which is entirely the invention of the programme makers and one which is not. Judging from the people who phone Pete Murray's show, most viewers are keenly aware of this difference, sub-consciously at least, which is presumably why they are so ready to dismiss television drama but rarely television journalism as absolute crap.</p>

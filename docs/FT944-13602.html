			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Asia-Pacific zone confidence Senator Bob McMullan, Australia's trade minister, yesterday brushed aside reports that China had rejected the idea of setting a binding timetable under which the Asia-Pacific region would move towards 'free trade', saying he was 'moderately optimistic' a deal could still be achieved. The proposal will be discussed at next month's summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum leaders in Jakarta. Mr McMullan believed there was a 'reasonable prospect' China would back the proposal, after discussions between the leaders themselves in Indonesia. The proposal, as currently mooted would require developed Apec countries, such as the US or Australia, to remove trade barriers more quickly than less developed ones, but would see all barriers across the 18-nation grouping eliminated by the year 2020.

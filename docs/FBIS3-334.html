			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mombasa District Kenya African National Union  chairman Shariff Nassir today accused the British Government of  assisting youths of the unregistered Islamic Party of Kenya  [IPK] to flee to Britain, where they declare themselves as  refugees. Nassir claimed that two-thirds of the IPK youth had  left the country for Britain as self-made refugees.    Addressing a news conference in Mombasa today, Nassir, an  assistant minister for information and broadcasting, noted that  yesterday's stone-throwing incident in Mombasa was the work of  remnants of IPK youth who wanted to create a crisis, which they  would use as an excuse to flee the country. Nassir asked the  government to investigate cases in which businessmen in the old  town of Mombasa were assisting Muslim youths to flee to Britain.    When contacted, the British High Commission declined to  comment.</p>

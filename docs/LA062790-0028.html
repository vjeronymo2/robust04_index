			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PORTER RANCH FOES PLAN LAST-DITCH FIGHT;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE OPPONENTS CONCEDE THAT IT'S PROBABLY TOO LATE TO PERSUADE THE  CITY COUNCIL TO REJECT THE $2-BILLION PROJECT.  </P> <P> Neighborhood opponents of the massive Porter Ranch development in Chatsworth  gathered Tuesday evening to organize a last-ditch campaign to lobby Los Angeles  City Council members to reject the project next week, but conceded that it will  probably be in vain.  </P> <P> If a down-to-the-wire campaign of post cards and phone calls cannot defeat the  proposal, they will continue the fight in court, leaders of the group said.  </P> <P> About 75 residents -- some holding babies in 90-degree temperatures at  non-air-conditioned Castlebay Lane Elementary School -- agreed that it is  probably too late to influence the City Council before its vote Tuesday on  Porter Ranch.  </P> <P> Councilman Hal Bernson wields "Napoleonic" control over the council on the  Porter Ranch issue, said Don Worsham, a member of PRIDE, a homeowners group  opposed to Porter Ranch. Any substantive change would have to come through  Bernson, the proposal's chief political supporter, Worsham said.  </P> <P> Land set aside for school use is likely to be the only aspect of the plan  Bernson will agree to change, Worsham said, and "that issue is being used to  divert attention from other important issues like air quality, water and  traffic."  </P> <P> Porter Ranch, if approved, would be a $2-billion project to be built over 20  years in the hills of Chatsworth north of the Simi Valley Freeway.  </P> <P> The development would include 3,395 residences and six million square feet of  commercial and retail space.  </P> <P> Shapell Industries, headed by Beverly Hills builder Nathan Shapell, and Liberty  Buildings Inc. are equal partners in the Porter Ranch Development Co., the  project's primary developer.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District strongly objected initially to  the 1,300-acre development on the grounds that by creating an estimated 21,000  jobs, it would contribute to poor air quality and possibly exacerbate traffic  congestion in the area.  </P> <P> The AQMD relented after the development company trimmed the project, which  initially called for 7.7 million square feet of commercial space, and added  more condominiums and apartment buildings to better balance the new jobs and  housing.  </P> <P> Bernson, whose district encompasses Porter Ranch, has supported the revised  plan, increasing the likelihood of its passage by the full council Tuesday.  Council members have rarely interfered in land-use issues in other members'  districts.  </P> <P> Julie Korenstein, a West Valley school board member, has repeatedly clashed  with Bernson over the school issue, demanding that the developer set aside a  seven-acre site for an elementary school and a 15-acre plot for a junior high  school. The current plan says the developer needs to save the elementary school  site for only 10 years, and could reserve a site for a future junior high  school.  </P></p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Exclusion of Russia from Nato would be gross provocation Sir, Boris Fyodorov deserves support for his rebuttal (Letters, September 20) of German defence minister Volker Ruhe's indefensible views on Nato membership. An extension of Nato up to, but not beyond, the borders of Russia would be a gross provocation to Russia and inimical to European security. It is true that, at an earlier stage, European security survived an analogous provocation in the shape of West Germany's rearmament and entry into Nato's military structure. But that change did not involve a shift of Nato's eastern frontier. The logic of Ruhe's position is that the collapse of communism and the dismantling of the Warsaw Pact is a pure external retreat by Russia, with no concomitant internal transformation of its values and ambitions. Some of us, to the contrary, are impressed by signs of fundamental change in Russia's political priorities. In particular, the country has shown itself able to accomplish a significant degree of transition from authoritarianism to democracy by its own internal volition. That is more than can be said for Germany, at least in this century. Peter Oppenheimer, Christ Church, Oxford OX1 1DP</p>

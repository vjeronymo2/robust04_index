			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 10 KYODO -- Cambodian Government  forces were able to seize the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin  in late March because of an arms supply by North Korea, the  SANKEI SHIMBUN said Sunday [10 April].    Pyongyang provided Cambodian Government forces with six  armored personnel carriers and tons of weapons, including shells  for howitzers, ammunition, mortars and small weapons as a grant.  The vehicles and weaponry were flown to Cambodia from  mid-February, the daily said, quoting a military source close to  the forces.    With North Korea's military assistance, the government  forces  started in mid-March to intensify attacks on the guerrilla  group's biggest stronghold in western Cambodia near the Thai  border and brought it under their control on March 21, the  SANKEI said.    Pyongyang also pledged to offer additional tons of  ammunition  by early April, it said.    The source was quoted as saying that the government forces  could not have subdued Pailin without the supply of ammunition  and the forces will not be able to maintain their control  without additional military help.    Cambodia maintains friendly relations with North Korea,  largely owing to North Korean leader Kim Il-song's long-standing  support for King Norodom Sihanouk.</p>

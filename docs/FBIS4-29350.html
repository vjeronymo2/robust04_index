			<p>BFN     [Text] Dhaka, June 15 KYODO -- Japan will provide 22.97  billion yen to Bangladesh under two loan agreements signed here  Tuesday [14 June] between the two countries, the government said.    The main loan of 21.56 billion yen is for the construction  of  the Jamuna multipurpose bridge project, the Bangladesh  Government said in a press release. The remaining 1.41 million  yen loan is for financing a separate development project.    The bridge is being cofinanced by the World Bank and the  Asian Development Bank, which are giving 200 million dollars  each, the government said.    With the loan agreements signed Tuesday, the total amount of  assistance to Bangladesh from Japan's Overseas Economic  Cooperation Fund (OECF) comes to 481.59 billion yen, the OECF  local office said in a press release.

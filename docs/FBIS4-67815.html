			<p>Neutron   Bomb Using `Red Mercury'  <H4>  Defense Ministry Denies Report </H4>  <F P=102> 94WP0083A Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 15 Apr 94 p 3 </F> <F P=103> 94WP0083A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow IZVESTIYA </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA correspondent Aleksandr Krivopalov, </F> London: ``All of England Is Talking About `Red Mercury' and a  New Russian Weapon'']    [Text] People in London are discussing a documentary  film that was shown on Channel 4 of British television,  concerning a new and very secret mass-destruction weapon that  has allegedly been created in Russia.    The portable bomb approximately the size of a cup of tea or  a  small ball is presumably capable of destroying every living  thing in the radius of a large modern city or rayon.    Britons engaged in collecting material concerning this for  18  whole months, trying to find the confirmation of rumors that  have been disturbing the Western press for a long time -- rumors  to the effect that secret smuggling channels are being used to  ship out of Russia ``red mercury,'' the very existence of which  is denied by scientific-technical experts.    No, asserts G. Roberts, who leads the narration in the  sensational British television research. This substance is not a  myth: it is, in fact, a major component in a ``clean''  thermonuclear bomb that has presumably been made in Russia and  nowhere else in the world. True, his conversational partners on  the topic of ``red mercury'' remain, as a rule, anonymous, and  their testimony sounds, one has to admit, not too convincing.    The attempt to get hold of responsible and knowledgeable  commentators finally led the film makers to Yekaterinburg, where  they photographed scenes that greatly resemble old James Bond  hits: secret meetings at twilight with certain unknown  individuals who first promised to provide the needed  information, but at the last moment disappeared, frightened by  the consequences.    Nevertheless the group from England would appear to have  succeeded in learning the secrets about the weapon that can  become a new and even more frightening threat for all of  mankind. They met with a Russian scientist who personally, over  a five-year period, allegedly participated in work on this  project. In any case the film's consultants were convinced that  that testimony is substantiated.    Another eminent expert in the field of nuclear physics,  American Professor Cohen, has stated firmly that American  scientists, so far as one can judge from the materials that were  collected by the British television group, are lagging seriously  behind their Russian colleagues in this area. In Cohen's  opinion, now it will be impossible to stop the proliferation of  nuclear weapons in the world.    At the end of the film there is an interview with the head  of  a major German company. That entrepreneur states that he knows  personally about proposals concerning such major sales of ``red  mercury'' from Russia, and that he was simply terrified.    [Editor's note] A representative of RF Ministry of Defense  has rejected the hypotheses concerning the existence both of  ``red mercury'' and the ``ninibomb'' that was created on its  basis (see IZVESTIYA, No. 70).</p>

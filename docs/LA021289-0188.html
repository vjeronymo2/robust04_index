			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REVAMPED LINEUP BREATHES NEW LIFE INTO NORTHRIDGE'S OFFENSE IN WIN  </P> <P> Having sputtered in several important games recently, Cal State Northridge  injected an untested but obviously high-octane mixture into its starting lineup  Saturday against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> The new face belonged to Sandy Brown. After The 6-5 forward helped Northridge  get off to a fast start, the Matadors had far too much horsepower for the  Mustangs in a 90-61 victory in in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game  at CSUN.  </P> <P> Brown, a freshman from Manual Arts High, scored 12 points in his first college  start and helped limit Coby Naess, San Luis Obispo's top scorer, to four points  -- 14 under his season average.  </P> <P> Brown helped put CSUN on the right track early. After seven minutes, he had  outscored the Mustangs by himself, 8-7.  </P> <P> "The last couple of games we got off flat," Brown said. "After I made the first  one on an offensive rebound I felt I could help keep us running."  </P> <P> The addition of Brown, who had been CSUN's second or third man off the bench,  represented half of a major change in the Matadors' starting lineup. Karl  Becker, a part-time starter this season, also joined the opening lineup.  </P> <P> On the bench at the start were Derrick Gathers and Darren Matsubara,  Northridge's top scorers in CCAA games.  </P> <P> Gathers was being disciplined for his failure to notify Coach Pete Cassidy that  he would be late for practice on Friday.  </P> <P> And Matsubara?  </P> <P> "It was a coach's decision," Matsubara said. "Maybe we should do it all the  time. It worked well tonight."  </P> <P> Matsubara led Northridge with 17 points in 23 minutes. But there were plenty of  standouts for CSUN. Alan Fraser, Kris Brodowski and Kendell McDaniels dominated  play inside the key.  </P> <P> "Alan Fraser is the most underrated player in the conference in my opinion,"  Cassidy said of the 6-6 senior who scored 15 points and grabbed eight rebounds.  </P> <P> Brodowski and McDaniels turned in equally strong blue-collar efforts. Brodowski  scored only six points, but added nine rebounds and five assists. McDaniels had  eight points and four rebounds in only 13 minutes.  </P> <P> Northridge (14-9) shot 49% and never relented on defense, forcing 17 turnovers.  San Luis Obispo (13-9), one of the conference's better shooting teams, made 21  of 68 (30.9%) of its field-goal attempts.  </P> <P> "This is the second or third time this year we've played in coach's system --  really stayed in it the whole way," Matsubara said. "He set down the guidelines  and we stuck with them. It's a lot easier when everyone is doing the same  thing."  </P> <P> Said Cassidy: "I didn't say anything to them that I haven't been saying all  year long . . . but tonight it clicked. It's pretty basketball when you play  that way."  </P> <P> But it helped turn the CCAA standings into one ugly mess.  </P> <P> Northridge, 5-5 in conference play, moved into a tie for fourth with San Luis  Obispo and Chapman. Four teams make the conference's postseason tournament.  </P> <P> The Matadors play at Chapman on Thursday.  </P> <P> CSUN led at the half, 42-29, and only a three-point shooting exhibition by  James Gama kept the Mustangs temporarily within distance in the second half.  </P> <P> Gama, a former Santa Clara standout who finished with 20 points, scored nine of  San Luis Obispo's first 10 points in the half on three long-range shots. They  were the only field goals made by the Mustangs until Errol Talley scored on a  layup with 11:21 left.  </P></p>

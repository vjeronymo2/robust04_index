Apart from the popular opposition to the agreement inside  the  occupied territories, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that there  is opposition within the Palestinian leadership in Tunis, as  'Arafat's attempt to convene a meeting of the PLO Executive  Committee to brief it and seek its approval of the agreement has  failed. [passage omitted]    Palestinian sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that three  Executive Committee members -- namely, Sulayman al-Najjab  (representative of the Palestinian People's Party), Yasir 'Amr  (independent), and Samir Ghawshah (representative of the  Palestinian Popular Struggle Front) -- refused to accept the  invitation sent to them by 'Arafat to attend the committee's  meeting to ratify the agreement -- which means there is no  longer a sufficient quorum to endorse any decision in the  highest executive authority inside the PLO. [passage omitted]    The refusal of al-Najjab, 'Amr, and Ghawshah to agree on the  security arrangements means that 'Arafat will not be able to  pass the agreement constitutionally at the Palestinian level, as  the number of those who approve of it will not reach 12, the  number required to complete the quorum.

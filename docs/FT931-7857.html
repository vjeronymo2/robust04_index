			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (22): Automating the hassle - Databases IN A company where cars are a mere perk, the time and energy spent on them is hidden in overheads. But when the number of cars rises to 150 or so, managing a fleet becomes a full-time job for somebody. This rule of thumb comes from an administration manager who currently runs 73 cars, among a staff of 120 or so. His main problem is to have enough detailed information not only to keep track of maintenance, but to avoid ruffling feathers in the dovecot when new cars are assigned out of pecking order. A database of some sort should be the ideal answer, but it is hardly worth it for what is, at present, only part of his job. The 150 mark may also be the one at which a company considers 'outsourcing' the job and giving it to experts whose accumulated wisdom might prove more cost-effective in the long run. There comes a point where a computerised system is worthwhile, through a contractor, in-house, or even using a combination of both. Unfortunately, fleet management suffers from the same conundrum as any other application of information technology. One can know what is needed only when a system is installed, up and running. By then, it is often too late to change it or add in the extra 'if only' dimension that would make all the difference. Learning how to use the system, and having reliable support for it, are themselves hidden overheads. The purchase of any solution is an investment, the beginning of a long-term relationship, so the financial security of the supplier is as important as the functions of the system itself. Of an estimated 250 different packages on the market, none does exactly the same job. The starting point has to be an analysis of who needs what information. 'Need' is not the same as 'want', but it is often the extras that prove valuable, so flexibility is important. Make a system too complex, and no-one will ever want to use it. Hide nuggets of valuable information in a two-inch thick report, and they will go into the bin with the dross. In-house promotion of the system - simply telling people what information is, or might be, available is a must. The database is a good starting point. General-purpose databases such as Informix, Oracle and Ingres have spawned specialist packages through value-added resellers, such as Oracle's Ocella. Generally, because of the database foundation, such packages are easily tailored and customised. So-called 'fourth generation languages', 4GLs, take a similar approach, and products using these software tools should be more tolerant of individual users' quirks. The Progress language, for example, has been used to create NCR's Profleet, developed by Kalamazoo, and Towquest Pro-Lease. According to Mr Dinos Theophanus, a management consultant specialising in transportation at CMG, the very words 'fleet management' are open to misuse. 'Of the 250 or so packages, few have more than 10 installations.' Even fewer manage the full range of functions. This makes it difficult for people trying to choose a solution, especially as changing financial circumstances might put different requirements to the fore. 'The recession has done two things. Companies have less to invest so they are hiring rather than buying, and it has increased competition, which has resulted in the cost of services coming down. It's a buyer's market, and people are looking for better choice, fancier facilities and value for money.' Often, those who contract out fleet management get IT services thrown in as part of the deal. 'When you outsource, you get rid of the hassle, and part of that is the IT. Also, with an outsourced service you can police and control the supplier. A transport manager must define the service and know the requirements: some things may be luxuries, others necessities, and the budget will go only so far,' he says. Mr Theophanus describes a 'pick and pay' approach to the levels of service available. Users can have monthly paper-based reports, or linked terminals at the user-company, a regular download of database information, or even EDI  -electronic data interchange. There can be economies of scale. But while a company such as BRS can provide a cradle-to-grave service in terms of repairing a car and keeping it on the road, there are certain sorts of information a contract supplier cannot provide. Most packages deal with processes relating to a particular vehicle: few, if any, keep track of individual users of the car. But in-house systems might also need to link with personnel, accounting and insurance applications. The way round this is an in-house 'extra', either a database or a bought-in package, of which only a limited number of modules are actually used. Mr Theophanus says the market for large-scale packages is shrinking, becoming limited to the lease management companies as in-house managers turn to outsourcing. In-house, people are relying on do-it-yourself efforts to provide extra information, usually with a small general-purpose database or other software. One manager, for example, keeps track of fleet cars due for their MOTs with a screen he built within Lotus 1-2-3, a spreadsheet software tool he knows well. But, he admits, it's a clumsy solution of limited value and demands a lot of manual intervention. He also uses part of a cheap package, the Company Car Administration Kit from Emmerson Hill of Fareham which, at less than Pounds 50, provides form letters for maintenance management. A proper database would bring up an automatic warning, allowing him to keep track of individual car history. Explanations of how high mileage is incurred would be valuable for decisions on replacements and on resale values. Another manager's comment sums up why the flexibility of database software is essential. 'Once the information is there, you think of all sorts of other ways it might prove useful.'</p>

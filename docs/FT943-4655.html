			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Luxury carmakers fight tax Three leading European luxury carmakers - Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW - have joined forces to seek European Commission action against the Italian government to force changes in what they claim are discriminatory taxes on large cars in the Italian market. Mr Nicholas Scheele, Jaguar's chairman, is to meet Mrs Christiane Scrivener, commissioner for tax matters, in Brussels today to press the companies' complaints which have the backing of both UK and German governments. The carmakers claim five Italian taxes breach European law and have undermined their sales of large cars while favouring Italian manufacturers. The taxes introduced in 1992 and 1993 are based on engine size, cars with engine capacity above two litres being penalised particularly. All Jaguar cars have engines of more than two litres.</p>

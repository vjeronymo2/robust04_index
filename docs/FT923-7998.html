			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Mexicans fear pact depends on Bush's fortunes THE Mexican government, business and financial sectors reacted with relief that the free trade pact talks were over, but are evidently concerned the treaty is a hostage to President Bush's political fortunes. The Mexican stock market hardly moved on Wednesday, as investors spoke of the many obstacles before a treaty becomes law. Mr Manuel Robleda, Mexican stock exchange president, told the EL Economista newspaper: 'Now comes the most difficult step of realisation of the agreement. This will be reflected in the equity market and economy, mainly because statements in favour and against will provoke ups and downs and confusion amongst investors.' The Mexican government is ready to start lobbying hard in the US, but will be wary of becoming too involved in the its electoral process. It is likely to follow the same strategy as last year, when it successfully persuaded Hispanic groups, business leaders, and local newspapers to support renewal of 'fast-track' trade legislation, on which passage of Nafta then depended. At home, the Mexican government is on surer ground, with the private and official labour sector firmly backing the treaty. Mr Fidel Velazquez, the nonagenarian labour chief, told El Economista: 'The free trade pact will not resolve all problems of the workers, but constitutes a strategy to improve living standards, because undoubtedly, new businesses will be established.' Practically the only opposition comes from the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD), dissident unions, and various ecologists and academics. Mr Porfirio Munoz Ledo, former president of the ruling party and now a PRD leader, said: 'If we liken it to a Shakespearian tragedy, it is an agreement between three dying kings. In the Mexican case, the government is trying to project a positive image, offering the expectation of economic medals just as illusory as Olympic medals'. The support owes much to government control of much of Mexico's media, but could backfire if the treaty were rejected by the US Congress. Any ruling party candidate for the 1994 elections would have a tough job explaining why the government put Mexico through negotiating the treaty with nothing to show for it. Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's trade minister, said Mexico would not re-negotiate the treaty to suit another presidential candidate. While this may be bluff, Mexicans are unlikely to accept any substantial revisions to the treaty.</p>

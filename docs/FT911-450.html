			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Moreira gives stability pledge: Brazil's economy minister installed amid chaos MR Marcilio Marques Moreira, Brazil's new economy minister, took office yesterday promising stability, amid organisational chaos after the resignation of about 50 government officials. Those who quit included the entire directorate of the Central Bank and all those responsible for monetary policy, debt negotiations and the privatisation programme. Their departure followed that of Ms Zelia Cardoso de Mello, who had been criticised for her confrontational approach and accumulation of too much interventionist power in all aspects of the economy. The only person to remain of Ms Cardoso's original team is Mr Joao Santana, who yesterday became head of the powerful infrastructure ministry. President Fernando Collor de Mello was said to be surprised at the avalanche of resignations, losing Mr Ibrahim Eris, the central bank governor, Mr Antonio Kandir, chief economic policy maker, and Mr Eduardo Teixeira, the infrastructure minister, who had held the job only six weeks. Others included the head of the Bank of Brazil, the biggest state bank, and the president ion. The appointment of Mr Moreira, the sixth economy minister in as many years, indicates a shift to the right for the Collor government. The team Mr Moreira brings with him, such as Mr Francisco Gros, the new central bank governor, represents an older, more experienced generation than the youthful figures who surrounded Ms Cardoso. The 47-year-old Mr Gros previously held the post for 78 days between February and April 1987 during Brazil's debt moratorium. He is the eighth central bank chief in six years. In the handover ceremony Ms Cardoso launched a bitter attack on the country's elite. Her eyes fixed on politicians and businessmen at the ceremony, she said: 'I am worried by the incapacity of our elites to discuss objectively the country we want and need to construct, and who criticise without presenting alternatives.' The 37-year-old former minister spoke of 'violent attacks' on her personal life and concluded: 'In view of the growing controversies surrounding my actions and incompatibilities in the public domain I had no choice but to offer my resignation.' She was praised by an unusually emotional President Collor, who had earlier told politicians her removal represented 'a shifting of gear in the economy'. Mr Moreira for his part promised to continue the war against inflation but emphasised that intervention would be replaced by negotiation. In a television interview he said: 'My economic policy will stay as that determined by President Collor, but each minister has its own style.' He added that a policy of austerity need not prevent a return to economic growth. Mr Moreira said he intended to accelerate on three fronts: escaping from the current price freeze; reaching an agreement on Brazil's foreign debt by the end of this year and normalising relations with the international financial community; and negotiating with the Congress to push through economic reforms. He stressed a 'deepening of the liberalisation and modernisation process'.</p>

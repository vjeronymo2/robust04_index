			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Venezuelans warned of economic controls The Venezuelan government is close to adopting 'harsher measures' to deal with critical economic, financial and monetary problems, Mr Julio Sosa, minister of finance, told congressmen, writes Mr Sosa, the leading economic policymaker in the administration of President Rafael Caldera, did not specify what these measures would be but he indicated the administration could declare a 'state of economic emergency'. This would give the executive branch the power to dictate extraordinary economic and financial measures to confront an economic crisis. Many Venezuelans, alarmed by a deteriorating economy, expect the government to take steps soon to impose price controls on basic consumer goods.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Good housing starts help to boost Dow Wall Street ENCOURAGING signs of economic recovery and lower US bond yields helped equities move higher yesterday, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19.68 higher at 3,256.04 after moderate New York SE volume of 189m shares. Advancing stocks led those declining by 1,057 to 651. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 3.19 at 409.58, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks climbed 5.33 to 623.27. The stock market took strength from more encouraging news about the US economy, with February housing starts up 9.5 per cent after a 5.5 per cent increase in January. Many players had expected static housing starts this time. In addition, the slim recovery in Tokyo after Monday's stock market plunge gave some support to US stocks. Lower bond yields also helped. In late trading, the treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was  21/32 higher at 99 13/16 , yielding 8.01 per cent. Yields had initially risen as the bond market reacted to the February housing starts, but prices then turned higher on weaker than expected February industrial production figures. The equity market was further encouraged by the slight 0.3 per cent increase in February's consumer price index, which indicated that economic recovery might not be accompanied by inflation. Singer, the sewing machine manufacturer, was one of the most active big board issues of the day, rising Dollars 2 to Dollars 23 7/8 after the company sold 7m shares at Dollars 21.875 each in an offering priced late on Monday. Unisys was actively traded for a second day in the wake of bullish first-quarter forecasts by company executives, who said that the computer company would post a profit for the first quarter, usually its weakest period. The shares closed Dollars  1/8 firmer at Dollars 10 1/8 . Auto issues were busy for the second day running, Chrysler rising Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 18, a 52-week high, Ford Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 and General Motors Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 . Federal Express improved Dollars 2 to Dollars 55 1/4 after the air freight group said late on Monday that it had cut back its operations in Europe. The company also turned in a third-quarter loss after a restructuring charge of Dollars 254m. US Shoe climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 16 7/8 on the back of fourth-quarter profits of 28 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 1.24 a year earlier. An analyst at Kemper Securities yesterday initiated coverage of the stock with a 'strong buy' rating. Eastman Kodak dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 40 1/8 in heavy trading. An analyst at Salomon Brothers downgraded the stock's rating yesterday and cut its 1992 earnings estimate to Dollars 3.50 a share from Dollars 3.90. Technology issues dominated Nasdaq trading, with Microsoft advancing Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 127 3/4 , Lotus Development losing Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 37 and Dell Computer adding Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 38 1/4 . Canada TORONTO was dragged slightly lower by another fall in the gold sector. The composite index ended 4.3 easier at 3,439.8 as declines outscored rises by 334 to 226. Volume amounted to 29.4m shares. A late rally in the Canadian dollar, which improved against the US unit to CDollars 1.1925 from Monday's close of CDollars 1.1980, and a sharp rebound in bonds failed to lift stocks. The gold sub-group index dropped 1.56 per cent as spot gold in New York lost USDollars 3.25 to USDollars 340.50 an ounce, after losing Dollars 3 on Monday.</p>

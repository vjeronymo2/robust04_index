			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 2 Mar (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH  describes the recent statement issued by the UN Special  Commission as a certificate of recognition in favor of Iraq and  a slap in the face of the enemies.    In an article published today noting the commission's  refutation, in a recent statement, of allegations regarding  Iraq's alleged use of chemical weapons in the marshlands, the  paper adds: The statement issued by the UN Special Commission  has shown the enormous misrepresentation of facts and malice  that characterizes Van der Stoehl's statements and reports,  which are full of falsehoods. This statement by the UN Special  Commission has also revealed Stoehl's unjustifiable zeal.    The paper underscores the soundness of the clear and frank  Iraqi position, which is designed to promote the welfare of the  Iraqi people, protect them, and boost their quest for  development, which is a fact acknowledged by friends and enemies  alike.    The paper notes the lies promoted by Tehran and other  covetous, hostile, and rancorous parties, which are unhappy with  the steadfastness of the Iraqi people, saying: This is not the  first lie, nor will it be the last. The UN Special Commission  must examine the flood of previous lies, the truth and  objectives of which have been exposed, and pronounce them as  lies too.    AL-THAWRAH says: The allegations and fabrications made from  time to time by some regional powers and some aggression states  is a big unresolved hurdle that has been instrumental in  preventing the UN Security Council from honoring its  commitments. Meanwhile, Iraq has underlined its commitment by  implementing UN Security Council Resolution 687.    The paper concludes by saying that to do Iraq justice, the  impartial statements made must be translated into positive acts  and deeds to remove the injustice and wrong done to it.</p>

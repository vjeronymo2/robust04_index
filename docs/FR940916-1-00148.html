This option is available only for conventional freight trains. Class 1 brake tests on all other types of trains shall be performed by fully qualified brake system inspectors who meet the qualification requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;232.207 and &sect;232.209, as applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Spot checks, meeting the frequency requirements of &sect;232.15(i), of the Class 1 test are not performed by qualified train brake system supervisor who meets the qualification requirements of &sect;232.205.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The railroad, system wide, has a quarterly power brake defect ratio, as defined in &sect;232.5, for the most recently completed calendar quarter, of greater than five percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The train picks up individual cars enroute or more than one block of previously tested cars is added to the train.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The train contains a block of cars whose previous Class 1 brake system test was performed by a qualified train crew member.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The railroad does not have a periodic freight brake and single car test program in place that meets all the requirements of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1,500-mile train movements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A train may be operated up to 1,500 miles from a point where it receives a Class 1 brake test if all of the following conditions are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Class 1 brake test on that train is performed by a qualified train brake system inspector who meets the requirements of &sect;232.207 (for mechanical inspectors) or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;232.209 (when an electronic inspector is required).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For freight trains only, a pre-departure freight car safety inspection is performed in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;215.13(b) of this chapter by an inspector meeting the qualifications of &sect;215.11 of this chapter. This inspection shall be performed on all cars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A record of all brake tests performed on the train is available to the train crew.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A Qualified Train Brake System Supervisor, meeting the qualification requirements of &sect;232.205, performs frequent spot checks of the Class 1 tests in accordance with &sect;232.15(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The railroad, system wide, has a quarterly power brake defect ratio, as defined in &sect;232.5, for the most recently completed calendar quarter of less than five percent on outbound trains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The train configuration remains unchanged for the entire trip except for:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) At most, the addition of a single block of previously tested cars (where the previous Class 1 test was performed by qualified brake system inspector) that has been disconnected from a charging device for less than four hours.

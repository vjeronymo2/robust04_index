			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Market debuts First-day dealings in two recent flotations saw both stocks race ahead to healthy premiums. Gear and pump manufacturer David Brown made an impressive debut as placed at 170p, the shares raced forward to 209p. Profit-taking late in the session saw the stock ease to close at 207p with a hefty 12m shares traded. Nursing homes group Westminster Health Care achieved a more modest premium, closing at 287p compared to the 260p issue price, which capitalised it at Pounds 132.6m. Westminster made 6.4m shares available to the public, and this offer was 4.8 times subscribed. Both issues were handled by BZW. Water and regional electricity (Recs) stocks continued to tumble as investors again shunned the sectors and dealers sought to find new levels for the shares. Sector specialists continued to point out that the stocks were suffering from a combination of high rating, a lack of news and the move from defensive to cyclical shares. Pointing out that turnover was mostly derisory, Ms Angela Whelan at BZW added: 'Water shares remain fundamentally good value. They probably have a little further to fall on current sentiment, but this should open up good buying opportunities ahead of the results season next month.' Among waters, North West dropped 15 to 502p, Southern 17 to 519p and South West 20 to 533p and Yorkshire 20 to 556p. In the Recs, Northern slumped 18 to 517 and South Wales 17 to 540p. The widely expected cut in Forte's dividend was not as deep as some in the market had predicted and that, with the enhanced scrip, left the market relieved. The shares gained 6 1/2 to 188 1/2 p on bulky turnover of 10m. However, many analysts remain pessimistic about the hotel market in general and Forte's strategy in particular. Mr Mark Finnie at NatWest Securities, one of the specialists who first forecast yesterday's dividend cut, said: 'It does not go far enough and barely gives Forte the flexibility for the rights issue which we believe it needs to recapitalise. The real issues have not been addressed.' There was tired takeover heard talk around Cadbury-Schweppes, up 5 at 485p, while another favourite candidate, United Biscuits, was spurred on by options activity and the shares advanced 7 to 384p. A broker's buy recommendation helped Hanson shares lift 3 to 232 1/2 p. Shaw &amp; Co advised clients that exposure to US recovery and recent falls in the share price made the stock attractive at 230p. Big overseas earner Reuters Holdings eased 14 to 1302p in reaction to a stronger pound and reports that Lehman Brothers had signed on to EBS, an Electronic Broking System that competes with Reuters Dealing 2000-2. An AGM statement from BP failed to ripple through to the market. In spite of a pointed comment by the chairman about the disparity between BP's rising share price and the pessimism of UK analysts, the stock was flat at 301p. BP has been well supported by the US although ADR traders in London said yesterday that enthusiasm was beginning to fade. News of an oil discovery prompted Cairn Energy to rise 4 to 50p. Results from cement manufacturer Blue Circle came in ahead of forecasts with overseas trading making up for poor domestic results. One leading securities house raised its 1993 profit forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 140m, pencilling in Pounds 175m and Pounds 205m for the following years. The shares put on 3 1/2 to 241p. RMC Group also beat most market forecasts, the shares leaping 21 to 629p. Yorkshire Television rose sharply on little volume as speculation returned that retailer WH Smith is poised to sell its 14 per cent stake in the group to Granada. Yorkshire shares gained 19 to 173p, Smith 5 to 414p, while Granada slipped a penny to 395p. News that AT&amp;T, the giant US telecoms group, was seeking to enter the UK telephony market predictably hurt BT, the shares dropping 6 to 420 1/2 p. Cable and Wireless, which owns Mercury, fell 8 to 742p. Automated Security Holdings advanced 3 to 165p after announcing sharply improved first quarter profits.</p>

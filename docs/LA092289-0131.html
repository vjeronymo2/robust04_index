			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CBS PRODUCER GETS USAIR STORY HARD WAY: HE IS CRASH SURVIVOR  </P> <P> While other news organizations were still scrambling to cover the crash of a  USAir jetliner that plunged into the bay near La Guardia Airport Wednesday  night, CBS was able to provide viewers with an eyewitness account from the  scene. One of its producers had been on the plane.  </P> <P> Producer David Hawthorne had been on his way to North Carolina to coordinate  coverage of Hurricane Hugo when the jetliner suddenly skidded in the rain and  plunged into the bay near La Guardia Airport at 11:27 p.m., EDT.  </P> <P> "We simply ran out of runway," Hawthorne, a 29-year-old producer for CBS  Newsnet, the network's service for sharing news footage with local affiliates,  recalled Thursday. "I didn't know that we had hit water until I climbed out  onto the wing. The plane had split into three pieces. When someone shone a  flashlight into the plane, I saw two people strapped into their seats, with  blood around them."  </P> <P> Two passengers were killed, and 51 of the other 61 people on board were injured  in the crash. Hawthorne was holding a passenger's baby when he realized that he  was over water. "I thought, 'Whoa, I can't swim well enough to carry a baby.' "  </P> <P> Thanks to high tech, what Hawthorne could do was report the story.  </P> <P> "Once everyone was safe, I thought, 'I've got to call CBS News.' " Hawthorne  returned to his mangled seat, retrieved the cellular phone he was carrying with  him on his assignment, and called in to the CBS News desk. The desk put him on  the air live on WCBS-TV in New York at 11:59 p.m. At 12:33 a.m. EDT, the  network broke into its entertainment programming and Hawthorne -- whose  previous report for WCBS had been his first on-air experience -- reported from  the scene, live on the phone to Dan Rather, who had come into the studio to  help with the live coverage.  </P> <P> "He had cool-headed intelligence, and it was hard to believe he'd never been on  the air before," Rather said Thursday. "I think he'll get the equivalent of a  battlefield promotion."  </P> <P> Rescued to the La Guardia runway on a raft along with other passengers,  Hawthorne continued to provide off-camera coverage for CBS News producers until  nearly 3 a.m. At 7:10 a.m., he was a guest on "CBS News This Morning."  </P> <P> On his way to the doctor Thursday afternoon to check out soreness and a slight  pain in his neck and shoulders, the producer said he had no thoughts of turning  his experience into an on-camera career.  </P> <P> "When I called in, I never expected to be on the air," he said. "I thought  they'd send out one of those guys who look good and can tell the story on the  air."  </P></p>

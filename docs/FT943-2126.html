			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Watchdog wants more disclosure on investments Detailed plans for giving customers more information about investment products such as unit trusts were set out yesterday in a paper published by the Personal Investment Authority. The watchdog for private investor protection is seeking comments by late next month on applying a new regime to provide investors with more information about certain investment products and about fees and charges. At present the PIA intends the new regime to be compulsory from the beginning of next year - the same starting date as the new disclosure regime which will apply to companies and individuals selling life insurance policies. Although some companies that sell both unit trusts and life insurance are keen to move to the new systems at the same time, others believe companies should have more time to adapt. The costs of producing the information in the form required are likely to run into millions of pounds in total, but two factors will help to keep the costs lower for life insurance disclosure. The first is that much of the information must be produced anyway - the change is primarily to the format. The second is that much of it can be produced on a standard or specimen basis and does not have to be client-specific. The regime is intended to apply not only to unit trusts but also to offshore collective investment schemes and certain personal equity plans. The PIA believes that the information should come in the form of a 'key features' document, as it will for the life insurance disclosure system. While companies will have some freedom to use their own format, the document must cover particular questions, for example how to follow the progress of investments, and the impact of charges. The aim of the new regime is to enable customers to make a fair comparison between the different types of financial products available. It should be simpler than the information that must be provided for selling long-term life and investment policies but will have to be adaptable for different ways of selling which are not allowed for life insurance - for example through customers deciding to buy solely on the basis of an advertisement in a newspaper or from direct mail.</p>

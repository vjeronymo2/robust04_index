			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHULA VISTA EARNS MIRA MESA'S RESPECT  </P> <P> They were undefeated but nobody told them they were a good football team.  </P> <P> So the players of No. 5 Chula Vista decided to do something about it. And they  did, clubbing host Mira Mesa, 14-0, Friday night to improve to 3-0.  </P> <P> Chula Vista quarterback Derek Chapman led the way, completing 13 of 15 passes  for 95 yards. His arm, and the slippery moves of running back Trenell Hicks (22  carries, 90 yards), who scored an insurance touchdown with 4 minutes, 45  seconds remaining in the third quarter, helped offset No. 6 Mira Mesa's size  advantage.  </P> <P> "We're always looking for respect," Chapman said. "Every week you've got to  earn respect."  </P> <P> Chula Vista Coach George Ohnesorgen said: "I'll tell you our kids were pumped.  Strongest doesn't always win."  </P> <P> But a shutout, coach?  </P> <P> "That just (shows) our kids' intensity."  </P> <P> There was a brief moment midway through the third quarter when Mira Mesa's  confidence swelled. Defensive back Steve Hamaguchi had just flattened Daniel  Johnson, Chula Vista's tight end. Johnson had caught an eight-yard pass from  Chapman. He fumbled. Mira Mesa (2-1) recovered and there were high-fives and a  lot of yelling.  </P> <P> One play later, Mira Mesa running back Wayne Pittman carried through the  middle, was hit and fumbled. Charles Barnes recovered for Chula Vista, and the  Spartans took control the rest of the way.  </P> <P> "Souldn't have happened," Mira Mesa Coach Brad Giffith said. "I don't think we  lost our confidence. Give the credit to Chula Vista."  </P> <P> Mira Mesa did manage to drive to Chula Vista's six-yard line early in the  fourth quarter, but a holding penalty ruined the drive, and subsequently  quarterback J.J. Rowlett (10 of 19, 143 yards) was sacked on fourth and eight  from the 15.  </P> <P> Chula Vista ran seven times in its nine-play, 55-yard scoring drive in the  first half. Of course, when the drive began to slow down, Chapman did his  thing, completing a 10-yard pass Brandon Gregg and a 12-yard pass to Neviette  Richardson. Two plays later, running back Steve Gomez, a transfer from Mar  Vista, scored from the three.  </P> <P> Mira Mesa chewed up its share of yards in the first half, but each time the  Marauders got within striking distance they were either stopped by an  aggressive Chula Vista defense or they stopped themselves.  </P> <P> For example, in the second quarter, Mira Mesa drove 87 yards in 10 plays on an  assortment of runs by Pittman, who runs over anybody in his way. He finished  with 80 yards in 18 carries. Griffith opted to use Don Elder on fourth and goal  from the three. He swept left for three two yards before running into a cluster  of defenders.  </P> <P> Mira Mesa appeared to be on its way to a touchdown in the first quarter, but  Chula Vista linebacker Garland Phillips retreated into the territory where  defensive backs are usually found and made a diving interception of Rowlett's  pass.  </P></p>

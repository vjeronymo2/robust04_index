			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Debt reduction helps lift net at France Telecom France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications operator, yesterday announced a sharp jump in net profits for last year, to FFr4.8bn (Dollars 888.8m) from FFr3.3bn in 1992. The increase was achieved on a slight rise in sales, from FFr122.6bn to FFr127bn, and reflected a fall in financial charges as the operator pursued a policy of debt-reduction. At the end of last year, group borrowings were down to FFr105.6bn, compared with FFr111.6bn at the same time in 1992. As a result, financial charges fell to 6.9 per cent of sales, against 8.4 per cent the previous year. There was a FFr15.2bn payment to the state, the same as in 1992. France Telecom said the rise in sales, which confirmed its position as the world's fourth-largest telecoms group after NTT of Japan, Deutsche Telekom and AT&amp;T of the US, was achieved against a background of depressed demand in France. Considering the difficult environment, it said the improved revenues reflected the impact of new products such as Itineris and Bi-Bop, its mobile telephone services. Itineris, which operates a mobile radio-telephone service, had 78,700 subscribers at the end of last year. Meanwhile, Bi-Bop, which requires the user to be near a base station, had 38,000 subscribers. Both services have seen strong growth. The group also saw continued growth in its Minitel teletext activities. Subscriptions rose to 6.5m from 6.3m, while the number of services available on Minitel rose to 23,000. France Telecom plans to pursue its strategy of reducing debt, while seeking partnerships in its core telecommunications activities, and in new areas such as multimedia. Last month, it announced the formation of a partnership with Deutsche Telekom and Sprint of the US to provide services to multinational clients. This represented an extension of the French operator's existing alliance with Deutsche Telekom, agreed in 1993. The alliances do not yet involve equity participations, partly because of France Telecom's public-sector status. Plans to reform this status, a necessary step before any eventual privatisation, have been delayed while the proposal is discussed with unions.</p>

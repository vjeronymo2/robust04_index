			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Japan's government acts to end doubts on banks' health JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance yesterday issued a detailed report on the financial performance of Japanese banks, in an attempt to quash doubts about the health of the country's banking system. The ministry released estimates of the banks' financial results for the year to the end of March, saying Japanese banks were 'very sound' and would have no difficulty coping with the fall in the Tokyo stock market or a sharp rise in bad loans. The ministry's action followed the sharp fall in bank share prices and reports of growing concern overseas about some Japanese financial institutions. The statement was issued after the stock market closed yesterday, but speculation about its contents helped the Nikkei average to rise 562.93 to 17,402.05. However, foreign bankers said any improvement in sentiment about Japanese banks could be short-lived because the figures in the ministry's statement were largely in line with expectations. They said the ministry had not allayed worries about further write-offs in 1992-93 which could be much larger. The finance ministry said operating profits for all 153 Japanese banks rose 26.8 per cent to Y3,659bn (Pounds 15.46bn), boosted by declining interest rates. Pre-tax profits fell 17 per cent to Y2,799bn, due to aggressive write-offs for loans and investment loans, including those related to the property market. Net after-tax profits fell 24 per cent to Y1,379bn. Banks' valuation losses on share portfolios surged 500 per cent to Y1,734bn and the write-off for bad loans rose to Y639.3bn. A senior ministry official said the large national banks - including 11 city (commercial) banks, three long-term credit banks and seven trust banks - had between Y7,000bn and Y8,000bn in bad loans at the end of the fiscal year. However, the ministry official said banks could easily cope with bad loans because they had unrealised portfolio gains of Y17,000bn. The figure for bad loans is lower than analysts' estimates of at least Y20,000bn. However, much depends on the way in which bad loans are calculated. The ministry said all but 'one or two' leading banks cleared the 8 per cent capital adequacy ratio set by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

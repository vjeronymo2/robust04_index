			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Members of the Group of  Seven (G-7) industrial nations will continue intervening in  foreign exchange markets to stem excessive fluctuations of  currency rates, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [10  May].    Fujii, speaking at a regular press conference after a  morning  cabinet meeting, declined as usual to comment on exchange rate  levels but said, "it has become a consensus among the (G-7)  nations that recent movements were led by speculation not  reflecting economic fundamentals."    G-7 financial authorities have intervened jointly in the  currency markets since finance ministers and central bankers  reaffirmed in late April in Washington that they would cooperate  to keep exchange rates stable and reflecting fundamentals.  Fujii said, "We are constantly keeping in close contact to take  appropriate, timely measures to cope with unstable movements."    Concerning Japan's current account surplus, Fujii said  steady  implementation of the February 15.25 trillion yen stimulus  package will boost domestic demand for a "meaningful" reduction.    The politically sensitive surplus topped 130 billion dollars  to hit a second consecutive record in the fiscal 1993 figures  released Monday. But Fujii stressed that exports declined and  imports expanded in volume terms, and yen-based figures pointed  to the first decline in three years.    While dismissing the need for any fresh fiscal actions,  Fujii  said he stressed at the cabinet meeting the importance of  drawing up a bill in June and having it enacted by the end of  the year for tax reform, including permanent tax cuts.    Japan promised in its March market-opening package to detail  the tax reform, especially to extend the 6 trillion yen tax cuts  implemented for the current fiscal year.    The minister rejected reports that the government's tax  commission is considering multiple consumption tax rates as one  of the options for its proposals to be issued in June. The  November report issued by the commission, an advisory panel to  the prime minister, indicated such multiple rates are  inappropriate, Fujii said.    The Finance Ministry is insisting a single consumption tax  rate, currently at 3 percent, and a uniform rate hike to offset  income tax cuts.    Referring to a monthly economic report issued by the  Economic  Planning Agency (EPA), Fujii said, "I don't consider it as  pessimistic." The report kept its assessment unchanged from the  previous month, saying the economy remains generally sluggish  although some bright signs are emerging.    Fujii said, "The economy is at a delicate stage...with even  experts mixed in their assessment" over recent statistics  showing both good and bad signs.</p>

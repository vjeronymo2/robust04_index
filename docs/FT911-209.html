			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Cash squeeze hits Polish aircraft plant A CASH squeeze at WSK Mielec, one of Poland's biggest aircraft factories, and one of 200 Polish plants dependent on sales to the Soviet Union, means 14,500 workers may not be paid their April wages due today, Christopher Bobinski reports from Warsaw. Polish officials were in Moscow yesterday for talks on finding ways of securing payments. Poland meanwhile is paying for its purchases of Soviet oil and gas. The factory has in effect ceased to pay for deliveries of components from domestic producers since Comecon countries switched to hard currency pricing on January 1. Management has said it will no longer take delivery of them. WSK Mielec makes AN 28 and AN 2 aircraft for the Soviet market. Last year, it laid off 4,800 workers.</p>

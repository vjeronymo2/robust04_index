			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Arts: 'Polska' strikes gold - Concert Radio 3's 'Polska' season, an intensive celebration of Polish music, continues apace, and on Wednesday it struck gold. In the BBC's Maida Vale studios Matthias Bamert conducted the BBC Symphony in Szymanowski, Lutoslawski and young Hanna Kulenty. Inevitably, Szymanowski's gorgeous First Violin Concerto made the deepest impression; but Bamert ensured that Kulenty's raw-but-shapely Trigon and Lutoslawski's Second Symphony  - middle-period, experimental, rather dependent upon effects that were novel in 1967 - left their own vivid stamps. Kulenty fixes a sharp division of labour in the small orchestra of her Trigon. While the strings groan up and down in perpetual glissandi, as in early Penderecki, machine-gun bursts of rapid, mechanical even-notes pass intermittently from brass to solo piano to percussion and back again. There is a sense of barely suppressed fury and frustration; and yet the tense silhouette of the piece is elegant and cogent, collecting its 13 minutes into a single clean blow. When Lutoslawski wrote his Second Symphony, he was sure that tonality was a dead letter. Though his latest works have made their own kind of peace with the tonal tradition (he is 80 now), that symphony represents his most defiant earlier distancing. Its two movements, respectively hesitant and direct, are almost entirely 'aleatoric'. The role of the conductor is just to signal the starts and finishes of successive sections, in which players execute their overlapping parts in their own uncoordinated time. Hesitant is a long string of pungent episodes, each for a handful of instruments, separated by abrupt pauses; in 'Direct' the orchestra pulls itself together, over a weird density of string-sound, to hammer out a distinctly baleful purpose. Back then, Lutoslawski was so intent upon keeping the 'symphonic tradition' at arm's-lengths that the music now seems riskily stretched for the time it takes, Yet the broad structure is tough enough to hold the ear. Szymanowski's first violin concerto, composed after he escaped Bolshevik internment during the first world war, is a kind of one-off miracle. Someone wrote about the young Szymanowski that he 'carries the death-dream of romanticism to the border of awakening'. Not a Pseuds' Corner quote, but dead right: the trappings of late, ultra-decadent romanticism are raised here to a level of crazy, intricate, nakedly rapturous fantasy, without ever tipping over into 'post-romantic' irony. Szymanowski's score is iridescently evocative and original, the solo role - most of it written for the top two-and-a-half inches of the E-string - searingly heartfelt. It is strange that this work is not yet part of every major violinist's kit. The drawbacks are that it needs a very good, very large orchestra and a lot of costly rehearsal time. Bamert and his admirable soloist Krzysztof Smietana must have enjoyed that bonus, since all the multiple facets of the soundscape were radiantly clear and balanced. Smietana played as if two-and-a-half inches of E-string were all he had ever wanted for full-blooded expression, beautifully secure. For hours after you hear this siren-music singing in your head; there is really nothing much like it.</p>

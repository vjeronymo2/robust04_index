			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ovens closure costs Inland Steel Dollars 20m INLAND Steel of the US is to take a pre-tax charge of about Dollars 20m in the fourth quarter due to the closure of four coking batteries at the No 2 Coke Plant at the Indiana Harbour Works, Reuter reports. The batteries' coke ovens, used to bake coal into fuel for ironmaking blast furnaces, will be shut in December. About 461 hourly workers and 38 salaried employees will lose their jobs, and the company said they would be eligible for support services, certain benefits and retirement options. The four batteries are Inland's only remaining coking facilities. All the coke battery shutdowns are due to the same combinations of circumstances, including the inability to meet existing and future environmental regulations and the decline of the oven performance. Phillips-Van Heusen, the US clothing and shoes group, will incur a one-time charge, net of tax, of Dollars 12.2m, or 45 cents per share, for its fourth quarter ending January 31, as part of its plan to redeem senior debt, Reuter reports. The group said it planned to issue Dollars 100m of debentures, due 2023, and use the proceeds to redeem the company's outstanding 11.2 per cent Senior Note, due 2002. The note was issued to the Prudential Insurance Company of America. With cash from working capital, the proceeds will also go towards redeeming outstanding 9.93 per cent Senior notes due 1997, issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, the company said. Goldman, Sachs and Company and BT Securities Corporation will be the underwriters.</p>

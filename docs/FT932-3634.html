			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / A social evil called tourism: Richard Tomkins questions the value to Britain of foreign visitors ASTRONOMICALLY speaking, summer does not arrive in the northern hemisphere until June 22. But in London, you can tell the season has started - less because the capital has briefly basked in sunshine this week than because it is bursting with the annual invasion of foreign tourists. Britain is the world's fifth most popular holiday destination, but while many of its citizens have the occasional grumble about this phenomenon, few question whether it is a good thing. Spending by overseas visitors brings in more than Pounds 7bn a year in foreign earnings, Britons are told. The tourist industry contributes more than Pounds 25bn a year to the economy and provides 1.8m jobs. Many of London's theatres, shops and restaurants might close if the tourists stayed away. Yet this is a bogus assessment, for it looks at only one side of the equation. A proper analysis would start with the fact that British holidaymakers going abroad spend Pounds 3bn a year more than foreign tourists bring in, so the net effect is negative. But even leaving this aside, there are other costs that ought to be shown on the balance sheet. One example is the cost of maintaining redundant emblems of the national heritage for tourists to gawp at, such as old buildings, oddly-attired soldiers and the royal family. Another is the cost to British taxpayers of providing foreigners with subsidised arts and entertainment, subsidised transport, and public services such as refuse collection and policing. And what figure shall we put on the costs of the traffic congestion caused by hundreds of tourist coaches grinding around the capital each day? The benefits of tourism, meanwhile, are not what they are cracked up to be. Take those 1.8m jobs. Pickpocketing, drug peddling and prostitution aside, most are not only degrading and servile, but extremely badly paid. Certainly in the capital, it is rare to find any cases where tourism provides jobs for the indigenous population. Britons would sooner beg on the streets than wash other people's dirty bed linen, grill their hamburgers or sweep up their litter. As for the theatres, shops and restaurants that would be imperilled if the tourists stayed away, still unexplained is the mystery of how they thrived for so long before the tourists arrived. For theatres, the most obvious effect of tourism has been to reduce diversity by encouraging the proliferation of mindless musicals that foreigners can tap their toes to without needing to understand the words. And what of the tourists themselves? Do they really derive any pleasure or benefit from watching the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace, being cheated by the street vendors that prey on them, or eating hamburgers in different branches of McDonald's? Not at all: they gain nothing in terms of enlarging their understanding of another culture. They are simply country-spotting, collecting passport stamps and snapshots with which to impress their neighbours once they are back home. In short, the time has come to recognise that if tourism confers any benefits at all, they are far outweighed by the disbenefits. Ideally, it should be abolished: but since freedom of movement is a human right, a more cautious approach will have to suffice. One possibility would be to start recognising tourism as a social evil, like smoking or drinking, and to forbid activities which promote it. As a first step, all tourist offices would be closed, and the vast sums used to finance them diverted to more productive ends. And as an interim measure towards the prohibition of tourism advertising, legislation would require all tourist advertisements to be accompanied by the warning: 'Tourism damages your country's health.' Planning policies would also change, so that any application that held the possibility of encouraging tourism would be refused. Heavy tourist taxes would be introduced, partly to discourage people from indulging in tourism in the first place and partly to ensure that those who persisted in travelling compensated society for the costs of their habit. The trouble is, all this could prove too controversial for Britain's beleaguered government. There is, however, an alternative. Last time Britain was faced with the threat of an invasion, during the second world war, its citizens stopped talking to strangers and turned all the signposts round so they pointed in the wrong direction. Desperate times call for desperate measures: it is time to resume hostilities.</p>

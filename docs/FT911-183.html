			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Deadline for Chelsea FC draws closer THE DEADLINE for Chelsea Football Club to decide whether to buy its Stamford Bridge ground or leave it came closer to definition yesterday with the appointment of an independent valuer. The 11.7-acre site in Fulham Road is owned by Cabra Estates, which has been in dispute with Chelsea's chairman Mr Ken Bates virtually since it acquired the ground from Marler Estates in April 1989. Mr William Wells, a partner in Chesterton, the London firm of surveyors, has the job of determining the value of the ground in August 1988, when Chelsea exercised an option giving it the right to buy at a price adjudicated by a surveyor. Mr Wells is expected to take four to six weeks to produce the valuation, which is supposed to be binding on both parties. In March 1988 Savills, another London firm, placed a figure of Pounds 40,000 on it, taking into account Chelsea's tenancy (which expired in August 1989) and planning consent for predominantly residential redevelopment. It has since been revalued at Pounds 30m. After Mr Wells has reached a decision, Chelsea will be given a reasonable period - which Cabra reckons to be three months - to come up with the money. This could, however, take the process into the next football season and Mr John Duggan, chairman of Cabra, has indicated that he probably would not evict the club in mid-season. He said yesterday that he hoped the valuation would 'quickly resolve the uncertainty that has hung over the site.' Mr Bates was unavailable for comment.</p>

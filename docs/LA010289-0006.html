			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPULATION, RENT  </P> <P> Andrea Rosenwein, in a Dec. 17 commentary ("L.A. Renters: Condemned to  Extinction?" Editorial Page), bemoaned circumstances that forced her to join  the "real word (of) exorbitant rents." However, this followed years of enjoying  artificially low housing costs. An acknowledgement that the law (rent control,  for example) can fix the price but not the cost of a commodity would have shown  more real world awareness.  </P> <P> Los Angeles is a mega-city beginning an explosive increase in population  density; spacious lodgings in a desirable neighborhood in such a city are not  easily had, particularly by those with low incomes. Most, like myself, wind up  east or south of her neck of the woods, in whatever midway between splendor and  squalor they can manage.  </P> <P> There are 5 billion people in the world. If Rosenwein stopped worrying  exclusively about developers and considered how many others would like to be  where she is, the cost of her desired life style would be more explicable.  </P> <P> LEE RANKIN PORTER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

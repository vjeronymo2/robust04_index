			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EDITOR AT CHANNEL 39 RESIGNS OVER NEWS-POLICY DIFFERENCES  </P> <P> In the latest in a long line of shake-ups at KNSD-TV (Channel 39), chief  assignment editor Eric Hulnick resigned Monday, blaming differences in news  philosophy with management at the NBC affiliate.  </P> <P> Sources at the station portrayed Hulnick, chief assignment editor for four  years, as a believer in "traditional" news who has been upset with the  station's news direction for several weeks. He reportedly objected to the  decisions not to actively cover certain stories, such as the David Lucas murder  trial.  </P> <P> The station was criticized last week for allowing reporter Paul Bloom to  arrange for the arrest of a parole violator he had contacted on the pretense of  conducting an interview.  </P> <P> Reached at home Monday night, Hulnick refused to comment on specifics of his  decision, as part of an agreement he made with the station.  </P> <P> "I just didn't agree with some of the things going on," he said.  </P> <P> According to one reporter at the station who asked not to be identified,  Hulnick "had a different view of what is news. He's a traditional kind of news  guy, and we're looking at a change of philosophy here."  </P> <P> The station has laid off several reporters in recent weeks. Within the last six  months, it has gone through a major identity change under new owner Gillett  Communications, including changing the station's call letters and starting a  variety of new programs.

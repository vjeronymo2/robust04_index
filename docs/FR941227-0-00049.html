			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final regulations retain the look-through rules. Access to information and records necessary to identify and value partnership section 1374 items is not dependent on whether the S corporation is a controlling partner. Moreover, section 1374 should generally apply to an S corporation's partnership section 1374 items even where a principal purpose for using the partnership was not to avoid the section 1374 tax.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations, however, modify the small interest exception to the look-through rules to accommodate the commentators' request for a rule requiring a valuation of the partnership interest only on the first day of the recognition period. Under the rule as modified, the small interest exception generally applies for a taxable year if the S corporation's interest in the partnership represents less than 10 percent of the partnership's profits and capital at all times during the taxable year and prior taxable years in the recognition period and has a value less than $100,000 as of the beginning of the recognition period. However, if the S corporation contributes an asset to the partnership in the recognition period and the S corporation held the asset as of the beginning of the recognition period, the fair market value of the S corporation's partnership interest as of the beginning of the recognition period is determined as if the asset was contributed to the partnership before the beginning of the recognition period (using the fair market value of the asset as of the beginning of the recognition period). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Valuing Inventory <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations provide that the value of an S corporation's inventory on the first day of the recognition period equals the amount that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the inventory in a purchase of all the S corporation's assets on that day. Commentators argue that the rules for valuing inventory in the proposed regulations are unclear and should be clarified to provide a non-liquidation, non-distress, bulk sale approach, which generally will result in a value for the inventory less than retail value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations provide that the value of an S corporation's inventory on the first day of the recognition period generally is determined by reference to a sale of the entire business of the S corporation to a buyer that expects to continue to operate that business. The buyer and seller are presumed not to be under any compulsion to buy or sell and to have reasonable knowledge of all relevant facts. Relevant facts include (1) the replacement cost of the inventory; (2) the expected retail selling price of the inventory; (3) the seller's incentive to demand a price for the inventory that would compensate for and provide a fair return for expenditures the seller incurred to obtain, prepare, carry, and dispose of the inventory before the sale of the business; and (4) the buyer's incentive to pay a price for the inventory that would compensate for and provide a fair return for similar expenditures the buyer expects to incur after the sale of the business. It is expected that the value of an S corporation's inventory as determined under the final regulations will generally be less than its anticipated retail price, but greater than its replacement cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preamble to the proposed regulations describes a safe harbor rule that was being considered for publication as a revenue procedure under which the value of inventory for purposes of section 1374 would be determined using a formula. One commentator endorsed the general idea of adopting a safe harbor rule, but objected to the rule described in the preamble and did not suggest an alternative rule. No commentators supported the rule described in the preamble of the proposed regulations or suggested an alternative rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The withdrawal would involve 3,972 acres of public land in the White Sides Area of the BLM's Caliente Resource Area, Lincoln County, Nevada. This amendment is proposed to be an environmental assessment (EA) level amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A 30 day scoping period is being conducted to give the public an opportunity to comment on this proposed amendment and the following tentative issues: (1) Oil and gas leasing; (2) Off-road vehicle use; (3) Locatable minerals; and (4) Access. In addition to the proposed withdrawal and the no action alternative, the public is also invited to suggest alternatives to be analyzed in this amendment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> A 30 day scoping period is scheduled from June 24, 1994, to July 25, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> All comments and concerns the public may have with this proposed amendment and EA must be mailed to: Bureau of Land Management, Attention: District Manager, P.O. Box 26569, Las Vegas, Nevada 89126, or delivered to the Las Vegas District Office, 4765 W. Vegas Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0065 forcenewline --> 0 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Gary Ryan, Acting District Manager, at the above address or telephone (702) 647&hyph;5000. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed withdrawal of the White Sides area, located adjacent to the Nellis Air Force Range, is to provide a security buffer to the Nellis Air Force Range. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The White Sides area is currently managed by the Caliente MFP. The adjacent Nellis Air Force Range is withdrawn for military purposes (see Public Laws 99&hyph;606 and 100&hyph;338) and its natural and cultural resources are managed by the BLM through the Nellis Air Force Range Resource Plan (RP). If this area is to be withdrawn, its management would be similar to that of this RP. Therefore, it is proposed that the Caliente MFP be amended to not include the management of the subject 3,972 acres and the Nellis Air Force Range RP be amended to include the management of the subject 3,972 acres.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management of resources that may be changed by this amendment include: (1) Oil and gas leasing; (2) Off-road vehicle use; (3) Locatable minerals; and (4) Access. Thus, they become tentative issues that will be addressed in one or more of the alternatives of the amendment. Issue 1. Oil and gas leasing: The area is currently open to leasing under the Caliente MFP Minerals decision 2.0. The proposed withdrawal could impact oil and gas exploration and development. Issue 2. Locatable minerals: The subject area is open to locatable mining under the Caliente Minerals decision 1.1. The proposed withdrawal would close the land under the mining laws. Issue 3. Recreation/Off-Road Vehicle Use: The subject area is currently open to sight-seeing, recreational, and off-road vehicle use under Caliente MFP Recreation Decision R&hyph;2. The proposed withdrawal would close the area to public access.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This amendment will analyze the impacts of several alternatives to the proposed withdrawal, including the no action alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal, state and local agencies, and other individuals or organizations who are interested in/or affected by aspects of the proposed amendment and environmental assessment, are invited to participate in this planning process. Comments and recommendations will be accepted only on those subjects being addressed by this amendment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ronald B.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tripoli, Al Maa [May] 8, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS  AGENCY--The emergency meeting of the general secretariat of the  International Islamic People's Command, held on 5-7th instant  under the banner "Enabling Muslims To Defend Their Holy Places",  concluded its proceedings last night in Tripoli.    The secretariat issued a communique at the end of the  meeting  asserting that the meeting was held at the darkest time in the  history of Muslims as crusader tyranny and encroachment affected  all affairs of Muslims.    The secretariat pointed out that this encroachment by  Western  crusaders on Muslims and their holy shrines went as far as  controlling their religious practice and tutelage over their  holy places like Mecca and Medina and setting conditions on  Muslims in the fulfilment of their religious obligations.    The secretariat cited in this respect the ban imposed on the  Libyan Arab pilgrims preventing them from travelling to the holy  places.    The secretariat urged all Muslims, as individuals, groups  and  governments, to shoulder their responsibility regarding this  encroachment and onslaught on Muslim holy shrines and  intervention in their worshipping matters.    The secretariat stressed the need for Muslims to stand  against the resolutions of the so called Security Council which  follows a double standard policy and directs one humiliation  after another against Muslims.    The communique called for issuing clearly the Islamic legal  view on the intervention of a non Muslim side in the Muslims'  religious affairs and embargo against them and to convey this  ruling to all non-governmental and official organisations and  institutions in the Muslim world, international organisations  and human rights institutions.</p>

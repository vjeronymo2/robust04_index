			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 'CYRANO' STAR TO GO TO MOSCOW  </P> <P> Gerard Depardieu, star of the European blockbuster film "Cyrano," will travel  to Moscow next month to promote the movie featuring what some critics say is  his best performance.  </P> <P> "Cyrano" is vying for the coveted Gold Palm award at this year's Cannes Film  Festival.  </P> <P> It stars Depardieu as the long-nosed dreamer who breathes his passion and  poetry into the empty head of a simple soldier to woo the beautiful Roxanne.  </P> <P> At a cost of about $19 million, "Cyrano" is France's most expensive cinema  production. It was Depardieu's 60th film role and has been called his strongest  work by many critics.  </P> <P> The film adapted from Edmond Rostand's theater classic was directed by  Jean-Paul Rappeneau.  </P> <P> Depardieu will be accompanied by Theirry de Beauce, secretary of state in the  Foreign Affairs Ministry, and will also travel to Czechoslovakia and Hungary,  where the movie was filmed.  </P></p>

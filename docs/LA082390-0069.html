			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VIEW FINDER: ODDS &amp; ENDS AROUND THE VALLEY  </P> <P> Going Up and Coming Down  </P> <P> Elevators are not ordinarily found in San Fernando Valley houses, so builder  Frank Thompson thought -- what with the soft real estate market and all -- that  putting them into eight of his new two-story Woodland Hills hillside houses  might be a great marketing tool.  </P> <P> "Frank figured elevators might appeal to an untapped group of buyers," said  Jeff Oblas of Fred Sands Realty who is in charge of selling the houses and lots  in the mini-development. "He thought that maybe disabled people might be  interested, or people with bad backs or gimpy knees."  </P> <P> It didn't work out that way at all.  </P> <P> According to Oblas, all five of the eight houses with lifts that have been sold  were bought in spite of them, rather than because of them. Oblas thinks that's  because people in the Valley are only used to thinking of elevators in  commercial buildings or apartment houses, where someone else is responsible for  their maintenance. "I think people were concerned about what would happen if  something went wrong. They probably worried that the kids might get stuck in  them or that they would break down," he said.  </P> <P> Oblas said that instead of stressing the elevators, maybe the sales promotions  for the development should have focused on the view the houses offered of the  surrounding hills and valleys, or maybe on the fact that the three houses that  are left have been reduced in price $150,000 or more, from around $750,000 to  between $575,000 and $600,000.  </P> <P> Oblas, on reflection, remembers one weekend when the place was swarming with  elevator aficionados, however.  </P> <P> "We tagged utility poles with little notices about a weekend open house in the  homes with elevators, and about 50 neighborhood kids dragged their parents over  to see them," Oblas said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wheeler Dealers in Training  </P> <P> Jack Ohringer, general manager of the newly redecorated Fashion Square in  Sherman Oaks, thought it would be capital to invite Monopoly addicts to play in  the fancy, newly decked out Center Court area of the mall.  </P> <P> It was a strange promotional idea for a mall manager since most of them would  rather have people spending money than watching other people playing with it.  </P> <P> But Ohringer said the promotion did what it was supposed to do: create interest  at the square.  </P> <P> About a dozen or so hard-core Monopoholics were expected to be interested or  confident enough to give up a weekend to play in front of back-to-school  shoppers.  </P> <P> What a shock to have more than 100 of the greedily acquisitive come to play,  Ohringer said, with about 80 signing up in advance and 20 more just showing up.  </P> <P> To anyone supposing money lust had become unfashionable -- what with the  rumored downfall of The Donald, or the downfall of professional greed heads  like Ivan Boesky and our own Valley boy Michael Milken -- a trip past the  hotel-building, opponent-bankrupting gamesters playing at the Sherman Oaks  Fashion Square would have meant being quickly disabused.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Russia in Reseda  </P> <P> Glasnost came at an opportune time for Soviet refugee Ark Kivman. When he  arrived in the United States from Odessa five years ago, and opened his Moscow  Nights restaurant on Sherman Way in Reseda, his patrons were mostly fellow  Soviets looking for good borscht.  </P> <P> All that changed with the "big thaw," according to restaurant manager Lisa  Lizshin, who says the place is filled with people toasting Gorby with one of  the restaurant's 80 brands of vodka. "The people started coming in because  Gorbachev is a big hero and Russian things are such a big trend. But I think  they keep coming back because they like the food and because we are a place for  a party," Lizshin said. "We have a lot of fun here."  </P> <P> The food runs to roast duckling stuffed with apples, prunes and oranges,  Cornish hen marinated in lemon, garlic and dill, and skewered, marinaded lamb,  pork and chicken, as well as beef stroganoff, cured fish, red caviar and  stuffed cabbage. Complete dinners, with salad, borscht, vegetables, rice or  potato, entree and dessert (like the walnut-filled Kiev cake), run between $15  and $18.  </P> <P> But Lizshin says the best fun is when people come with a party of four or more.  "For $27 a person on Friday, $35 a person on Saturday, or $25 a person on  Sunday you get a huge platter of 16 different Russian hors d'oeuvres, six  different main courses to choose from, a bottle of liquor, like vodka or  champagne, and any dessert you want."  </P> <P> The fun comes from the music, which includes a little show put on by the  six-piece band -- a sort of Gypsy-Russian-Yiddish extravaganza -- followed by  an evening filled with lively, danceable continental tunes. It is an eye-opener  to see the lambada done to a balalaika backbeat, Lizshin says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Women's Liberation? Yes and No  </P> <P> Twenty years ago, women coming into college were mostly concerned with whom  they were going to marry rather than what they were going to do.  </P> <P> Now, according to Jane Prather, who has a doctorate in sociology and teaches at  Cal State Northridge, it's just the reverse.  </P> <P> "I used to ask women in my classes where they thought they were going to be and  what they would be doing in 10 years, just to get them thinking about their own  careers and the future," she said. Even in the late '60s and early '70s, women  told her they didn't know, because they didn't know whom they would marry.  Everything hinged on that.  </P> <P> Now, Prather says, women are marrying later, if at all, and are vitally  interested in making correct career decisions. It's simply assumed that they  are headed for the career fast track, she says.  </P> <P> With a notable exception.  </P> <P> Some of the women students in her classes are first generation in this country,  with parents whose values are firmly rooted in the Middle, Near or Far East.  </P> <P> "These women are not quite so liberated," Prather said. "They are still  attending class under the old suppositions that they will go to school for a  little while, then become good wives and mothers. Getting educated, for them,  is something their parents allow as an indulgence," the sociologist said.  </P> <P> One of her brightest students wanted to go to San Diego to law school, but her  Armenian parents said they couldn't allow such a thing, the educator said.  </P> <P> The student told Prather that traditionally Armenian girls are expected to  marry when young, and are not allowed to leave their parents' home until they  become brides. Going away to school would not be allowed because the woman  would be unchaperoned.  </P> <P> Prather said teaching these cloistered young women has been a learning  experience for her, and adds a new element to her classes.  </P> <P> "At one end of the spectrum you have the liberated women and at the other end,  those who are completely sheltered."  </P> <P> The men in her class, she said, are right in the middle, not entirely  comfortable with either side.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overheard  </P> <P> "I think the reason they don't play water polo here is because two horses  drowned." -- A 6-year-old speculating to a chum at Northridge Park pool  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Mandela's Call To End Mass Action -- "Nelson Mandela  correctly anticipates difficulty in bringing home to his  supporters that the time for mass action is over," states the  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 27 April in a page-11  editorial. This is because workers throughout the country "have  become accustomed to walking out or downing tools when they  cannot get their own way. Having encouraged mass action as an  effective method of bringing pressure on the Government, the ANC  is not now going to switch it off too easily." "Perhaps" the  "most daunting" task for the future government is to convince  people to stop thinking in "terms of resistance" and start  thinking about "addressing problems."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Elections in KwaZulu-Natal -- "The eyes of South Africa and  perhaps the world are likely to be on the KwaZulu-Natal region  after the elections," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English  on 27 April in a page-6 editorial. The violence in this area of  the country is "obviously a symptom of socio-economic  problems...and is not about to stop after the elections."  Kenyan mediator Washington Okumu, who played a role in  encouraging Buthelezi to join the elections, warned that "there  is a tendency among victorious political groups in Africa to  wipe out the losers. But we believe the elections could also  serve to end the deep enmity between the ANC and the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] with King Goodwill Zwelithini playing a  vital role. Our wish is that there should be a balance in the  distribution of power which will give the king the chance to  play a unique role in the history of South Africa." In  conclusion the SOWETAN states that "Natal is a vital region and  if things go wrong there, they are likely to take similarly  unfortunate routes in the rest of the country."</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Volvo welcomes revised deal - Divorce sends European automotive groups along divergent routes Volvo, the Swedish motor manufacturer, said yesterday it had won a much better divorce deal from Renault than it initially negotiated. The terms contained in the French government's plan for the partial privatisation of Renault announced on Tuesday put a higher price on Volvo's 20 per cent holding in Renault than previously agreed. They also give Volvo greater freedom over when it sells out. 'This is a good deal for Volvo,' the company said. The deal provides for the unwinding of almost all the cross-shareholdings left over following the collapse last December of the two groups' plans to merge. In particular, it allows for Volvo to take back full control of its highly-profitable truck division. In February, Volvo agreed to swap a 12 per cent stake in the Renault parent for the 45 per cent share in Volvo trucks held by Renault, if the French company was privatised by December. The deal was worth FFr4.5bn (Dollars 849m), implying a total valuation of Renault of FFr37.5bn. This week, the terms were changed to allow Volvo to buy back the Renault share of its truck division for 5 per cent of Renault - valued at FFr2.12bn  -plus FFr2.38bn in cash. This implies a total valuation of Renault of FFr42.5bn. Volvo, which wants eventually to sell out its full 20 per cent holding, is also obliged to sell a further 3 per cent stake in Renault at whatever privatisation price is offered to institutional investors. However, for the remaining 12 per cent it has considerable freedom to pick its time and price. It has the option to sell up to a further 4 per cent at the institutional offer price at the time of privatisation. It has undertaken to retain its residual 8 per cent for a period yet to be stipulated, but which will not be longer than six months after privatisation. Within that period, however, it will be free to sell when it feels the price is right. 'It provides us with the opportunity to benefit from a possible value increase in Renault,' said Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive. Under the original divorce terms, Volvo has been able to treat the truck division as wholly owned, so benefiting from resurgent profits now accruing in both the truck and car divisions. However, it was anxious to regain full control as part of its new strategy, adopted after the merger collapse, to concentrate on core car and truck operations. It has meanwhile begun a programme to sell SKr40bn of non-core assets.</p>

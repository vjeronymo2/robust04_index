			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Is Brest Oblast the `Cradle' of </F> Statehood?"]    [Text] At some enterprises in the city of Kobryn, the  collection of signatures in support of the main contender for  the presidential chair, Vyacheslaw Kebich, is being conducted by  management itself. Appropriate directives have been given to  heads of workshops and foremen. Workers have been given a  choice: Either to put their signatures supporting the  "formidable" candidate or to face difficulties promised by  managers. Under conditions of general job reductions, many  prefer to avoid problems.    Thus, the Brest Oblast may successfully continue its "good"  traditions and become once again the "cradle" of a new head of  state, as it was with Slyunkow [secretary of the Communist Party  of Soviet Belarus] and Dzemyantsey [former Supreme Soviet  speaker].</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: ABB investment fund link-up ASEA BROWN Boveri, the European manufacturer of power plant and industrial systems, is setting up a fund with six US investment institutions to provide equity and subordinated debt to help finance industrial and power projects in the US, writes Martin Dickson in New York. GE Capital, the financial services arm of power equipment manufacturer General Electric, already provides equity capital for power projects. ABB believes, however, its move will give it a lead in other industrial areas served by the company, such as petrochemicals and paper and pulp.</p>

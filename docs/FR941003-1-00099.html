			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) For large-scale projects, particularly those covering a very large area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or numerous alternative locations for the undertaking, the purpose of initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification efforts is to collect and review existing information and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records in order to consider the likelihood that historic properties will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely affected in choosing a preferred alternative for the undertaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Draft EAs, DEISs and other environmental and planning documents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should, at a minimum, reflect this level of information. A less intensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation (which may include development and testing of a ``predictive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model'' to indicate where historic properties exist or are likely to exist) will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be sufficient until one or more principal or preferred alternatives is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) For small-scale projects, and for the principal or preferred alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of large-scale projects, the agency should determine the extent to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available information provides a reliable basis for decisionmaking, and then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consult with the SHPO and others to consider the need for more detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and site-specific identification, including intensive field survey(s). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency should follow up by completing identification and ``gather sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to evaluate the eligibility of [identified] properties for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Register'' (&sect;800.8(b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coordinate identification with NEPA and other land and resource management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The magnitude of effects, both detrimental and beneficial,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on historic properties and historic and cultural values should be projected and analyzed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in adequate detail so they can be compared to other environmental, economic, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical analyses and projections for various project alternatives. The projected number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and character of historic properties and the likely effects of each alternative on buildings,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighborhoods, land use, socioeconomics, cultural values, and other relevant natural and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cultural characteristics of the environment should be taken into account. Historic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preservation documents and appropriate analyses, at least of a preliminary nature, should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be circulated and reviewed at the same time as other planning documents, such as Eas and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DEISs, land management plans, engineering general design memoranda, and transportation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(f) analyses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action for any undertaking which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involves alternatives that may adversely affect historic properties should be studied,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed, and described.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Situations where actions are planned by private applicants or other non-Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities before Federal involvement should be adequately provided for, so that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Policies are established and staff designated to advise potential applicants of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies or other information foreseeably required for later Federal action and Section 106  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance, consistent with Section 110(k);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The Federal Agency consults with appropriate State and local agencies, Indian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and with interested private persons and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations to ensure that the concerns of other parties can be addressed before any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> irretrievable or irreversible commitment to the project is made; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The Federal Agency commences the Section 106 process at the earliest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible time so that by the time an EA, Finding of No Significant Impact, or Final EIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Record of Decision under NEPA is issued, historic properties have been identified,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects determined, and this information is incorporated with the consideration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives for any necessary resolution through negotiation with other parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24357 Filed 9&hyph;30&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;10&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

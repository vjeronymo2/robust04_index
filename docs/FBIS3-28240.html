			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The head of the government's  Tax Commission said Friday [4 February] a planned income tax cut  should be scrapped if it is uncoupled from its companion  "welfare tax."    Told of reports that the tax plan decided early Thursday was  being sent back to the drawing board because of political  opposition, Kan Kato, head of the advisory panel to the prime  minister, told reporters the plan's 6 trillion yen in income and  resident's tax cuts must remain linked to the welfare tax.    At a regular press conference, Kato praised Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's decision to adopt the plan, which links the  tax cuts, retroactive to January 1, with changing the 3 percent  consumption tax to a 7 percent welfare tax in 1997.    He said he and others on the panel thought that "political  collateral" -- promises that the tax cuts would be paid for  later -- was not enough and that the funding must be made clear  along with the tax cut. The tax cuts require "panel  collateral," he said.    Hosokawa has vowed in the past to respect recommendations of  the Tax Commission.</p>

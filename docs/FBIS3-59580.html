John Abernathey invited us to a photo opportunity. The  "Quarter-Micron" project leaders from the participating Siemens,  IBM, and Toshiba enterprises are in a good mood. They have  accomplished a lot indeed in this one year since the contract  had been signed. "We are entirely on schedule" says Hans  Schuster-Woldan of Siemens. Since January he is heading one of  the most diverse teams of workers from all three firms in East  Fishkill, about 100 km north of New York. "The first  experimental chips produced by the quarter-micron technology are  already available" he announces proudly.    In order to prevent further runaway of costs for development  of ever more finely structured chips, these three large DRAM  producers from the competing camps of Europe, U.S.A., and Japan  decided last year to such an unprecedented alliance. They are  sponsors of the joint project designed to develop a technology  of producing fine chip structures. The is to develop processes  which will yield 0.25 &mgr;m wide structures. As the first  product  they want to come out, by the middle nineties, with a 256 Mbit  DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory): a semiconductor memory with  optional access to all 256 million memory cells.    If this project succeeds, it will be owing to Siemens alone  that Europe has regained ground in microelectronics. This is by  far the only enterprise which devises such clever strategies.  All other microelectronic firms still just swim behind the  technological leader.    Instead of all joining forces, each enterprise in Germany --  industry and institutes alike -- tries to keep its head above  water with with its individual solution.    What looked so promising in 1990, when the fathers of the  JESSI EUREKA program found a new home and new task for the  Fraunhofer Institute of Silicon Technology (ISiT) in Itzehoe,  has in the meantime turned into dust. The Institute was supposed  to explore new processes for structurization of microchips by  x-ray lithography. Soon, however, did the Research Minister cut  off the funds for this because the "large industry has abandoned  x-ray lithography." The ISiT chief Prof. Dr. Anton Heuberger  notes today: "Since the European firms had largely stopped  manufacturing memory chips, there was no prime user of this  technology to be found in Europe. We therefore had discontinue  our efforts."    This assessment is, of course,not quite correct in view of  the activities at Siemens. Rather, photolithography was also  applicable to much smaller structures than had been assumed at  that time. The Japanese tried it already then on KrF excimer  lasers. And for this reason, evidently, the large industry let  x-ray lithography go.    A new concept made it nevertheless possible to begin  construction of the ISiT in Itzehoe, after both Federal and  State governments released the funds. Meanwhile very large-scale  integration was been abandoned and somewhat smaller integration  is being targeted: Only system integration, hybrid technology,  and ASIC's (Amorphous-Silicon Integrate Circuits) for the  medium-size industry are now considered.</p>

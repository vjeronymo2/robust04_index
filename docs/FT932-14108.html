			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Technology: Stemming the flow of costs - Mexico City's new water system will be one of the world's most modern British and French water companies have taken on the daunting challenge of overhauling Mexico City's water system. Hard as it is to believe, Mexico City faces a more critical problem than the suffocating smog that pollutes the air during winter months - the lack of affordable water. The city's underground aquifer is being over-exploited by 20 cubic metres a day, and will run dry in a decade or so. It is prohibitively expensive to build a second reservoir and pump more water in from outside. And with budgets tight, a recent project to recycle water at a reservoir in Ixtapalapa at the city's edge had to be called off. Mexico City's water commission, headed by Carlos Casasus, a former finance director at Telefonos de Mexico, has thus turned to the private sector to solve its problems. Earlier this month, two British and two French water companies and Mexican partners won a contract worth some Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) over 10 years to restructure the city's water system, prepare a water census, draw up a digitalised map of secondary pipes, install some 700,000 electronic meters, and repair the city's 12,000km of pipes. The contract is one of the biggest of its type in the world, and will turn what is probably one of the least efficient water systems into one of the most modern. 'Mexico City is skipping a whole generation of technology,' says Jim Southworth, operations manager of North West Water of the UK. In two years, the city will have computerised maps of the water infrastructure, electronic reading of bills by radio, and some of the most advanced and accurate meters in the world. According to Dean Wheadon, an economist with International Water Consultants, who worked on the project: 'Mexico City will become a model for the developing world. Moscow is interested and is planning to visit the system. Now North West Water is following, and introducing its own pilot programme for radio reading of water meters.' The changes will have a series of effects that will reduce the water shortage. First, collected revenues should increase by about 20 per cent as the authorities expand the number of meters installed, and fewer users escape detection. Mexico City has 1.2m water users, but around 500,000 are not registered or do not pay. As a result of illegal use, Mexico City's annual water revenues are only about Dollars 152m while costs are Dollars 516m. The subsidy that goes to water consumption could be re-directed to increasing supplies from recycling. Second, accurate metering will reduce consumption, even if relative tariffs do not change. Most Mexico City residents pay a flat tariff since their meters are only read once every three years. They thus tend to waste water. Water consumption per head in Mexico City is about double that in Paris, where it is metered accurately. Third, an accurate 'intelligent' map of the water network will help the water authorities pinpoint leaks and mend them. Currently, Mexico City loses some 30 per cent of its water to unlocated leaks. The city's water commission has divided the city into four zones, and granted contracts to four groups of companies: Lyonnaise des Eaux- Dumez, Anglian Water, and Bufete Industrial; North West Water and Grupo Gutsa; Severn Trent and Socios Ambientales de Mexico; and Compagnie Generale des Eaux, Grupo ICA and Banamex. While it would have been cheaper to award the contract to one company, Casasus says the government hopes later to stimulate competition by setting water prices according to the average rate of return of the four companies. The first phase is the water census, the digital mapping of the network and the installation of meters. The census will be conducted by sending sound signals through the pipes and listening for breaks (which would mean a private connection). This way, all those taking water (legally or illegally) can be put on a computerised database and start receiving bills. At the same time, the four water companies will install new meters, for which they will be paid per meter. Mexico now uses jet meters, in which water turns a pin wheel as it enters the system. Given Mexico City's low water pressure, pin wheels often do not turn, and the meters do not record full water consumption. The new positive displacement meters work when water enters a chamber, and pushes the piston or disc around continuously. The meters will be read electronically. North West Water will read them using vans that pick up a radio signal. It claims one van can read 30,000 water meters a day. The other companies will install electronic touch pad meters, of which about 500 can be read by one person a day. Now, just 30 of the old meters are read a day by one person. With the new meters, the authorities will be able to compare water production and water use in a matter of days and reduce the amount of spare capacity needed. When the meters are in operation, Mexico City will hand over responsibility for the maintenance of supply and collection of bills to the private water companies. In effect, each company will buy water at bulk from the city's water commission, and sell it at regulated prices to the customer. Each company will thus have an incentive to be efficient in collection and in maintenance of secondary pipes. The eventual, though unstated, goal is the privatisation of the water system. But rather than do it immediately, the government has decided to go about it in incremental steps, in view of the appalling condition of the water system, and above all the lack of information about usage and costs.</p>

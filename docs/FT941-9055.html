			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The covering of short positions as a more positive mood about the market outlook returned brought a turnaround in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Brushing aside a further overnight retreat in Tokyo, the March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened firmly at 3,359. But for a brief retreat following the release of lower-than-expected industrial output figures, March moved steadily ahead for the session with a more bullish tone about the market. This helped it trade at a premium to fair value for most of the session. With the firm start to trading in New York offering further support, March finished at 3,390, up 36 on its previous close, but around 5 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about minus 5. Turnover was 10,976 at the official close. Dealers reported a poor day in the traded options with volume falling to 35,977 contracts of which 16,468 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 5,363 in the Euro FT-SE 100. In the stock options, Trafalgar House was the most active with a total of 3,109 lots with James Capel said to have carried out the days' biggest trade, the April 115 Calls, the busiest series. Dealings on the OMLX, trading the FT-SE mid-250 futures, was more or less at a standstill with a mere 68 contracts traded during the session. It finished at 4,028.5.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MOVE TO BULLPEN HAS BEEN BONUS FOR ECKERSLEY, A'S  </P> <P> It was strictly coincidence that Dennis Eckersley's baseball career and  lifestyle changed directions at the same time a little more than three years  ago.  </P> <P> Neither Eckersley nor the Oakland Athletics had a clue that he would become the  premier reliever in baseball. That happened almost by accident, shortly after  he was acquired from the Chicago Cubs in the final week of spring training in  1987.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of starting pitchers who were missing turns," said A's Manager  Tony La Russa. "He was a quality veteran and we were looking for depth. We had  guys like (Joaquin) Andujar, (Moose) Haas, (Greg) Caderet and (Jose) Rijo who  pitched good when they pitched, but they couldn't always go out there.  </P> <P> "If one of them turned up unavailable, then Eck was going to go into the  rotation," said La Russa. "But then we ran into the same problem in the  bullpen, when Jay Howell got hurt."  </P> <P> Brilliant decisions sometimes evolve from such circumstances.  </P> <P> Unbeknownst to the A's, or the Cubs, was that Eckersley, who had spent some  time on the wild side, was making changes of his own. Personal problems caused  him to take inventory of his life after the 1986 season, and he didn't like the  looks of his balance sheet.  </P> <P> "That was a screwed-up year," said Eckersley, "but I'm not going to make  excuses. I just didn't pitch good."  </P> <P> He had had arm problems in 1985 (when he was 11-7), and when he followed with a  6-11 season, the Cubs figured Eckersley was on the down side of his career.  </P> <P> "I can't blame the Cubs for trading me -- they didn't know the guy they were  trading was sober," said Eckersley, who went through an alcohol treatment  program on his own during the off-season. "But it wasn't the time for me to  talk about it either."  </P> <P> It wasn't just because Eckersley didn't want to admit to a problem. "I really  didn't know that much then. As time went on it came out and now it's easy for  me to talk about it."  </P> <P> While looking for a starting pitcher to give them depth, the A's came up with  an unexpected bonus: a rejuvenated Eckersley. Still neither the right-hander  nor La Russa envisioned him in the role of stopper.  </P> <P> "The biggest thing for me was accepting what it was," said Eckersley. "At first  it was a garbage role -- sort of like a caddie. It was a blow to what was left  of my ego."  </P> <P> That changed with the injury to Howell, who subsequently was traded to the  Dodgers after the 1987 season. In the last two years Eckersley has saved 78  games for the A's, a remarkable statistic for a guy who spent his first dozen  years in the big leagues as a front line starter.  </P> <P> Despite a seeming vulnerability to left-handed hitters, the transition  undoubtedly has given Eckersley a career extension as well as a different  approach to the game.  </P> <P> "I'm much more physical than I've ever been," he said. "The truth is that my  arm came back. If that didn't happen, nothing would matter. When your arm is  bad you work harder on it. If it isn't, you don't do anything.  </P> <P> "Working out is like therapy to me -- plus it's like trying to stop the aging  process," said Eckersley, who at 35 is in the best shape of his life.  </P> <P> "He's one of the best conditioned athletes around," said La Russa. "He's got a  program that would bring young guys to their knees."  </P> <P> Years ago the importance of such a program would have been lost on Eckersley,  but no longer. "I want the game more than ever now," he said. "It would be  stupid to jeopardize it. And how good a shape do you have to be in to pitch one  inning a game? And working out is a very positive thing; you expect good things  to happen when you work hard."  </P> <P> Eckersley gives Oriole Manager Frank Robinson credit for getting him to the big  leagues sooner than expected, and La Russa for enhancing his success as a  reliever. "Frank played an important role in my career," said Eckersley, who  came up in 1975 with the Indians, the first team managed by Robinson.  </P> <P> Robinson's decision on Eckersley 15 years ago was not unlike the one he made on  Gregg Olson a year ago. "He hadn't done anything wrong and I couldn't see any  reason to send him down, even though he hadn't pitched above Double A," said  Robinson. "We started him in the bullpen, but that was to protect him because  he was only 20 years old. He was in the rotation by the middle of May."  </P> <P> "A lot of people didn't want me in the big leagues that soon," said Eckersley,  "but Frank believed in me. I was very fortunate to have him as manager at that  point in my career.  </P> <P> "And a lot of my success now is due to the manager (La Russa). The way he uses  me makes it easy."  </P> <P> However, La Russa can't help his ace get out the left-handed hitters that  occasionally tormented him. "Part of the answer to that is I only have to go  after them one time," said Eckersley. "There comes a time in your career when  it gets tough to get a guy out four times (in a game). I probably see as many  left-handed hitters as right-handed, but I can still throw pretty hard for one  inning."  </P> <P> And if he didn't always have control of himself, Eckersley always did have good  control of his pitches. "I'm not talking about this kind of control," said La  Russa, holding his hands about six inches apart in the middle of an imaginary  plate.  </P> <P> "His control is like this," La Russa said for emphasis, indicating an area of  about four inches -- starting two inches from the edge of the plate to two  inches outside the strike zone. "He has four different pitches with his  fastball. He throws in, down and in, up and in, down and away, up and away --  and they all have different movement."  </P> <P> Though Eckersley admitted to having some nervousness when he took over his new  role ("Anybody who says they don't get nervous is crazy," he said), pitching  coach Dave Duncan says it's no accident he has adapted to the role of stopper.  "He's been out there in the ninth inning as a starter a lot of times," said  Duncan. "He knows how to get the last out -- and anybody who can do that can be  a good short reliever."  </P> <P> Eckersley had his share of success in the past, but not as much appreciation.  "I wouldn't want anybody to have to go through what I went through," he said,  reflecting on his erratic past.  </P> <P> "But it's difficult for anybody to really appreciate success unless they've had  some problems along the way."  </P> <P> So Dennis Eckersley keeps working out, slowing the aging process and extending  a career that changed both dramatically and unexpectedly.  </P></p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Now the early leaver has a chance to take it with him - The choice may lie between the guaranteed benefits of an old company scheme and the unknown ones of a life company contract / Transfers NO ASPECT of pensions has caused more problems, or aroused greater controversy, than transfers out of a company final-salary scheme into a life-company contract, whether a protected-rights personal pension or a Section 32 buy-out contract. Most people who change jobs, or leave their employer for a variety of reasons, including redundancy, face the decision of whether or not to transfer. This is the so-called 'early leaver problem'. Until a few years ago, someone leaving an employer was treated rather harshly. No allowance was made for the effect of inflation on the deferred pension, and the transfer-value calculation was stringent. But, following legislation, the position of the early leaver has improved. He now has the choice of either leaving benefits in the old scheme, or taking the cash equivalent of his deferred pension (known as the transfer value) and investing it in another pension arrangement. If he chooses the first option, the benefits take the form of a deferred pension, plus a spouse's pension, payable from the scheme's normal pension age. The initial value of a deferred pension is based on the employee's salary and his years of membership of the scheme at the time of leaving. But each year up to the retirement date, it is revalued in line with the rise in the retail price index, up to a maximum of 5 per cent a year. Once the pension becomes payable, the usual increases applicable to the scheme will be paid. A spouse's benefit would also be payable. If the latter alternative is chosen, the employee can take the transfer value and invest it in - either his new employer's scheme (if there is one), or in a pension contract from a life company - either a protected-rights personal pension or a section 32 buy-out. The choice is the employee's, and it is not an easy one. To start with, many people do not understand the situation, and company schemes often fail to provide a simple explanation, as is confirmed by the experience of the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service. Pension scheme administrators are wary of providing more than very broad general advice, in case they contravene the Financial Services Act. Consequently, employees need expert, impartial advice. This must come from the life assurance intermediaries, including independent financial advisers, tied agents and direct sales forces. There is no shortage of such advice, but much of it is neither expert nor unbiased. Essentially, the employee has to decide between: the guaranteed benefits provided by his old company scheme; and the unknown, but possibly higher, benefits provided by a life company contract, which depend very much on the underlying investment performance and annuity rates at the time of retirement. In reaching his decision, he must also assess how secure the company scheme is. Recent events have shown that many, wound up because a company has gone into liquidation, are under-funded. And deferred pensions are at the end of the queue when benefits are allocated from limited resources. The benefits from a company scheme may not be as guaranteed as they appear. Certain life companies will quote, on certain assumptions, the investment return needed, so that the benefits of the personal pension match the company pension scheme benefits. But employees and their advisers have to decide whether the life company can achieve a higher return, perhaps over several years. Illustrations on transfer values provided by Lautro, the regulatory body, are liable to mislead the layman. Whatever selection is made, the employee is taking a risk with his transfer, so that one task for the intermediary should be to ensure that he understands these risks and is prepared to accept them. Both Lautro and Fimbra have issued guidance notes to their members, to be followed when advising on transfers, but these may not always be adhered to. In particular, intermediaries tend to gloss over the positive aspects of leaving the benefits in the company scheme, while highlighting the dangers. Maxwell was the best sales aid for an intermediary who wants to push transfers - as was seen when intermediaries persuaded redundant miners to transfer from the British Coal pension scheme - one of the most secure, providing very favourable deferred pensions - to the insecurity of a life company pension contract. However, employees do not have to make up their minds at the time of leaving an employer. They can leave their benefits in the old scheme and transfer later, at any time up to a year before normal pension age. So there is no need to be rushed by enthusiastic, commission-hunting intermediaries. But delay can mean that, if the employee does eventually invest in a life company pension contract, there is less time for the underlying fund to grow. And although this should be offset by increases in the transfer value, as pension age approaches, the value is also subject to short-term fluctuations.</p>

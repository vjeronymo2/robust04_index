			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / N Korean leaders in power struggle Signs of a power struggle were evident at the latest session of the North Korean parliament held in Pyongyang late last week. The clash pits the conservative old guard affiliated to President Kim Il-sung, 81, against a younger generation of technocrats supporting Mr Kim Jong-il, the president's son and designated successor, according to analysts. 'There is a generational conflict in all this,' said Mr Adian Foster-Carter, director of the Leeds University Korea Project. 'The old guard are said to fear for their prospects once Kim Jong-il takes full charge.' A central point of dispute between the two factions is economic reform. The conservatives believe that opening the economy to foreign investment will undermine the stability of the government as North Koreans become exposed to outside influence. But the technocrats argue the North is in danger of economic collapse if the country remains closed and sticks rigidly to the governing principle of juche, or self-reliance. The reformers appeared to carry the day at the latest parliamentary session when they were given two or three years to restructure the economy, including promoting foreign trade and light industry and agriculture at the expense of heavy industry. This decision was accompanied by a report admitting the economy faced serious problems. But to mollify the conservatives, President Kim's younger brother, once touted as a potential successor, was suddenly appointed a vice-president and politburo member after an 18-year absence. Mr Kim Yong-ju, 71, disappeared from view in 1975 after the president's son rose to prominence and was proclaimed the next leader. Some analysts believe Mr Kim Yong-ju may be appointed president, while Mr Kim Jong-il will hold the more powerful positions of general secretary of the Korean Workers' party and head of the armed forces. 'Splitting the leadership between President Kim's brother and son would represent a balancing act to appease both the conservative and reformist factions, while keeping power concentrated in the hands of the Kim family,' said one analyst. President Kim has simultaneously held all three posts. Other analysts discount speculation that the rise of Mr Kim Yong-ju indicates President Kim is having second thoughts about his son assuming power. Kim Jong-il still appears to be in charge of formulating policy on the economy and other issues. The two top economic posts were recently filled by those believed to be reformers, including Mr Yun Gi-bok as chairman of the economic policy committee of the Central People's Committee, the country's senior executive body, and Mr Hong Sok-hyong as state planning chief. Efforts to attract foreign investment have also accelerated in recent weeks. The government has approved legislation allowing foreign bank operations and foreigners to lease land and visit free trade zones without visas. This follows introduction of a new foreign investment law last year that offered tax incentives for joint ventures, although barriers remain on the repatriation of profits. South Korean and some western companies, such as Unilever, are studying setting up light industrial plants in North Korea if the dispute over the inspection of the North's nuclear facilities is resolved. North Korea's interest in developing light industry using western aid would enable it to provide consumer goods to the population in the hope of retaining support for the government. It would promote the production of goods suitable for export, such as textiles and electronic goods, as part of the new policy to develop new overseas markets to improve foreign trade. The renewed emphasis on agriculture in the new economic policy is meant to overcome shortages in grain production that has cut food supplies and is reported to have led to local disturbances. Some analysts believe North Korea is using the issue of nuclear inspections to win economic concessions from the west. The strategy may have been adopted by Mr Kim Jong-il to prove his toughness to the old guard, while promoting the goals of the reformers by gaining foreign aid in return for allowing nuclear inspections.</p>

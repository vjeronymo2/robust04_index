			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Letter: No guarantee Stephen Fidler's article ('US seeks to raise World Bank's private profile', May 1) leaves out answers to one vital question: Who is to gain? The objective of structural reform promoted by the bank has, for some time, been aimed at achieving more efficient resource allocation among the economies to which they have been directed. At best results have been only mixed. The failures have largely beeneither because of poor project selection by bank staff or inefficient local management, or both. Bank lending to the private sector is essentially an extension of the same set of structural reform policies. These new ideas, if adopted, will not necessarily expedite the development process as this new breed of private borrowers will have to be at least partly vetted on the basis of their respective projects' commercial viability. This defeats the objective of alleviating 'backwardness' through sensitive resource allocation. There is no guarantee that the new form of direct lending will enhance the bank's record of picking winners - so yet further scarce resources will be wasted at the expense of those who need them most.

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: L. S. Lowry - the myth exploded / Why this artist was not as naif as he seemed we may drop the Laurence Stephen straight away, for the bare name and initials were always enough - remains in many ways as strange and contradictory a figure of 20th century British art as ever he was in his life. Born in 1887, he lived to a great age, dying in 1976 loaded with professional, civic and academic honours. His career began effectively with his years of study under Adolphe Valette at the Manchester College of Art before the first world war, and ended with a memorial show at the Royal Academy in the year of his death that was seen by some 300,000 visitors. Few British artists have been the subject of so many biographies and television documentaries. He was in many ways as popular an artist as we have ever had. Yet the myth persists. The popular imagination loves the idea of the naif, the innocent and the self-taught, and then again that of the artist condemned to his lonely studio through long years of critical neglect. Genius denied yet staying obstinately true to itself is always good copy. And then what about that critical neglect and condescension confounded by immediate popular acclaim? Lowry in his mythical reputation has enjoyed them all, and not just turn and turn about, but all at once. And none of it is true. An innocent and self-taught artist? Lowry's studies began with private classes in 1904 and continued intermittently until the early 1920s. There is no doubt that he was a man of reclusive and apparently eccentric habits, but isolated through years of critical neglect? He first showed his work at the Manchester Academy in 1919; had a painting bought by the Manchester City Art Gallery in 1926; in 1930 showed at the Salon d'Automne in Paris and the New English Art Club; showed at the Royal Academy in 1932; was elected to the Royal Society of British Artists in 1934; had his first London one man show at Lefevre, and was bought by the Tate, in 1939 . . . Small as it is, the fine and representative Lowry's show now at the Crane Kalman makes the point inescapable. For here are works across the full career, from the 1920s to the '70s, that celebrate the artist in all his quality and sophistication. Mr Kalman's own natural enthusiasm for his subject may run away with him just a little - 'a selection of masterpieces', the show's title, sets the tone - and he may also serve the myth in his persistent belief in Lowry's continuing critical neglect - the Tate has lately given a room to him. But then he has been stalwart in support of his artist, in Manchester and London, through thick and thin for more than 40 years. It is commonly supposed, since Lowry is superficially so singular in his work, that he stands entirely alone. And yet the industrial city and the urban masses that animate it have many antecedents. Leaving aside the 18th-century humanist and scientific interests of such as Wright of Derby, or the Victorian urban realism of Atkinson Grimshaw, we have only to look to an Impressionist such as Pissarro to register an interest in the city, its thorougfares and commerce, as a legitimate subject for the artist. In England, Lowry's own teacher, Adolphe Valette, himself lately the subject of an exhibition in Manchester, brought his own Impressionist's eye to the local cityscape, while at the same time the German Expressionists were turning a fiercer, more dyspeptic eye to the subject. As for the crowd, from Avercamp and Teniers to Frith and Cruikshank and the contemporary illustrators of Punch, parallel examples are everywhere to hand. If Lowry often came close to self-parody in the formulaic idiosyncracy of his mature and familiar work, he will not be the last artist to fall into that trap. But even in that later work, we so often find an inventive and radical eye, ever open to new imagery and visual ideas, and still working to organise and simplify the image in ever more radical terms. Who would think of Lowry as an artist of the countryside or the seascape, and how beautifully simple and convincing are the standing stones he painted in Cornwall in the 1950s, or the moorland fields and hedges at Fylde, or 'the old grey widow-maker,' the simple seascapes of the 1940s? There is not a figure in any of them. And where the figures do persist, even in the latest works, they retain a liveliness and freshness of characterisation and animation, so closely observed yet achieved by purely painterly means. A flick, a dab and dot of colour, and the figure, alone or in the crowd, is there to the life, scurrying and bustling out to the jetty across the canvas. But the earliest works are still the more fascinating, for they give us Lowry before his conventional method was fully established, though with hindsight we can see what is coming. The tone is darker, the contrast closer, the figures larger and more closely seen. In the earliest of them all, the cityscape of 1922, smoke fills the sky, the children run through the blackened town, men stand gossiping in the street, and already Lowry has imposed his vision of the world upon our own. But then who, just a little later, is this little girl with her back towards us, in white dress and hat and her racquet in her hand and her long black pigtail falling down her back? This is a show full of surprises. LS Lowry RA - A Selection of Masterpieces: Crane Kalman Gallery, 178 Brompton Road, SW3 until late August.</p>

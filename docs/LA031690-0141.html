			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> COUNTY CONFIRMS $475,000 SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> Breaking weeks of silence, the county formally disclosed Thursday that it has  paid a private investigator $475,000 to settle two federal lawsuits alleging  that Sheriff Brad Gates improperly investigated his critics and issued gun  permits to his friends.  </P> <P> "I'm resigned to the fact that it is over. It wasn't worth it," said Preston  Guillory, 45, of Santa Ana, who has pursued the sheriff in court for more than  a decade.  </P> <P> Guillory, Ty Ritter and his brother Frank first sued Gates in U.S. District  Court 11 years ago after they were repeatedly denied concealed weapons permits  -- Guillory for a perceived lack of moral character and the Ritters, who had a  bodyguard business, on grounds they lacked a good reason to have one.  </P> <P> They charged that Gates' gun permit process was so capricious and fraught with  cronyism that it violated their constitutional right of due process. Although  Guillory has dropped out of the case, the Ritters are continuing the lawsuit.  </P> <P> Guillory sued again in 1985, alleging that Gates improperly initiated an  unsuccessful criminal prosecution of him because he had filed the gun permit  suit and was working as a private investigator on behalf of a political  opponent of the sheriff. Last March, a jury awarded Guillory $189,894 in  damages, but both sides appealed aspects of the case.  </P> <P> Gates has maintained that his process of granting or denying concealed weapons  permits is fair and that those given the privilege have legitimate reasons and  good moral backgrounds. In the second lawsuit, the sheriff contended that there  was enough evidence to justify a criminal investigation of Guillory. Gates and  his attorneys declined to comment on the agreement.  </P> <P> The county officially announced the settlement Thursday in a terse two-page  news release that sets forth the basics of the agreement worked out last month.  The Times reported on Feb. 17 that the county had paid $475,000 to end the  litigation.  </P> <P> Under terms of the settlement, Guillory received almost $290,000, while the  county paid his lawyers, Michael Cisarik and Meir J. Westreich, $185,000 in  legal fees. In addition, Guillory agreed not to testify on behalf of the  Ritters or seek a concealed weapons permit for at least two years in Southern  California.

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRANDED CRUISE PASSENGERS RETURN  </P> <P> About 1,000 passengers on a luxury liner that ran aground in the Delaware Bay  crossed a gangplank Monday night to a ferry that brought them back to land, the  Coast Guard said.  </P> <P> Nearly two days after the cruise had been scheduled to end, the ferry Delaware  pulled alongside the 642-foot Regent Star, and passengers transferred to it,  the Coast Guard said.  </P> <P> As the cheering passengers arrived on shore, buses waited to take them back to  their cars at airports and bus stations in the Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.,  and New York City areas.  </P> <P> The ship got stuck on a sand bar early Sunday after a small fire knocked out  power. It was carrying 1,360 people, about 300 of whom were crew members.  </P> <P> Nobody was in danger during the two days atop the sand bar, the Coast Guard  said.  </P> <P> The Regent Star, sitting a mile off Fortescue, N.J., had been in the final leg  of a seven-day cruise from Montego Bay, Jamaica, when it ran aground.  </P></p>

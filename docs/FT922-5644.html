			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report Base metals prices fluctuated irregularly during a quiet day on the LME. The Ascension Day holiday in Europe made for quiet morning trade and the volume hardly improved when the US opened. Traders said uncertainty over the next move of the dollar kept consumers on the sidelines. TIN rallied in the afternoon on shortcovering prompted by the failure of the market to follow through to losses made earlier in line with a lower Kuala Lumpur market. ZINC remained a two-tier market with covering against tight nearby delivery dates pushing the premium for cash metal to Dollars 142 a tonne from Wednesday's Dollars 131. But there was little enthusiasm to buy forward metal. COPPER continued to find solid support on any dip to Dollars 2,230 a tonne. ALUMINIUM remained under pressure from liquidation and appeared to be headed for a test of the bottom end of the Dollars 1,320-Dollars 1,330 support band for three-month metal. GOLD and SILVER prices slipped lower in thin European trade in line with the New York market. The gold price ended Dollars 1.65 lower at Dollars 337.10 a troy ounce while silver lost 3 cents at 408 cents an ounce. But PLATINUM moved higher to test resistance just below Dollars 370 an ounce.

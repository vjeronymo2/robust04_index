In Nuurfanax, around 70 km southeast of Beledweyne, the  final task of General Klaus Naumann, the Bundeswehr general  chief of staff, was to hand over the largest German project to  date: A dam and a straightened river bed, which after the rains  is to hold water for irrigating some 5,000 hectares of land.    The highest ranking German soldier thanked the unit for the  humanitarian assistance they had provided. In response to the  request from indigenous clan leaders and elders that the Germans  remain in Beledweyne, Naumann said the political decision had  already been made concerning the final return of the over 1,400  German UN soldiers by 31 March. Colonel Holger Kammerhoff, the  commander of the Somalia support unit, said the Germans were  leaving behind a sign of hope with their aid projects.    According to a report drawn up by the unit, the over 3,000  soldiers and officers deployed in Somalia over the past eight  months have distributed more than 3.2 million liters of water,  drilled seven wells, repaired three bridges, and put three dams  in working order. In addition, seven schools and an orphanage  for over 120 children were built. The Germans also gave  outpatient and hospital treatment to over 15,300 Somalis and  operated on 480 victims of the civil war.    The costs of the humanitarian operation total around 3.5  million German marks [DM]. According to estimates, which have  not been confirmed by the Bundeswehr, total costs for the Somali  operation are between DM350 and 500 million.</p>

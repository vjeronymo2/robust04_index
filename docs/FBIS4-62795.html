			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Shakhray, deputy chairman of Russian </F> Government, under the "Politics" rubric: "Northerly Inhabitants  Must Be Helped in Summer, Not in Winter"]    [Text] The disruption of economic ties in parts of the Far  North and equivalent territories, the sharp reduction in the  volumes of extraction of raw materials, including oil, and the  growth in transport tariffs have jeopardized the provision of  the region's population with vitally important products. Thus,  to date, compared with the 1993 level, 45 percent of the  foodstuffs, consumer goods, and petroleum products have been  shipped in and just 8 percent of the contracts concluded for  technical industrial output. As of 1 May, 765,000 tonnes of  freight had accumulated in sea and river ports, although by May  last year this figure had reached 2 million tonnes. There is  virtually no freight in Far Eastern ports that is earmarked for  delivery to the North. The dramatic nature of the situation is  indicated, for example, by the fact that goods are brought into  a number of internal regions of the northern territories along  rivers on which navigation begins in May and continues for  several weeks. At the same time it should not be forgotten that  many of the northerners' needs are met in full by means of  deliveries. Whereas in the eighties they were funded through  the credit system, this is impossible now.    Resolving the problem, the government has adopted a decree  altering the mechanism of state financial support and shipping  of output and goods into northern regions. The Federal Fund for  State Funding of Shipping of Products and Commodities is being  created as a result of this. It is being formed out of state  budget funds, which will essentially be the North's annually  indexed working capital. A special operational commission is  being set up, which should, in my view, be endowed with  extraordinary powers. We frequently say that Russia will grow  by means of the North, but the inhabitants must be given active  assistance now, so that they do not again encounter the dramatic  situation in which they found themselves last winter.</p>

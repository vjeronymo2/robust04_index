Boris Yeltsin only partly took advantage of  this opportunity. This is what Dmitriy Lvov, corresponding  member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and deputy director of  the Central Economic-Mathematics Institute, believes. The  president's message to the Federal Assembly, he said in a  conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, fairly fully  reflects the range of questions which must be solved in order to  extricate the country from the economic crisis, but it does not  indicate how to do this.    The scientist believes that the message does not reveal the  mechanisms ensuring that inflation is curbed and the production  slump is halted, and the method of implementing the idea of  state regulation of a market economy is also unknown.    The scientist was expecting greater clarity regarding tax  questions. "In my opinion," he stressed, "our tax system is  flawed. No less than two-thirds of all crisis factors are  associated with it. All sociological polls show that the tax  question is what worries both businessmen and ordinary workers  most of all. If they escape with only minor changes in this  matter, that means the noose around industry's neck will be  pulled ever tighter. The present tax system must be changed  radically. The tax problem is the same as the problem of the  banking system's financial stabilization, and should be given  utmost priority."    A large part of the message, Lvov observed, is taken up by  the question of combating inflation. But here too, in his  opinion, there are many uncertainties and even contradictions  between the position of the president and the government. The  Ministry of the Economy, for example, plans to reduce inflation  to 7-9 percent by the end of the year, while the president's  message demands that it be cut to 5 percent. "I have formed the  impression," the scientist says, "that the president's figure is  an obsession and has no economic basis. There is a vast gulf  between the government's and the president's figures which  represents many trillions of rubles. False interpretations are  impermissible here."</p>

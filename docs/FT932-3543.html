			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Dairy trade pioneer and peace campaigner: Obituary of Alec Horsley ALEC HORSLEY, founder of Northern Foods, one of the largest food manufacturers in the UK, has died at the age of 90. Very much an individualist in the mould of enlightened 19th century Quaker entrepreneurs such as the Cadburys of Bournville and the Rowntrees of York, his unorthodox approach proved no handicap to the successful development of what is now the leading UK dairy company and the largest supplier of fresh foods to retailers such as Marks and Spencer, J. Sainsbury and Tesco. From a base in Hull in 1932 Horsley started a small business selling Dutch canned milk to the confectionery industry in the north of England. In 1937 he opened a condensed milk plant near York. By 1956, when his company, Northern Dairies, went public, it had expanded throughout Yorkshire and the north Midlands; during the 1960s it extended into the Midlands, Wales and Northern Ireland. Before retiring from the chairmanship in 1970 he was instrumental in establishing the company's trading relationship with Marks and Spencer; probably the most significant contribution to the company's rapid growth over the past 20 years. He remained on the board as a non-executive director until 1987, participating in further large dairy acquisitions and in Northern Foods' success in the cake, biscuit and chilled prepared foods markets. Until his death he was president of the Northern Foods Welfare Association, where his warm concern was appreciated by the company's thousands of pensioners. Horsley was born in Derbyshire on September 1 1902. He was educated at St George's, Harpenden, and at Worcester College, Oxford. His family was nonconformist; he himself became an energetic member of the Society of Friends (Quakers), combining a belief in the virtues of private enterprise with the goal of achieving a fair society through the redistribution of wealth. Uninterested in accumulating a private fortune - and with an unqualified attachment to underdogs, whether employees, African students, or former prisoners down on their luck - he gave most of his money away. Other than to his company, his family (he is survived by his wife Susan, five children, 15 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren) and to social justice, Horsley's life-long commitment was to the peace movement. He was a founder member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), and later received an honorary doctorate from the University of Bradford in recognition of the part he played in establishing its now distinguished chair of Peace Studies. Horsley's annual chairman's statements reflected the personality of the man. On the one hand he would extol the strengths of his company in progressive, paternalistic style; on the other he would warn shareholders of their impending incineration - possibly before the next annual meeting - as a result of the nuclear arms race. Shareholders, apparently unflinching, continued to support him. They benefited accordingly.</p>

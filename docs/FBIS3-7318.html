			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- Japan's prolonged  recession apparently discouraged manufacturers from building new  production facilities in 1993, with construction of new  factories decreasing for the fourth straight year, a government  report said Monday [29 March].    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said  corporate acquisitions of land for new factories in 1993  decreased 33.8 percent from the year before to 1,634 cases, the  lowest since 1979.    The total tract of land acquired for new plants also dropped  28.7 percent to 2,290 hectares, the ministry said.    The ministry said the report was based on a survey of  corporate purchases of land for new factories, covering 1,000  square meters or more.    Citing another survey conducted last fall on capital  investment plans, the ministry predicted the sluggish trend will  continue in 1994.    The ministry said land acquisitions decreased in most  regions  covered in the survey.</p>

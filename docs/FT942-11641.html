			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / China seeks meeting soon on finance for HK airport China yesterday requested a meeting in the next week or so of a high-level group charged with deciding how to finance Hong Kong's new airport and its connecting railway. British and Hong Kong government officials had expected a formal meeting of the airport committee, an adjunct of the Joint Liaison Group (JLG) which oversees the colony's transfer to Chinese sovereignty, but not so soon. Such a meeting would raise hopes of an early resolution to the financing of the airport. The Chinese request is linked to the presence in the colony of Mr Lu Ping, Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs. He is making his first visit since January 1992. On Tuesday evening, he said he thought an agreement on the financing of the airport acceptable to both sides could be reached soon. Mr Lu has attracted much criticism in the Hong Kong colony for his refusal to meet Governor Chris Patten, or be questioned by the colony's media. The surprise Chinese overture on the airport may be his attempt to salvage what has begun to look like a public relations failure for Mr Lu. But it is also in step with the noticeable thaw in Beijing's hard line on dealing with the British on Hong Kong matters. China is studying the fourth financial plan for the airport and its railway. This provides for an increase in the government's equity contribution to airport and railway to HKDollars 60bn (Pounds 5.4bn), from HKDollars 45bn, and a cut in the amount of debt needed to finance the project to HKDollars 23bn from HKDollars 38bn. Behind-the-scenes discussions about the airport have been going on for the past few months. Recently, a senior member of the Chinese JLG paid a visit to the airport site to assess work in progress.</p>

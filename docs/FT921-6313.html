			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Management: New guide to picking top brains What do you do when the managing director asks you to look into some new business sector or to solve a management problem? Many people would reply: 'The first thing I'd do would be to try to find a person who knew something about it'. Even with the growth of databases, many people prefer the personal approach. But they may still be overlooking the many academics who study industries and business subjects, and who have committed their findings to print. The problem of tackling this source of expertise has now been eased by the recent publication of a directory of research papers published by academics at most British management schools and business colleges. Called Brains,* it lists thousands of academic papers published in 1989 and 1990. It starts with an index under broad categories such as 'decision-making' or 'retailing'. These are then broken down into hundreds of sub-headings (examples: Deadlines: effect of; or Newcastle Metro Centre: consumer survey) with references to the individual research papers. These are listed under the names of the colleges or business schools where the author teaches, and grouped in geographical areas of the UK. This is so that people consulting the papers can not only obtain them easily but may even be able to meet the writer: each institution's telephone number is listed. Diana Griffiths, the publisher, points out that in addition to 'refereed' papers, approved as genuinely original by two senior academics, Brains contains details of many 'non-refereed' papers, which include articles from less overtly intellectual journals such as Management Today. These papers are often hard to find though academic databases. *Available from Kilmartin Publishing, 159 Granton Road, Edinburgh EH5 3NL. Pounds 150</p>

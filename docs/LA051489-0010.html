			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'THREE AND FOUR AND GLORIA!';  </P> <P> SETTLING THE SCORE BY MICHAEL LEVIN (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $17.95; 239 PP.;  0-671-66761-0)  </P> <P> Classical music is a business like no other. To become a performer,  particularly an instrumentalist, requires first the sacrifice of youth -- a  virtuoso must begin young, the younger the better, and then submerge childhood  in dulling, daily hours of practice.  </P> <P> Next comes the cutthroat competition. This happens at all stages of career  building and career maintaining -- competing to get into the best conservatory,  competing to get the best teacher, competing to get into the prestigious  competitions so you can compete some more, competing for management, and then  auditioning, auditioning and more auditioning.  </P> <P> What are the rewards? Well, you can make a lot of money and become a celebrity,  so that you can live the life of a Gypsy in airports, faceless hotels, concert  halls and sterile recording studios. Or if you manage to land a coveted spot in  a major orchestra, you can spend your life playing what the conductor tells you  to play, the way he wants you to play it, all the while seething while someone  else plays the Tchaikovsky concerto.  </P> <P> Singers, conductors, composers, management types don't have to start quite so  early, but usually they come out of the pool of musicians who do, and each of  those areas of the classical music business has its hazards as well. Remember,  there was a time when young boys underwent castration for their careers' sake.  </P> <P> So, it is hardly surprising that musicians are sometimes eccentric, petty,  immature or just plain nutty. And a very funny behind-the-classical-music-scene  roman a clef could be written about the world.  </P> <P> "Settling the Score," unfortunately, is not that book, as hard as it tries to  be.  </P> <P> Michael Levin's targets are conductors, orchestra members, singers, composers  (Levin's sniveling descriptions of new music are appallingly foul-mouthed),  managers, despicable music teachers, wives and lovers and mistresses of all of  the above, stage-door guards. Have I left anyone out? Oh, yes, and Mozart.  </P> <P> The premise of the novel is that the director of a New York chorus discovers a  lost Mass by Mozart, which is about to have its premiere in Carnegie Hall.  Mozart had supposedly written the Mass as a display piece for a lady oboist  after whom he lusted. When she rejected his advances, the composer evidently  withdrew his music.  </P> <P> No one knows that Donald, our chorus director, is a great conductor because he  suffers from stage fright, so the world premiere of the Mass is offered to a  dashing conductor of something called the Royal Symphonic, a former college  wrestler who happens to be a barely literate nincompoop married to the daughter  of the Royal Symphonic's principal donor.  </P> <P> Andrew, the conductor, seems principally interested in pretty women in the  orchestra -- his wife is a frigid, ambitious dragon lady. He also is a  political naif, as well as a musical one, and he has managed to enrage both the  Palestinians and the Jews. And so the stage is set for the gala Mozart premiere  and his American debut, a media event during which everything that can go wrong  does. You can find out for yourself how he winds up on the podium and on  national television wearing a torn mint-green tuxedo and sneakers.  </P> <P> To parody the classical music world, however, one has to know it better than  Levin appears to. From the first page, the novel demonstrates a very shaky  grasp of music, of how it is made. For instance, Donald, the chorus master,  asks, at the opening of the book, for his singers to begin two measures before  the "Gloria" and then calls out, "Three and four and Gloria!" -- Levin thus  confusing those two beats with two bars. A small detail, perhaps, not one that  inspires confidence.  </P> <P> Moreover, Levin seems to have only the vaguest notions how an orchestra  administration works -- the music director of the New York Philharmonic, or its  "Settling the Score" equivalent, does not hire a chorus master; the general  manager does not leave it up to his assistant to negotiate the fees of  celebrated guest conductors, and on and on.  </P> <P> Certainly in a work of fiction and especially a parody, the author is free to  invent however he likes for the sake of a laugh or to help the plot along. But  Levin banks heavily on the intrigue of insider information -- the appeal of his  previous novel, "The Socratic Method," was its behind-the-scenes look at Ivy  League law school, something Levin, a law graduate, knows something about.  </P> <P> Not so here. "Settling the Score," besides being inelegantly written, seems to  want to settle some score against music; all about music and its business come  out looking foolish. It is not a nice or a fair book or an amusing book, but  rather a sour one.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan by </F> CLARIN reporter Telma Luzzani in Buenos Aires; date not given]    [Text] [Papazyan] Armenia's economy and political life is  directly affected by the [Nagorno-Karabakh] conflict. For us, a  peaceful solution to the conflict is of prime importance. There  are at present two proposals for achieving peace in  Nagorno-Karabakh: The CSCE proposal and the Russian proposal.  Armenia has accepted both and what is more, we have convinced  the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities to accept them too. But do not  believe it was an easy task.    [Luzzani] Why?    [Papazyan] Because neither proposal guarantees protection  for  the Karabakh population following the peace agreement, and it  goes without saying that the documents do not talk about the  enclave's "independence."    [Luzzani] Both proposals speak about withdrawal of troops.  Is Karabakh willing to withdraw from the occupied Azerbaijani  territory?    [Papazyan] One should put that question to Karabakh's  authorities, but I believe that if they accepted the proposals  it is because they are willing to withdraw their troops.  Azerbaijan will also have to withdraw its troops from northern  Karabakh. The Azerbaijani Government has, however, rejected  both proposals.    [Luzzani] Is there practically no possibility of a  cease-fire?    [Papazyan] I would not say so. Azerbaijan is also steeped in  a critical situation and sooner or later will have to accept  that the solution will not be found through military  intervention. There will come a moment when it will have to  accept the CSCE's proposal since it does not want Russian troops  to return to its territory. Ideally, international troops should  be used to ensure that peace will not be broken. Russia will  not be able to oppose this.    [Luzzani] How are relations between Armenia and Iran at  present?    [Papazyan] Our relations are those of good neighbors. There  are some problems because the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has  spread to its boarders and Iran does not like that at all. Iran  is also interested in a peaceful solution.    [Luzzani] And with Turkey?    [Papazyan] We do not have diplomatic relations with Turkey,  which totally closed its border with Armenia and it openly  promotes Azerbaijani interests.    [Luzzani] Does Russia continue to be Armenia's leading  partner?    [Papazyan] Russia is enmeshed in a very serious economic  crisis. Armenia is Moscow's ally, but the Russian Government  finds it difficult to provide aid to its allies. Moreover, we  have very good relations with the EC, the United States,  Argentina. Our foreign policy is orientated towards a balanced  opening.    [Luzzani] And with the other former Soviet Republics?    [Papazyan] Relations with the Ukraine are not as deep as  they  should be because Kiev is in an even worse situation than  Moscow. We have very good relations with republics in Central  Asia, especially with Turkmenistan. From the economic  standpoint, I would say our main partners are Russia first,  followed by Turkmenistan, with Iran in third place.</p>

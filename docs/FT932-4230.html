			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Technology: A quick-fix telecoms solution - DHL is using microwave frequencies in Moscow to bypass the city's overloaded exchanges Not many western companies operating in Moscow have reason to be grateful to the KGB. But when the courier firm DHL set up its new Moscow telephone link this month, it marked not only an innovation in Russian telephone technology, but also a considerable coup in terms of post-cold war co-operation. What makes DHL's telephone system unusual - and the co-operation of the KGB necessary - is its use of microwave technology. A radio transmission system popular in military communications, microwaves have been used in telephone systems since the end of the 1980s, either to circumvent existing cable or copper networks, or to provide extensions to them. But though now commonplace in the west, they have been slow to appear in eastern Europe, where microwave frequencies have been controlled by the local military and the emerging western-style telecommunications infrastructure has focused on satellite, cellular radio and fibre-optic systems. 'This is the first time microwave has been used in Russia,' says Kevin Edmond, director of Hermes telecommunications company which installed the link. Hermes hopes microwave will provide a viable telecommunications alternative for other businesses in eastern Europe. Judging from DHL's story, the system does seem to have some advantages of speed and flexibility, particularly for smaller businesses which want to use satellite services. In common with many companies operating in eastern Europe, DHL had arrived in Moscow to find a familiar saga of telecommunication woes. Although it had originally asked the local telephone authorities to supply 30 lines on one number, it had received five lines, each on different numbers - resulting in engaged telephones and frustrated customers. Since the local exchange was already heavily overloaded, there was little hope of gaining any extra lines through the local system. 'There is such a shortage, they said they could only give us new lines when another user died,' explains Steve Csikai, DHL's IT manager. Since establishing its own satellite link would have been extremely expensive, DHL began to explore ways of using those run by Comstar, a joint venture between the British company GPT and Moscow Telecommunications Network (MGTS), through the existing UK-built System X exchange in Moscow. But because DHL's offices were located 38km from the exchange, linking into this presented a problem - either they would have to use the local network, which would place them at the mercy of the Russian telephone system again, or lay a new fibre-optic cable which would be a lengthy process. 'Putting wires across Moscow means digging up roads, which all takes a lot of time - in our case at least six months,' says Csikai. At that point, Hermes suggested a microwave link, which was potentially quicker and cheaper, representing a total investment of around Dollars 150,000 (Pounds 97,400). Establishing the link required extensive negotiation with the local security services and considerable engineering innovation. To ensure a clear transmission path between DHL's low-lying offices and the Comstar exchange, an antenna had to be suspended from a nearby tower block, surrounded by metal cages and locked steel doors to guard against theft. But a month after the operation started DHL received the 40 new lines, offering international phone calls at a cost ranging from Dollars 1 to Dollars 5 a minute. As other telecommunications operators point out, the system still has drawbacks, especially for larger businesses. Compared with optical fibre, microwave's capacity is relatively limited  - the DHL link, for example, carries 4 channels of 2 megabits - or the potential equivalent of 120 lines. The optical fibre cables being laid by Comstar carry 32 optical fibres, each carrying 34 megabits, soon to be upgraded to 155 megabits, representing the potential for thousands of lines. Another problem lies in transmission. Because laser-thin signals are beamed between stations which have to be in line of sight, the receivers cannot be more than a horizon apart - usually about 40km. Although this distance can be extended by relay stations, transmission can be affected by obstructions - severe weather conditions for example, can cause delays - and if any new buildings are constructed in the pathway, the signal must be re-routed. 'Microwave is a quick-fix solution,' says Ken Norman, project director of Comstar, who insists that the real future for telecommunications in Russia lies with optical fibre systems. Comstar, for example, has already laid 1,060km of optical fibre cable across Moscow. Nevertheless, DHL insists that as far as its own telecommunications needs are concerned, the link is effective. Furthermore, for a courier company which relies on advertising a well-known number, the system has one big advantage - if it moves premises, it will be able to take its telephone number without needing to lay more cable. 'In the end our customers don't care what the 'phone system is, just so long as they just can rely on getting through,' says Csikai.</p>

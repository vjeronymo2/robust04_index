			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SCIENTISTS WILL RELEASE WASPS TO COMBAT ASH WHITEFLY INVASION  </P> <P> Biologists hoping to eradicate the pesky ash whitefly, a tiny insect which has  defoliated trees from Sacramento to San Diego, were preparing today for the  release Friday of 50 wasps that help control the pest.  </P> <P> The tiny, stingless wasps will be released at the Balboa Sports Center, a  fly-infested park in Encino, by scientists from University of California,  Riverside. The black-and-gold wasps, which rapidly reproduce, were imported  from Israel and Italy.  </P> <P> The wasp is a parasitic insect which reproduces by laying its eggs in the  bodies of the ash whitefly. Scientists hope to release 250 more wasps  throughout Southern California later this month. The first whiteflies were  spotted in California at a Van Nuys fruit stand in August, 1988.  </P></p>

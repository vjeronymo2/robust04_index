			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 31 May, the government held a  coordination meeting on reunification and security-related  policies under the chairmanship of Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime  minister and minister of the National Unification Board, at the  South-North talks Secretariat in Samchong-tong. Discussions  were held on the government's measures against the North Korean  nuclear issue which faces a serious crisis due to the failure in  the negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] and North Korea. Following is a report by Kim Chol-min.    [Begin Kim Chol-min recording] Today, the government decided  to actively promote sanctions against the North based on the  international cooperation system if North Korea does not accept  the separation and storage of the fuel rods at its five-megawatt  atomic reactor in Yongbyon by 6 June, the date slated for the  IAEA Board of Governors meeting. In accordance with President  Kim Yong-sam's yesterday's order to come up with a  countermeasure according to each situation of the North Korean  nuclear issue, the government held a coordination meeting on  reunification and security-related policies and discussed this  matter today.    The government confirmed that it will not stop its efforts  to  continue to hold dialogue with North Korea until 6 June. In  particular, the government decided that if North Korea does not  accept the IAEA's demand, even after a final warning is sent to  North Korea through a resolution stronger than the UN Security  Council presidential statement adopted by the United Nations  today, it will strongly convey to the United States the  inevitability of carrying out sanctions against the North at the  UN Security Council level.    Along with this, the government discussed ways to deal with  China, which might exercise a veto when voting on a resolution  on sanctions by the UN Security Council. It also decided to  actively encourage China's participation, and examine the  possibility of taking sanctions focusing on allies such as the  United States and Japan, aside from the UN Security Council.

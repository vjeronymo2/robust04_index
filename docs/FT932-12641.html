			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Europe is unexcited by cut in German rates European equity markets moved in directions of their own making for much of last week, with the Bundesbank's unexpected cut in rates on Thursday failing to provide much of a lift. Overall, the FT-Actuaries World index reflected an easier trend. Dublin exemplified the lower trend, finally giving ground after posting gains in each of the previous eight weeks. Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin, notes that given the extent of the previous rise, straight forward profit-taking was a major factor. However, in spite of the week's decline, the overall market index so far this year was still 25 per cent higher and prices were 40 per cent above the low reached last October. Mr Kelleher adds that among specific factors dragging the market lower were AIB, which fell 3 per cent, and Bank of Ireland, 7 per cent off, mainly reflecting a perceived weakness in future contributions of US regional bank subsidiaries. Fyffes gave up 11 per cent of the previous week's 30 per cent rise as it rejected a bid by Dole, the US fresh produce company, which said it had no plans to launch a hostile bid or to raise the value of its offer. Smurfitt fell 10 per cent after an announcement of plans to close a Spanish associate because of price weakness in the European markets. Looking ahead, Mr Kelleher believes valuations of shares that have found most foreign demand no longer look unduly cheap by international comparisons. 'Given that these stocks dominate the market in terms of market capitalisation, we find it difficult to see how the market as a whole can push significantly ahead from these levels without inducing some overseas profit-taking.' France was also lower, in spite of a further easing by the Bank of France in the intervention rate to 8.5 per cent after the Bundesbank's rates reduction on Thursday. Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Europe says US funds, which were buyers in January on the assumption that the franc would be forced out of the EMS, were taking profits. Some domestic investors were also sellers on the view that the next rate cut might be up to three months away. He also notes that some investors might be keeping money back for forthcoming privatisation issues. In the opposite direction, Finland had a good week, on the back of lower interest rates and a positive view on the outlook for the weekend's Russian referendum. Mrs Mary Berg of James Capel in London notes that changes at the start of the year which removed limitations on foreign ownership of Finnish shares had prompted foreign funds to increase their holdings in a market widely perceived to have underperformed for the last four years. Moreover, forestry companies with a high proportion of exports had benefited from the weakness of the local currency. Mr Peter Tron of Unibank in London adds that the 35 per cent advance by the market since the start of the year and 117 per cent increase since last September, when the markka was floated on the foreign exchanges, were not the result of speculative pressure but reflected falling interest rates, a positive outlook for earn-ings, and the stable economy. Malaysia continued to benefit from changes planned in the composition of the Morgan Stanley Capital International index from May 1, effectivly splitting its Malaysian and Singapore stock grouping. The move, which will give Malaysia a much larger weighting, is pulling in investment from funds which are obliged to invest in the area. Last week's rally, which saw the composite index around its high for the year and posting advances on every trading day but one, confounded some analysts who had expected the market to consolidate after the strong performance of the previous week. Instead, prices took their cue to continue higher from heavy demand on Monday amid reports of a big programme buying operation. Mr Michael Franklin of Kim Eng Securities in London notes that interest has shifted in recent weeks from third line stocks back to recent laggards among core stocks, and in particular Tenago, the national electricity group, and Malaysian Telecom.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in                 % change in local currency**    sterling**  US Dollars**              1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of     Start of                                         1993      1993         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +0.82    -1.90   -18.06    +1.22     -1.11        +2.88 Belgium      -2.43    -1.13    +5.26   +11.90     +9.71       +14.13 Denmark      -0.20    +6.31   -12.09   +12.17    +11.19       +15.67 Finland      +4.81   +11.71   +41.46   +35.62    +24.82       +29.87 France       -3.19    -4.52    -1.76    +5.65     +4.88        +9.10 Germany      -1.15    +0.37    -7.33    +9.02     +7.15       +11.47 Ireland      -5.11    +2.21    +6.76   +27.33    +16.30       +20.98 Italy        +3.37   +10.60   +12.51   +24.40    +18.22       +22.98 Netherlands  -1.31    +0.43    +6.58   +10.89     +8.92       +13.32 Norway       -0.22    -2.85    -4.68   +10.56     +9.78       +14.20 Spain        +2.74    +3.24    +0.39   +15.62     +9.20       +13.59 Sweden       +2.95    +3.30   +14.99    +7.96     +0.89        +4.95 Switzerland  -0.10    +0.18   +14.31    +5.14     +3.54        +7.71 UK           +0.86    -0.04    +9.82    +1.20     +1.20        +5.28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE       -0.08    +0.20    +4.87    +6.16     +4.69        +8.90  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    -0.60    +0.90    +2.84    +8.96     +8.47       +12.84 Hong Kong    +1.03    +6.32   +22.82   +21.81    +17.30       +22.02 Japan        -1.76    +6.86   +17.75   +16.71    +26.65       +31.74 Malaysia     +3.82   +11.10   +33.26   +17.02    +14.48       +19.10 New Zealand  +2.77    +2.62    +8.66    +7.04     +8.36       +12.73 Singapore    +0.56    +5.93   +13.45    +9.34     +6.57       +10.86 Canada       +1.13    +1.38    +3.36    +6.97     +3.68        +7.86 USA          -2.66    -2.44    +6.48    +0.18     -3.69        +0.18 Mexico       -1.10    +0.27    -5.61    -2.28     -5.26        -1.44 South Africa +1.71    +2.07    +5.02   +13.13    +13.30       +17.86  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  -1.52    +1.23    +9.01    +6.90     +6.96       +11.27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on April 23rd 1993.

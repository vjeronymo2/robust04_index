			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Drug money launderers find new routes THE volume of laundered drug money, estimated at Dollars 85bn (Pounds 46bn) in the US and Europe four years ago, has remained high in spite of the efforts of a task force set up to combat it by the leading industrialised nations at their 1989 economic summit. 'I cannot imagine that the figure has dropped since we started,' Mr Alexis Lautenberg, a Swiss foreign ministry official, said yesterday. Mr Lautenberg, who has chaired the task force in the past year, said that even though many countries, including Switzerland, had introduced measures to prevent drug money laundering, the activity had merely shifted 'geographically and institutionally'. Money launderers were moving to eastern European and far eastern countries and using unregulated institutions and more circuitous paths. The report also revealed that many of the 27 governments participating in the task force had not yet implemented many of its recommendations, especially those requiring legal action. Only 10 have ratified the 1988 Vienna Convention criminalising drug money laundering. Progress will be accelerated next year when member countries of the European Community and European Economic Area will have to comply with the EC money laundering directive. It will oblige all financial institutions to know the identity of their customers, to keep full records and to report any suspicious transactions to the authorities.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DOUBLE JUMP ISN'T A PROBLEM FOR TELFORD  </P> <P> The usual route to the majors for a pitcher is through triple A, the highest  minor league classification. As a rule, pitchers require more time in the  minors than position players do.  </P> <P> The Baltimore Orioles, however, have had success bringing up pitchers from  double A.  </P> <P> They did it with reliever Gregg Olson, and last season he was the American  League rookie of the year.  </P> <P> Saturday, they brought up Anthony Telford from Hagerstown (Md.), their  affiliate in the double-A Eastern League, so he could start Sunday's game  against the Oakland Athletics.  </P> <P> Telford, the former San Jose State star, held the Athletics to one hit in seven  innings and the Orioles won, 3-2, ending a four-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Cal Ripken and Joe Orsulak hit home runs for the Orioles to give the rookie a  3-0 lead.  </P> <P> They brought Olson in to pitch the ninth. Although he gave up a two-run homer  to Mark McGwire, Olson was credited with his 28th save. It was McGwire's 32nd  homer and the first hit off Olson at Memorial Stadium.  </P> <P> Telford, a 24-year-old right-hander who was Baltimore's fourth-round pick in  the 1987 draft, had a 10-2 record and a 1.97 earned-run average at Hagerstown.  He had a no-hitter until Terry Steinbach looped a single to center with two out  in the fifth inning.  </P> <P> "I was a little nervous, but Oakland had never seen me, so that was an  advantage. They didn't know what to expect," Telford said. "I was just trying  to do the best I could to keep us in the ballgame."  </P> <P> Telford who was called up to replace injured Dave Johnson, started the season  at Class A Frederick, Md., where he was 4-2 with a 1.68 ERA.  </P> <P> He pitched in only one game in 1988 before undergoing surgery on his right  shoulder. He returned 15 months later, and was 2-1 with Frederick last year.  </P> <P> "It was a tremendous effort," Oriole Manager Frank Robinson said. "He showed a  lot of poise and savvy -- he made some pitches when he had to make them. He  kept them off balance. That's what pitching is all about."  </P> <P> Oakland Manager Tony La Russa also praised Telford.  </P> <P> "He was very effective," La Russa said. "He showed a good variety, good  location and different speeds."  </P> <P> Toronto 9, Minnesota 1 -- When the Twins won the World Series in 1987, they  were almost unbeatable at home. The noisy Metrodome was given much of the  credit for their success that season.  </P> <P> But, as they wallow in the cellar in the West this season, the Twins don't have  a home park edge.  </P> <P> The Blue Jays have made themselves at home there. When the Twins made two  errors to help the Blue Jays score six runs in the seventh inning, it enabled  the Blue Jays to sweep the six-game season series at Minneapolis.  </P> <P> The Twins had a 1-0 lead over David Wells (9-3) when a single and errors by  shortstop Greg Gagne and pitcher Mark Guthrie put Toronto ahead. Mookie  Wilson's two-run double broke the game open.  </P> <P> Wilson, who is batting .424 against the Twins this season, also had a two-run  triple.  </P> <P> The third win in a row kept the Blue Jays in a virtual tie for first with  Boston in the East.  </P> <P> New York 3, Seattle 1 -- On the day before owner George Steinbrenner is  supposed to be swept out of office, the Yankees completed their first home  sweep of the season.  </P> <P> Tim Leary (7-15) won for the first time in 10 starts at Yankee Stadium. The  former Dodger right-hander gave up six hits in seven innings to end his 0-6  record at home.  </P> <P> Bob Geren hit a two-run homer off Matt Young, another former Dodger, in the  fifth to give Leary the support he needed.  </P> <P> Lee Guetterman pitched a scoreless eighth and Dave Righetti retired the last  three batters for his 26th save.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 7, Kansas City 2 -- Darryl Hamilton singled twice, stole two bases  and scored two runs at Milwaukee to support the three-hit pitching of Mark  Knudson (9-6).  </P> <P> About the only Royal who presented a problem for Knudson was George Brett.  Brett, continuing his late-season hitting splurge, had two of the hits and  drove in both runs with his 10th home run and a single.  </P> <P> The loser was Andy McGaffigan who had won three in a row.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, Texas 2 -- The White Sox moved back to within 6 1/2 games of the  Athletics with this victory at Arlington, Tex.  </P> <P> Ron Karkovice drove in two runs and Bobby Thigpen registered his major  league-leading 40th save. Thigpen, Chicago's fourth reliever, pitched a perfect  ninth.  </P> <P> The Rangers put at least one runner on base in eight innings, but stranded  seven. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

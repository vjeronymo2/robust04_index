			<p>BFN     [Text] Rafah, 1 Jun (MENA) -- The Palestinian civilian  authorities have started to exercise their full power in the  autonomy areas in Gaza and Jericho as of today. Staff Major  General 'Abd-al-Raziq al-Majaydah, commander of the Palestinian  National Security Forces, stated that a Palestinian-Israeli  higher coordination committee has been formed and that three  Palestinian liaison subcommittees were formed in Jericho, Gaza,  and Khan Yunus to discuss outstanding matters and to come to a  solution to the remaining problems that obstruct the  implementation of the agreement, primarily the issue of borders  and crossing points.    The autonomy areas have been divided into three zones, each  entrusted to an official. They are North Gaza, from Wadi Gaza  to Bayt Hanun, entrusted to Colonel Sulayman Halas; South Gaza,  from Wadi Gaza to Rafah, entrusted to Brigadier General  'Abd-al-Mu'ti al-Sab'awi; and Jericho, including the city of  Jericho and camps, entrusted to Brigadier General Sa'id Naji.    Maj. Gen. al-Majaydah remarked that these appointments are  temporary and are designed to run matters in the National  Authority areas until Yasir 'Arafat completes his appointments.    In another development, a group of 222 Palestinian police of  varying ranks from Tunis crossed the Rafah border point today.  Another 600 individuals are expected to arrive from Libya this  evening and a third group will arrive from Tunis in the next two  days.    Meanwhile, the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and  Islamic Jihad commands have decided to cooperate with the  Palestinian National Authority on building the state, to abandon  violence, and to form a political party to discuss matters  objectively to serve the interests of the Palestinian people.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The FAA has received numerous reports of fatigue cracking and/or corrosion in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the strut-to-wing attachments on Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. In two cases, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cracking resulted in the failure of a strut load path and the subsequent loss of the number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3 engine and strut. In both cases, catastrophic accidents occurred when the number 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine and strut separated from the wing of the airplane and struck the number 4 engine,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> causing it to separate from the airplane. Investigation into the cause of these accidents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other reported incidents revealed not only that fatigue cracks and corrosion in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strut-to-wing attachments, if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, can result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure of the strut and subsequent separation of the engine from the airplane, but that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structural fail-safe capability of the strut-to-wing attachment is inadequate on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has previously issued 17 AD's that address various problems associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the strut attachment assembly on Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. These AD's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have required, among other things, inspections of the strut, strut-to-wing attachment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure, and wing backup structure of Model 747 series airplanes that are equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pratt &amp; Whitney Model JT9D series engines (excluding Model JT9D&hyph;70 series engines).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Explanation of Service Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Boeing recently has developed a modification of the strut-to-wing attachment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure installed on certain Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model JT9D series engines (excluding Model JT9D&hyph;70 engines) that significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improves the load-carrying capability and durability of the strut-to-wing attachments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such improvement also will substantially reduce the possibility of fatigue cracking and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrosion from developing in the attachment assembly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994, which describes procedures for modification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nacelle strut and wing structure. This modification entails the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Providing a new fail-safe load path by installing a new dual side load fitting to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the strut and the underwing structure and the associated wing back-up fitting, front spar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> post, and side links;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Strengthening the strut by installing a new midspar web and a new lower spar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> web and/or channel stiffener;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Strengthening the internal wing structure by installing a new stiffener at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wing midspar;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Improving the strut-to-wing attachments by installing new stainless steel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> midspar fittings on the strut, replacing aluminum fittings with new titanium midspar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underwing fittings, and replacing the upper link and the diagonal brace;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Enhancing the diagonal brace underwing fitting by installing certain new nuts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and tension bolts; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Modifying the electrical wiring and hydraulics by rerouting certain wire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bundles around the new dual side load fitting and installing new hydraulic tubes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This alert service bulletin specifies that the modification of the nacelle strut and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wing structure is to be accomplished prior to, or concurrently with, the terminating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions described in the service bulletins listed in paragraph I.C., Table 2, ``Prior or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concurrent Service Bulletins,'' on page 13 of this alert service bulletin. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminating actions include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Replacement of the diagonal brace, midspar, and upper link fusepins with new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third generation 15&hyph;5 corrosion-resistant steel fusepins;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Replacement of the diagonal brace strut and wing attachment fittings;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Strengthening of the wing front spar; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Replacement of the forward engine mounting nut.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph III, NOTES 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the Accomplishment Instructions on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pages 149 and 150 of the alert service bulletin also describe procedures for inspections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and checks to detect discrepancies of the adjacent structure, and correction of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discrepancies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Explanation of the Provisions of the Proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require modification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nacelle strut and wing structure, inspections and checks to detect discrepancies in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjacent structure, and correction of discrepancies. The actions would be required to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that long term continued operational safety will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better assured by design changes to remove the source of the problem, rather than by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repetitive inspections. Long term inspections may not be providing the degree of safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance necessary for the transport airplane fleet. This, coupled with a better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding of the human factors associated with numerous continual inspections, has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> led the FAA to consider placing less emphasis on inspections and more emphasis on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design improvements. The proposed modification requirement is in consonance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accomplishment of the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminate the inspections currently required by the following AD's:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

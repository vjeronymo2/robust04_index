			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Vard ferry group pre-tax losses up after nine months VARD, the troubled Norwegian cruise and ferry group, saw nine-month pre-tax losses widen substantially to NKr148.9m (Dollars 17.8m) from NKr3.23m in the same period last year, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The deterioration is due largely to higher operating and interest expenses, foreign currency losses on debt, and an extraordinary charge of NKr69.8m. Group revenue rose to NKr5.46bn from NKr4.11bn and operating profits advanced slightly to NKr478.6m from NKr437.9m, as interest income increased to NKr13.37m from NKr6.47m. Interest expenses, however, rose to NKr500.34m from NKr330.22m last year. Vard said its Kloster Cruise subsidiary was being restructured, the results of which would take some time to be reflected in the company's accounts.</p>

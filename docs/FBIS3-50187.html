			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rem Ivanovich Vyachirev, president of the </F> Russian GAZPROM gas company, by Vladimir Duduc, in Bratislava on  10 January: "Doubling of Deliveries; Preliminary Agreement on  Gas Imports From Russia"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Duduc] We know that, while in  Bratislava, you discussed natural gas deliveries to Slovakia.  What are your conditions?    [Vyachirev] Our talks were concluded with the signing of a  protocol that affirms the two sides' interest in advantageous  bilateral cooperation. [passage omitted] The Russian Federation  is interested in increasing natural gas deliveries to the  countries of Western Europe via the Slovak Republic's transit  gas pipeline system. Your side, on the other hand, is asking for  more gas from Russia. We have agreed that experts of both  countries meet in Bratislava or Moscow by the end of the first  quarter of this year to specify the amount by which [Slovak]  natural gas imports will be increased. According to preliminary  agreements, the increase should be in the range of 4-5 billion  cubic meters, which is approximately twice the amount the Slovak  Republic has been importing thus far.    [Duduc] Have you also come to an agreement on prices?    [Vyachirev] No, we did not discuss prices. Even if we did, I  would not reply to your question because it is a commercial  secret. I would not tell anyone.    [Duduc] Did you also discuss the modernization of existing  gas pipelines or the construction of new ones?    [Vyachirev] We have agreed on a fraternal division of labor.  Everyone will do his job on his own territory--Russia on Russian  territory and Slovakia on Slovak territory.</p>

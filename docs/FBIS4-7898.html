			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 5 (CTK) -- Agreement on the final  date of signing a document on repaying the Russian debt means  that several- year talks on the issue are drawing to a close,  Premier Vaclav Klaus said after return from a two-day trip to  Russia today.    The date is May 30. A "check date," May 15, was agreed upon  in the talks with Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, Klaus  said, adding that in case of problems the two premiers would  speak over the phone on May 16 in order to remove the obstacles.    The agreement does not mean that the Russian debt, worth  some  $3.4 billion, will be paid back "starting tomorrow or the day  after tomorrow," Klaus noted. "The agreement means a written  acknowledgement of the debt and establishment of clear relations  and clear schedule of the payments," he added.    The debt will be partly repaid on the basis of the  principles  of the "Paris Club of creditors," the rest by deliveries of  goods and through Czech participation in Russian privatization.    Klaus admitted that the Czech Republic had been striving for  collecting the debt by other means than through the Paris club  which comprises economically advanced countries.    "We had hoped for a long time that we would be able to find  other ways of payment, not being viewed as the rich West to  which payments are made belatedly. I have to admit these dreams  were unrealistic," Klaus said.    Klaus said he had not discussed security issues with  President Boris Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin.</p>

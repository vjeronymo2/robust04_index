			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Charity regulations to be reviewed organisations are to be deregulated. Mrs Tessa Baring, who chairs the charity Barnardo's, is to head a task force which should report to ministers on suggested changes 'early in the new year'. Mr Neil Hamilton, the trade and industry minister responsible for deregulation, said the team would 'look at the whole range of regulations affecting the voluntary sector, and will also bring a different perspective to concerns about unnecessary regulations'. It will work closely with Lord Sainsbury, special adviser on deregulation to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. One step towards deregulation in the sector came yesterday with the first publication of the decisions and advice of the Charity Commissioners. These will now be published twice a year.</p>

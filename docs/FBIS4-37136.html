			<p>BFN     [Text] An official source has asserted that the rebellious  and traitorous gang no longer has influence on foreign public  opinion apart from its false wailing and spreading of fabricated  reports on indiscriminate artillery and missile bombardment of  residential areas in the valiant city of Aden. This gang also  talks about victims among the innocent citizens after having  used up its lies about the shelling of vital and economic  installations.    The precise details of the situation are now known in Aden,  whether regarding the acts of repression, killings, and  persecution carried out by the rebellious gang and those who  encroached upon legitimacy against innocent citizens in all  areas and neighborhoods, or regarding the involvement of  children and girls in acts from which men, soldiers, and  officers, who are mortgaged and linked to the rebels, have fled  after finding out the truth and having been overwhelmed by  immense despair.    Likewise, the citizens' position is known toward these  gangs,  which are obsessed with blood and with creating catastrophes in  order to terrorize and humiliate the citizens. Meanwhile, these  gangs transferred their entire families from Aden by sea despite  the will of the ships that arrived in the port of Aden to  transfer foreigners from Aden. This fact is also well known by  the steadfast and enduring citizens in Aden.    The source found it strange that some Arab media carried  these reports along with old pictures and other repeated  pictures that were not taken in Aden. These media were so  hostile and reckless that they carried televised clips showing  the dead and wounded from Sanaa, al-Rahidah, Zinjibar, and other  cities as a result of the Scud missiles fired by the rebellious  criminals. These media, however, claimed that these clips  showed victims of the alleged indiscriminate shelling of  residential areas in Aden.    Concluding his statement, the source asserted that this worn  out card, which depends on lies and fabrication, will  undoubtedly catch fire and turn into ashes, exactly like other  cards. No doubt, lies are short-lived, he added.</p>

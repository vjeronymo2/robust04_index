			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Armed forces limited to 2.7% Recommended pay increases of between 3 per cent and 4.4 per cent for the armed forces are higher than for other public-sector employees, although part of the increase is being held back until next January. The recommendations were the only ones not accepted in full by the government, which is limiting increases payable from April to 2.7 per cent. The review body said it had taken into account the 'turbulence and uncertainty' caused by defence cuts, and the fact that some military salaries had fallen 'below broad comparability' with civilian earnings. One officer said that the rise was 'realistically as much as we could have expected'. The changes will lift a brigadier's pay to Pounds 55,958 a year when fully implemented and that of an army captain with three years in the rank to Pounds 23,699. Officials said that the initial 2.7 per cent rise was higher than foreseen in the revised Pounds 23.5bn defence budget but this would not significantly affect other Ministry of Defence plans. Last November defence spending targets were cut by about Pounds 1.8bn over three years. The ministry is due to set up an independent board in the next few weeks to carry out a more far-reaching review of career structures, pay and conditions in the armed forces. Local authority employers yesterday predicted sweeping cuts in services after teachers were awarded a flat 2.9 per cent pay increase by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, John Authers writes. The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities said that government rules would allow a maximum national increase in local government expenditure of only 1.6 per cent next year. Shortfalls will vary between authorities but Mr Graham Lane, who chairs the AMA's education committee, said: 'Inevitably teachers will have to go and class sizes rise.' Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the award was 'probably the best obtainable in the current climate'. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, said the rise would soon be overtaken by inflation. 'The Teachers' Review Body is not independent and nor is it considering the needs of education. It has bowed to the policies of a government which dislikes public services.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (June 23) TURAN: The State Committee for  property submitted to Milli Mejlis Commissions for Economic  Policy and for Budget Supervision new draft of Privatization  Program. Discussion of the program was to take place three days  ago, but was postponed.    TURAN was told by the source, close to government, that the  main reason of that is due to three various approaches to  privatization program.    The most influential representative of the first trend is  the  parliament's speaker Rasul Guliyev. He stands for mass  privatization, as in Russia. Such approach is motivated by  economic efficiency of such privatization. But supporters of  such approach are widely represented in economic structures, as  well as in authority structures. In case of mass sale of state  property they will become owners of great properties.    Supporters of this approach oppose the monopoly of State  Committee for Property concerning privatization questions.    Representative of the second approach is Prime Minister  Suret  Guseynov. He opposes privatization, referring to continuous  war. But such approach is also explained by the fact, that his  supporters are weakly represented in industry, and for them  privatization would mean loss of positions.    The third approach is reflect in the privatization program  and is protected by State Committee for Property. That approach  provides gradual and stage by stage privatization -- in  1994-1995 privatization of minor enterprises, and beginning from  1996 -- privatization of average enterprises and large  enterprises partially.    In this case social justice is emphasised, and economic  efficiency is on the second place. Such option of the Program  of State Committee for Property was ready a year and a half ago,  when Elchibey was in power.</p>

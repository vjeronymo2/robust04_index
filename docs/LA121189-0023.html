			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORTITUDE PAYS OFF FOR FOURCADE;  </P> <P> NEW ORLEANS: JOURNEYMAN QUARTERBACK LEADS SAINTS TO 22-19 VICTORY.  </P> <P> His journey has been a long and circuitous one through seven cities and three  football leagues.  </P> <P> But 29-year-old John Fourcade -- formerly of the Memphis Showboats, Toronto  Argonauts and Denver Dynamite -- finally made it to the big time Sunday and  responded with a big-time performance.  </P> <P> "I've been around in every league known to man except the European leagues,"  said Fourcade, who led New Orleans to a 22-19 victory over the Buffalo Bills.  "I was just happy to be out there playing today."  </P> <P> Fourcade, whose only other starts came as the Saints' replacement quarterback  during the 1987 strike, threw two touchdown passes, and Dalton Hilliard rushed  for 97 yards and caught a 54-yard touchdown pass. Fourcade started in place of  Bobby Hebert, whom Fourcade replaced last week.  </P> <P> Despite the victory, Philadelphia's 20-10 win over Dallas ended the Saints'  slim playoff hopes.  </P> <P> "We are a good football team," New Orleans linebacker Pat Swilling said. "We  just won't be going to the playoffs to show it."  </P> <P> The loss was Buffalo's second in a row and third in four games. The Bills (8-6)  are repeating their swoon of last season, when they lost three of their final  four regular-season games.  </P> <P> "It's been a horror show," said Bills nose tackle Fred Smerlas. "We've got to  go out and redeem ourselves if we're going to make the playoffs."  </P> <P> The Saints (7-7), who gained 436 total yards, took advantage of Buffalo  turnovers on each of their first two possessions to build a 13-0 lead in the  first quarter, and take a 16-12 lead after a snowy first half.  </P> <P> The snow disappeared in the second half, but the Saints' defense continued to  handle the Bills, getting a timely interception midway in the fourth quarter  that New Orleans eventually turned into the winning field goal.  </P> <P> Toi Cook, beat in the second quarter for a 42-yard touchdown pass caught by  James Lofton, picked off a tipped ball near the Saints' end zone as Buffalo was  driving for a go-ahead score.  </P> <P> "The way (Bills' kicker Scott) Norwood was kicking, that would've been a chip  shot for him," Cook said. "Somebody (Thurman Thomas) tipped the ball and it  just ended up in my hands."  </P> <P> With Fourcade and Hilliard leading the way, the Saints drove 81 yards to the  Buffalo four, setting up a 22-yard field goal by Morten Andersen. Brett Maxie  clinched the victory with New Orleans' third interception of Jim Kelly.  </P> <P> "I'm very proud of them after what has happened the last couple of weeks," said  New Orleans Coach Jim Mora, whose team lost their previous two games by a total  of 10 points. "You have to play pretty good to beat these guys."  </P></p>

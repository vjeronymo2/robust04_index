			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] As suddenly as he had arrived in Gorazde, General  Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, left the town.  During his stay, Gen. Rose had a very brief meeting with Ferid  Buljubasic, commander of the Bosnian Army's eastern Bosnian  operational zone in Gorazde. After being told by the Gorazde  commander that UN forces have not yet fulfilled their duty  regarding the setting up of a demarcation zone 3 km from the  town center, Gen. Rose briefly said this was not right and cut  short the conversation. After this, Gen. Rose visited the almost  destroyed hospital in Gorazde and the UN members in the town.    During Gen. Rose's stay in Gorazde, people from the nearby  villages started gathering outside the UN headquarters. This  protest meeting is still under way, and over 2,000 residents of  Kazagici, Zupcici, Bare, Ugarak, Kokino Selo, [words indistinct]  are demanding to return to their homes as soon as possible--the  homes they left at the height of the chetnik offensive on  Gorazde. This protest meeting--these people here--are yet  another of many proofs that the chetniks have not withdrawn 3 km  from the town center, because that is where the aforementioned  villages are situated.

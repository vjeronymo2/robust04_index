			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Fraud against companies rises THE VALUE of fraud perpetrated against British companies has nearly trebled in five year to more than Pounds 468m in 1992, figures released yesterday by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick show. KPMG's 'fraud barometer' says total reported fraud was Pounds 1.6bn from 1987 to 1992, covering 349 separate incidents. The figures are based on newspaper reports of fraud charges above Pounds 100,000 brought to UK courts. Any case with a not-guilty verdict is removed from the records. Mr Philip Haberman, a partner from the firm's forensic accounting unit, said it was unclear whether the increase represented a jump in the number of frauds or a rise in the level of detection. But he said reported frauds probably represented less than 10 per cent of total frauds. Many companies were reluctant to publicise frauds and others did not have sufficient evidence to bring prosecutions. He said there did not seem to be a particular increase in frauds related to the recession, although a lot more had been revealed as a result of the effects of the recession. The largest amount of fraud in the last five years - nearly a third of the total - was in the banking and finance sectors, such as forged cheques and mortgage fraud. A further 29 per cent were in commercial companies and 15 per cent were against the public, including investors. Other areas included social security and legal aid frauds.  ---------------------------------------------------           UP GOES KPMG's FRAUD BAROMETER  --------------------------------------------------- Victims of fraud                    Amount    Number (1987-1992)                       Pounds m  --------------------------------------------------- Banking and finance                  490       105 Commercial companies                 473        58 Public (including investors)         230        77 Pension funds                        147         2 Inland Revenue/Customs &amp; Excise       99        26 Local &amp; Central government            17        37 Other                                129        31 Not known                             20        13  --------------------------------------------------- Total                              1,605       349  --------------------------------------------------- Source: KPMG Forensic Accounting  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN THE MUSIC STOPPED, A MAN LAY DEAD;  </P> <P> CRIME: DONALD TERNUS WANTED TO SLEEP. ACROSS THE STREET, ANTHONY ORTIZ'S STEREO  WAS BOOMING. TERNUS GOT A RIFLE AND LEFT HIS APARTMENT. ORTIZ WAS KILLED;  TERNUS IS CHARGED WITH HIS MURDER.  </P> <P> Almost as soon as he moved last year to a cul-de-sac apartment on the east side  of Azusa, a mostly Latino neighborhood of low-end rentals and fast-food stands,  Donald Ternus began to wonder if he hadn't made a mistake.  </P> <P> Every weekend, it seemed, the police were making a drug bust on his block.  Gunfire often broke out at night. Sometimes, the 21-year-old warehouse worker  lamented to his roommate, it felt like they were the only two white guys in  town.  </P> <P> Within a few months, Ternus had bought a 12-gauge shotgun, loaded it with  buckshot, and left it cocked under the headboard of his bed. He never thought  of using it to kill anybody, he said. It was just good to have a gun around the  house.  </P> <P> But late one warm summer night at the end of June, provoked by the thump of  loud music across the street and fortified by two six-packs of beer, Ternus  decided to take a stand.  </P> <P> What happened next is at the core of a Pomona Superior Court jury's  deliberations this week. Ternus, who has been held in Los Angeles County jail  without bail since the June 30 incident, says he acted in self-defense. The  district attorney contends that it was murder.  </P> <P> What is undisputed is that Ternus, with his rifle, marched over to the shabby  brown-and-tan apartment building across Glenfinnan Avenue. Anthony Ortiz, 37, a  glass cutter, had lived in Unit C for five years with his wife, Irma, and their  two young daughters.  </P> <P> "Me, myself and I . . . Me, myself and I," pumped the dance tune from Ortiz's  stereo. Ternus, shouting obscenities, called for him to turn it down.  Obscenities were hurled back.  </P> <P> By the time the shooting was over, Ortiz lay face down in a puddle of blood,  his stomach and skull ripped open by two blasts from Ternus' gun. Ortiz's  cousin, Jeffrey Mora, who had ridden a bus down from Northern California for a  family reunion the next day, was wounded in both hands, his arm and groin. A  friend, Joe Rodriguez, who had come over to drink a beer, took a lead pellet in  the nose.  </P> <P> "I never even thought of killing a person," Ternus testified this week. "I was  just trying to prevent a physical confrontation. . . . I didn't think they  would mess with somebody who had a gun."  </P> <P> But Deputy Dist. Atty. Ingrid Uhler, who Wednesday concluded her case for  murder, attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon, contends that Ternus  acted more as a vigilante.  </P> <P> "He thought he was doing Azusa a favor by getting rid of these . . . Mexicans,"  Uhler said in her closing arguments. "He's thinking, 'They can't run me, they  can't run this neighborhood.' . . . He thought at that point he was king of the  mountain."  </P> <P> For Ortiz, a hulking man who weighed in at more than 300 pounds, it was a  weekend of celebration. He had spent the afternoon in El Monte, for his  mother's 61st birthday. Then he returned to his apartment, where he continued  to relax on the balcony, listening to the radio and sipping a rum and Coke.  </P> <P> His party days, however, were long gone, his wife said. Ever since their first  daughter was born seven years ago, he had done everything for his family. His  business of fitting windows in high-rise buildings was picking up. He cooked  and cleaned around the house. And the big reunion planned for July 1, the fifth  straight summer that all 200 members of his extended family would be getting  together, meant the world to him.  </P> <P> "It was a special, special occasion for us," Mora, 22, said. "Everybody was  happy and laughing."  </P> <P> Ternus had been having a fine night too. A husky man with reddish hair parted  in the middle, he had come home in the early afternoon from his job loading  trucks at an electronics and appliance warehouse. He had no plans for the  evening, until a friend dropped by and proposed they head to the Orange County  Fairgrounds to see a motocross race.  </P> <P> When he was dropped off at his apartment shortly after midnight, Ternus' ears  were still ringing from the roar of the engines and he was pleasantly buzzed  from what he guessed were about a dozen beers. The only problem would be  getting up at 5 or 6 the next morning to go to work.  </P> <P> Then, standing there in his driveway, he realized that it was going to be even  harder than he thought. Loud music and shouting were pouring out of a  neighbor's apartment across the street.  </P> <P> "Hey, cut down the noise," he remembers hollering to them. They shouted back an  obscenity, he says, punctuated by the epithet "white boy."  </P> <P> He yelled something else and walked back to his apartment. He took off his  shoes and socks, lit a cigarette and shut the window. It didn't help. He  thought about calling the police but said he feared that the neighbors might  pay him back with slashed tires.  </P> <P> "I was thinking, 'I really don't want to go over there,' " said Ternus, dressed  in court in a dark blue blazer, white shirt and matching hankie. "The way these  guys talked to me, it didn't seem like a smart thing to do."  </P> <P> But Ternus, whose father taught him to fire a gun when he was 6, decided to go  anyway. He grabbed the rifle, which he had used to shoot skeet the weekend  before, and walked barefoot with the gun diagonally across his chest with the  barrel pointed up.  </P> <P> "Not intending to use it," his lawyer, Robert D. Chatterton, said, "but to  protect himself, so he wouldn't get attacked."  </P> <P> The perspective from the Ortiz balcony, however, was not the same.  </P> <P> "He was cussing, saying the music was too loud -- which it wasn't," Rodriguez,  43, said. "We were wondering what had happened. Everybody was, like, stunned."  </P> <P> There was some shouting back and forth, then Rodriguez, Ortiz and his other  cousin, David Mora, 27, left the balcony and ran down the steps to the  sidewalk. Only Jeffrey Mora stayed up above.  </P> <P> "I just kept my eye on this guy," he said. "In case something went down."  </P> <P> According to Ternus, the three men split up and began to circle him, with  Ortiz, walking slowly, his gaze transfixed on him, approaching down the middle.  Ternus said he kept looking back and forth, convinced that at any moment one of  them would jump at him and wrestle the gun away.  </P> <P> He said he told them not to come toward him. But they continued to approach.  Then he felt something hit the gun -- a beer bottle he thinks, possibly hurled  from the balcony.  </P> <P> "I was scared," he said. "I didn't know what was happening. I couldn't imagine  that somebody would come toward a person with a gun in his hands."  </P> <P> The Mora brothers and Rodriguez, however, testified that they tried to calm  Ternus down. He pointed the gun at David Mora, who fled. Then Ortiz approached  him, his hands outstretched.  </P> <P> "Hey, put away the gun," Jeffrey Mora heard him say. "You don't need it. We can  work this out."  </P> <P> Ternus said he heard no such thing. He thought Ortiz was lunging at him. He was  sure somebody else was sneaking up from behind.  </P> <P> He squeezed the trigger and ripped a hole in Ortiz's abdomen. Ternus said he  doesn't remember shooting him again, but a second shot, probably fired while  Ortiz was either collapsing or already lying face down, blew away the right  side of his head.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Mora had descended the stairs, and Ternus fired at him three times as  Mora ran. Rodriguez was hiding behind a van on the street. Ternus said he  thought he saw something in his hand. He aimed at the car window and fired at  him through the glass.  </P> <P> Then he went back to his apartment, lit a cigarette, opened a beer and waited.  When police arrived, he refused to come out for more than 15 minutes, fearful  that they would gun him down.  </P> <P> "They had the gall to ruin the good evening of David Ternus, so he was going to  take matters into his own hands," Uhler said. "He's the aggressor. He's the one  who is seeking a fight. He doesn't have the right of self-defense."  </P> <P> Chatterton, however, argued that Ortiz had a history of aggression. As a young  man, Ortiz had been involved in a barroom brawl. A few years later, he was  convicted of a strong-arm robbery in a tavern parking lot. And just last  summer, he had pleaded guilty to inflicting cruel punishment on a child, after  he had grabbed a neighbor's 3-year-old boy who had spit on his daughter and  held him so that his little girl could spit back. She refused.  </P> <P> But Ortiz's mother, Mary Dixon, said those were the unfortunate incidents that  always seemed to befall her son. As a child, youngsters in the neighborhood  used to beat him up. In high school, he dropped out because the principal  wouldn't allow him to wear his shirt untucked -- a habit he had developed to  hide his growing girth.  </P> <P> "Tony was a sweet, gentle boy, but he was a big guy," she said. "I always  wondered if that's why people picked on him. He always seemed to be in the  wrong place at the wrong time."  </P></p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): A clean job of it - A laundry owner's experience of working with Investors in People During the first holiday David Coulter took after founding his laundry business, Stalbridge Linen Services, he read a book on management by Peter Drucker. To Coulter, a boot-strapping entrepreneur who began his business washing pub tea towels in London launderettes, Drucker was merely re-stating the obvious. 'You talk to the customers and find out what they want and provide it. And if it goes wrong, you find out why and sort it out,' says Coulter. Without knowing it, Coulter says he had been applying much of this theory as he grew his business in Dorset to Pounds 6m of sales and a workforce of 200 people. It was therefore a rude shock when he applied for Investors in People, a government-sponsored programme set up in 1990 to boost training and management development in the UK. Instead of sailing through to IIP recognition, Coulter found his management team fell well short of the mark. The production side of the laundry - sorting, washing, pressing and packing  -passed with flying colours. But in frank conversations with the consultant who helped implement the IIP programme, Coulter was told his management relied on firefighter decision-making, rather than foresight and planning, and that there was considerable scope for improving com-munication among the team. 'We had senior managers who were relying on experience and know-how from the past and were not looking to improve themselves or inspire the people underneath them,' Coulter says. 'The attitude had to change.' Driving down a narrow Dorset lane shortly after starting the IIP programme, Coulter recognised his problem. Like the traffic building up behind two dawdling cars, the pace of Stalbridge's progress was being dictated by its slowest managers. He fired the entire management team and made them reapply for their jobs. Nine months later, in May this year, Stalbridge won IIP recognition. Most of its managers got jobs back in different areas. But responsibility is now more effectively delegated, training systems are better documented and the management team has been allowed to grow now that it has been freed of the influence of managers who did not encourage personal development, Coulter says. His early scepticism about the IIP programme is not uncommon. He approached the exercise thinking it would be a good marketing tool but otherwise with low expectations. The surprise at discovering that IIP has real benefits is also not unusual. According to Mark Spilsbury, senior research fellow at the Institute of Employment Studies at Sussex University, a growing number of case studies suggest the IIP programme is achieving its aims. 'Unusually in our evaluations of government initiatives, the response has been quite astonishingly positive,' Spilsbury says, based on the early stage of an evaluation he is conducting. 'Employers certainly liked it (IIP) and thought it had made an impact on how they had done their training and development and thought it would filter through and benefit the bottom line.' He believes IIP opens up channels of communication and will eventually increase businesses' chances of surviving and growing. 'It gets them (managers) focusing on their business needs,' he says. 'It goes all the way through from the mission statement, the business plan and training plan linked to that. For some companies that is quite new stuff.' The IIP programme is funded by the department for employment and administered through the Training and Enterprise Councils which market it to local companies. Some companies qualify for a subsidy from the Tec. Dorset Tec paid about half the cost of Stalbridge's IIP consultant but the expense of implementing the programme still came to Pounds 30,000, Coulter says. Companies that seek the standard must agree to training all employees towards specified corporate objectives; they must regularly review training and development needs and identify the necessary resources in their business plans. They must train employees when they are recruited and evaluate subsequent training and development and revise their targets. The government's intention is that half the companies with more than 200 employees should have achieved IIP recognition by 1996. More than 350 companies are already recognised as Investors in People and 2,800 are on the way to achieving recognition - this is about 35 per cent of companies with more than 200 employees. But is there any proof that IIP works? 'I would say there is plenty of evidence, though not proof, of improvements,' says Mary Chapman, chief executive of Investors in People UK, a government-supported body promoting the IIP programme. 'There is reduced absenteeism and staff turnover and tangible improved productivity, reduced waste and increased profitability.' Bringing in outside consultants is not easy for any entrepreneur, particularly one like Coulter who has taken an unconventional route. Coulter and his then wife had decided to move to Dorset before they had any idea that they would start a laundry business. 'We thought of opening a shop but we didn't have enough capital and had to fall back on our experience and what we knew best,' says Coulter. Having started and subsequently bought a local laundry business, Coulter proved it was possible to build a thriving business in an industry where there were relatively low bars to entry. Coulter knew he had to change from an entrepreneurial to a professional management style. But the IIP programme exposed him to some blunt criticism. 'A customer once said I was an autocrat trying to be a democrat,' Coulter says. The IIP consultant was broadly of the same opinion. 'I am having to learn to delegate and by delegation I mean you have to train people to develop themselves,' Coulter says. He is also worried about losing his contact with customers, the basis for the growth of his business. 'The process is supposed to be getting us closer to customers,' he says. 'Some people are getting closer but others, like me, are getting more removed.' He is having to learn to let his management team take the reins. No doubt, now that he has recognised this need he will read a management tract that tells him entrepreneurs need to let go if their businesses are to grow.</p>

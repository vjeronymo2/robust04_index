			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVAL PATROL BOAT SUNK IN LATEST BOMBING IN SPAIN  </P> <P> A bomb sank a Spanish naval patrol boat anchored in San Sebastian harbor Friday  in the second bombing incident in the city in less than 24 hours.  </P> <P> Police said no one was injured in the blast on the 30-foot boat, which had been  evacuated after Red Cross officials received an anonymous early morning warning  by telephone.  </P> <P> Explosives experts rushed to the scene, but the bomb went off before they  arrived. Police did not know the size of the bomb.  </P> <P> Police Thursday defused a powerful parcel bomb sent to the head of the Civil  Guard in Spain's northern province of Guipuzcoa.  </P> <P> They said the bomb, containing 2.4 pounds of explosives, was hidden among  geography books sent to Lt. Col. Enrique Rodriguez Galindo from Madrid.  </P> <P> No one claimed responsibility for either of the bombs, which follow a wave of  letter and parcel bomb attacks on judicial and government officials this year  by ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) separatists.  </P></p>

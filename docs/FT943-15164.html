			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Bonn's EU agenda likely to be opposed by UK The new German presidency of the European Union appears to be on course for a collision with the UK after making clear it intends to try to enact the remaining labour market and workers' rights measures in the EU's Social Charter. Mr Norbert Blum, Germany's labour minister, presented the proposals in a paper to EU labour and social affairs ministers in Dortmund at the weekend. They are intended to set the social policy tone for the German presidency, Foremost among the measures Germany will push for are: stalled directives extending the rights of full-time employees to part-time workers; widening parental leave rights; regulating the rights and obligations of employees working outside their own country; and reversing the burden of proof in sex discrimination cases - from the complainant to the employer. The UK, wholly or partly, opposes all these measures, which Germany has placed high on the agendas of Council of Labour Ministers' meetings in September and December. Mr Michael Forsyth, Britain's junior employment minister, said after the meeting that 'we made it pretty clear we don't want more along the lines of the social action programme' derived from the European Commission's 1989 Social Charter. 'We are not in favour of regulating pay and conditions and we're not going to change that.' Chairing the first, informal ministerial meeting of the German presidency in his Dortmund constituency on Saturday, Mr Blum evoked the spirit of the French Revolution, still incomplete, he suggested, in its ideals of equality and fraternity. Mr Blum underlined the gulf on social policy between the UK and its partners, declaring: 'Europe will either be a social Europe - a Europe of the masses - or it will be no Europe at all.' The UK may resort to its opt-out from the Maastricht social chapter to avoid being bound by most of the directives Germany wants to advance. But on part-time work, it could face difficulties following the recent House of Lords ruling requiring equal statutory treatment of part-time and full-time workers. Mr Blum's discussion paper emphasises the principle of subsidiarity, whereby the EU should not do what member states can do better. It stresses the need for better training, more flexible labour markets, and a crackdown on the black economy. The document spells out, however, that 'an essential aspect' of the flexible labour market idea seized on by the UK was the part-time workers and parental leave directives.</p>

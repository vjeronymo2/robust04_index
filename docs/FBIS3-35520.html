			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, 25 Feb (MENA)--Faruq Qaddumi, the head of the  PLO Political Department, has condemned the Israeli massacre  today in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.    He said the world today is witnessing a new cycle in a  series  of Israeli crimes inside the occupied territories at a time when  Rabin is taking no action. Instead, he encourages such  massacres by not punishing the perpetrators.    In a statement today, Qaddumi said that Rabin uses the  pretext of protecting Israeli security to postpone the date of  the withdrawal of his military forces from the occupied  Palestinian territories. He allows no international force to  enter the occupied territories to end the abuse by the Israeli  settlers, which threatens the chances of peace and security in  the region and prolongs the struggle.    He noted that Yitzhaq Rabin, who insists on Israeli  security,  talks cold-bloodedly about these fierce and heinous massacres.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Conversion costs leave Budgens lower Budgens, the small food retailing chain 29.4 per cent owned by Rewe, the private German food retailer, yesterday reported pre-tax profits down Pounds 17,000 at Pounds 3.05m for the 28 weeks to November 7. The figure was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 618,000 for the conversion of nine Budgens stores into Penny Market outlets. In the comparable period there were store closure costs of Pounds 250,000. At the trading level, profits rose 10 per cent, from Pounds 4.16m to Pounds 4.56m. The shares eased 1p to 41p. Mr John von Spreckelsen, chief executive, said that 1993 had been a difficult year for food retailing with margins under pressure throughout the period. However, he was pleased that trading margins improved from 2.7 to 3.01 per cent in the six months. Turnover slipped 1.6 per cent to Pounds 151.8m (Pounds 154.2m), though the nine converted stores had been closed for an average four weeks each during conversion. In April, Rewe, which has a chain of 1,800 Penny-Markt discount food stores, bought a 26.3 per cent stake from BIL Securities (Far East) for Pounds 23.5m. It has since raised its stake. In October it underwrote the Pounds 30m issue of 5 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock 2003, subscribing Pounds 28.9m to the issue. If Rewe decides to convert at the first conversion date of September 1 1995, it will raise its holding to 46.2 per cent of Budgens' equity. The proceeds were used for expansion of the Penny Market chain. Mr von Spreckelsen said there would be no more store conversions, only new building. Some 40 in total are planned in the two years from last November. Earnings were a same-again 1.5p per share, and the group has resumed the payment of interim dividends with 0.3p this time.</p>

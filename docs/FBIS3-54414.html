			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 Jan (MENA)-- Shaykh Fahim Bin-Sultan al-  Qasimi, secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC],  has affirmed that the Arab boycott of Israel will continue until  the original causes for it have been removed and Israel has  withdrawn from all the occupied Arab territories. He noted that  the bilateral boycott [muqata'ah thuna'iyah] can be ended  gradually if progress is made on the basis of goodwill  initiatives.    At a press conference he held this afternoon on the  sidelines  of the second international conference on challenges facing the  Arab world amid world changes, Shaykh al-Qasimi said that there  is no fear of Israeli penetration of Gulf markets if a  comprehensive peace is achieved. He remarked that the GCC  states will not be a "piece of cake" for Israel.    On the GCC stand on Iran's occupation of Tunb al-Sughra,  Tunb  al- Kubra, and Abu-Musa--the three islands of the United Arab  Emirates-- al-Qasimi pointed out that the GCC will refer the  matter to international organizations if Iran and the Emirates  do not resolve the dispute.    Asked about the varying stands the GCC states adopted on  Iraq  and Iran, al-Qasimi emphasized that the GCC summit resolutions  on these matters are binding to all members. He pointed out  that varying views do not mean that these states are divided.  Each state is entitled to its own views and what counts is for  all these views to serve the GCC's interests, he said. He added  that any contact between a Gulf state and either Iran or Iraq is  in the GCC states' interest because these contacts seek  solutions to the problems involving these two states.    On the GCC stance on borders among Gulf states, Shaykh Fahim  remarked that the GCC is not a unique case and that these  matters are on their way to a solution.    Answering a question on increasing the number of the  Peninsula Shield troops, al-Qasimi stated that the GCC has  agreed to increase the troops from 8,000 to 17,000 and to  develop united military and communication systems.    Shaykh al-Qasimi added that the Gulf states must develop a  common vision of cooperation. He also said that the Damascus  Declaration leaves defense cooperation between Gulf states and  both Egypt and Syria up to each individual state.    Al-Qasimi answered a question on the visit the Omani energy  minister paid to European and East Asian states to negotiate a  reduction in oil output. He said the visit produced encouraging  results and that he received a report from the Omani minister,  affirming that the responses were very reassuring. He remarked  that a reasonable reduction in the oil output will contribute to  price stability.</p>

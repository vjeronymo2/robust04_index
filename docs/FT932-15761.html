			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Militant seeks control of Civil Service union THE MILITANT Tendency, the Marxist group, is trying to win control of Britain's largest Civil Service union, the 125,000-strong Civil and Public Service Association. In the past Militant was quick to deny that it was an organised faction in the union. Now, for the first time, it has launched a public campaign for power in the union's annual elections. Postal voting starts on Monday for the union's presidency and vice-presidency, as well as for all 18 seats on its executive council. There is growing concern among the present moderate leadership that Militant is poised for victory. Results will be announced on May 10 at the union's annual conference. Mr Barry Reambottom, the union's general secretary, said yesterday: 'The union is in serious danger of being captured by extremists. The Militant is campaigning openly for power in a way it has never done before.' Mr Reambottom said Militant was in a 'resurgent and buoyant' mood. 'I am deeply concerned that, because of the many difficulties our members face, the Militant has an ideal opportunity to exploit the great reservoir of discontent in their favour.' In a leaflet published last week, Militants in the union said they were 'openly playing a leading role' in the election campaign and had 'initiated calls for a united opposition to the current union leadership'. 'This has resulted in an electoral alliance on the basis of opposition to the government's 1.5 per cent pay ceiling and market testing and in defence of union democracy,' it says. The leaflet adds: 'Faced with large-scale threats to jobs through privatisation and a virtual pay freeze recommended by the current moderate leadership of the union, CPSA members increasingly are turning to the broad left in which Militant Labour supporters openly play a leading role, for an alternative leadership.' It claims the broad left has almost three times as many branch nominations as the moderate incumbents and suggests it is 'heading for a landslide victory'. Mr Larry O'Callaghan, head of the union's Home Office section and an executive committee candidate, said: 'Militant supporters are proud and open about our socialist beliefs. It is precisely because of factors such as low pay and the inability of the current leadership to do anything about it that members are increasingly looking for a more positive leadership.' Mr Phil Marston, a Militant member of the union, said: 'Politics do not come into it. More and more people are supporting us because we are prepared to stand up and do something about their complaints.' In a leaflet the moderate union president Mrs Marion Chambers urges union members not to allow the Militants to use them as a 'political battering ram'. She faces a serious challenge from Mr Albert Astbury, a self-proclaimed independent who heads the broad left list.</p>

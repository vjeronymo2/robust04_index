			<p>BFN     [Text] During their formal meeting at Government House  today, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and Australian Prime  Minister Paul Keating discussed expanding bilateral trade and  investment cooperation and promoting free trade practices.    Aphisit Wetchachiwa, spokesman of the Prime Minister's  Office, disclosed that in addition to trade and investment  policies, the Australian side expressed its desire to use  Thailand as an aviation center for Qantas Airlines. The Thai  side asked the Australian delegation to protect Thai products  which have difficulties when imported to Australia and those  products which were once accused of market dumping by asking  Australia to use various cautious measures. Aphisit said:    [Begin recording] Besides bilateral issues, the two sides  exchanged views extensively on how to use the multilateral  cooperation framework to serve the two countries' trade,  investment, and economic interests. In particular, the two  sides have recognized the important role of the economic  cooperation forums such as the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation, or APEC, and discussed possible ways to further  expand cooperation in different areas. They discussed the  possibility of linking economic cooperation between the ASEAN  Free Trade Area and the economic cooperation zone, the so-called  CER, of which Australia and New Zealand are members. This issue  has never been brought up for official discussion previously.  However, both the Thai and Australian sides agreed that further  actions must be taken in this regard. Thailand itself can bring  up this matter during ASEAN meetings, while Australia seeks  consultations with New Zealand as well as members of ASEAN, AFTA  [ASEAN Free Trade Area], and other groupings. Multilateral  economic cooperation itself is very significant. The two sides  agreed that it is a framework that can effectively prevent and  discourage any country from resorting to unilateral trade  measures which threaten and cause damage to the economies of  others. Moreover, the stability is also a byproduct of  multilateral cooperation. Despite the end of the Cold War, the  two sides deemed it necessary to continue consultations on the  security issue. [end recording]    Speaking to reporters during an interview after the meeting,  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak disclosed that the  two sides agreed to turn APEC into a multilateral economic  cooperation grouping. Suphachai said:    [Begin Suphachai recording] We discussed multilateral  cooperation with APEC. The Australian side reiterated its  concern over this issue. It noted that the United States is  moving toward multilateral cooperation and that this is the  right move. A multilateral basis means many countries are  involved in any agreement. Australia does not want the United  States to resort to bilateral actions similar to what it is  doing with Japan. Therefore, Australia asks Thailand to help to  build up the strength of APEC because APEC was established with  support from U.S. politicians and economists who support the  principle of multilateral trade. They do not want to see APEC  lay idle for fear that certain elements in the United States  might turn to practicing trade harassment on a unilateral basis.  Prime Minister Chuan reaffirmed that Thailand has always  supported and wants to see a strong APEC. However, he suggested  that APEC apply GATT agreements as soon as possible and try to  comply with GATT rules. He also noted that APEC members are not  equally developed like countries in the European Union. This  issue must also be considered. [end recording]</p>

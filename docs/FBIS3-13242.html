			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salih Rajab] </F>   [Excerpts] Hundreds of people were wounded and hundreds of  others were detained as a result of the security forces' savage  suppression of the uprising of the angry Egyptian people in  protest against the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The Interior  Ministry last week mobilized tens of thousands of central  security and antiterrorism forces to suppress the popular  demonstrations, which started from the universities, mosques,  and trade union headquarters. These forces used extremely  sophisticated weapons, including modern tear gas canister  launchers, which have a range double that of the older type.  The type of the canisters used is also more effective than the  other tear gas canisters, as they cause serious inflammation to  the stomach's mucous membrane and to the respiratory system.  The rest of the repression arsenal included rubber bullets,  shotgun cartridges, and electric clubs [al-'usi al- kahraba'iyah.    More than 1,000 people, most of them students, were arrested  last week. They were all charged with illegal gathering and  rioting and then most of them were released. The number of  people injured exceeded 800, most of them students. At Cairo  University the number of injured up to last Thursday was 116  male and female students. Ten people were seriously wounded,  most of them as a result of shotgun pellets. Some of them said  they were wounded inside the university campus. [passage omitted]    The situation at 'Ayn Shams University was no better than at  Cairo University. The police opened fire with shotguns from  close range at the demonstrators, seriously wounding a large  number of students. Some of them lost their sight as a result  of shotgun pellets. The 'Ayn Shams hospital received 60 wounded  students up to last Thursday. Thirty others were admitted to  the Dar al-Shifa' hospital.</p>

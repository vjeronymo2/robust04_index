			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Hooked by Holbein - Art The whole trend of my education was academic, which I do not regret in the least, but there rode with it the unquestioned assumption that its natural end would be at the university. Art in the 1950s was at best a marginal business, not a waste of time exactly, but most certainly a distraction were one supposed capable of higher things. Even the history of Art was but the stuff of those general discussion and appreciation sessions, set to broaden and civilise the Sixth-Form mind a notch or two, but nothing more. But I grew up in Windsor, and the Castle was always, even in term, a place of regular resort. Out along the North Terrace, between the inevitable queue for the Queen's Dolls' House on the one hand, and entry to the State Apartments on the other, was no queue at all but only a sign to the Old Master Drawings. A whispered request to the attendant and payment of the necessary sixpence, or was it a shilling, and the cord was unhooked and I was let through into the quiet gallery and its Claudes and Poussins, Sandbys and Leonardos, above its Holbeins. Those images of Sir Thomas More and his family, and the somewhat later group centred upon the Court of Henry VIII, drawn to the life yet with an elegance and economy that still takes the breath away across the centuries, are as familiar to me as any. What is more to the point, they are the very first that I ever recognised directly as true and profound works or art. I can still see myself standing before them in the dappled sunshine that filtered through the room that spring afternoon of nearly 40 years ago, and thinking: well, there is more to life than the History of France under the Second Empire, and more to Art than my Shakespeare text. There may not be better, but there other things, other kinds, other ways. The pick of those Royal Holbeins was shown at the Scottish National Gallery through the summer, and comes to the National Portrait Gallery in London early in the New Year. I shall go along again, of course, to say hello.</p>

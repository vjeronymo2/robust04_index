			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Rivers face 'aesthetic test' THE National Rivers Authority has proposed that rivers, lakes and estuaries should be assessed on their pleasant appearance and ability to support aquatic life, as well as by the chemical tests used in the past. The authority, which is responsible under the 1989 Water Act for setting water quality standards in England and Wales, yesterday made its proposals to the government, drawing on more than 160 responses to its December 1991 consultation paper. It proposes that rivers and estuaries be classified by use: fisheries; drinking water; agricultural or industrial supply; water sports; and nature conservation. Surveys every five years would test the chemical, biological, nutrient and aesthetic state of the water. Dr Jan Pentreath, the authority's chief scientist, said: 'Water should be improved locally on the basis of what it is to be used for. At the same time, it is essential to have the national picture in order to assess value for money.' The authority's report follows rising concern about the increasing cost to water companies of meeting new environmental regulation, and the effect on customers' bills. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said it was concerned that 'The government's fear over rising water bills will compromise the implementation of the new statutory water quality objectives'.</p>

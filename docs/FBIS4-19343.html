			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The day before the Federal  Constitutional Court hearing on Bundeswehr missions abroad  begins, Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed that Germany must take  responsibility alongside its partners. Germany should not stand  aside when "peace and freedom in the world and Europe" are at  stake, Kohl said this morning in Bonn at a reception for  servicemen who have taken part in humanitarian and peace  missions.    The chancellor recalled that Germany's security and its  ability to act in foreign policy terms are based on the trust of  its allies. Therefore, Germany must be "a reliable partner."  The Bundeswehr's participation in "measures to safeguard world  peace as part of the international community" is a key issue of  German foreign and security policy, he said.</p>

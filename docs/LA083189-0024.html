			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INTERNAL DISCIPLINE BY TORRANCE POLICE EXCELLENT, WITNESS SAYS IN CRASH TRIAL  </P> <P> A former deputy chief with the Riverside Police Department testified Wednesday  that the Torrance Police Department conducts excellent internal affairs  investigations and disciplines its officers appropriately.  </P> <P> Mervin Feinstein rebutted allegations by a San Pedro family in a civil trial in  Los Angeles Superior Court that Torrance police condone and cover up  misconduct, particularly incidents linked to excessive drinking.  </P> <P> "It just isn't there," Feinstein said of the plaintiffs' case against the  Torrance police. "There is no widespread cover-up or ratification of employees  . . . who might not properly record their investigation or report what is going  on. . . . They don't sweep it under the carpet."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called to Testify  </P> <P> Feinstein retired from the Riverside department last year and is now a private  consultant and administrator with the California Peace Officers Assn.  </P> <P> He was called to testify on behalf of the Torrance Police Department and nine  officers named in a lawsuit filed in 1984 by John and Geraldine Rastello of San  Pedro. The Rastellos claim that off-duty Torrance police Sgt. Rollo Green was  driving drunk and caused the traffic collision that killed their 19-year-old  son, Kelly. Their lawsuit also alleges that fellow officers covered up for  Green as part of a pattern of concealing misdeeds by police.  </P> <P> Feinstein told the jury that his opinions were based on an impartial review of  more than 500 internal affairs files from the Torrance Police Department. But,  during cross-examination, one of the Rastellos' lawyers, Brian Panish,  attempted to paint Feinstein as a friend of the Torrance police who would never  take a stand against a fellow officer.  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, Torrance's own internal affairs investigators defended  their work under Panish's harsh cross-examination.  </P> <P> The defense is expected to rest its case today, five years and one day after  Kelly Rastello died in the collision with Green. Final arguments in the  5-week-old trial are scheduled for Tuesday.  </P> <P> Feinstein opened his testimony by criticizing a former Los Angeles Police  Department deputy chief who was called by the plaintiffs two weeks ago. Lou  Reiter, the former LAPD official, told the jury that Torrance police received  little or no punishment for alcohol-related misconduct, creating an atmosphere  in which excessive drinking was condoned.  </P> <P> Reiter focused on 11 alcohol-related cases in which he said Torrance police  only once sought criminal charges and only once took a blood-alcohol reading.  But Feinstein called that information misleading, saying that in most cases the  Torrance officers were not subject to chemical blood testing because they had  not been driving. And in many of the cases, criminal charges were not filed  because the victims did not want to go to court or because the incidents took  place outside the city's jurisdiction, Feinstein told the jury.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rehabilitation Favored  </P> <P> The Torrance Police Department has a wise policy of trying to salvage officers  involved with alcohol by offering them rehabilitation programs instead of  suspensions, Feinstein said.  </P> <P> The policy was designed to prevent relapses, Feinstein told the jury.  </P> <P> But Panish countered that incidents involving Officer Donald Mason show that  departmental policy is ineffective.  </P> <P> While questioning Feinstein, Panish said Mason was told that he could enter an  alcohol treatment program after he brandished a gun in a bar in 1982. Two years  later, Mason was reportedly drinking when he crashed into three parked cars as  he was driving home, Panish said, recounting previous testimony.  </P> <P> Panish also asked Feinstein if he had been told that the Torrance Police  Department did not adopt a program to assist alcoholics until 1986, a decade  after most other police departments. Feinstein said he did not know that.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crackdown on Drinking  </P> <P> The former Riverside official testified that he did not find an excessive  number of alcohol-related complaints against Torrance police officers. After  one 1979 incident, he said, the department cracked down on officers drinking in  public after hours.  </P> <P> Torrance Sgt. Greg Fahnestockand five officers gathered in a parking lot after  work to drink beer, a custom known in police circles as "choir practice,"  Feinstein testified. He told the jury that the officers continued their  drinking in the stairway of a public building. "They had an attack of dumb, as  we say in the business," Feinstein said.  </P> <P> Feinstein said that when Fahnestock received a three-day suspension, it "sent a  very strong message to younger officers, saying that tenure or rank is not  going to get you off the hook." The other officers received written reprimands.  </P> <P> After the incident, the department approved a regulation outlawing choir  practice, Feinstein said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Showed Toughness  </P> <P> A thorough investigation in another case involving a ranking officer also  showed the department's toughness, Feinstein said. An internal report showed  that Lt. Henry Pupkoff took an accident report himself, in violation of  department policy, after he was involved in a minor collision in 1979.  </P> <P> Follow-up investigation by another officer showed that Pupkoff had not  accurately recorded statements by witnesses to the crash, Feinstein told the  jury.  </P> <P> The accident was minor enough that it could have been brushed aside, but the  department chose to perform a full internal investigation, which led to Pupkoff  being counseled against taking reports in incidents in which he had personal  involvement, Feinstein said.  </P> <P> On cross-examination by Panish, Feinstein conceded that he cannot recall ever  testifying against a police officer in a civil case.  </P> <P> Feinstein made another concession to the plaintiffs: He said he sees no  objection to police departments that order officers to take blood-alcohol tests  when they have been accused of misconduct while drinking. Torrance police  officials have testified that a policy would violate officers' rights and  produce test results that would not be admissible in criminal cases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Continued Testimony  </P> <P> Earlier, Torrance Deputy Police Chief Jim Popp resumed the stand Monday to  continue testimony that began last Friday.  </P> <P> Popp said last week that the supervisor of a Police Department program for  troubled teen-agers had been forced to resign after one of his former clients  accused him of using drugs and keeping child pornography in his apartment.  </P> <P> Popp added Monday that the former client also accused Juvenile Deversion  Program Coordinator Tom Heitmann of sexually molesting him.  </P> <P> When officers searched Heitmann's apartment, they found three or four ounces of  marijuana and a film of the teen-age boy masturbating, Popp told the jury.  </P> <P> Although Heitmann resigned immediately, Popp testified that criminal charges  could not be filed on the alleged molestation because the three-year statute of  limitations had expired. In an interview after his testimony, Popp said he does  not know why criminal drug charges were not filed against Heitmann.  </P> <P> Heitmann did not return several telephone calls.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 111 Complaints  </P> <P> On Monday, John Rastello's lawyers produced a Police Department report that  showed discipline was imposed only once as a result of 111 complaints made by  the public in 1984 and 1985.  </P> <P> Popp conceded that claims against police officers are sustained much more often  when they are made by fellow officers rather than by private citizens.  </P> <P> But Popp testified that the 1984-85 report is deceiving because it does not  account for officers who were disciplined even before the public filed  complaints against them.  </P></p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Observer: Happy baptism Norman Lamont's spring trip to Washington, away from the worries of Westminster and Notting Hill, obviously did him the world of good. By the end of the proceedings when most finance ministers have that numbed look that goes with listening to endless set speeches, the chancellor was beaming and bouncy. Luckily, he did not have to suffer the ignominy of the usual sterling crisis that always seems to coincide with IMF meetings. But another reason was the chancellor's elevation to near hero status among the Germans. 'The toast of Bonn' was how one over-enthusiastic German observer described Lamont. The chancellor won this unlikely accolade after standing firm with Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, in resisting US pressure for lower interest rates. He also earned some useful brownie points by making hawkish noises against inflation and stressing the need for a strong D-Mark in tones that could have come from Bundesbank president Karl Otto Pohl.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Observer: Corporate largesse What do elderly business tycoons talk about at lunch? According to Melvyn Marckus, City editor of The Times, Lonrho's Tiny Rowland and Harrods boss Mohamed Fayed were lunching together last week when the conversation turned to the subject of penis transplants. According to a report in The Times, Fayed told Rowland that he had asked the Mayo clinic in the US whether he could have a 'larger penis'. Since Melvyn Marckus used to work for Rowland as City editor of the Observer (before Lonrho sold it to The Guardian), presumably he would not misquote his former boss. Those who know Fayed well are not surprised by such a line of conversation. However, one wonders what members of the royal family and other patrons of Harrods make of such talk? Poor old Gerald Ratner only had to admit that some of his jewellery was 'crap' and his career was cut short.</p>

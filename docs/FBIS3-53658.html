			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nehama Doweq] </F>   [Text] A majority of the Israeli public supports the  establishment of a Palestinian state with clear and agreed-upon  borders. Among Labor voters, there is a majority for abandoning  settlements in Judaea and Samaria in return for a peace  agreement. These two facts emerge from a public opinion poll by  the research institute of Hanokh and Rafi Smith conducted for  Labor.    The poll results show that 47 percent of the Israeli public  support the establishment of a Palestinian state, while 40  percent oppose this and 13 percent abstain. Among Likud  supporters, 38 percent favor of the idea, and 54 percent oppose  it.    Distribution of stands among Labor supporters is as follows:  67 percent are for the establishment of a Palestinian state; and  23 percent are against. After studying the data, the  researchers conclude that Likud supporters will agree to the  establishment of a Palestinian state, provided it has  agreed-upon and clear borders.    The poll reveals a surprising fact regarding the readiness  to  leave settlements under foreign sovereignty in Judaea and  Samaria -- there is only a 6-percent gap between the stands: 40  percent accept this, while 46 percent oppose.    In this case too, there is a different distribution of  stands  between Labor and Likud supporters: 65 percent of the Likud  supporters oppose the idea, while 70 percent of the Labor voters  are willing to accept it.    The poll, conducted at the end of December among a  representative sample of the Jewish population in Israel, also  shows that only 30 percent want to end the talks with the PLO at  once, while 51 percent want to see the process proceed, though  cautiously.    Some 33 percent have a positive view of and no reservations  about the Oslo agreement, while 21 percent believe that although  the agreement is good, it will not bring peace.    Most of those polled, both Labor and Likud supporters,  believe that the key is quiet borders. An autonomy agreement  that would secure quiet borders is supported by 60 percent of  the Likud voters and by 99 percent of Labor voters. At the same  time, if terrorists continue murdering Jews after an agreement  is signed, 70 percent will regard this a failure. There was no  difference between Labor and Likud voters' stands on this issue.  The agreement will also be perceived as a failure if, after the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] pull out of the Gaza Strip, the PLO  fails to seize control.    The authors of the poll state in conclusion: Some 60 percent  of the public support a cautious promotion of the peace process;  the public is very sensitive to murderous terror attacks, and  will not regard a peace agreement while terror continues a  success; the public is split in its stands regarding the  establishment of a Palestinian state and the evacuation of  settlements.    The Labor public relations department closely examined the  poll results, and plans the party's updated public relations  campaign strategy in accordance with the findings. It is clear  to Labor officials that the guideline should be the claim that  peace will bring security. The Labor campaigners are also clear  that the fact that military men are in charge of the  negotiations should be stressed to the public, hence -- the IDF  will be able to defend the peace agreement and the borders it  entails.</p>

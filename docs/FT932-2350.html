			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (12): The grub without the grubs - Profile, Ciba Pigments THREE or four times a year, groups of local women visit the Ciba Pigments plant at Paisley, near Glasgow. They are not concerned with the automated processes which produce yellow and blue pigments: their destination is the canteen. Its chefs give cooking demonstrations and the women try out the recipes on the spot, eating what they have cooked. It has nothing to do with chemicals but, says Mr Ian Shankland, safety and environmental protection manager, 'it makes visitors familiar with the plant and gets them to know the kind of people we are.' Ciba-Geigy has been in Paisley since the 1940s, developing, making and marketing pigments for use in printing inks, paints and plastics. About 70 per cent of the plant's turnover - Pounds 116m in 1992 - is exported, much of it to Germany. Up to a decade ago the plant had little contact with the people of Paisley, except as being a major employer (it currently employs 800 people and is the town's biggest private sector employer). The change came as the public became increasingly conscious of environmental issues, and the Swiss company realised that to be environmentally sound was not just in the public interest but was also in its own interests. 'There were financial people such as investors who thought Ciba-Geigy was spending too much on environmental protection,' says Mr Shankland. 'But we told them it was a positive investment for the future. At worst, we could go out of business if we didn't do it. The company aims to be operating well into the next century.' Mr Shankland says that the Paisley pigments plant is a low hazard site with a good environmental record, though he acknowledges that it is large and is close to residential areas. The drive to improve its environmental standing began around 1987 when Ciba-Geigy's headquarters in Basle decided to carry out audits of all its sites and asked plants to highlight future problems. At the same time, new EC legislation was coming into force. The company decided that, in addition to complying with national environmental standards, it would implement in all its worldwide plants the stiffest standard being applied anywhere - which generally meant the German standard. Mr Shankland points out that although the Paisley plant is beside the River Cart it draws no water from the river, being supplied by the local authority water service. All its effluent goes through its own treatment plant before passing to the municipal treatment plant, before being released in the River Clyde. He points to two sets of measures Ciba has taken to improve its environmental performance. First, recognising in 1990 that increased production of blue pigment with the phthalocyanine process would add to the copper effluent from the plant, it cut the amount of copper used to make the pigment. It chose this solution rather than devote its efforts to cleaning up the effluent, which would have been what he calls 'an end-of-pipe solution'. The project did not involve capital expenditure, but rather the time and the work of the chemists involved. It was successful in reducing copper levels to half of what they had been and the new process turned out to be cheaper. There was a risk that by changing the process Ciba would have altered the product, making it unacceptable to the customer, but this did not happen. Secondly, Ciba Pigments had to deal with the production of additional ammonia from the increased output at the blue plant. The increase would have breached Clyde River Purification Board limits. The solution was to build a plant to oxidise the ammonia into nitrogen and water vapour by burning it with natural gas. The tall, thin blue chimney of the thermal oxidiser has become part of the complex's skyline. The project cost between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 300,000. Both these measures were required to meet the legal limits, though Ciba claims it exceeded them. However, other measures it has taken were not required by outside regulation but rather to improve the environmental performance and also the efficiency of the plant. A major part of this is waste minimisation. As part of this, the company has installed tanks to collect and recycle the sulphuric acid which it uses. This has cut consumption of sulphuric acid by 30 per cent. Ciba Pigments now delivers its pigment granules in portable hoppers which the consuming company returns to Paisley after use. This eliminates the waste of disposable containers or packaging. The biggest capital expenditure has been to upgrade the Paisley complex's sprinkler system and build an eight-inch-high wall around the entire complex. These measures, costing Pounds 600,000, were taken after a bad fire at the Sandoz plant in Basle in 1986 led to water from the fire brigades' hoses carrying polluting chemicals into the Rhine. Mr Shankland says that if such a thing had happened at Paisley the chemicals would not have killed fish but they would have made 'a hell of a mess'. A good part of the company's efforts over the past few years has aimed to ensure that local people see Ciba Pigments as a good neighbour. Local councillors and MPs visit the plant, and visitors' groups are encouraged. 'Most fear is based on ignorance,' Mr Shankland says, 'and most of what people see coming out of the chimneys is water vapour. When they ask questions we tell them the truth and they go away with any fears they might have had dissolved.' The company says its staff are its best ambassadors in spreading the word about the plant. 'They want to be able to answer the questions people put to them and so we hold monthly meetings to bring them up to date on what's going on,' says Mr Shankland. There is evidence that the image of the plant has improved in recent years. 'Ciba has good relations with people in Paisley,' says a local reporter. But he recalls an occasion about two years ago when red dust leaked into the air and landed on people's roofs and gardens. Mr Shankland says: 'That was a one-off. A dust filter burst because it malfunctioned. We've put in new equipment since then.'</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / New world disorder The problem with the collapse of communism is that it faces us with the one question we never thought we would have to answer: what do we do now? The familiar and predictable confrontation between east and west simply vanished a couple of years ago; but the policy planners are still thrashing around in search of a new strategy. In Washington, it now emerges, the debate has crystallised into a straight face-off between negotiators and unilateralists. President George Bush, the traditional internationalist, has advanced the idealistic image of a new world order. But across the river, planners in the Pentagon are advocating a unipolar world, in which the US will make the rules, by force if necessary. News of the Pentagon paper, as leaked to the New York Times, has set off a mild international kerfuffle, since its prescriptions are deliberately dismissive of the separate interests of America's allies. The president's men have tried to reassure us, by declaring that the Pentagon position is not administration policy. But the fundamental dilemma cannot be resolved that easily, because we still do not know what is administration policy. In recent months, Mr Bush has been keeping quiet about the new world order. One reason is that the voters do not want to know: what interests them is jobs and economic growth, not some airy-fairy conception of the world after communism. So for the time being, President Bush is keeping his vision thing to himself. But there is a second reason which is just as compelling: there is not now, and there will not be in any foreseeable time-frame, a new world order. There is a new world, with the disintegration of the Soviet Union; but there is no order, in the sense of a coherent and structured framework for future international policy. Above all, there is no benign order, as Mr Bush has seemed to assert. With his tract The End of History, Mr Francis Fukuyama has argued that the collapse of communism has united the world behind a new ideological consensus, in favour of market forces and democracy. The thesis has made him famous, but alas, it is palpable nonsense. The command economy may now be irretrievably discredited, but democracy is not yet in favour with those who can get away with autocracy. Ask the rulers of China, Singapore, Morocco, Mexico, Kuwait, Iran, or Pakistan, to name but a few. The central innovation of the new world is not the revelation of a universal consensus, but the removal of the harsh organising principles represented by the Soviet system and the east-west conflict. There is no reason to assume that these organising principles can be replaced by others which are more benign. On the contrary, the defining characteristics of the new world will probably be disorder and unpredictability. Mr Pierre Lellouche, a leading French foreign policy analyst, has just published a sweeping survey of this new world * whose subtitle succinctly conveys the message: 'From the order of Yalta to the disorder of the nations.' This new disorder is by nature not readily amenable to restructuring by governments; moreover, the US is manifestly unwilling to get involved in the restructuring of Yugoslavia, and it is so broke that it cannot provide any serious financial help for the ex-Soviet Union. When President Bush proclaimed his concept of a new world order, he was evidently inspired both by the belief that the inheritors of the Soviet Union would become the benevolent partners of the west, and by the extraordinary diplomatic and military experience of the Gulf war. That conflict seemed to inaugurate a new era of international consensus between the responsible powers, in which the United Nations would at last fulfil its promise of harmonious international action. Today, these hopes look hopelessly nave. The brilliance of the military campaign in the Gulf war has been dismally tarnished by the political aftermath: this is not a satisfactory model for the superior management of the world. And however friendly the inheritors of the Soviet state may be, they cannot contribute to any predictable principles of international order, because their own political system is still in a process of headlong decomposition. What is happening to Yugoslavia is bad enough, but just wait for the disintegration of the Russian federation. The professional self-interest in the unilateral thesis from the Pentagon is all too transparent: if the US is to be the sole policeman in a unipolar world, it obviously needs a large defence budget. Yet the end of the Cold War means military force will become less important as an instrument of foreign policy, not more. More fundamentally flawed is the underlying idea that there can be a unipolar world. The US is and will remain large, rich and powerful; but its post-war dominance over the western world was essentially due to the east-west conflict. Today, the western allies no longer depend on the US for survival; so they have less need to defer to US leadership. The US-led Gulf war was a dazzling show; the post-war follow-up continues to be a slog of collective effort. The US is taking the lead in nuclear arms talks with the Russians; but the real ongoing task is to prevent the unauthorised leakage of Russian nuclear hardware, and this too can only be a slog of collective effort. The central issue is not whether the Pentagon, from a position of military strength, can assert and impose its dominance over the rest of the world, (it cannot), but whether President Bush and his successors are prepared to recognise that in the new situation the US must work with its allies on a basis of unfamiliar equality. If there is any meaning in the phrase 'new world order', that is it. * The Nouveau Monde: De l'Ordre de Yalta au desordre des nations; by Pierre Lellouche; published Grasset; FFr165</p>

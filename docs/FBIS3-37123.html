He spoke briefly about the results of the recent Russo-Georgian  talks, emphasizing that the signing of the bilateral  comprehensive agreement was the most important occasion in the  history of new Georgia. The head of state said that this had  put an end to the political and economic isolation of the  republic and initiated a legal basis in the relations between  the two states.    In Eduard Shevardnadze's view, the unsettled political and  economic state of Georgia has a very adverse effect upon the  country. A deep paralysis covers all spheres of economy in  Georgia. Eduard Shevardnadze emphasized that the escalation of  confrontation between Russia and Georgia has a profound effect  on the issue of Abkhazia and the situation in Samachablo [South  Ossetia], thus making the problem of the settlement of conflicts  in the autonomous regions of the country more difficult. It  also impedes an important process of the creation of the  national army.    Eduard Shevardnadze expressed the view that Georgia's  membership in the CIS became the first step toward the  Russo-Georgian treaty being signed then in Tbilisi and serving  interests of the two countries.    The chairman of the Georgian parliament drew the  parliament's  attention to the fact that Russia, in making economic  commitments, would allow the republic to catch its breath, and  that this really is very important.    The head of state expressed the thought that it is very  important that the two countries agree to have a contingent of  Russian frontier forces guard the border [with Turkey] until  professional Georgian cadres are trained. Otherwise, Georgia's  borders will be unprotected.    Mr. Shevardnadze said that arms required for the Georgian  armed forces and interior troops would be received through  Russian channels. As for the settlement of the Abkhazian  conflict, Russia will have a decisive role in this issue,  whatever resolutions the UN Security Council will have passed.    Speaking of military cooperation between Russia and Georgia,  Eduard Shevardnadze said that this is a matter of strategic  alliance of the two countries linked historically and in many  other ways.    The Georgian leader appealed to the deputies to take a  realistic approach to the existing situation and to make an  unbiased assessment of the possibilities of alternative variants  when making a decision on any issue.    When answering questions asked by members of parliament, the  head of state requested that they demonstrate better manners and  proper reciprocal respect when working at the highest  legislative body of the country.</p>

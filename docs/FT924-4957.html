			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Major sets off to sell British view of EC MR John Major embarks on a three-day round of European capitals today determined to impress on his fellow heads of government that there is a great deal more at stake at next week's Edinburgh summit than the reputation of the British presidency. The prime minister's key message to Mr Felipe Gonzalez, his Spanish counterpart, when they meet tomorrow morning will be that all sides have a vested interest in reaching a deal as failure could tip recession into slump. 'What has to be made clear,' said one British government minister last night, 'is that agreements at Edinburgh could help market confidence and aid recovery, failure could turn recession into slump.' With the peseta, the escudo and the punt all highly insecure within their exchange rate mechanism bands, anything short of a success could provoke a fresh bout of jitters in the markets, again destabilising the ERM. Mr Major's trip begins today with talks in Luxembourg with Mr Jacques Santer, the prime minister But the crucial visit is on the next leg to Madrid where he must attempt to calm Spanish anger at what they see as parsimony by the rich northern countries, led by Germany and the UK, over the cohesion fund for the poorer south. Using all his powers of conciliation, Mr Major will claim Spain and its Mediterranean colleagues have already had a significant victory in the preliminary negotiations on future financing of the commun-ity. A key element in the new arrangements means that the Value Added Tax element in the Community's revenues will be reduced immediately from 55 per cent to 50 per cent, rather than phased over five years. This has long been sought by Madrid. Furthermore, Mr Major will stress that the difference between the UK presidency's financing proposals and those of the commission amount to just Ecu2.5bn (Pounds 2.02bn) a year. He will juxtapose that figure with those showing the combination of the cohesion fund with existing structural funds will double total average annual provisions over the next seven years from Ecu8bn to Ecu16bn. What he is desperate to avert, however, is any attempt by Mr Gonzalez to use an alliance with France involving the threat of opposition to the Gatt trade deal as fresh leverage on the north. He is also determined to avoid any opening of the debate on Britain's budget rebate. Like other UK ministers, he will point out that the UK's commitment to the Community can be measured in the fact that, even with the rebate, it is the second largest contributor to EC funds. One minister pointed out yesterday that the UK is aware that Spain needs a good deal to help sell the Community to its voters at a time when northern products and companies are increasingly penetrating its markets. But the hardnosed bottom line is that Madrid must realise that no deal at all is a substantially worse option than what is on offer. In some respects a similar message will be taken to Copenhagen where the Danes' demands for 'opt-outs' from aspects of the Maastricht deal are top of the agenda. The UK presidency appears increasingly convinced that acceptable wording on subsidiarity and openness can be found. But there are considerable concerns over Denmark's four additional requirements of exemptions on such common policies as citizenship rights and internal policing. In spite of the mounting nervousness and doomsaying, however, there are still some in London who believe that the sheer complexity of the negotiation, alongside its urgency, could help rather than hinder a final successful outcome. There is even some speculation that Paris could decide to keep its difficulties with Gatt off the agenda in order not to confuse it with all the other high-stakes poker now about to be played. What is certain is that senior British ministers believe that the future financing of the community will be the central debate at Edinburgh. The success of the summit in resolving the other highly controversial and important issues also in play will depend on whether the financing deal can be agreed.</p>

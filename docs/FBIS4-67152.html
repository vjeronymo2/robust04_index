			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (AFP) -- President Gonzalo Sanchez de  Losada spoke on Thursday [date not further specified] of the  danger of a "narco-guerrilla" and powerful drug cartels like  those of Colombia developing in Bolivia if a general drug  enforcement policy is not quickly defined.    Sanchez de Lozada said that this new policy, which he will  present to Congress next August, must not be imposed from  abroad. He said this to a local newspaper, alluding to the  problems created in Bolivia by U.S. pressure to radicalize drug  enforcement and to eradicate coca plantations in El Chapare, the  largest cocaine raw material producing zone in the world.    The chief of state said: "Trafficking is a very serious  problem for all sectors of society and it affects Bolivian  relations with the rest of the world."    The president said he was worried about the lack of a  consistent drug enforcement strategy. He stated that most of  the coca produced in El Chapare--approximately 60,000 tonnes per  year--ends up in drug production.    "Nobody chews coca in El Chapare; coca produced in Yungas  region is taken to El Chapare, and all goes to produce drugs.  The atmosphere in the region favors the establishment of drug  cartels or narco-guerrillas," Sanchez de Lozada said.    Regarding the policy being prepared by his administration,  Sanchez de Lozada mentioned the creation of a National Drug  Enforcement Council [Consejo Nacional de Lucha Contra el  Narcotrafico] presided by Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and  comprising Justice Minister Jorge Blattman, Sustainable  Development Minister Guillermo Justiniano, and Minister of  Government German Quiroga.    This council must find solutions in Bolivia and not  solutions  imposed from abroad, the president said, adding that this  reorganization includes defining a policy toward the United  States.    "This is far too important for them (the United States)  because after many years they have recognized the need for  shared responsibility. It is our obligation to generate a  proposal that will really solve this problem," Sanchez de Lozada  said.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Polish privatisation back on track Mr Waldemar Pawlak, Poland's prime minister, yesterday removed one of the last obstacles to the long delayed mass privatisation programme by approving around 100 companies for inclusion. The decision, which brings the number of companies to be transferred to the private sector at one fell swoop up to 460, has been awaited by the privatisation ministry since July. Poland had promised both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that the plan would go ahead. Both institutions, worried about the fate of the programme, had insisted it be implemented before freeing funds to finance the recent agreement to cut cut Poland's commercial debt by 49.5 per cent. Mr Pawlak, who heads the Polish Peasant party, junior partner in the government, has argued that the plan gives too great a role for foreign managers and includes too many plants in key sectors. The previous government approved 360 companies more than a year ago. About a dozen companies were removed from the present tranche before the prime minister signed it. The government plans to establish around 15 national investment funds (NIFs), run jointly by foreign and local managers, which are to be handed equity in the 460 companies. Shares in the funds are then to be distributed to the population at large for a nominal fee. Next year's budget assumes that income from the fees will run to 4,000bn zlotys (Pounds 108m). Fund managers for the programme have already been shortlisted and these include Kleinwort Benson, Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Charterhouse, as well as Polish banks and local consultants. The next step is for the government to establish the NIFs formally and appoint supervisory boards which will then chose management groups. The funds are to stay in existence for 10 years, with managers paid an annual fee as well as a performance bonus in NIF equity and cash at the end of the period. The aim is to privatise the companies as well as improve management, modernise plant and generally enhance their value. The scheme has become an indicator for international financial institutions and investors of the government's intentions on privatisation. It leaves abother 5,000 or so companies to be privatised including sensitive sectors such as petrochemicals and telecoms.</p>

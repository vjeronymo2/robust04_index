			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australia halts sales from wool stockpile THE Australian government yesterday announced a 12-month moratorium on sales from the wool industry's 3.9bn-bale stockpile in an attempt to end a slide in prices, which have already fallen to historic lows. Mr Simon Crean, primary industries minister, also announced a ADollars 50m (Pounds 23m) assistance package designed to subsidise debt interest payments by about 6,500 farmers hit by falling prices and severe drought. The minister said the postponement of sales from the wool stockpile would remove the speculative pressure that had contributed a fall in the national wool indicator from ADollars 5.50 a kilogram in November to ADollars 3.96 on Friday. The market indicator, a weighted average of auction prices for 15 grades of wool, stood at ADollars 7.29 before the abolition of the wool industry's ADollars 7 floor price two years ago. The government's seven-year debt guarantee to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, the statutory authority which markets the stockpile, would be extended by a year, Mr Crean said, and there would be a three-month review of the wool industry's organisation and structure, to be chaired by Mr Ross Garnaut, professor of economics at the Australian National University. Mr Crean rejected a call by the Australian Wool Council, the main growers' body, for a cut in the 8.5 per cent wool tax, which finances the stockpile and the industry's marketing efforts. 'What we are not going to do is to allow the growers. . . to get out of the obligation they have to meet the debt,' he said. 'We are prepared to support them in meeting it in a managed way, but they can't have the luxury of finding some new crisis (each year) and in the end saying to the government: 'you have got to pay the bill'.' The series of announcements was welcomed by some farmers' associations; the Queensland Graingrowers Association said the drought package would help farmers to stay on the land until the rains came. But Mr Alan Bowman, president of the Wool Council, said the government's decision not to reduce the wool tax was 'bloody hopeless'. He said the cut 'would have allowed the industry to help itself.' The Wool Council was also disappointed that the seven-year disposal schedule for the stockpile had not been extended indefinitely. The minister said that Mr Garnaut's review of the industry would consider fresh marketing initiatives to divert the stockpile sales to non-traditional buyers of wool, which could help to ease pressure on auction prices. One of the ideas being considered by officials is the use of wool as an insulation material in the construction industry. The government is also considering proposals to exchange wool for equity in Russian textile mills.</p>

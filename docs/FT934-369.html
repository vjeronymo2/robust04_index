			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / First meeting for Saudi council Saudi Arabia is expected to take its first step towards more representative government today when King Fahd bin Abdulaziz inaugurates the first session of the 60-member majlis al-shura (consultative council). The creation of the council, first discussed more than 30 years ago, reflects the huge changes which have taken place in Saudi Arabia as a result of its oil wealth and its central role in maintaining stability in the Gulf. The council will initially play an advisory role, but could develop into the main source of new legislation. Its 60 members, who were appointed in September, have been drawn mainly from the professions and more than half have advanced degrees from western universities. They will debate issues referred to them by the council of ministers, headed by King Fahd, but their recommendations will not be binding. Debates will be held in secret and members will not be allowed to remove documents from the council chamber in Riyadh. The creation of the council has come at a testing time for the government, with the fall in oil prices threatening plans both to bring the budget deficit under control and to reduce the worsening current account deficit.</p>

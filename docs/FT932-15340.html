			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Arts: A powerful experience way down South - Theatre From The Mississippi Delta at the Cochrane Theatre is a partly autobiographical play about the Deep South written by Endesha Ida Mae Holland. In America, the play opened in Buffalo and New York, and in England at the Young Vic (1989). This Talawa Theatre production makes powerful, high-energy theatre: fine acting in a bare set, with no props. The central characters, shared by the three actors, represent the black American experience during the civil rights activism of the 1950s and 1960s. The play is set in Greenwood, Mississippi in the early 1960s, and stretches forward and back from there. By then, that day in 1955 when Rosa Parks failed to give up her bus seat in Montgomery, Alabama had become civil rights history; Martin Luther King emerged as the leader there in 1955, but the activists were slower to reach the delta. The play focuses on the life of Ida Mae Holland and her mother, Aunt Baby, who was a midwife. There are pictures of domestic toil, a terrifying breach-birth scene, and vignettes of neighbourhood characters; out of these, Ida Mae Holland's character emerges with a decency and honesty born of hard work and deprivation: 'Yo' c'n look over yo' friends when yo' is low, but yo' sure c'n't look over them when yo' is pickin' in high cotton.' She tries erotic dancing, prostitution, self education and then college in Minneapolis; north of Memphis, en route to Chicago, the diner car joins the train - 'and anyone can eat there.' But before she graduates, her mother is burned to death by arsonists, the scent of Magnolia and burnt flesh on the delta breeze. The final scene pays tribute to Martin Luther King, Jimi Hendrix (the inimitable 'Star Spangled Banner') and Alice Walker, who says simply, 'we are not the first to suffer.' While Ida Mae Holland lacks the popular appeal of Toni Morrison or the depth of Zora Neale Hurston, she does speak for black women's lives; like her mother, 'she taught us we could do more things than she had words for.' The easy physicality and trust between the actors (Pauline Black, Josette Bushell-Mingo and Joy Richardson) creates and focuses energy on stage, while the direction (Annie Castledine and Sue MacLennan) drives the action quickly around the bare set walled with rusty corrugated iron. The a capella singing, however, tempts one to wish for something more substantial; some delta blues on slide and harmonica would add musical body, but the singing at the revivalist funeral is still unforgettable. Cochrane Theatre (071-242-7040) until May 1; Contact Theatre, Manchester (061-274-4400) May 12 - June 5.</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> IS GALLEGLY PREPARED?  </P> <P> In response to Janice Gallegly's letter (Oct. 26), there has been an empty  chair at our dinner table as well. My husband, Richard Freiman, has been  campaigning full time for the office of U. S. representative since May.  </P> <P> We both feel that the issues of freedom of choice, protection of our  environment, and maintaining the integrity of Social Security, Medicare and  other senior citizen programs are that important.  </P> <P> Rep. Elton Gallegly has refused to meet my husband in a debate even though  Richard first challenged him to a debate as far back as June. KADY-TV tried to  make it as easy as possible for the incumbent to debate by offering to telecast  him via satellite from Washington. The incumbent refused, claiming that it  would take him too long to prepare.  </P> <P> How can he be able to vote on the issues if he's not prepared enough to discuss  them?  </P> <P> LESLIE S. FREIMAN, Agoura  </P></p>

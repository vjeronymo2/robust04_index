			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Excerpts] On 7 March it will be a month since Lieutenant  General Lagos Lidimo was promoted to his present rank, following  his appointment to the Supreme Council of the Mozambique Defense  Armed Forces (FADM). [passage omitted]    Reacting to the appointment and subsequent promotion of the  senior government army officer to the FADM Supreme Council,  diplomatic sources in Maputo expressed regret at the choice,  linking Lidimo to Mozambique's shadowy war period when he was  chief of Military Counterintelligence (JIM). Other diplomats  went as far as to approach FAM/FPLM [Mozambique Armed  Forces/Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique]  officialdom to express their annoyance at Lidimo's appointment.  Moreover, they noted issues relating to the period before  independence when Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front]  guerrillas clashed with Portuguese colonial troops in  Mozambique, particularly in Cabo Delgado where Lidimo was born  and operated.    Contacted by DOMINGO, senior government army officers  categorically rejected those arguments, emphasizing that that  amounted to interference in the country's domestic affairs.  They based their views on the fact that Lagos Lidimo played a  leading role in the defeat of Portuguese colonialism and in?the  dismantling of a [U.S.] CIA network in Mozambique. They noted  that possible resentment harbored by certain circles after those  two events could have prompted the diplomats' attitude. They  also mentioned the role played by Mateus Ngonhamo in the war  that ended in 1992, during which he operated in central and  southern Mozambique, where most of the bloodiest  Renamo-sponsored massacres were reported. They said as the  country moves toward national reconciliation and  democratization, the international community ought to assist  Mozambicans in reconstructing their lives in peace instead of  opening old wounds.</p>

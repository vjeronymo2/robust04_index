			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Marketer of Car Coolant Plans Recycling: Lexington, Ky.-based IG-LO Products,  maker of a coolant for car air conditioners that is linked to the depletion of  the Earth's protective ozone layer, announced a recycling and consumer  education program. Recycling units are to be established at service centers by  mid-1990 to capture escaped particles of the CFC-12 coolant, known as Freon,  and allow them to be reused. The chemical breakup of CFC-12 and other  chlorofluorocarbons -- or CFCs -- in the upper atmosphere has been linked to  the depletion of the Earth's protective ozone layer.  </P></p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Chemical Banking to axe 3,700 jobs in shake-up Chemical Banking, the fourth-biggest US banking group, announced a range of cost-cutting and other measures, including 3,700 job losses, in an attempt to lift its profitability closer to the levels of more successful rivals. In addition to the job losses, which amount to about 9 per cent of its total staff, Chemical said it would dispose of two peripheral businesses, sell off Dollars 1bn of non-performing property loans and extend its share buy-back programme with a further 6m shares. The moves signal the first broad-ranging restructuring at the bank since its merger with Manufacturers Hanover at the end of 1991. They reflect the generally lacklustre outlook for bank earnings in the US after the interest-rate rises of this year, and went some way yesterday to meeting market concerns that Chemical had failed to cut costs aggressively enough at the time of the merger. Mr Walter Shipley, chairman, denied that the bank was acting belatedly to deal with the Manufacturers Hanover transaction. However, he called the latest restructuring 'the second phase' in the process of absorbing the bank, following an eight-month review to find ways to make all operations more efficient. At the time of the merger, Chemical said it planned to lift its return on equity to 16 per cent by 1994. 'Clearly, at 14 per cent, we're not where we should be,' Mr Shipley said. He added that the failure to hit the target was caused by the US interest rate rises and the fall-off in trading revenues this year, rather than a failure to meet internal cost targets. The moves, which will result in restructuring and write-down costs of Dollars 410m, are intended to enable Chemical to hold costs steady in the next two years, while growing its revenues at 4-6 per cent a year. This should result in earnings per share growth of 15 per cent in each of the next two years, the bank said - a return on equity of 16 per cent. Chemical said it would sell 60 per cent of its banking business in the state of New Jersey, retaining only those operations close to New York city. The New Jersey bank, acquired in 1989, has assets of Dollars 5.7bn and 140 branches. Chemical is also to sell its 40 per cent stake in CIT, an asset-based lending business. The remaining 60 per cent was sold to Dai-Ichi Kangyo, the Japanese bank, in 1989. Among moves to make the bank's international network more profitable, Mr Bill Harrison, vice-chairman in charge of wholesale banking, said Chemical planned significant reductions in its German business, which employs 300 people in capital markets, leasing, export finance and general corporate banking. It will also reduce its presence in Chile. Signs that Chemical was taking a more aggressive stance on improving its earnings have sustained the company's share price in recent weeks. The shares rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 36 7/8 in early trading yesterday.</p>

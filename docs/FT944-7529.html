			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television Arousing pity comes easily to television's intimate immediacy. Tonight's Witness: Life after Death (9pm C4) is one of those gentle, almost deadpan probings of tragedy that leave you pondering the issues long afterwards. The scene is Ulster: the Catholic woman whose husband was mistakenly killed by the IRA is embittered; the ex-Loyalist paramilitary who served a jail sentence after killing a catholic stranger is almost serene as he acknowledges his guilt, a born-again Christian. The ways of God and men are incomprehensible. The film's integrity contrasts with the perceptible layer of smugness in Forbidden Britain (9.45 pm BBC2). The series' assumption that we think society's ills date only from modern times overlooks the fact some of us read books. The slightly accusing note with which tonight's programme unearths fascinating film of homelessness is a good fault at a time when the chattering (and TV-making) classes think of history as a month-old colour supplement, and are themselves unaware of life before the sixties when not only sex but civilisation began.</p>

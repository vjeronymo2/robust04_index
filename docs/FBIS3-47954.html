Satsuki Eda, its leader and currently state minister in  charge of the Science and Technology Agency, Shogo Abe, party  secretary general, and Yanosuke Narasaki will join the group as  early as next week after dissolving a parliamentary link with  the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], they said.    The USDP, which was formed in March 1978, splitting the SDP,  will decide to put an end to its 16-year history next Monday at  a meeting, they said.    The other USDP lower house member, Naoto Kan, has already  joined the parliamentary group.    Abe told a party meeting in early January that his party's  historical duty to seek power change is over.    Eda has said that the USDP's dissolution would be a first  step toward political realignment.    The USDP, which has also one seat in the House of  Councillors, joined six other parties last August to form the  seven-party coalition government ousting the Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) from a 38-year grip on power following the general  elections one month before.    The JNP is led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, while  Sakigake is led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.</p>

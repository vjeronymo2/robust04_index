			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Limited Role for Foreigners in Private Banks"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 7. The Government today assured the  Rajya Sabha that foreigners will not be allowed to control the  private banks that are proposed to be set up in the country.    Replying to the brief debate on the Banking Regulation  (amendment) Bill, 1994, which the House approved after a  division, the Minister of State for Finance, Dr. Abrar Ahmed,  said that under the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India the  proposed private banks could not hold more than 20 per cent of  the capital. Non-Resident Indians could have 40 per cent of the  total capital, he said.    The Minister said the provision of appointing part time  chairmen for the proposed banks would be confined to the private  banks and the nationalised banks did not come under its purview.    He said the loss-making bank branches operating in the rural  areas would not be closed down.    "The Reserve Bank had so far permitted nine banks to be  established in the private sector and one of them had been  issued a licence.    Adequate measures had been taken to ensure safety of the  deposits in such banks," he said.  <H5>  BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] Abstains </H5>   The Rajya Sabha passed the Bill 1994 by 61 to 26 votes in an  Opposition-pressed division in which, however, the Bharatiya  Janata Party did not participate.    The BJP members, during the discussion on the Bill, opposed  several provisions in it and also the ordinance promulgated in  this connection before the budget session of Parliament began.    Earlier, the House rejected by voice vote the statutory  resolution moved by Mr. Viren Saha (BJP) and others for the  disapproval of the January 31 ordinance.    The Bill also replaces the ordinance.  <H5>  `Provisions Will Not Be Misused' </H5>   Dr. Abrar Ahmed assured the House that the provision for  appointment of a part-time chairman in the private banks would  not be misused.    He said the Government in no way would be involved in the  process as these appointments would be made by the private banks  themselves. However, he said, these appointments would be  ratified by the Reserve Bank of India.    Referring to steps being taken to improve the banking  system,  the Minister said the Government had taken measures to  strengthen the capital adequacy norms of the banks.  <H5>  Computerisation </H5>   Referring to the need for improving the quality of services  rendered by the nationalised banks, the Minister said the  Government was committed to computerisation of the banking  operation, which would help in improving the efficiency of the  banks.    In this context, he said the Government was in constant  touch  with the union representatives for implementing the  computerisation programmes.    Regarding the closure of loss-making branches of  nationalised  banks, Dr. Ahmed said that as many as 102 branches had been  identified by the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) for closure.    However, he assured the members that none of these  identified  branches in rural areas would be closed and no bank employee  would be retrenched.  <H5>  Opposition Charge </H5>   Earlier, participating in the discussion, the Opposition  members charged the Government with bringing the privatisation  in the banking sector under the "alibi" of inefficiency in the  public sector banks and at the behest of the International  Monetary Fund.    Members from Left parties, the Janata Dal and the BJP  expressed apprehension that the reforms in the banking sector  would only benefit the rich and would entirely ignore the poor  population in both rural and urban areas.    The members also severely criticised the Government for its  frequent resort to issuing ordinance, bypassing Parliament.    Mr. Viren Shah of the BJP questioned the hurry for the  ordinance when Parliament was to meet in three weeks' time. He  moved the statutory resolution disapproving of the ordinance.  <H5>  Ordinance Questioned </H5>   Dr. Ashok Mitra (CPI-M) (Communist Party of India-Marxist),  said the Narasimham committee report was out in December 1991  and the Government waited for two years to take action on the  report. He said he was unable to fathom the `sudden rush' to  issue the ordinance as if without it the whole banking  operations would have come to a standstill.    Were any of the provisions in the ordinance implemented till  now? he asked and said that according to him nothing had been  done till today.    Describing the Narasimham committee as the "local surrogate  of the IMF," Dr. Mitra said the amendment of the Bill was being  done at the behest of the international financial institutions.</p>

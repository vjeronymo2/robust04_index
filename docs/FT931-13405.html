			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading FURTHER hopes of a cut in UK interest rates continued in the derivates, again helping to drive Footsie futures forward, writes Joel Kibazo. The March contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,785, and, but for a brief early retreat, moved steadily forward on speculation of a cut in base rates. It was also boosted by the firm trading in gilts and short sterling. The contract reached the day's high of 2,813 around 1pm. In the afternoon, March came off the top due to the poor trading in the bonds market but remained above the 2,800 level and closed at 2,803, with turnover reaching 8,735 lots. In traded options, Asda was the most actively dealt stock option as talk of a bid circulated. It traded 9,390 contracts with the July 70 puts the busiest series. British Airways was a poor second at 1,993 lots and TSB followed at 1,957 contracts. The closing total for the traded options was 37,685 lots, with the FT-SE 100 option recording 10,290 contracts.</p>

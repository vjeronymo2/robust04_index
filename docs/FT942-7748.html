			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: NHL in the black and to resume lending National Home Loans, the centralised mortgage lender, yesterday announced it would resume residential mortgage lending after a three-year absence, following its return to profitability. The company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.1m for the six months ended March 31, against losses of Pounds 26.1m. Mr Jonathan Perry, executive chairman, said the company had seen 'substantial reductions in provisions, repossessions and bad debts' and that a resumption of lending was now 'an obvious step'. NHL's mortgage portfolio has fallen from a peak of more than Pounds 3bn to Pounds 1.8bn, and consequently net interest income was down at Pounds 32.1m (Pounds 35.8m). However, operating expenses fell from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 11.8m, helped by disposals, while provisions for losses fell by almost Pounds 30m to Pounds 20.5m. Accounts that are more than 3 months in arrears have fallen by more than half to 1,516. With the mortgage book under control and being rapidly depleted, the company has decided to make a push for new business. It has signed a long-term lending facility with Abbey National, which will provide initial funding for its mortgage portfolio, but this will be refinanced through securitisation. Intermediaries are still estimated to account for more than one third of the mortgage market and NHL is confident it can regain access to this network. Mr Perry said NHL could compete with the building societies because their cost of capital had increased with competition for deposits, while NHL had the advantage of lower costs through the absence of a retail network. Renewed lending represents the second leg of NHL's strategy for recovery, and the third leg, a financial restructuring, is promised this year. The company still has negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 32m and preference share dividends are Pounds 20.3m in arrears. A rights issue is also considered likely. Earnings per share amounted to 0.4p (29.1p losses). The shares rose 1/2p to 23 1/2p.</p>

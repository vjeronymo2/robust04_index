			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Enrique Santos Calderon: "What Do They Want?" </F>   [Text] Kidnappings of incumbent or would-be legislators and  of their spouses or relatives; taking mayors and councilmen  hostage; selective assassinations of regional political leaders;  bombings of political headquarters...Besides their customary  destruction of the nation's assets and violence against law  enforcement, the guerrillas are now bent on "making their  presence felt" in the elections.    And what a way of doing it: by killing, kidnapping, and  setting fires. It is ultimately a pitiful cry of political  powerlessness. It is a clumsy, brutal attempt to show that they  have not yet become criminals through and through, that they  still have something to do with politics. This is why they are  going about disrupting the elections.    But what is it that they want? This is something that no one  has been able to figure out. Aside from their by now timeworn  platform of cliches and generic slogans (against militarism,  Yankee imperialism, the oligarchy, multinational oil  corporations, foreign capital, privatization, etc.) we have not  heard a single proposal that would suggest to us that they have  a specific, viable, credible agenda for Colombian society.    Their pathetic lack of ideas and suggestions came to the  fore  during the long months of talks in Caracas and Tlaxcala, where  the Guerrilla Coordinator failed to offer a single proposal that  would set the stage for serious negotiations. It is also true  that the 1991 constitutional reform left them without major  arguments. Their petrified discourse about the closed, cliquish  nature of Colombian democracy was laid to rest by the many  political guarantees, social rights, and minority protections  that the new constitution established.    But unlike the M-19, EPL [Popular Liberation Army], PRT  [Revolutionary Workers Party], CRS, Quintin Lame, and other  armed groups with some political vision, the FARC [Revolutionary  Armed Forces of Colombia] and the ELN [Army of National  Liberation] never understood or even wanted to understand the  profound institutional change and democratic opening that the  Constitutional Convention represented.    History passed them by. They were left without arguments or  proposals. But they held on to their weapons and to the cool  millions that they make from kidnapping and extortion. And now  they want to make themselves felt in the election campaign in  order to demonstrate that they still count, that they are still  interested in politics. And there they are, engaged in the only  thing that they know how to do.    There is talk that the guerrillas are conducting their  kidnapping campaign to soften up the political class and build a  future negotiating base. But this brings us back to the same  point: To negotiate what? On what conditions and with what  proposals?    The guerrillas in Central America undertook negotiations.  They had suggestions and proposals and showed that they were  indeed interested in putting down their weapons and were not  addicted to violence or corrupted by money.    In Mexico, the emergence of the so-called Zapatist  Liberation  Army might make the ELN and FARC believe that the armed struggle  is indeed still valid. But the emergence of this group was due  to the specific conditions of backwardness and oppression  besetting the Indians in Mexico's poorest province, and it is  striking a responsive cord nationwide by questioning a political  system (one that is indeed closed and cliquish) in which the  same party has held power since the days of Emiliano Zapata.    Commander Marcos, who has turned out to be something of a  poet as well, has already declared that the talks with the  government "are on the right track" and has expressed his desire  to arrive at a just solution and lay down his arms.    He is thus not trying to perpetuate the armed struggle or  turn it into a profession or lifestyle, as the Colombian  guerrillas are, by all indications. Unable to accept the rule of  law, set their weapons aside, and embrace the dynamic, changing  realities of a country that has left them behind, the FARC and  ELN want to show that they still count for something by  disrupting the elections as much as they can.    They are not going to succeed in preventing elections from  being held anywhere in the country, except in some isolated  village. They have neither the military might nor the political  credibility to do so. This does not mean that they cannot create  serious disruptions, as they are in fact doing with their rash  of political kidnappings.    There is no way, though, to guarantee that the State can  protect the thousands of congressional hopefuls, nor can the  Armed Forces prevent the guerrillas from blowing up checkpoints  or staging ambushes. An attack on a toll station guarded by  women is hardly a show of military might, as General Adrada  rightly pointed out in recent days.    But there are likely strategic targets that could be better  protected. Electric power plants, for example, or communication  pylons like the one that they blew up on Monday in Cerro de  Guasca, cutting off contact with that region of Cundinamarca.    If the past election campaign was marked by the atrocities  of  the narcoterrorists, with a macabre death toll of three  presidential candidates, this campaign will bear the stigma of  guerrilla violence.    This seems to be the tragic fate of a country with a  democracy that is permanently under fire. But nothing lasts  forever. Colombia has already put the nightmare of  narcoterrorism behind it. And although it may take somewhat  longer, Colombia will also cast off the yoke that the guerrilla  criminals are endeavoring to impose on it.</p>

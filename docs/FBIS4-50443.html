			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cao Min: "Ministry to Keep Urban Jobless Rate Below 3 </F> Percent"]    [Text] The government is encouraging businesses to recruit  more jobless people, in a bid to keep urban unemployment below 3  percent this year.    And it is adopting preferential policies for those service  industries who take on the unemployed, said Vice Labour Minister  Zhu Jiazhen.    At a national labour and wage conference on Saturday, Zhu  said the government would encourage the setting up of labour  service companies that absorb idle workers.    Set up by State-owned firms or private businesses, labour  service companies will be exempted from taxes and given priority  in obtaining bank loans and materials if 60 percent of their  jobs are given to the jobless or those who have been temporarily  laid-off.    The urban unemployed are registered in cities and issued  with  certificates to help them seek re-employment.    To give these labour-intensive businesses more autonomy, the  ministry will experiment with a shareholding system, said Zhu.    Previously, the decisionmaking powers of these labour  service  companies lay with the enterprises which set them up. The  companies were thus prevented from using their own initiatives  in their development.    And in addition to their wages, the employees in the firms  will be paid bonuses according to the profits earned by the  company, the vice minister said.    "One of the best ways to control unemployment is to give  full  play to the service industries irrespective of their ownership,"  said Zhu. Up till now, most labour service companies are run by  State-owned enterprises.    The Ministry of Labour hopes to hold the unemployment rate  to  3 percent this year. Last year's 2.6 percent was up from 2.4  percent in 1992.    Urban unemployment is expected to top 5 million this year.  There were 4.1 million city dwellers out of work by the end of  last year.    During the first quarter of the year, inflation hit 20.1  percent, resulting in an increase in the level of unemployment  in Chinese cities. This trend is worrying the government.    Another reason for the growth in the numbers of jobless is  that the current economic readjustment has forced unprofitable  State-owned enterprises to cut staff levels to raise efficiency.    Many State-owned firms are now in the red because of poor  management, price hikes of production materials, and the new tax  system which calculates more expenditures into costs.    To reduce the unemployment rate, the Labour Ministry has  initiated a training programme in the hope of putting more  unemployed into new jobs.    Instead of providing only financial relief to those out of  work, the project aims to improve the quality of the workers  with further training giving them more flexibility in their hunt  for new jobs.    The Labour Ministry is also trying to include the urban  employment index in the overall state economic plan, said Wang  Dongyan, in charge of planning and wages at the Labour Ministry.</p>

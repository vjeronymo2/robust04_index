			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Strike to close Greek airports Greek air traffic controllers announced a 48-hour strike beginning today that would paralyse airports and create chaos for thousands of fans arriving for the European Champion's Cup football final tomorrow evening. A civil aviation union official, Mr Dimitris Petrissis, said yesterday the walk-out was called to protest against legislation under debate in parliament placing civil aviation employees under the control of local governors. About 300 extra flights were scheduled to arrive in the next 24 hours from Spain and Italy carrying fans for the AC Milan-Barcelona game.</p>

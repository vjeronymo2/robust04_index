			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Malta full prepared for admission into European Union Sir, The FT survey on Malta (February 18) provides a very accurate synopsis of Malta's proactive domestic and foreign policy agenda for the 1990s. I would, however, like to raise two points of clarification with particular reference to Robert Graham's assessment of Malta's EU application. First, the Fenech Adami administration has consistently declared that Malta is fully committed to subscribing to the EU's common and foreign security policy (CFSP). In fact, there is no need for any constitutional amendments prior to EU accession because Malta's neutrality, which is based on the principles of non-alignment, in no way contradicts what is stated in Title V of the Maastricht treaty. A specific section of the title stipulates that the introduction of a CFSP does not mean that member states cannot continue making their own specific security arrangement: 'The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article (Article J4) shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States.' In addition, admission of the neutral European Free Trade Association countries will establish the framework to accommodate the Maltes whose neutrality is 'sui generis'. Second, if the institutional implications of the four EFTA candidates do not present a problem for the EU decision-making process, it is difficult to comprehend how the case of Malta will. To suggest that EU institutional reform should be a prerequisite to the vetting of Malta's application would be setting a precedent and equivalent to re-writing EC history itself. Moreover, the ministry of foreign affairs is already in the process of building a professional diplomatic corps that will be adequately prepared to assume the administrative and bureaucratic responsibilities that EU membership will entail.

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Next displays strong improvement to Pounds 8.3m NEXT, the fashion retailer, continued its recovery with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.3m in the first half, compared with just Pounds 200,000. The advance in the six months to July 31 came from slightly reduced turnover of Pounds 212.6m (Pounds 219.7m) as the group further reduced its peripheral activities. The figures were helped by Pounds 2m (Pounds 500,000) of interest received. Next again beat most expectations - as it did with its 1991-92 pre-tax outcome of Pounds 12.3m - and the share price rose 3 1/2 p to close at 102 1/2 p. Next Retail turned an operating loss of Pounds 1.9m into a Pounds 4.1m profit. The result was struck on sales up from Pounds 125.1m to Pounds 138.4m. Lord Wolfson, chairman, said the high street stores, excluding clearance, increased sales by 13.6 per cent. The total number of shops fell from 348 to 316 under the policy of closing loss-making outlets and rationalising neighbouring outlets. The clearance operation was cut back to only six shops. Mr David Jones, chief executive, said that strong stock control and 'short, sharp' end-of-season sales had greatly reduced the surplus. The group had traded for 23 of the 26 weeks without discounting. Next Directory improved its operating profit to Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 1.4m), on flat sales of Pounds 42.8m (Pounds 42.7m), through better control of stock and other costs. Excluding Club 24, the credit operation that has been one of Next's problem areas, the amount of cash held rose to Pounds 114m, compared with Pounds 106m at the year-end. The balance sheet was restored last year through the Pounds 167.5m disposal of Grattan, the mail order group. Repayment of Eurobonds next month will take Pounds 87m cash. Club 24, which at one stage had debt of more than Pounds 330m, contributed Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 38.9m) to sales but had no impact on profits. Mr Jones said the group was withdrawing from providing funds for the credit service offered to other stores. Instead it would manage the accounts for a commission. By next year the switch should be complete, leaving core borrowings of about Pounds 20m. Club 24 could then be brought back on to the balance sheet. Meanwhile, about Pounds 10m of unused provisions would lead to an exceptional credit in this year's accounts. Earnings per share rose to 2.01p (nil). An interim dividend of 0.5p (nil) is declared. COMMENT Next's customers - 'young women aged 18 to 80' as Lord Wolfson puts it  - have given the shops the benefit of the doubt after the dark era, responding nostalgically to the return of the old style. Hence its good performance in a highly competitive market. Even more impressive is the resilience of the men's wear side, which accounts for 30 per cent of sales. Some price reductions and an embracing of the idea of popular appeal, rather than exclusivity, have helped keep the men happy, while the former plethora of women's lines has been rationalised. There is scope for further margin improvement as the management sticks to its recovered knitting. Upgraded profit forecasts of about Pounds 26m give a prospective p/e of more than 16, on a 10 per cent tax rate that should last another couple of years. While there is still some running in the recovery story, most of it is in the share price.</p>

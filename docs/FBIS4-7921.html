			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 6 (BTA) -- "I believe we will make up  for lost time by activating our meetings," Mr. Husamettin  Cindoruk, president of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, told  a news conference today. He led a parliamentary delegation on a  three-day official visit here, the first by a head of the  Turkish Parliament to Bulgaria in 20 years. During his stay,  Mr. Cindoruk conferred with National Assembly Chairman  Aleksandur Yordanov, President Zhelyu Zhelev (with whom he  discussed Dr Zhelev's visit to Turkey this coming June), Deputy  Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, Foreign Minister Stanislav  Daskalov, and MP's of the National Security and Foreign Policy  Committees.    According to Mr. Cindoruk, the activation of parliamentary  contacts already creates prerequisites for a successful  promotion of bilateral economic relations as well, following the  example of political and military contacts. Mr. Cindoruk will  recommend the Turkish Government to concentrate on boosting  Turkish-Bulgarian trade, creating an East-West corridor after  the restoration of peace in the Balkans and cooperating with  Bulgaria in transport and tourism, in third countries included.    "We count entirely on your parliament for a solution of the  problems of the Bulgarian citizens who identify themselves as  ethnic Turks because they are equally represented in it," the  chief Turkish legislator told the news conference. He said that  Bulgaria is making great strides on the road of democracy. He  believes that the two countries' concerted efforts could help  remove the question about the rights of Bulgarian Muslims from  the agenda of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. "The  matter was put on the agenda before 1989, before the start of  democratic changes in Bulgaria," Mr. Cindoruk pointed out.    He explained again that the commitment of Turkish blue  helmets to Bosnia-Herzegovina was not decided by Turkey but by  the UN Security Council and recalled that his country has always  accepted such invitations, sending peacekeepers to Korea,  Somalia and other countries. "At the same time, we are  understanding of Bulgaria's sensitivity to this matter. If  under the influence of these objections the United Nations  changes its decision, we will accept this, too," Mr. Cindoruk  stressed.    National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov assessed his  Turkish counterpart's visit as exceedingly successful. In his  view, this visit showed that a number of questions and ideas,  which are useful to both countries at these hard times for the  Balkans, can be raised and acted on at the parliamentary level.</p>

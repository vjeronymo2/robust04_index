			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> METER FEEDING TO STOP AT 6 P.M.  </P> <P> A controversial decision to extend the running time on some Newport Beach  parking meters until 10 p.m. has been modified by the City Council.  </P> <P> As a result, it will not be necessary to feed meters citywide past 6 p.m.  </P> <P> In January, the city had extended the shut off-time for meters from 5 p.m. to  either 6 or 10 p.m., depending on the area of town, to generate revenue for law  enforcement and litter control.  </P> <P> However, the action angered some merchants and customers who said it was  difficult to read the meter instructions after dark and that the extended meter  times hurt business. Some residents were annoyed that visitors in their homes  would have to feed parking meters, said Rich Edmonston, city traffic engineer.  </P> <P> City workers will be finished changing the meters by the end of the week.  </P></p>

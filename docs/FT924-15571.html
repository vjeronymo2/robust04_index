			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses weaken on German and US influences THE LACK of movement from the Bundesbank, followed by steady US September jobless data and its implications for US interest rates, left bourses mostly lower yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT fell to a DAX index low of 1,474.25 in the last half hour before recovering to 1,478.04, 5.99 down on the day and 2.3 per cent down on the week. German market turnover from DM5.1bn to DM3.5bn. Strong gains for the dollar on the jobless data were seen initially as supportive of Germany's cyclical, and export-oriented corporate economy. Among major exporters the carmaker BMW, for which the US is a key market, continued to drift upwards, trading at DM477 in after-market computer business after an official close of DM475, up DM4. However, dealers were talking more bearishly later, and the run of depressing economic news continued as the association of German machine and machine tool wholesalers said that it expected 1992 turnover to fall by 3 to 5 per cent this year. PARIS was disappointed by the Bundesbank's announcement and Thursday's poor interim results. The CAC-40 index closed down 40.66 or 2.4 per cent at 1,683.34, a decline of 8.6 per cent on the week. Turnover was moderate at FFr2.2bn. Peugeot continued to fall following Thursday's results, and on yesterday's news that its September sales year-on-year had fallen by 1.9 per cent against a 4.6 per cent rise from Renault. It slid to a new 1992 low of FFr495.10, down FFr28.90 or 5.5 per cent. Eurodisney fell on low September attendance and apparent difficulty in attracting foreign tourists. Sterling and lira devaluations were reported to have depressed custom. The shares closed FFr1.60 lower at FFr67.40. Eurotunnel, which said that it will meet analysts on Monday to present new revenue forecasts, was FFr1.40 weaker at FFr35.30. UAP fell FFr17.50 to FFr367.50 on losses at its Banque Worms subsidiary. Societe Generale lost FFr12 to FFr516 and Axa shed FFr44 to FFr734. MADRID ended with a slight rise but the general feeling was that a further devaluation in the peseta, and up to a 1 per cent rise in interest rates, was imminent. The general index closed 0.27 higher at 186.28, a trend reflected in the Ibex which at one time had been more than 2 per cent lower. On the week, the general index was 7 per cent lower, but a significant feature yesterday was the return of foreign buyers who have been absent over the last few days. MILAN mixed the week's disappointing results, from Montedison and EniChem, with speculation and tax influences. The result were a Comit index 2.17 higher at 365.27, up 1.0 per cent on the week and one or two exciting individual moves; but there was an underlying feeling that the corporate sector had more woes to come. The Fiat group retail and construction companies, Rinascente and Cogefar, rose 8.3 per cent to L4,050 lire and 10.5 per cent to L1,801 before temporary suspension. The excitement followed the Fiat statement that it may sell some non-strategic assets to help finance a heavy car investment programme. Tax news included newspaper reports that capital gains tax might be suspended for six months and, more ominously, the imposition by decree of the 0.7 per cent tax on corporate net assets and the abolition of local tax deductibility. Mr Enrico Ponzone and Ms Fiona Marshall of Kleinwort Benson calculate that the deductibility abolition will raise the combined corporate tax ratio from 47.8 to 52.2 per cent and that this, with the net assets tax, could impact company profits next year by as much as 10 to 15 per cent in some cases. STOCKHOLM lost 2.5 per cent as investors remained worried about the effect of high short-term interest rates. The Affarsvarlden index closed 17.4 lower at 681.2, a 2.4 per cent fall on the week. Turnover was weak at SKr350m against Thursday's SKr446m. Some analysts noted a slight rebound in prices after the US dollar gained strength following positive economic data. The bank and finance sector worsened with Handelsbanken's A-restricted shares losing SKr2.50 to SKr26.50, while in the beseiged forestry sector Stora's B shares lost SKr12 to SKr186.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - OCT 2                            HOURLY CHANGES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open    11.30am   12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     4 pm     close 1002.45  1000.78  998.40   998.90   995.90   1001.65  993.53   993.56                  Day's High  1002.85    Day's Low  992.76          Oct 1      Sep 30      Sep 29     Sep 28     Sep 25         1006.01     1003.44    1009.98    1016.40    1035.63  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

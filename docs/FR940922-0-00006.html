			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Furthermore, the commitment funding process as proposed by SBA was not intended to put SBA at a disadvantage relative to where it would have been if it were considering a request for Leverage under the traditional funding mechanism. Since Leverage requests outside of the commitment process must be accompanied by a Short Form 468 for the most recent fiscal quarter, and since the draw down of funds under the SBA commitment is the issuance of Leverage, SBA should receive a Short Form 468 for the most recent quarter in order to evaluate a draw request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the commitment funding process, decisions on requests for draws will have to be made quickly by SBA staff, more quickly than decisions on requests for Leverage under the traditional funding process. SBA staff will need to monitor more closely the financial status of a Licensee with an outstanding SBA commitment in order to be able to respond in a timely fashion to the Licensee's draw requests. The filing of quarterly financial statements on Short Form 468 by all Licensees with outstanding SBA commitments will allow SBA to perform that function as promised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As mentioned above, in the event the draw request is made within 30 days of the end of the Licensee's fiscal quarter, SBA had proposed to accept a statement of no adverse change in lieu of the Short Form 468. Most of the comment letters argued in favor of adopting the more familiar standard of ``no material adverse change''. SBA agrees that adverse changes which are immaterial to the Licensee's financial status should not be a barrier to consideration for a draw of Leverage. Accordingly, &sect;107.215(f)(3)(i)(A) has been finalized with the suggested change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the comment letters also contained an objection to the requirement for specific deal information both pre- and post-draw. SBA reaffirms its position that while a Licensee need not have specific transactions under consideration in order to obtain SBA's commitment, draws under that commitment must be intended for use in a particular transaction with a particular small concern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ease the paperwork burden on Licensees, however, the statement evidencing the Licensee's need for the funds no longer requires that the Licensee provide the small concern's Standard Industrial Classification code number or a summary of the proposed financing. See proposed &sect;107.215(f)(2)(i)(B), finalized as &sect;107.215(f)(3)(i)(B). Instead, the statement must include only the name and address of the small concern, the amount of the proposed financing, and the scheduled closing date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBA is also extending by 30 days the due date for the written explanation of the failure to close a transaction. In summary, if the intended transaction closes, the Licensee must submit a Form 1031 (``Portfolio Financing Report'') within 30 days of the actual closing date. If the transaction fails to close, however, a written explanation must be filed with SBA within 60 days (instead of 30 days, as proposed) after the scheduled closing date. Penalties for the failure to file the Form 1031 or the written explanation remain unchanged from the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final documentation matter addressed in some of the comment letters concerns the requirement that a Licensee submit a certified statement with each draw request representing that it is in compliance with applicable regulations. The suggestion was made that SBA be permitted to accept draw requests in the event violations are disputed or are not material in nature. SBA has considered the suggestion and believes a clarification of the subject matter is in order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBA did not intend to apply a different standard to draw requests than it currently applies to Leverage requests. A Licensee with an unresolved regulatory violation that would not be cause for automatic disqualification for Leverage under the traditional funding process should not, for the same violation, be disqualified automatically from drawing down Leverage under the commitment funding process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In practice, there are two separate circumstances under the traditional funding process where SBA would consider favorably the Leverage request of a Licensee with an outstanding violation: (1) If the Licensee's violation is of a non-substantive provision of the Act or regulations and the Licensee has not repeatedly violated non-substantive provisions; or (2) if the Licensee has agreed with SBA on a course of action for the resolution of its violation, and if the terms of the agreement do not preclude the Licensee from obtaining Leverage prior to the resolution of the violation. In each case, the determination as to whether a violation exists is made by SBA, as is the decision to provide Leverage notwithstanding the violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBA has revised the proposed rule to allow for favorable consideration of a draw request under those two circumstances. See new paragraph 107.215(f)(2) ``Conditions to draws.'' Proposed &sect;107.215(f)(2) has been renumbered as &sect;107.215(f)(3), and now permits a Licensee to submit a certification that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, it is in compliance with applicable regulations (i.e., it has no unresolved regulatory violations) or an explanation as to the specific nature of any outstanding violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One additional change has been made to the proposed rule. The amount of the commitment fee was not set forth in the proposal. This final rule fixes -he commitment fee at 3% of the face amount of the pooled securities and 1% of the issue price of the Preferred Securities reserved under the commitment. As explained below, when pooled securities are issued by a Licensee as a draw against SBA's commitment, the 2% guaranty fee ordinarily due pursuant to &sect;107.210(d)(1) will be offset against the 3% commitment fee already paid. No additional payment will be necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the exception of some minor changes in wording, the proposed rule is otherwise adopted without change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effective immediately, any Licensee may submit an application for SBA's conditional commitment to reserve Leverage. The Application must be accompanied by the same financial information and other documentation as is required of Licensees applying for Leverage, except that no securities forms should accompany an application for SBA's commitment. For a Licensee wishing to participate in the next scheduled pooling of Leverage securities, and also wishing to obtain SBA's conditional commitment for future Leverage, separate applications should be filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A determination to grant a Licensee's request for a commitment will be made only after SBA reviews the applicant's financial and regulatory status as well as its representation as to projected needs. The actual amount of a commitment which SBA will approve for a particular Licensee will depend in part on factors other than the applicant Licensee's own financial and regulatory situation, including such matters as the anticipated need for Leverage by all other Licensees making Leverage requests and the amount of program authority appropriated by Congress for the fiscal year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commitment, when granted, will represent a conditional agreement on SBA's part to permit a Licensee to make draws against an agreed upon reserved amount of Leverage over a fixed period of time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a condition to a commitment's taking effect, the Licensee must pay a non-refundable commitment fee in the amount discussed above. Payment must be received within thirty days following SBA's issuance of the commitment, or prior to any draw against the commitment if requested within such thirty day period. When a Licensee issuing pooled securities draws against SBA's commitment, the amount of the user fee associated with the guarantee of the Licensee's security or securities will be debited against an account holding the commitment fees and credited against an account holding guaranty fees. Failure to make timely and full payment of the commitment fee will preclude any draws against the commitment, and will cause SBA's commitment to lapse automatically at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the thirtieth calendar day following SBA's issuance of the commitment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In any case, as mentioned above, SBA's commitment will also lapse at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the 60th calendar day preceding the close of the next full Federal fiscal year following issuance of such commitment. Under present law, the Federal fiscal year ends on September 30. Therefore, depending upon when within a given Federal fiscal year a commitment was extended, the term of the commitment may be as short as ten months or as long as twenty-two months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requests for a draw may be submitted at any time during the term of the commitment. It is contemplated that requests for a draw of pooled securities will, eventually, be funded as frequently as twice a month. Requests for a draw of preferred securities may be funded at any time. The minimum amount of any draw of pooled securities will be $1,000,000, with integral multiples of $100,000 permitted thereafter. Requests for draws of preferred securities may be in any amount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

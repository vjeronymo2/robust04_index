			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Latin America's dragon running out of puff: Signs that the global downturn is adversely affecting Chile's economy IT IS a mark of Chile's remarkable economic success that the prospect of 6 per cent growth this year is creating something of a panic among Santiago's business community. Only a few days ago Mr Jorge Marshall, the economics minister, was obliged to deny publicly that the country was in danger of slipping into recession. But there are signs that the world economic downturn is starting to catch up with Chile, which registered a 10.4 per cent rise in gross domestic product last year and which has seen growth averaging 7 per cent since 1987. 'For a while there may have been a feeling that Chile could defy gravity,' said one western diplomat. 'But now there is a consistent picture of unambiguous deceleration.' Such deceleration, which comes in spite of estimated 7-7.5 per cent growth in the first six months of this year, is most clearly marked in Chile's balance of trade position. This year the central bank is predicting a Dollars 500m (Pounds 335.5m) trade deficit, the first in 12 years, as the price of commodity exports slips and imports remain strong. In the first half of the year Chile recorded a Dollars 112m trade deficit, with exports down 4.1 per cent and imports up 19.3 per cent on the same period of 1992. Private economists predict that the current account deficit, which amounted to Dollars 583m last year, will widen in 1993 to Dollars 2bn-Dollars 2.2bn, or up to 5.5 per cent of GDP. However, most observers believe the country, which has Dollars 9.9bn in foreign exchange reserves and continues to attract healthy capital inflows, can sustain such deficits for a few years, but not indefinitely. The first six months of 1993 has seen a sharp deterioration in prices for Chile's main exports. The price of copper, which accounts for more than 30 per cent of export revenue, is likely to average considerably less than the government's budget estimate of 96 US cents a pound. Given that every one cent slide in the copper price costs the Treasury Dollars 22m, Chile would 'lose' about Dollars 200m at current prices. It is a measure of the country's fiscal prudence that at least Dollars 100m of this will be met from a Dollars 800m copper stabilisation fund accumulated since 1988. Other commodities have also suffered. The price of fishmeal has been affected by a rapid expansion of Peruvian production, while that of cellulose has slipped because of overcapacity and competition from recycled paper. Fruit growers, whose penetration of world markets has typified the country's dynamic export performance, claim that the European Community's restrictions on Chilean apples have cost the economy at least Dollars 100m. In all, economists estimate that, barring a sharp recovery in commodity prices, the country is likely to suffer a 'terms-of-trade shock' this year equivalent to 2-3 per cent of GDP. However, non-traditional exports such as salmon, wine and mining equipment surged by 10 per cent in the first six months, a sign of continued export diversification. The strong performance of such sectors adds weight to those who argue that Chile's economy, which underwent wholesale restructuring through the 1980s, is in a good position to weather the fleeting storm of low commodity prices. Although imports in general continue to grow, those of consumer goods are slowing. Consumer imports in the first half of this year, at Dollars 945m, were 14.5 per cent down on the second half of 1992. One economist called this 'welcome and necessary'. Imports of capital goods, on the other hand, were worth Dollars 1.6bn in the six months to June, against Dollars 1.2bn in the same period of last year. This suggests that levels of investment, and therefore the prospects for future growth, remain healthy. 'In terms of investment we can be satisfied,' said Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister. Government officials say that most fundamentals remain healthy. Inflation, at about 12 per cent, is in check while the peso, which has been appreciating steadily to the detriment of exporters, appears to be stabilising and may even edge down slightly.  Interest rates, which have been relatively high this year, are also likely to come down. The government appears to be keeping a tight rein on spending, in spite of pressures to relax controls ahead of presidential elections in December. The Finance Ministry projects a Dollars 500m balance of payments surplus this year. Mr Armen Kouyoumdjian, an economic consultant, still rates Chile's economy as the 'healthiest in the region'. Mr Foxley sees no cause for concern. 'One has to remember that the economy is going to grow by 6 per cent this year, that the rate of unemployment in Santiago is below 4 per cent for the first time in 30 years, and that we have record public and private investment as well as falling inflation.' There nevertheless remains the nagging worry that Chile, the self-styled 'dragon' of Latin America, may be running out of puff. As one diplomat put it: 'We're too close to the top to be able to see the bottom clearly.' He is one of the many observers who expects Chile to pull off a 'soft landing,' but warns it is too early to tell for certain.</p>

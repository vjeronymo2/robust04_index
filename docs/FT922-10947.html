			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Banco Popular advances 30% BANCO Popular, the Spanish retail bank, posted a 30 per cent rise in first-quarter net profits at Pta14.1bn (Dollars 134.7m), largely because of the partial sale of its subsidiary in France. The disposal of 50 per cent of the Paris-based Banco Popular Comercial to the Banco Comercial Portugues brought the Spanish institution Pta1.6bn in extraordinary profits during the period. Banco Popular's net profit for the first quarter from the day-to-day financial business stood at Pta12.5bn, a 15.5 per cent increase on the first quarter of 1991.</p>

Atsushi Nishikoori, a Sakigake (Harbinger) member of the  House of Representatives, told a press conference that the  party's Shimane branch opened its membership to foreigners the  same day. Other branches will follow the Shimane branch, he  said.    Sakigake was founded last June by 10 disaffected members of  the Liberal Democratic Party. Sakigake leader Masayoshi  Takemura joined the coalition government of Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa as the chief cabinet secretary last August.    It currently has 14 members in the 511-seat House of  Representatives.    Nishikoori said at least 14 foreign residents in Shimane  Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan side of western Honshu Island,  have expressed interest in joining the party. It will accept  foreigners who have lived in the prefecture for more than five  years or who have a Japanese spouse and have lived in the  prefecture for more than two years, if nominated by more than  two party members.    Nishikoori said opening the party to members of all  nationalities is an "appropriate" way to create a new party  suited to the demands of the world community. "Based on the  principle of equality, we will remove the obstacles one by one,"  he said.    Japan's two largest political parties, the LDP and the  Social  Democratic Party, stipulate that their members must be Japanese  nationals.    A senior member of Zainichito, a group of Korean residents  seeking the right to vote, said the Sakigake decision is  "wonderful."    Yi Chin-mi said "They're probably just aiming to expand the  number of party members, but we should use this as an  opportunity to work for getting the vote, given that it isn't  even known that foreigners in Japan don't have the right to  vote."</p>

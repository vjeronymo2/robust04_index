			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALES OUTPACE INVENTORY RISE  </P> <P> Business sales far outpaced inventory accumulation in August, the government  said Monday in a report that one analyst attributed to a mini-inventory  correction.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said inventories edged up 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted  $789.9 billion, while sales advanced a steep 3.1% to $526.8 billion. The pace  in inventories was down from a 0.9% hike in July, while sales rose from a 0.9%  decline the previous month.  </P> <P> The combination of sales advancing far faster than the accumulation of goods on  shelves and back lots is good news for the economy. If inventories were to pile  up excessively, it could mean cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs.  </P> <P> The Commerce report showed a decrease in the ratio of inventories to sales from  1.54 in July to 1.50 in August. That means it would take 1 1/2 months to  exhaust inventories at the August pace.  </P></p>

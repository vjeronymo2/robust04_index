			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a news conference following a cabinet meeting on  4 March, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki  said negotiations on the cellular phone issue -- one of the  major areas of trade dispute between Japan and the United States  -- could be nearing a conclusion.    He said: "Japanese and U.S. companies are talking to each  other actively and in depth; I would like to think we may soon  get some results from these talks."    He was asked if he thought a settlement would be possible by  17 March, the date on which the United States says it will  announce a list of sanctions measures against Japan.    He said: "I don't know," but ended on a note of cautious  optimism by saying the 17 March deadline could well prove to be  "a turning point" in the negotiations.</p>

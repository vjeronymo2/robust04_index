			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Exporters hit by EC payment losses ONE IN five UK exporters has suffered losses during the past year because of non-payment by customers elsewhere in the European Community, NCM Credit Insurance, Britain's leading export credit insurer, said yesterday. The cost of payment delays rose 52 per cent in the 12 months to June 30, it said in a quarterly study. For reasons of market secrecy it did not reveal the cash cost of payment delays. 'The outlook for UK exports, 60 per cent of which normally go to the EC, remains bleak,' said Ms Conni Randall, NCM business strategy director. Among the leading EC markets, losses due to non-payment were highest in France, where 20 per cent of exporters reported losses in the 12 months to June 30. Even Germany, regarded as one of Europe's most stable export markets, saw one in 14 companies reporting losses. Payment delays grew most strongly in Italy - up 150 per cent between June 1992 and June this year. Delays rose by more than 60 per cent in Germany. NCM, the Dutch-controlled company which two years ago acquired the short-term export credit arm of Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department, claims to account for 80 per cent of private-sector export insurance in the UK. Last year it provided cover for exports worth about Pounds 14bn. The database it used for the quarterly study draws on records of 2.5m companies worldwide.</p>

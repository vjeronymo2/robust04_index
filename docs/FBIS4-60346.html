			<p>BFN     [Text] The Saudis' inappropriate treatment of Iranian  pilgrims, and the restrictions and obstacles they created for  them with regard to the observance of the disavowal of the  pagans rituals, not only do not accord with the dignity of the  custodian of Mecca and the observance of sanctuary, but also, in  terms of political culture and the interests of the world  community, did not constitute the best solution.    Speaking at a meeting today of the country's judicial  authorities, Ayatollah Yazdi, head of the judiciary branch,  said: Governmental sense and wisdom dictate that, in order to  solve a particular case, the Saudi authorities should not set  themselves up against the world of Islam and regional countries  and face unanswerable questions from public opinion.    The judiciary chief said the recent action of the Zionist  regime was overt theft and blatant kidnapping. He declared:  Such ugly behavior by the illegitimate offspring of world  arrogance is not surprising, particularly since the raison  d'etre of the Zionist regime is usurpation and delinquence. The  deathly silence of the international forums and organizations  who talk about human rights is surprising and regrettable,  however.</p>

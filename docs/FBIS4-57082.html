			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maria Elena Gil] </F>   [Text] Pretoria, 11 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban President  Fidel Castro met privately with his South African counterpart,  Nelson Mandela, whose inauguration he attended here yesterday.  Early this morning, the Cuban leader visited Mandela at his  official residence where they held talks behind closed doors.    In statements made yesterday to the press, Fidel Castro  pointed out that the rise to power of the African National  Congress (ANC) opens new possibilities of cooperation between  the two countries. "Probably with no other country is there the  possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South  Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties  between both peoples," Castro said.    After meeting with Mandela, the Cuban head of state granted  an exclusive interview to SBC (South Africa Broadcasting  Company), the local television network, at the Arcadia Hotel  where he is staying with the rest of the high-level delegation  that accompanied him.    Concerning his first visit to this southern African nation,  whose Army clashed with Cuban troops in the struggle for  independence of Angola and Namibia, Fidel Castro said: "There  are two South Africas and two periods in the history of South  Africa. There was a period of strong confrontation, but now  there is a new South Africa where there is peace, respect, and  affection for Cuba."    The statesman confirmed he has been treated very  respectfully  by all sectors of society, not just the ANC, during his visit  here that began last Monday. We should all contribute to  harmony and peace in South Africa, he said, so that the results  of efforts and sacrifices will make this country a model for the  entire world.    He also appeared very emotional at Mandela's inaugural  ceremony which brought together more than 5,000 people in the  Union Building's amphitheater, where there were heads of state  and heads of government from approximately 40 countries.    Today, Fidel Castro ends his visit to South Africa, where he  also met with more than 20 leaders and representatives from  Africa and the Middle East.</p>

The city used $1.04 billion in foreign funds from January to  November, more than twice the figure in the same period of 1992,  Shen Jing, an official with the city's Economic Development  Bureau said last week.    Industrial output from foreign-funded firms was more than 29  billion yuan ($3.33 billion), or 73 percent of the city's total.  And the figure was 32 percent up on the same period in 1992,  Shen said.    The firms exported goods worth more than $5 billion, an  increase of 22.7 percent. That figure accounted for 69 percent  of the city's total.    In 1993, foreign investment still focused on industrial  programmes. However, more and more foreign businessmen invested  increasing amounts of cash in tertiary industry.    In addition, Shen said, well-known entrepreneurs and  international consortia began to turn their attention to the  special economic zone.    "These investors, instead of investing on one specific item,  moved into a variety of trade and professions in a bid to  develop overall," he said.    Li Ka-shing, the richest entrepreneur in Hong Kong, helped  Shenzhen establish the Shenzhen Chang Ho Industrial Company and  he invested in many fields.    Last year, Li signed an investment agreement to help build  Yantian Habour which involved huge amounts of cash from the Hong  Kong side.    Kumagai Gumi, a well-known a Japanese firm, invested in  electronic appliances and in putting up large commercial  buildings.    To encourage foreign investment in the city, Shen said, a  series of favourable policies and economic regulations were set  up, which greatly invigorated economic activity.    According to a recent study, more than 80 percent of the  foreign-funded enterprises in the city made profits.    All American-funded firms had annual profits of more than 15  percent and over 50 percent of the companies recovered their  investment.    The output of Huaqiang Sanyo Electronics, a Sino-Japanese  joint venture, has increased by more than 1000 percent since it  was set up 12 years ago. Its sales volume hit more than 1.4  billion yuan ($160.92 million) last year.    In addition, Shen said, more than 120 foreign-funded  enterprises were awarded Nationally Advanced Foreign-funded Firm  titles.    In a related development, Shenzhen became China's highest  exporting city for the first time last year.    It exported $7.2 billion-worth of products from January to  November, up by 15.7 percent on the same period in 1992, said  figures from the Trade Development Bureau.    The total figure for 1993 was expected to be $7.8 billion,  up  14.7 percent on the previous year.    The achievement was made possible by the work of more than  400 foreign trade enterprises and foreign-funded firms as well  as processors of imported materials, said a bureau spokesman.    Exports by foreign-funded enterprises totalled $5.1 billion,  an increase of 22.6 percent. The figure for processing  factories was $550 million, up by 14.9 percent, and exports to  distant countries were $490 million, up 27.3 percent.    In addition, the spokesman said, 21 firms were allowed to  set  up overseas offices in new markets including Malaysia,  Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam.    The city also organized or participated in many fairs both  at  home and abroad last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Stevan Cordas] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, Feb 16 (TANJUG) -- The U.N. Security  Council [UNSC] has failed to give the green light to NATO to  launch air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, diplomatic circles  in Belgrade said on Wednesday.    They interpret this by the fact that a decision was not  reached even after the two-day Security Council session on the  Bosnian crisis and the NATO ultimatum.    The diplomats believe that, in view of such an outcome of  the  Security Council session, the NATO bombardment of the Serb  positions would represent an aggression, rather than a move  towards a peaceful solution to the Bosnian crisis.    The (un)expected [as received] outcome of the session also  means that Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali was not given  permission to order the NATO air strikes.    China's Security Council representative openly said that  Peking [as received] opposes the NATO bombardment.    In talks with British Prime Minister John Major, Russian  President Boris Yeltsin said that a solution to the Bosnian  crisis cannot be sought without Russia.    The diplomats in Belgrade believe that Peking's and Moscow's  firm stands were clearly decisive for the outcome of the latest  Security Council session.    In the meantime, the world has already started the countdown  for the NATO ultimatum.    In NATO bases in Italy there are as many as 170 war planes.    Four more days remain until the deadline expires, but it is  uncertain whether NATO will attack the Serb positions around  Sarajevo without a direct Security Council decision.    Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who was in  Belgrade  on Tuesday, said that the NATO ultimatum cannot be interpreted  as directed only against the Bosnian Serbs. He claims that the  ultimatum was given to all three warring sides.    Papoulias' interpretation is identical to NATO's decision to  threaten the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims with air strikes unless  they withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo to 20 km  away from the city's centre. However, everyone abroad is  speaking only about the ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, while  the Muslims and Croats are not mentioned at all.    Croatia also faces sanctions if it fails to comply with a  U.N. demand to pull out its regular troops from Bosnia by  February 16.    However, Croatia is hardly likely to meet this demand and it  is even more improbable that it will be punished for this  because some Western countries have already come up with reasons  for Croatia's failure to withdraw. They are saying that the  presence of regular Croat troops in Bosnia is good because they  are "holding back" the Bosnian Croat forces.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>   [Text] Sofia, April 12 (BTA) -- "Bulgaria's position of  non- intervention in the developments in Sarajevo was spelled  out by President Zhelev and Prime Minister Berov and will remain  unchanged," STANDART NEWS quotes Defence Minister Valentin  Aleksandrov as saying in Ankara, where he is on an official  visit. A STANDART NEWS special correspondent reported that the  prevailing opinion in Ankara is that the Turkish contingent to  Sarajevo will hardly be allowed to cross Greece and Bulgaria,  and Turkey is ready to send it by sea.    Quoting government sources, 24 CHASA says that U.S  Ambassador  to Sofia William Montgomery asked "recently" that "Turkish blue  helmets be granted passage through Bulgaria." According to the  daily, President Zhelev and senior diplomats had been under  strong pressure. "Some of them were even given a hint that if  Sofia complied, its foreign debt problems would be settled in  the talks with the creditors of the Paris and the London Club,"  24 CHASA says. It quotes U.S. Press Attache William Cook, who  "categorically denied yesterday that U.S. officials had attacked  Bulgarian institutions about the passage of Turkish  peacekeepers."</p>

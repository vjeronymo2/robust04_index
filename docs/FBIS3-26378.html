Autonomous regional party, government, and military  leaders Gyaincain Norbu, Basang, Lieque, Puqung, Sengqen Lozong  Gyaincain, Samding Doje Pamo, Luosang Danzeng, Jangzhong Zhaxi  Doje, Lhamin Soinam Lhunzhub, Jimzhong Gyaincain Puncog, Lhalu  Cewang Doje, Tangmai Gongjue Baimu, Gonbasar Tubdanjigzha,  Cedain Zhoima, Hu Yongzhu, and Ga Jin ushered in the new year  with people from all walks of life.    Basang, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party  committee, extended new year's greetings to people from all  walks of life on behalf of the autonomous regional party  committee, the autonomous regional people's congress, the  autonomous regional government, and the autonomous regional  committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference. She said: At this moment, we especially cherish  the memory of the 10th Panchen Lama. He was a great patriot and  a banner for our united front. Although it has been five years  since his death, his patriotic spirit, as well as his spirit of  working hard for the country and the people, always deserves to  be emulated and always inspires us to move forward. We also  miss our Tibetan compatriots who are living in exile abroad. We  hope that the Dalai Lama will end his exile at an early date,  return to the motherland, contribute to the motherland's unity,  national unity, and economic development; and do useful work to  promote the Tibetan people's prosperity and happiness.</p>

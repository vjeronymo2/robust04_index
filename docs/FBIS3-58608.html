			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique jointly released by the Presidential Office and </F> the Prime Minister's Office the evening of 11 January on the  devaluation of the CFA franc]    [Text] The heads of state and of government of the African  countries in the franc zone have decided to modify the parity of  the CFA franc and the Comoran franc in relation to the French  franc. France has given its agreement to this decision which  aims to restore the right conditions for lasting economic growth  by enabling the resumption of international funding. This  decision will consolidate the recovery efforts in which many  countries in the franc zone are already involved.    France, which is in the front rank of the international  financial community, will not fail to show its solidarity with  its partners. To this end, it will closely follow and  participate in the implementation of the necessary accompaying  measures, particularly those intended to support the most  underprivileged populations.    France will step up its effort to promote economic and  social  development. New measures to cancel and reduce the debt have  also been decided in continuation of the action taken in this  sphere by President Francois Mitterrand. These different  measures bear witness to France's resolute and tangible support  for the franc zone and to the preferential ties it maintains  with its partners."</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (14): Battleground where giants contend - Software and computer services EUROPE is the cockpit for the latest round in the battle of the information technology giants - the struggle for a leading position in software and computer services (SCS). SCS is a heterogeneous sector, difficult to define and analyse. In Europe, there may be as many as 16,000 small SCS companies as well as a small number of large ones, not one of which has more than a few per cent of the market. The sector comprises, however, five broad areas of activity. First, there is consulting services, including the development and management of IT strategy. The consulting arms of the large accounting firms, Andersen Consulting, Price Waterhouse, Arthur Young and so on have traditionally had a strong position in this area, as have the US management consultancies McKinsey and CSC-Index. Few European owned consulting firms have the global perspective and coverage of these large players, nor have they the financial muscle to stay at the forefront of research and development. Second, processing services. Computer bureaux offering simple data processing services to companies without their own computers are effectively extinct, killed off by the growth of the microcomputer (although a few companies have maintained a thriving business in payroll processing). Today processing services encompasses sophisticated activities like facilities management and data network management. Cap Gemini Sogeti (CGS) of France, Sema Group of the UK/France and Electronic Data Systems of the US are among the leaders. Third, professional services. The traditional stamping ground for SCS companies, this includes technical assistance, business software, industrial software, training and education. The leaders include CGS, Sema Group of the UK/France and Volmac of Holland. Fourth, software packages. This area has always been dominated by US companies; when mainframes were at theheart of the computer business, financial packages from Management Science America and McCormack &amp; Dodge were the principal competition to bespoke solutions written by European companies. Now major US microcomputer software suppliers like Microsoft, Lotus Development Corporation and Wordperfect have the lion's share of a market in which few European companies have any presence. Fifth, systems integration (SI). SI has many definitions, but essentially means putting together the best mix of software and hardware to solve a customer's IT problem. Large SI contracts are often let on a fixed price basis and demand considerable expertise on the part of the computing services company if costly delays and overruns are to be avoided. SD-Scicon, a UK computing services company in which British Aerospace held a stake, was sold last year to EDS of the US after more than a dozen fixed price contracts slipped out of control leading to more than Pounds 20m in losses. According to Sema Consulting, a leading Anglo-French player in the SCS sector, the European market is the world's second largest after the US with sales estimated at Ecu85bn in 1995. Sema says: 'The European market is expected to grow at 12 per cent from 1990 to 1995, much reduced from the average annual growth rate of 24 per cent of the past five years.' Sema says that systems integration and software packages have the highest growth rate while professional services and software packages will account for two thirds of the market by 1995. Computing services, nevertheless, remains one of the few areas of growth in an industry hit by recession and market saturation. That is why it is so important to so many different kinds of player. The large computer manufacturers, for example, are exanding their services activities to compensate for declining profit margins on hardware. ICL, the UK-based subsidiary of Fujitsu of Japan, now derives more than half its revenues from services. IBM is strengthening its activities in systems integration. Earlier this month in the UK it announced it would set up a separate computing services company with a staff of 1,500 to tackle facilities management and consultancy. There is a measure of scepticism among traditional SCS companies about these moves on the part of hardware manufacturers; the fact remains that when IBM expands into a market sector, everybody has to take its presence seriously. These trends are contributing to the changes the SCS industry is going through. The market is maturing, technological change shows no signs of decelerating and there is a shift towards a more capital intensive industry  -with the inevitable acceleration in the rate of mergers and acquisitions as the principal players look for size to guarantee stability and survival. Where are the European-owned players in all of this? Unlike the hardware business, where Europe has little to offer, it has a range of skills in software and services that are the equal of any. It has, however, few companies with the size, finance and skills of EDS, the computer services arm of General Motors. An exception is Cap-Gemini-Sogeti, the largest SCS company in Europe with annual sales of about FFr10bn. It has pursued an aggressive acquisition policy at home and abroad with the intention of building a company with strengths in France, the rest of Europe and North America. To date, few European software houses have made much of an impact outside their home countries. SAP of Germany is, however, having considerable success providing integrated accounting software to large corporations who are beginning to standardise world-wide on its product. Microfocus of the UK continues successfully to sell software tools which make it simpler to write programs in Cobol, the most common business computer language. There is, however, no real European challenger to the major US packages like Microsoft's MS/DOS and Windows 3.0 or Lotus Development Corporation's 1-2-3 spreadsheet. And none is likely to appear unless the European Commission can bring about a speedy harmonisation of national traits and practices. Europe remains a collection of small, heterogeneous markets where software cannot be moved easily from country to country. European countries lack the skills in international marketing and distribution necessary to succeed overseas, especially in the US. An interesting test case is Sage Group of the UK, a successful supplier of low cost accounting software in its home market, which has bought a somewhat similar US company, DacEasy Inc, of Dallas, which has been selling its accounting software internationally.</p>

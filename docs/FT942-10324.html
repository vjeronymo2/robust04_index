			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Ploughs in search of fertile lands: Upheavals in the US and European farm equipment industry For years farm equipment manufacturers in the US and Europe have ploughed a lonely, and increasingly tough, furrow. Sales have declined as farmers have battled against recession and tended to buy fewer, larger tractors. Other opportunities - in Asia, for instance - have been slow to open up, and offer limited immediate rewards. Factories have been closed, merged or sold. But in the last month there have been tentative signs of a revival of interest in the industry's growth prospects. Agco, the fast-growing, Atlanta-based farm equipment group, has paid Dollars 328m to buy Massey Ferguson, the UK tractor manufacturer based in the Midlands, from Varity, the US industrial group. A day before that deal was announced, Tenneco, the Houston-based industrial group, said it intended to sell 35 per cent of its J. I. Case farm and construction equipment division via a public share offering. The decision apparently reflected a belief that it was a good time to sell. If the deals go through, two diversified US corporations will have signalled a strategic shift away from the tractor and farm equipment industry. But others will have taken their place. It is easier to explain the motives of the sellers than the buyers. Demand for the industry's products has sunk, resulting in serious overcapacity and financial losses for manufacturers. In the US, recession and the heavy burden of farm debts in the mid-1980s forced many farmers off the land and a consolidation of small farms into larger ones. The farmers that were left have bought larger, better-made tractors which last longer than they did 20 years ago. In consequence, North American tractor sales have fallen from 195,000 units in 1980 to 115,000 last year. In Europe, tractor sales have plunged from about 300,000 in 1980 to 135,000 last year. This is because of the European Union's farm set-aside programmes, high interest rates which have dented farmers' willingness to invest, and farmers' 'machinery rings' for sharing heavy equipment, including tractors. Reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992, including cuts in cereal prices and increased compensation payments for farmers who take land out of production, have piled on the pressure. No farm equipment maker escaped unscathed. Massey Ferguson, for example, has shut all its North American plants. In Europe, larger producers, which formerly had three or four tractor factories, have cut back to one or two. Case, for example, is to shut its Neuss tractor factory, near Dusseldorf, in 1996, leaving Doncaster in the UK as its only European tractor plant. It is also restructuring its UK and French operations. Besides closing factories, farm equipment manufacturers are also sharing production. The most important deal was announced in January, between Renault, the French vehicle manufacturer, and Deere, the largest US tractor maker. Renault will supply medium-sized tractors to replace a Deere model currently manufactured in Mannheim, Germany, and Madrid. In return, Deere's plant in Saran, France, will supply diesel engines for Renault tractors. Another result of the retrenchment has been a series of big takeovers, mainly in the US. Once-thriving enterprises have been swallowed up as their losses have become unsustainable - most of International Harvester, the US farm equipment group, for example, was bought by Case in 1985. In Europe, the process of retrenchment seems far from complete: it still has at least 40 tractor producers, many with very small market shares and declining volumes. In the past year market conditions have improved. UK tractor sales are at their highest level since 1989, while in the US 'there is a mini-boom taking place', says Mr Eli Lustgarten, analyst with PaineWebber, the US broker. But rather than reversing the trend towards retrenchment, some large farm equipment manufacturers have taken the revival as a chance to sell up. Explaining why his company sold Massey Ferguson, Mr Victor Rice, Varity's chairman, says it sees stronger growth in its other businesses  - diesel engines and automotive braking systems. Tenneco, too, says it will redeploy proceeds from the sale of its stake in Case - expected to be about Dollars 500m - into less cyclical, higher-growth businesses, such as automotive parts. Their decisions reflect an assumption that, notwithstanding the current revival, the long-term outlook for the tractor and farm equipment industry is lacklustre. 'We, like the whole industry, believe that over the long term retail sales of agricultural equipment will continue to decline. Europe is a very difficult environment for our business, given the CAP and weakness in the general economy,' says a Deere spokesman. Economic conditions are only part of the story: there is also a belief that the long-term growth areas are going to be those where profit margins are smaller. 'The most discouraging factor is the likely shrinkage of the market size in profitable areas, where you can sell tractors with higher specification,' says Mr Chris Barrow-Williams, analyst at the London-based consultancy, Corporate Intelligence Group. 'In Europe and the US, tractors are four-wheel drive, not two-wheel drive, and often have a computer on board. They have 36-speed gearboxes, while Africa wants eight-speed gearboxes,' he says. But if the announcements of the last month were logical moves for Varity and Tenneco, what are the motives of the new owners? One possible explanation is that they believe farm equipment manufacturers fare better when separated from other operations. In the 1980s, when Ford Motor of the US was still in the tractor business, its commitment to the industry was often questioned: there seemed little synergy between its tractor operation, with its very long product cycles, and the more dynamic car business. But in 1985, Ford's tractor business took over the farm equipment division of Sperry (now part of Unisys, the US computer group) to create Ford New Holland. In 1991, Ford New Holland was taken over by Fiat and combined with the Italian group's earth-moving and farm equipment interests. Though still under the wing of a large vehicle group, the increased size of the company, now called New Holland, and its global spread have resulted in a greater independence. The workforce of 30,000 in 1991 has been cut to 18,200, but New Holland has eliminated duplication, streamlined production and stripped out bureaucracy, enabling it to direct more money to product development. It claims to have raised its share of the main world tractor markets, and its financial performance is improving, although last year it still made a pre-tax loss. Similarly, Agco believes Massey can flourish under its wing, rather than under the control of a broad industrial conglomerate such as Varity. Mr Robert Ratliff, Agco chairman, notes that Massey has already made capacity cuts. Mr Dominic Chauvin, Massey's president, says the takeover could bring new opportunities for Massey's plants at Coventry and Beauvais, France, as Agco moves to exploit its expanded global base through broadening sales of farm equipment lines acquired in the US over the past three years. Mr Chauvin says there is also potential for growth in developing countries of the Far East and in eastern Europe, although sales are constrained because local farmers rarely have sufficient finance to buy expensive tractors. 'As soon as there is a mechanism for improving financing, there should be additional opportunities,' he says. Such patience requires a long-term commitment to the farm equipment industry. But the larger manufacturers that remain in the industry appear confident of reaping reasonable returns from a global market where much of the ground is stony.</p>

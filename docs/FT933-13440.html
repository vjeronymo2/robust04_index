			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: MacMillan Bloedel returns to the black HIGHER-VALUE wood products for North American and overseas construction markets enabled MacMillan Bloedel to report a profitable second quarter this year. However, the pulp, newsprint and containerboard markets continued to be weak, said Mr Robert Findlay, president. MacMillan would cut costs further and concentrate on producing higher-margin products in the most economic locations, he said. Second-quarter net profit was CDollars 22.5m (USDollars 17.6m), or 19 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 7.1m, or 8 cents a share. Sales were CDollars 964m, up nearly 25 per cent. For the first six months of the year, profit was CDollars 68.8m, or 57 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 18.1m, or 20 cents a share last time. Half-year sales were CDollars 1.8bn, up 20 per cent. Mr Findlay said that in the current six months, North American timber prices should remain at current lower levels but export prices should average about first half-levels. Canadian Pacific Forest Products, one of North America's biggest newsprint producers, reduced its second-quarter operating loss to CDollars 11m from a CDollars 53m deficit a year earlier. Sales rose by 6 per cent to CDollars 490m. For the first six months of 1993, losses totalled CDollars 49m against CDollars 120m. Half-year sales were 5 per cent higher at CDollars 941m. Strong wood products markets were the main factor, but newsprint shipments and prices were higher. Production costs declined and a lower Canadian dollar helped. However, the pulp, paperboard and white paper markets were weak and two joint ventures reported higher losses. Interest expenses rose because of continuing heavy capital outlays financed through term debt. Offshore timber products markets were firm in the second quarter, despite a 40 per cent drop in North American prices, but the Japanese market is now being adversely affected by the recession. CPFP is raising CDollars 130m by spinning off its wood products business into a separate, publicly-held subsidiary. Better demand for fine papers and strong timber products markets helped Noranda Forest to report its first quarterly profit in three years for the three months ended June. Second-quarter net profit was CDollars 4m against a loss of CDollars 21m on sales of CDollars 374m against CDollars 367m. In February, Noranda sold 49 per cent of MacMillan Bloedel for CDollars 997m: this week it announced the disposal of 50 per cent of a western fine paper group for CDollars 82m. The first-half loss equalled 40 cents a share against 39 cents, on sales of CDollars 761m, adjusted for the MacMillan transaction. Primax, a western wood product company that sells mainly to Japan, doubled second-quarter earnings to CDollars 4.4m, or 51 cents a share. It warned that Japanese prices were declining.</p>

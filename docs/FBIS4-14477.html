			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 31 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's Russian  newspapers concentrate on an idea of setting up a Eurasian Union  (EAU), which was put forth by Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev.    "The Kazakh president seeks to replace the moribund  structures of the Commonwealth of Independent States with new  organisations resembling more the European Union than the USSR,"  the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes.    Praising "the reasonable, realistic and vital" idea of  creating the EAU, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA daily stresses that this  initiative "was recently agitating the minds of politicians in  post-Soviet space".    The PRAVDA newspaper shares this appraisal, noting that "the  euphoria of sovereignties has passed". The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  newspaper forecasts that "the idea of reforming the CIS will be  amplified at the next Commonwealth summit.    Summing up the results of the Kazakh president's visit to  Moscow, which ended on Wednesday, PRAVDA stresses that the sides  at the talks "made real headway to bring the two republics  closer together".    Commenting on the results of the Russian-Kazakh summit, the  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper dwells at length on duel  citizenship which the Kazakh side refused to discuss. According  to the newspaper, "this question was postponed: the problem of  Russians in Kazakhstan still remains".    "The CIS development will be stable if all the Commonwealth  members take into account the principles of the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe to a greater extent," CSCE  Secretary-General Wilhelm Hoeynck said in an interview with  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA.    He sees the CSCE's task in 1994 "in creating stability in  the  region between Vancouver to Vladivostok" and favours the  development of contacts between the CSCE and the CIS.    Newspapers single out, among other topics, the survival of  Russian science. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI notes that scientists are at  the bottom of the list of civil servants for the remuneration of  their labour.    According to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, this causes the outflow of  specialists to other spheres of employment, which means the doom  of fundamental science. "There will be no top-notch specialists  in Russia by the year 2013," the newspaper cites calculations by  the institute of social and political research of the Russian  academy of sciences.    "Medical science will not survive, if authorities brush it  aside," president of the Russian academy of medical sciences  Valentin Pokrovskiy said in an interview with PRAVDA. He  substantiates the need for state investments in medical  fundamental science. According to the scientist, it "takes the  32nd place out of 35 as to its financing".    Speaking of non-payments in industry, Economics Institute  director Leonid Abalkin claims in his article in NEZAVISMAYA  GAZETA that "non-payments were provoked by the Finance  Ministry's actions".    The author examines in detail questions of employment and  investments in the Russian economy.    The Russian President's special representative Vitaliy  Churkin commented in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on particulars of an  agreement concluded on Wednesday between Krajina Serbs and  Croats at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb.    According to Churkin, "a new round of talks on economic  issues between Croats and Krajina Serbs can be arranged" in  Zagreb in two weeks' time.    "Work on reorganising security bodies has been completed. A  new Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCIS) has been  established in Russia," FCIS director Sergey Stepashin told  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. He described activities of Russian secret  services.    Lithuania "has no such service as counterintelligence"  Vytautas Petkevicius, chaiman of the Lithuanian parliament  committee on national security, said in an interview with  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA.    According to Petkevicius, the small Lithuanian Army "has not  even regulations, let alone a military doctrine" and will be  used for "putting down conflicts".    Writing in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, Sakha (Yakut) President  Mikhail nikolayev opposed the dumping of the federal treaty  which has not become a part of the Russian constitution.    Regarding the treaty as "a long-term document", Nikolyaev  calls for "making it an object of every-day policy".</p>

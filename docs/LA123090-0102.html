			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ONE CITY'S CONSERVATION SHOWS THE WAY;  </P> <P> * OTHER ORANGE COUNTY AREAS MAY END UP AS PRESSED FOR WATER AS SAN CLEMENTE WAS  </P> <P> When the Metropolitan Water District recently announced that it would impose  rationing on water districts next year, most local authorities in Orange County  said they have no immediate plans to impose mandatory restrictions on  businesses or residential customers and anticipate no rate increases in the  future.  </P> <P> That was possible because Orange County in general has done a satisfactory job  of responding to voluntary calls for conservation, and because the northern  part of the county benefits from good luck: It is blessed not so much by its  efforts to save water as by its location. It sits atop an underground lake that  supplies a good deal of water.  </P> <P> But it's a different story in the southern cities, which have had high growth  in recent years and are most dependent on imported water from the MWD and other  sources.  </P> <P> One of those communities, San Clemente, has just completed a full year's  experience with mandatory water rationing. The results are heartening for other  communities that might end up as pressed as San Clemente was; it simply had to  act because it was running out of water.  </P> <P> The results of the experience of cracking the whip for a year are that --  despite an increase in both residential and commercial customers -- San  Clemente has dropped to about 62% of last year's consumption. And by the way,  San Clemente has positioned itself well for the new water rationing ahead.  Because the city has already undertaken a water conservation program, the water  it has saved so far will be credited against the water reduction quota that  will be imposed by the Metropolitan Water District.  </P> <P> In San Clemente during the past year, a building moratorium was imposed, lawn  watering was allowed only during certain hours, and on assigned days, and water  wasters were subject to fines.  </P> <P> The City Council also voted to contribute $723,000 to help install water-saving  plumbing fixtures in homes built before a state law went into effect requiring  those devices. And most important, individual residents have been inspired to  do such things as remove grass from back yards and install brick and cactus.  Creating the atmosphere for water conservation where residents take it upon  themselves to find ways of saving is a plus that can pay off for the long term.  </P> <P> If the drought continues, other county communities may have to impose more  severe curbs. For them San Clemente has shown the way in the first year.  </P></p>

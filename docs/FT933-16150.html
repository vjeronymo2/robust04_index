			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Van Miert says subsidies threaten single market THE European Community risks embarking on a damaging race to subsidise state-owned industries which could endanger the single market, Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC's competition commissioner, said yesterday. The reluctance of Italy and Spain to co-operate with the European Commission on restructuring their steel industries was likely to force postponement of a crucial ministerial meeting later this month, he said. The meeting, set for July 26, was due to discuss the politically sensitive question of state aid and capacity cuts in the Italian, Spanish and east German steel industries. Agreement then would have laid the ground for an accord this autumn on restructuring the whole EC industry. Mr Van Miert said: 'Private enterprises are making a salutary effort (to fall in with Commission plans), but state enterprises are ready to use aid without making a positive contribution by reducing their capacity.' He added: 'Members are not only disregarding the rules of the game, they increasingly don't accept them.' In particular, state-owned steelmakers were refusing to make drastic capacity cuts as the price for state subsidies. Speaking in Bonn, Mr Van Miert indicated that the overall steel restructuring plan would be at risk if member states did not co-operate. 'In the steel sector, it has become clear that we do not have enough power at our disposal to carry out our policies,' he said. The success of the overall plan has always depended on the fragile goodwill of steelmakers and politicians, who must co-operate to cut capacity and reduce state aids. Commission officials said yesterday that Italy was particularly reluctant to adapt to Brussels' demands that Ilva, the state-owned steel group, make 3m tonnes of capacity cuts. They indicated that Brussels would try to find other ways to force Ilva into line. The EC steel industry has been hit by recession, overcapacity, and an influx of cheap steel imports from eastern Europe. The Commission has insisted that the industry comes up with a viable restructuring plan by October.</p>

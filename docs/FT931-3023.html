			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Reforms extend principle of mitigation - VAT Penalties REFORMS TO all the principal VAT penalties were proposed in the Budget, which the Treasury said were 'intended to achieve the correct balance between the rights of the individual trader and of the vast majority of businesses which pay their tax accurately and on time'. The changes envisaged are: Reforms to the penalty for misdeclarations made on VAT returns, intended to reduce the number of penalties issued by 40 per cent. The introduction of mitigation for penalties assessed after Royal assent will give Customs additional flexibility to deal with hard cases. The removal of restrictions on mitigation of penalties for civil fraud, allowing Customs or the VAT tribunals to reduce the penalty as they see fit. The extension of mitigation to certain other civil penalties - including the penalty for late registration - for assessments made after Royal assent. Reforms to the default surcharge for making late returns or paying VAT late. The measures include an immediate reduction in the top rate of surcharge (from 20 to 15 per cent) and a new minimum surcharge of Pounds 200. Surcharges for less than Pounds 200 will not be issued except for persistent defaulters. This will take effect later this year and could take up to 125,000 small traders out of surcharge altogether. Capping interest charged on misdeclarations so that assessments of interest will not date back more than three years. The measure will come into force as soon as computer changes can be made later this year. The Treasury said a review of repayment supplement (the penalty on Customs for the late processing of repayments) was in progress and may lead to changes later in the year. The same principles will be observed as in the review of penalties on traders. The government intends to retain the repayment supplement as a deterrent measure, and not as commercial restitution. The commissioners are to have to mitigate misdeclaration penalties and their decision will be appealable to a VAT tribunal. Some factors will be excluded by the Finance Bill in determining the degree of mitigation. These will be whether the trader has acted in good faith, inability to pay, and whether or not there has been a net loss to the Exchequer. The Treasury also announced: A change in the base against which misdeclarations are tested for seriousness. The net tax base, which is the net amount of tax which is payable or repayable, will be replaced by a gross tax base, equal to the sum of input tax and output tax reflecting the trader's tax throughput. A new test to target repeated misdeclarations, replacing the old persistent misdeclaration penalty (PMP). The changes will be introduced by Treasury order after a decent interval following Royal assent. Until then, Customs will not normally assess penalties under the current provisions. The chancellor also announced removal of mitigations on penalties on tax evaded, which can currently be given on the grounds of a trader's co-operation in determining the true liability to tax. In future, said the Treasury, 'the commissioners of Customs and Excise, or, on appeal, a tribunal, will have power to vary the penalty to such amount as they see fit. The only limitations in determining the amount of reduction are that no regard will be given to the trader's inability to pay or to the fact that there may have been no loss of tax to the Exchequer. This easement will make mitigation more flexible and bring Customs more into line with Inland Revenue procedures.' The maximum rate of default surcharge - imposed on businesses which have been late in rendering returns or making full payment of tax on three occasions within a set period - is reduced to 20 per cent. Other reforms include: Lowering the maximum rate of surcharge further, from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. Notifying first defaults to the trader rather than notifying only on the second default as now. This will bring forward liability to surcharge to the second default rather than the third as at present, but there will be a new lower starting rate of surcharge at 2 per cent. Not issuing surcharge assessments for less than Pounds 200, except when they are calculated at either of the two top rates of surcharge. Linking surcharge liability and the rate of surcharge only to late payments of tax and not to late VAT returns. There is no liability to default surcharge if traders can satisfy Customs or a VAT tribunal that there is a 'reasonable excuse' for late payment. Interest is charged on all misdeclarations of tax under Section 18 of the Finance Act 1985. The capping at three years will mean that interest is not assessed to a date more than three years prior to the assessment of the tax misdeclared. Interest will continue to accrue, however, if the tax assessment remains unpaid. The cost of the changes is Pounds 50m in 1993-94 and Pounds 75m in a full year.</p>

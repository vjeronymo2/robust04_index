			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wetherspoon flotation to raise Pounds 24m for pubs expansion JD WETHERSPOON, the London chain of pubs which feature cheap real ale and no music, will offer shares worth Pounds 24m when it is floated shortly on the stock exchange - a higher figure than initially expected. The group is expected to have a market capitalisation of between Pounds 40m to Pounds 45m. A pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, said the shares would be placed with institutional investors, with an as yet unspecified number of shares available for financial intermediaries. Dealing will start about a week after the final prospectus is published, which is expected in about a fortnight. The company will raise at least Pounds 18m and existing shareholders are expected to raise Pounds 6m. Mr Tim Martin, 37, who founded the rapidly-expanding chain, is not selling any shares leaving him with about 25 per cent of the company post-flotation. The company has 44 outlets within the M25 and will use the proceeds from the flotation to develop a further 18 sites for which it has obtained planning and licensing permission.</p>

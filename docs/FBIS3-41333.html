Nevertheless, the PGR [Office of the Attorney General of the  Republic] authorities warned that these chemical substances  accelerate considerably the irreversible damage to the human  body among persons consuming them. They are particularly harmful  to the brain and other vital organs.    The office noted that the drug dealers, faced with the large  confiscations made and the destruction of over a million  marijuana and poppy crops, are known to have been forced to  curtail their activities. They must now import most of their  narcotics, including the synthetic types processed mainly in the  United States.    By way of example, it mentioned the seizure of approximately  70 kg of Thai heroin, discovered in offices of the Mexican  Postal Service in Tijuana and Ensenada, Baja California.    It also gave a reminder of the interception, in the port of  Manzanillo, Colima, of 10 tons of Colombian marijuana discovered  in containers of vessels named Cordoba and Chimborazo.  Furthermore, in Mazatlan, Sinaloa, the authorities confiscated a  shipment of South American cocaine and cannabis indica worth  millions.    It stressed that, because of their strong intoxicating  power,  the synthetic or laboratory-produced drugs cause irreversible  damage to the human body, and that, as a rule, those using them  become automatically addicted.</p>

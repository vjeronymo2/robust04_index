			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Coalition set to change its hue: Christian Democrats could be shut out for first time since the war The Dutch need not be experienced pollsters to know that next week's general election will result in a coalition. Coalitions, their creation and their downfall are the very stuff of Netherlands politics, and the election on May 3 will be no exception, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. This year, however, the prospect of a 'purple' coalition - one embracing the Labour party, with its traditional red logo, the left-of-centre D66, and the 'Tory' blue right-wing Liberals - is exciting the population. Such a left-right alliance would be all the more unusual because it would shut out the centrist Christian Democrats, linchpin of every cabinet since the second world war and force them into opposition. The precise composition of the next government will take weeks, and perhaps even months, to work out. It is already clear, however, that this election will be the closest in years. Support is falling sharply for the Christian Democrats and Labour, the two parties (traditionally the largest) which comprise the present governing coalition. At the same time, the two smaller 'swing' parties, the Liberals and D66, are gaining ground. Recent polls indicate that these four parties will each win between 25 and 35 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament. This implies that the next coalition will need, for the first time since the 1970s, to include at least three parties to create a majority. 'These is the most dramatic shift within the political arena that I've ever experienced,' says Mr Ger Schild, director of research at Nipo, the Netherlands' leading polling organisation. The swing away from the Christian Democrats reflects their internal divisions as the party's veteran prime minister, Mr Ruud Lubbers, makes way for his successor, Mr Elco Brinkman. The latest Nipo poll gives the party just 29 seats, against its current 54. The Labour Party, by contrast, is still suffering in the polls because of the role it played in reforming disability insurance, a central part of the country's generous welfare state system. This alienated the party's traditional voters and Labour is forecast to drop to 35 seats from 49 seats in 1989. However, this represents a gradual recovery from late last year when the party was forecast to win less than 25 seats. Labour has been helped by the cross-party popularity of its leader, Mr Wim Kok, who is finance minister in the current centre-left coalition. One recent poll showed that almost a quarter of people questioned wanted Mr Kok as the next prime minister compared with less than 6 per cent for Mr Brinkman. Even more telling, however, is that the favourite for prime minister is Mr Lubbers. He commands a rating of more than 40 per cent even though he has insisted for the past five years that he will not serve again.</p>

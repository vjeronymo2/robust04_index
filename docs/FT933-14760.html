			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shell ready to cut N Sea oil jobs SHELL UK is scaling down its North Sea oil drilling programme and cutting jobs in its exploration department by between 20 and 30 per cent. But the company yesterday denied this was a result of the government's planned changes to Petroleum Revenue Taxes. 'The PRT changes have underlined and given focus to what we were already looking at in the North Sea,' the company said. The changes, which abolish tax relief on exploration drilling while cutting the tax rate for existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, are due to become law in about a month. Six senior Tory MPs yesterday tabled an amendment to to introduce a transition period of three years.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Night flying curbs prompt court move PEOPLE living near the three main airports around London face increased levels of night noise from aircraft if the government is allowed to introduce a controversial system of flying restrictions, the High Court was told yesterday. Under the new system favouring 'quieter' aircraft, the number of take-offs and landings at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted would rise sharply. Richmond and Tandridge councils in Surrey, and Windsor and Maidenhead and Slough councils in Berkshire, and the London borough of Hillingdon were applying for a judicial review of a decision by Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, to introduce new restrictions from October 24. The councils have financial support from eight other local authorities. Mr Richard Gordon, representing the councils, told Mr Justice Laws that the present regime dated from 1988 and imposed a straightforward curb on the number of night flights. He said there were fears that the number of after-dark flights at Heathrow could rise under the new system from 5,750 a year to 24,000. Since 1981 the government had a policy of encouraging more flights made by quieter aircraft, and that same policy was meant to underly the new restrictions. Mr Gordon said it was uncontentious that night noise levels had decreased since 1988. But Mr MacGregor was now planning to use powers provided under the 1982 Civil Aviation Act to curb noise nuisance in effect to increase the number of flights from airports which would disrupt people's sleep, said Mr Gordon. Under the act, the transport secretary has the power to lessen or extinguish noise, and that he had therefore acted outside his powers in making proposals which would increase existing noise levels. The hearing was adjourned until today. Manchester airport was yesterday voted the best airport in the UK, with Gatwick second and Heathrow third in the 1993 Travel Awards sponsored by Travel Trade Gazette, the industry paper, and Express Newspapers.</p>

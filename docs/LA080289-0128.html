			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> RIGHTS LAW FOR DISABLED ADVANCES  </P> <P> President Bush reached a compromise with key senators from both parties today  on legislation extending the nation's civil rights laws to protect the disabled  from discrimination.  </P> <P> The accord was announced by the White House shortly before the Senate Labor  Committee revised and approved the measure on a 16-0 vote, sending it to the  full chamber.  </P> <P> The legislation would prohibit discrimination in the workplace or in public  accommodations based on a physical disability, paralleling the 1964 Civil  Rights Act that bans bias based on race, sex, national origin or religion.  </P> <P> In reaching the compromise, the senators basically went along with the  Administration on penalties for violations, while the White House went along  with them on the scope of coverage, officials said.  </P></p>

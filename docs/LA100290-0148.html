			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> RENT-CONTROL GROUP GETS 23,000 SIGNERS  </P> <P> Advocates of rent control at mobile home parks submitted petitions bearing  23,000 signatures Monday in an effort to qualify the measure for a citywide  vote.  </P> <P> Members of the Anaheim Political Action Committee gave the city clerk petitions  with the 23,000 names. The group needs about 15,000 valid signatures to qualify  the initiative for the ballot.  </P> <P> The initiative calls for a rent ceiling at the 1988 rent level with an annual  increase of 8%, or 75% of the consumer price index, whichever is less.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for some of the city's 29 mobile home parks called rent control  "the worst form of fraud."  </P> <P> "This initiative doesn't belong on the ballot, and it certainly should never  become law in Anaheim," said Vickie Talley, executive director of Orange County  Manufactured Housing Educational Trust.  </P> <P> Renters in the city's mobile home parks said they expected the park owners'  quick response and felt confident that the initiative would withstand any legal  challenge.  </P> <P> "What we would like is a special election," said Clarice Jackson, president of  the committee. "Put it on the ballot and leave it up to the people of Anaheim.  That's all we've ever asked."  </P> <P> In 1987, the renters group collected more than the required number of  signatures for a vote. But because of a technicality in the wording of the  initiative, it failed a legal challenge and was never brought before the  voters.  </P> <P> The city has 30 days to verify the new signatures. The petition then goes  before the City Council, which must approve a mobile home park rent control  ordinance or hold a special election on the issue.  </P> <P> The issue is likely to become a political football in the hotly contested  mayoral race on Nov. 6.  </P> <P> Incumbent Mayor Fred Hunter has been a longtime supporter of the renters since  the issue first arose in 1984. His challenger for the mayor's seat, Councilman  Irv Pickler, has consistently opposed rent control.  </P> <P> Renters in mobile home parks represent about 8,000 potential voters in the  city.

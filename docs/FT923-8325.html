			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: De Beers loses a little sparkle  -Philip Gawith on the dividend cut at the S African diamond producer The De Beers board has a quaint habit of meeting in Kimberley, the northern Cape mining town where the South African diamond producer began. Yesterday it seemed very far removed from the country's financial centre in more than just a geographic sense as the prediction of a 'significant reduction' in the final dividend sent shock waves through the Johannesburg investment community. Although the 26 per cent fall in attributable earnings was in line with predictions, most analysts were aghast at the announcement that the final dividend would be cut. Some said this would do serious damage to the credibility of De Beers and Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, its chairman. The confusion stems from the seemingly inexplicable difference between the fairly optimistic predictions De Beers was making as recently as six weeks ago about the outlook, and the much more bearish picture it has presented. Until yesterday, De Beers had been sending a clear message that the position of the diamond market was not too bad. It told those worried about the poor results from the first three auctions of rough diamonds of the 10 to be held this year to refer to the directors' forecast. Its main point was that sales of rough diamonds in the second half of 1992 would be better than in the same period in 1991. However, yesterday the board withdrew this prediction saying second-half sales could well be lower than during the first half. The gravity of the group's position was emphasised by the imposition yesterday of a 25 per cent quota reduction in the diamonds bought from producers by the Central Selling Organisation (CSO) - the De Beers' organisation which markets about 80 per cent of the world's uncut diamonds. The directors offer two reasons for its changed forecast: Low retail and rough diamond sales, due to weaker than anticipated upturns in Europe and the US and the continued slowdown in Japan; and A 'dramatic increase' in supplies of illicit diamonds from Angola. The CSO has mopped up a lot of this supply, but some of it is being sold outside of the CSO. Recently Mr Richard Stuart of Martin &amp; Co, the firm of stockbrokers and South Africa's leading diamond analyst, said De Beers directors would rather cut their throats than cut the dividend. Yesterday, Mr Stuart spoke for many when he said they probably had cut their throats as far as the investment community was concerned. Aside from the damage done to De Beers's reputation, yesterday's dividend announcement casts a pall over its stock market status. Mr Charles Booth, research director of JD Anderson, the stockbroking firm, said that apart from being bad news for the share price - which fell by more than 6 per cent yesterday to R68.50 on the news - it also damaged the group's reputation as a quality stock whose dividend would never be cut. (The dividend has only once before been cut - in 1981). He said the market might be tempted to regard De Beers as more of a cyclical stock and to downrate it accordingly. There was disagreement among analysts over whether it was necessary for De Beers to cut the dividend. Although some brokers had forecast a cut in the final dividend, saying the company would not have enough cash to maintain it, others differed. Mr Stuart thought the cut unnecessary given the financial strength of De Beers, which has net assets at market value of more than R30bn (Dollars 10.9bn). He also argued that De Beers should have given the market time to adapt to the imposition of quotas before considering a dividend cut. Some see the hand of Mr Harry Oppenheimer, the retired former chairman of De Beers, behind the forecast dividend cut. His thinking, it is reasoned, is that if De Beers is going to impose quota constraints on the industry, then it must also be seen to be taking some pain itself. A further puzzle about the dividend cut is that it seems to be something of an over reaction. Even with the second-half forecast revised downwards, it seems unlikely that CSO rough diamond sales for the year will be much worse than Dollars 3.5bn, against Dollars 3.9bn in 1991. This compares with a near halving of CSO sales in 1981, the year of the earlier dividend cut. Analysts caution that comparisons with the early 1980s, when the industry experienced the worst slump in its history, should be resisted. Then deflation in the world economy caused large stocks of diamonds, which had been bought as an inflation hedge, to be deposited on the market. De Beers, as a result, lost a degree of control over the supply of diamonds to the CSO. Today, De Beers has much improved control over the supply. The difference is evident from the ratio of CSO stocks to sales which rose above 160 per cent in 1984. Last year it was 77 per cent, and even with the gloomy second-half prognosis it is still unlikely to rise above 100 per cent. There is no comparable overhang of diamonds, excepting two problems. The first concerns the increase in supply from Angola. The second relates to De Beers's Venetia mine in the Northern Transvaal which opens in two days time. Originally the mine planned to open in a US election year, traditionally a period of firm demand in the US economy. This calculation has clearly backfired. As a result an extra 6m carats of diamonds - Venetia's full production - will be entering the CSO, without a market and hence will have to be stockpiled. See Lex</p>

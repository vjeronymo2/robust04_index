			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by RENMIN RIBAO reporter Mao Lei (3029 4320), FAZHI </F> RIBAO reporter Zhang Ya (1728 0068), and XINHUA reporters Fan  Liqing (5400 7787 7230) and Zhu Guoxian (2612 0948 6343): "The  Ins and Outs of the Qiandao Lake Incident -- Both Sides of the  Taiwan Strait Are Torn by Sorrow and Anger, and the Souls of the  Deceased Are Comforted Through Strict Law Enforcement"]    [Excerpts] Hangzhou, 19 Jun (XINHUA) -- Upon reviewing the  facts, the Zhejiang Provincial Higher People's Court rendered a  verdict on 19 June, in which it sentenced robbery and murder  convicts Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun to death and  deprived them of political rights for life. The three convicts  were subsequently taken to the execution grounds where they were  shot to death.    The Qiandao Lake incident was brought to an end. This major  criminal case stirred the emotions of countless compatriots on  both sides of the Taiwan strait, from the time of its occurrence  on 1 April until the end of the legal proceedings.  <H8>  I. </H8>   At 0805 [2405 GMT] on 1 April 1994, the Chunan County Public  Security Bureau in Zhejiang Province received a report that a  tour boat had caught fire on Qiandao Lake. The county party  committee, government, and public security bureau immediately  sent fire brigade and medical personnel to the scene to  extinguish the fire and carry out rescue operations.    An investigation carried out at the time showed that the  boat, the "Hairui," with a Taiwan tour group on board, had left  Shendu, Anhui Province, for Qiandao Lake on 31 March and was  scheduled to reach Maozhuyuan pier in Chayuan Town, Chunan  County on the evening of the same day. There were 24 Taiwan  tourists, two tour guides, and six crew members on board.    Harbor inspection personnel from the Chunan County Shipping  Administration were the first to arrive on the scene at 0830  [2430 GMT]. Thick smoke was billowing from the boat's lower  cabin. The harbor inspection personnel, disregarding their own  safety, boarded the burning boat and used the fire extinguishers  on board to put out the fire. Shortly thereafter, two fire  trucks arrived on a ferryboat. The firefighters contained the  fire 10 minutes later. Accumulated water, however, caused the  boat to list. The rescue personnel had to bail "Hairui" out  while towing her to a nearby ferry dock where they continued to  extinguish the fire.    Because no people were found dead on deck or in the  passenger  cabin during rescue operations, the provincial party committee  and government ordered a quick search for missing persons from  the boat. To conduct the search, Chunan County sent more than 20  boats carrying over 1,000 people to comb the waters in bays and  around islets within 40 km of the scene of the incident. Using  wire broadcasts, they also asked residents in the lake area to  provide clues. Air Force troops stationed in Zhejiang mobilized  airplanes, and the East China Sea Fleet also sent people to  assist in the search-and-rescue mission.    After the fire on the "Hairui" had been extinguished, Liu  Yongjian, head of the criminal investigation detachment under  the county public security bureau, was the first to enter the  lower cabin to survey the area in the hopes of finding out what  had happened there. Covering his mouth and nose with a towel,  he braved the thick pungent smoke billowing out from the cabin.  There he found some dead bodies. After bailing out the cabin  and counting the bodies, he found the bodies of all 32 people  board the boat were in the lower cabin.    CPC Central Committee and State Council leaders were very  concerned about the incident and issued an important directive  on dealing with it. They instructed that matters arising in the  aftermath of the incident be handled earnestly, and that the  cause of the incident be determined swiftly. The Taiwan Affairs  Office under the State Council, Public Security Ministry, and  Communications Ministry also immediately sent personnel to the  scene. Based on reports filed from Zhejiang, the Association  for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS] promptly took  the initiative in briefing the Taiwan's Straits Exchange  Foundation [SEF] on the relevant facts. [passage omitted on how  local leaders organized efforts to deal with matters arising in  the wake of the incident]    On 4 April, more than 50 family members of the deceased  Taiwan compatriots arrived in Chunan County to discuss matters  arising in the aftermath of the incident with civil affairs,  tourism, and other departments in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou  city. Vice Governor Liu Xirong and ARATS Deputy Secretary  General Liu Gangqi visited the Taiwan compatriots at their  hotels to offer condolences for the deceased and to express  sympathy to the bereaved families.    The bodies of the Taiwan compatriots killed in the  incident were identified after careful examination and  identification by their families. The Zhejiang authorities  invited Master Jiyun, the abbot of the Hangzhou Lingyin Temple,  to perform Buddhist rites and memorial services for the  deceased. Following patient and careful communication between  the two sides, the remains of the Taiwan compatriots killed in  the incident were escorted by their families to the Tonglu  County Funeral Parlor for cremation on the afternoon of 6 April  and their ashes were taken back to Taiwan by their families.  Mr. Lin Weiyang, general manager of Taiwan's Soaring Travel  Service who was involved in dealing with the remains of the  deceased throughout the period, said: "Mainland departments in  charge of the incident have made all possible arrangements.  After having done what is humanly possible, we have to defer to  God's will. May the deceased rest in peace soon."    Some high-ranking officials and politicians on Taiwan Island  began issuing strong statements of condemnation on 2 April  following the incident. Using such phrases as "utter disregard  for human life" and "bandits," they launched vicious attacks and  turned the incident into a political affair. On 12 April,  Taiwan's "Mainland Affairs Council" made the following  announcement: "As of today, cross-strait cultural and  educational exchanges will be suspended temporarily" and "As of  1 May, mainland-bound tours by local people will be  discontinued." Forces for Taiwan independence also seized on  the opportunity to raise a hue and cry, and to provoke the call  for "Taiwan independence."    The Taiwan authorities' actions cast a shadow over  cross-strait relations and exchanges, and attracted attention at  home and abroad.    On 12 April, ARATS Executive Vice President Tang Shubei met  with SEF Deputy Secretary General Shi Qiping [Shih Chi-ping] in  Beijing, during which the former briefed the latter on how  mainland central and local authorities took the incident  seriously and how they managed it as best they could. He  reiterated: The mainland guarantees Taiwan compatriots' safety,  both in terms of their lives and property. State laws offer  equal protection to both Taiwan and mainland compatriots. The  Qiandao Lake incident cannot and should not affect the  development of cross-strait relations. More important, we  should not "politicize" the incident and allow it to worsen  cross-strait relations which have been built up with great  difficulty.  <H8>  II. </H8>   The investigation was greatly hampered by the fact that all  passengers and crew members aboard the "Hairui" tour boat had  been killed and that there were no eyewitnesses at the time of  the incident. Faced with this complicated and major case,  public security officers and experts showed a strong sense of  responsibility toward the people, and commenced a methodical and  intensive investigation.    Yu Zhangchun, a 30-year-old deputy director of the Chunan  County Public Security Bureau, was the first public security  officer to arrive on the scene. Prevented from approaching the  tour boat by the firefighting operation, he led four public  security motorboats to search the surrounding waters and  obtained several leads with which they could judge the  approximate time and place of the incident. The sketch showing  the "Hairui's" route before and after the incident, compiled by  the county public security bureau on 2 April, was confirmed by  the testimony provided by the criminals after the incident.    Ding Hong, head of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau  forensic office, rushed to the scene at 2300 [1500 GMT] on 1  April. The lower cabin was submerged in 50 centimeters of  water; bodies were floating or submerged in the water. To find  out whether all 32 people on the boat were dead, Ding Hong and  three other officers entered the lower cabin, which covered an  area of just 17.1 square meters and was 1.5 meters high, to  survey the area with flashlights. They worked until 0400 [2000  GMT] the next morning. When the bodies were removed the next  day, they squatted down in the cabin and assigned numbers to,  photographed, and videotaped the bodies. The smell in the cabin  was suffocating. The four men, who sweated profusely, removed  the bodies with their bare hands after their rubber gloves were  damaged. From 1200 [0400 GMT] to 1700 [0900 GMT], they removed  all 32 bodies from the lower cabin.    On the evening of 2 April, 14 forensic experts sent by the  Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau carefully examined the  bodies.    Trace analysts collected 36 bags of "charred ashes" from the  cabin, washed them, and conducted a careful technical appraisal  of the screened substances.    Before long, the forensic experts prepared a report on the  general status of the bodies. The autopsy report concluded that  the victims were still alive before they entered the lower  cabin, and that their deaths were caused by suffocation and  burning.    Firefighting experts confirmed that the fire was started at  the entrance to the lower cabin, and that gasoline was added to  the flames. Shipping experts excluded the possibility of the  fire being caused by latent defects on the boat and its  equipment.    During the survey, trace analysts found that the iron  ladder at the entrance to the lower cabin was defective. They  also found a gasoline canister in the center of the spot where  the fire was started. Round dents caused by shots from hunting  rifles were also found on the steel plate above the entrance to  the lower cabin. There were traces of an explosion on the oil  tank in the cabin.    Criminologists analyzed that people on the boat were most  likely forced into the cabin under the threat of violence and  were burned to death afterward.    Public security organs confirmed that the incident was a  premeditated, well-prepared robbery and murder case of  exceptional proportions, and they formally put the case on file  for investigation. [passage omitted on how police officers  devoted themselves to solving the case]    The leads in the investigation gradually pointed to Wu  Lihong, who operated a motorboat service without a license.    On the day of the incident, Wu Lihong bought three gasoline  canisters, one of which was never returned. The specifications  of the missing canister were the same as those of the one found  on the "Hairui." Prior to the incident, Wu Lihong had bought  civilian-use explosives and hunting rifle bullets and had lent  hunting rifles to other people. An eyewitness saw Wu Lihong  driving two other men to the lake on a motorboat on the  afternoon of 31 March. Last year, Wu Lihong borrowed 60,000  yuan to buy a high-horsepower motorboat, and the debt will  become due this month. According to an informant, Wu Lihong had  his hair cut on the morning of 1 April, and burn mark traces  were found on his eyebrows and on the hair covering his  forehead. After the incident, he said he would mortgage his  motorboat for just 30,000 yuan....[ellipses as received]    Public security officers immediately launched an  investigation into Wu Lihong's family life, lifestyle, his  friends and activities, learning quickly about some suspicious  activities of two of Wu's close friends, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun.  Afterward, public security organs resolutely decided to summon  the suspects immediately.    Yu Aijun and Wu Lihong were summoned on the afternoon and  evening of 15 April. Hu Zhihan was called in the next day.    The three criminals bowed their heads in the face of  conclusive evidence. During the small hours of 17 April, the  three gave an account of the entire incident and explained their  motives. The details of their story completely matched the  information collected during the on-site survey.    According to information provided by the three criminals,  the  police went to the place where they had stashed their stolen  goods to recover the booty, which included camcorders, cameras,  U.S. dollars, new Taiwan dollars, renminbi, Hong Kong dollars,  wristwatches, rings, jade bracelets, and necklaces. They also  seized the motorboat, hunting rifles, bullets, and leftover  explosives which the criminals had used to commit the crime.    On 20 April, Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun were  apprehended in accordance with the law. On 3 June, the Hangzhou  City People's Procuratorate filed a public indictment in the  Hangzhou City Intermediate People's Court regarding the robbery  and murder case on Qiandao Lake.    After public security organs proclaimed the case solved,  ARATS promptly notified the SEF and briefed the latter on the  case on several occasions. Speaking on 18 April, Li Peng,  premier of the State Council, said: The exceptional robbery and  murder case on Qiandao Lake has been solved, and the criminals  have been arrested. They will be dealt with strictly according  to legal procedures.    Most Taiwan compatriots were relieved to hear his words.  Some people in the Taiwan government, however, continued to  spread rumors and falsely accused the mainland of "covering up  the truth," as they attempted to mislead public opinion at home  and abroad.    To safeguard cross-strait relations, and to inform more  people concerned about the case, especially Taiwan compatriots,  ARATS sent three letters to the SEF in which it invited SEF  officials and experts to come to Hangzhou for briefings by  experts in charge of the case on condition that the judicial  proceedings not be affected. On 8 May, SEF Deputy Secretary  General Xu Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu] led six analysts, criminologists,  and forensic experts, some lawyers, and seven bereaved family  members on a visit to Hangzhou. [passage omitted on briefings  by ARATS officials to the delegation]  <H8>  III. </H8>   On 10 June, the Hangzhou City Intermediate People's Court  held an open trial of the robbery and murder case on Qiandao  Lake. [passage omitted on details of the crime provided by the  defendants in court]    Justice has a long arm. The three criminals were sentenced  to death and executed in accordance with the law. The  compatriots from both sides of the Taiwan strait who were killed  in the incident can now close their eyes in death. The relevant  insurance company has made preparations for compensation for the  Taiwan compatriots killed in the incident, and it is handling  the case in accordance with relevant provisions. The handling  of matters arising in the aftermath of the incident, the swift  solution of this largest criminal case involving Taiwan  compatriots since the two sides of the Taiwan Strait initiated  exchanges, and the punishment of the criminals in accordance  with the law, demonstrate that the state sets great store by  people's legitimate rights and interests, and has made every  effort to improve its legal system and safeguard people's lives  and property.    Judging by the rumors flying around the Qiandao Lake  incident, however, people on the two sides of the Taiwan strait  perceive and deal with certain issues differently because of  their long-term separation and different social systems.  Different perceptions and methods of dealing with matters have  inevitably given rise to misunderstandings. Farsighted people  on both sides of the Taiwan strait maintain that the two sides  should expand exchanges and improve communication to achieve a  better understanding of each other in an even shorter period of  time. In dealing with concrete matters involving both sides of  the Taiwan strait, we must consider the general interest of  cross-strait relations, and confront and solve problems by  adopting the attitude of safeguarding the fundamental interests  of people on both sides of the Taiwan strait, being realistic  and objective, and seeking truth from facts. We should prevent  people from making a fuss over something in an attempt to  undermine cross-strait relations. After learning of the truth,  some Taiwan newspapers noted: "The Qiandao Lake incident,  however complicated, is after all a criminal case. It would be  a serious mistake to dismiss Mainland China's current social  values or even the blood ties binding all of China together."    It should be noted that some people in the Taiwan government  and a handful of Taiwan independence elements are still  nonsensically characterizing the incident as an "unsolved case,"  although the truth of the Qiandao Lake incident has been brought  to light and the criminals have been executed. It seems a few  people are still trying to exploit this unfortunate incident to  obstruct and undermine cross-strait relations. Such an attempt  will eventually prove fruitless. The Qiandao Lake incident was  an accident and its adverse effects will be temporary. Closer  cross-strait relations are an inevitable and general trend.  History will corroborate this point.</p>

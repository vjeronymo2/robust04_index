			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Entrants to degree courses rise 22% ADMISSIONS to degree courses at the universities and colleges covered by the Polytechnics Central Admissions System rose 22.2 per cent last year, figures published yesterday show, John Authers writes. The figures, achieved in spite of a reduction in the number of 18-year-olds, was described by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals as 'quite staggering' and a 'pleasant surprise'. It said the figures demonstrated the rising demand for higher education. However, the committee added that applications may have been boosted by the effects of recession, as sixth-formers decided to delay seeking a job. The Department for Education said: 'This will be seen as evidence of the wisdom in getting rid of the binary divide between universities and polytechnics.' It warned that the increase would not be continued this year because the government has cut the tuition fees it pays to universities for each student. Applications rose by about 20 per cent, while the proportion of applicants with a background solely in A-levels and AS-levels fell. Students coming from a BTec background accounted for 13.1 per cent of degree course admissions and a third of HND admissions.</p>

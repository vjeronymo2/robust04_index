			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Francesco Speroni, minister for </F> institutional reform, by Stefano Caviglia in Rome; date not  given: "Speroni: Reforms -- Yes, But With the Opposition" --  first paragraph is L'INDIPENDENTE introduction]    [Text] "Reforming the regional electoral systems is the  first step toward federalism." Francesco Speroni, minister for  institutional reform, is off, and he has no intention of  stopping. The start was a very fast one, with the majority  expressing immediate agreement on his bill.    [Caviglia] It must have been hard to persuade your  government  allies.    [Speroni] Not at all. As far as federalism is concerned, the  National Alliance is still putting up a fight, but I see no  insuperable difficulties.    All that was needed the other day was an hour's discussion,  more by way of clarification than anything else. The only  annoying thing was that I had to get up at six in the morning to  get to the meeting.    [Caviglia] Can the double ticket of federalism and  presidentialism bring everyone into agreement?    [Speroni] It would be fine with me; I have always been a  presidentialist. But let us get something straight: The direct  election of the presidents of the regions does not mean  presidentialism. It is the same system used to elect mayors.    [Caviglia] Now that you have taken the first step, will you  tell us which ones you intend to take next?    [Speroni] The next step is definitely the appointment of the  panel of experts whose job it will be to revise the  Constitution. What we have just agreed on is nothing more than a  partial bill on the regions, a portion of the constitutional  reform that is being brought forward so that the 1995 elections  can be held under the new system. The rest will come with the  reform of the Constitution along federal lines.    [Caviglia] Who will be the members of this panel? In recent  weeks there has been talk of the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left] constitutionalist Augusto Barbera, as a gesture of  goodwill toward the opposition parties.    [Speroni] Unfortunately, Barbera cannot be on it because he  is tied up all summer with a lecture tour in England, but he is  willing to help. I still want to widen the debate to include  the opposition parties. Federalism is a heritage shared by all  who believe in it, not a matter of majority and opposition.    [Caviglia] And what about Miglio [of the Northern League]?    [Speroni] Miglio will not be involved, but only because he  has declined the offer, twice since the government was formed.  I can hardly go down on my knees and beg him.    [Caviglia] How long do you think it will take to complete  the  federal reform?    [Speroni] Well, it is definitely not a matter that can be  settled in three months. The only one who managed that was de  Gaulle, but he did it by going over parliament's head, and I  have no intention at all of doing that. The new Constitution  must not be the constitution according to Speroni or Berlusconi;  it must be what all the Italians want.</p>

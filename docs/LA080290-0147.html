			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WALNUT;  </P> <P> LANDSCAPING PACT MAY END  </P> <P> A dispute between the city and its landscape contractor over piles of debris  and compost came to the City Council, which voted to end its $1,750-per-month  contract with the company in 60 days.  </P> <P> But the council agreed to reconsider if Hacienda Landscape Inc. removes the  debris.  </P> <P> Homeowners in the vicinity of Hacienda's plant on Carrey Road have complained  that the piles are an eyesore and draw flies. A 120-signature petition  presented to the council July 11 accused employees of urinating in public,  drinking beer on the premises and violating city codes by beginning work before  7 a.m.  </P> <P> At last week's council meeting, Abid Javaid, Hacienda's owner and president,  promised to have the debris removed and to keep the yard clean. He also offered  to call the Sheriff's Department if he saw employees urinating or drinking in  public, saying it might "teach them a lesson."  </P></p>

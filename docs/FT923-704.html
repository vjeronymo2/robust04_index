			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Heavy futures trading lifts Paris bourse BOURSES were mixed at the end of a careworn week, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS saw heavy trading on the futures market give a lift to equities, and a steadier franc also helped to encourage sentiment. The CAC-40 index closed 14.03 higher at 1,843.53, down 2 per cent on the week. Turnover was some FFr2.2bn. A downgrade left Total down FFr7.60, or 4.6 per cent at FFr219.40 in volume of some 7000,000 shares and led to the oil group issuing a statement just before the close in which it disputed the reasons for the recommendation. The note, from a UK broking house, cut the forecast for 1992 earnings by 8 per cent. Havas lost FFr23 to FFr431 on disappointing interim results from subsidiaries, while Peugeot was down FFr12 at FFr575 following poor earnings figures from Fiat. Michelin improved FFr5.00 to FFr206.50. Bancaire lost FFr30.50, or nearly 8 per cent at FFr356.00 in the absence of corporate news, although some switching into Sovac was noted as the Lazard group subsidiary saw a rise in first half profits. Its shares gained FFr19 to FFr799. FRANKFURT extended the trends of a depressing week, with six DAX stocks hitting new lows for the year, Daimler Benz matching an earlier low, and weakness in carmakers, chemicals, engineering and steels, in particular, relieved only by continued relative strength in the banking sector. The DAX index fell 17.58 to 1,513.36, 4.8 per cent down on the week and 3 per cent above its August low. German stock market turnover fell from DM5.1bn to DM4.6bn. At Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, Mr Matthias Welticke said that Germany was the main loser from the way currencies have moved in Europe and that it would take additional, and early interest rate cuts from the Bundesbank (unlikely now that the franc has stabilised) to change the mood of the bourse. MILAN reacted to Fiat's first half profit fall and a profit warning from Stet, the telecoms combine. The Comit index fell another 5.52 to 361.60, 3.7 per cent lower on the week. Fiat responded to its 54 per cent fall in first half profits with a fix 4.7 per cent down at L3,448 before recovering slightly in kerb trade to L3,485. Stet's warning of flat profits this year left it L58 lower at the fix, and L44 down at L1,417 after hours. ZURICH ended steadily, the SMI index rising 0.6 to 1,909.8 and underlining this week's consolidation, with a gain of 0.7 per cent, following last week's 4.7 per cent advance. AMSTERDAM eased as DSM's fall continued. The CBS Tendency index finished 0.9 lower at 112.2, a 1.2 per cent decline over the week. The chemical group was hit by a number of downgrades following an analysts meeting on Thursday. The shares closed down Fl 2.70 at Fl 93.50. Its fellow chemical group, Akzo, eased Fl 1.70 at Fl 144.00. Elsevier went against the trend rising Fl 1.60 to Fl 111.20. MADRID recovered some ground as buyers re-emerged following Thursday's steep fall. The general index gained 1.62 to 199.77, after a intraday low of 195.64, fall of 7 per cent on the week. There was a feeling that the rally in the French franc may have removed some of the pressure for a further peseta devaluation. The construction sector, which has seen some of the heaviest falls recently, was slightly firmer. STOCKHOLM stumbled over falling building and property shares and the Affarsvarlden General index dropped another 11.0 to 697.90 to end the week 8 per cent down in moderate turnover of SKr456m. The property company, NCC, saw its B shares down SKr3, or 23 per cent to SKr10 following news that the Globen City consortium in which it participates has halted its interest repayments. Meanwhile, Sweden's biggest construction and property group, Skanska, saw its B-restricted shares fall for the 11th consecutive day, this time by a further SKr4, or 9.5 per cent to SKr38. Elsewhere, bad news, or the expectation of it, left Volvo B down SKr8 to SKr256 and Electrolux B SKr13 lower at SKr178. BRUSSELS saw relatively quiet pre-weekend trade as the Bel-20 Index lost 3.52 to 1,118.06, down 1 per cent on the week. Banks were a feature with Generale de Banque climbing BFr50 to BFr7,100.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - Sep 25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1036.76  1036.13  1034.14  1035.46  1036.59  1034.14  1034.87  1035.63  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High  1037.19    Day's Low  1032.50  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        Sep 24    Sep 23    Sep 22    Sep 21    Sep 18       1041.31   1043.77   1044.34   1050.43   1070.95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

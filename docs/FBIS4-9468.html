			<p>BFN     [Text] Katowice, April 26 -- Coalminers of nine Silesian  collieries went on strike during night shift on Monday [25  April], according to reports sent to a state coal mine agency in  Katowice on Tuesday.    Striking miners in the "Turow" brown-coal mine in Turoszow  deliver some 2,500 tonnes of coal to the "Turow" power plant to  keep it going. Four of the power plant's eight power units  work, the strike committee said. The power plant had provided  ten percent of Poland's power supplies before the strike began.    The National Power Distribution office (PDM) announced tenth  degree of power supply in Poland starting from 0830 hours, shift  manager Andrzej Dobroczek said on Tuesday.    Brown-coal mines started its sixth day of strike protesting  against the government plan to restructure the industry. They  decided to leave the power plant with enough fuel to keep its  furnaces going. Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski said  that the strike "will end if legal decisions come into force."</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: All round growth for Clondalkin Improving demand for most of its products helped Clondalkin, the Dublin-based printing and packaging group, achieve a 34 per cent advance in pre-tax profits from IPounds 4.64m to IPounds 6.23m (Pounds 6.15m) in the half year to end-June. The increase was achieved on turnover up from IPounds 74.3m to IPounds 92.6m. Earnings per share came out at 10.63p (8.03p) and the interim dividend is raised to 2.017p (1.834p). Irish operations had benefited from corrective actions taken last year, while more buoyant conditions in the UK had helped the profits advance, said Mr Domhnall McCullough, chairman. In the US, the flexible packaging and business forms companies showed good volume and profit growth, although commercial printing continued to be a difficult sector and operations had been cut again, he added.</p>

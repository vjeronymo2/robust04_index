			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Russia breaches diamond deal with De Beers The Russian government, desperate for hard currency, is selling uncut gem diamonds from its Treasury stockpile directly to dealers in Antwerp in clear breach of its agreement with De Beers, the South African group which controls more than 80 per cent of the world's rough, or uncut, diamond market. Between Dollars 40m and Dollars 80m of diamonds had been 'leaked' to the west in the past two weeks, Mr Gary Ralfe, a De Beers director, suggested yesterday. The Russian problem emerged at the end of a record year for the Central Selling Organisation, De Beers' London-based offshoot that organises the international diamond cartel. The CSO reported yesterday that its rough diamond sales reached Dollars 4.355bn (Pounds 2.91bn) in 1993, 28 per cent higher than last year's total and 5 per cent above the previous record in 1988. The former Soviet Union re-joined the diamond cartel in 1990, giving the CSO exclusive rights to sell 95 per cent of its production for five years. At the same time, De Beers advanced the government a Dollars 1bn loan and shipped some of the Soviet diamond stockpiles to London as collateral. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, Russia agreed to continue the accord. The international diamond market relies on De Beers to even out the peaks and troughs in demand via the cartel - a system it calls single-channel marketing. Mr Ralfe said he had made it clear during a meeting with a senior Russian official at the weekend that any large-scale leakage of gem diamonds would destabilise the diamond market. 'I urged the Russians not to damage the long-term benefits of single-channel marketing for short-term gain,' said Mr Ralfe. The official - whom Mr Ralfe refused to identify - said great care was being taken not to undermine the market and said the diamonds were not not being sold at cut prices. Mr Ralfe said the sale of a second category of rough diamonds, from Russia's strategic defence stockpile, had been 'worrisome' for De Beers this year. These stones were outside the marketing deal because at the time they were stockpiled they were non-gems for industrial and technical use. However, many had now been cut in India where an ability to polish, economically, very small stones, has been developed over the past 20 years. The US was also selling diamonds from its strategic stockpile and this was causing 'some signs of oversupply in the lower and cheaper quality range of rough diamonds,' said Mr Ralfe.

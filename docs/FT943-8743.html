			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Growth in industrial output slows to 0.2% US industrial production expanded at a moderate 0.2 per cent in July, according to the Federal Reserve, a decrease from the 0.5 per cent advance of June. The output returns were the last economic data to be published before today's meeting of the Fed's open market committee. Analysts expect the central bank to nudge short- term interest rates higher by increasing the Fed funds rate by 0.25 points to 4.5 per cent. There was nothing in the industrial production figures to contradict the consistent picture of an economy now growing at a more moderate pace than at the turn of the year, but with inflation apparently well in check. The 14th consecutive monthly increase in July was cut in half by two particular factors - a drop in the generation of electricity from the unusually high levels of June and the impact of the strike at Caterpillar. Otherwise output of consumer goods rose by 0.4 per cent, in spite of some weakness in the car sector. Industry in July operated at 83.9 per cent of capacity, the same as in the previous month and similar to the levels of the last five months, but up from 81.3 per cent a year earlier. The Fed noted that primary processing industries such as textiles, petroleum, lumber, iron and steel, were operating at levels above their long-term averages, but that there was less deviation from the norm in advance processing sectors.</p>

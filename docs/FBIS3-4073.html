			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- China's deficit has  been within a normal and permissible range, according to a  Chinese financial expert.    "China's total debts for 1994 will come to nearly 130  billion  yuan, which seems big," said Zhao Haikuan, honorary director of  the Finance Institute of the People's Bank of China.    "This is the result of a change of accounting methods this  year, and the change will not affect the actual size of the  debt," he said.    "We formerly regarded what we borrowed as revenue income and  included expenses on debt servicing in total expenditures; the  shortfall between revenues and expenditures was regarded as the  hard deficit," he said, who is also a member of the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference.    Many experts and scholars at home and abroad expressed  disagreement with this practice. To more clearly reflect the  balance between the country's normal revenues and expenditures  and the scale of debt, starting from this year, the country is  using a different method of calculating the deficit, Zhao said.    Income from borrowing will no longer be included in total  revenues. The entire deficit will be covered by issuing  treasury bonds, instead of by loans from banks as was the case  previously. As a result, the amount of the debt goes up  accordingly, Zhao said.    This year 48.081 billion yuan for servicing domestic and  foreign debts due for repayment will be covered by issuing  treasury bonds and 14.245 billion yuan of new foreign loans will  be used for the construction of key projects.    "All these factors lead to a seemingly big increase in the  total debt," Zhao said.    However, Zhao pointed out, due to various factors, deficit  is  also a serious problem in China. To some extent, it will have a  great impact on China's economy, which should be given due  attention and should never be ignored, he warned.    On how to reduce deficit, Zhao said that from a long-term  point of view it is imperative to bring money supply under  strict control. Excessive issuing of currency is caused by too  large an amount of deficit and vice versa.    He suggested that the state appropriately slow down the  economic growth rate, pay more attention to efficiency and  reduce the scale of investment into fixed assets.    In Zhao's view, the country's investment into fixed assets  is  not compatible with its national strengthen.    In addition, tax collection should be strengthened to avoid  tax evasion, and administrative spendings should be cut, Zhao  added.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / TUC condemns cost of closures CLOSING each of the 31 threatened pits will cost between Pounds 8m to Pounds 10m more for each pit than keeping it open, says an assessment released yesterday by the Trades Union Congress. The TUC said its study showed that the total net costs of pit closures, after taking into account unemployment benefit and tax losses, would be Pounds 80m for the 10 pits earmarked for early closure and Pounds 320m for all 31 pits. The TUC called for immediate government action to 'create a larger market for coal as recommended by the Commons trade and industry select committee'. The committee called for measures widely interpreted as meaning expansion of the coal market by at least 16m tonnes a year. The government's white paper is likely to lead to considerably less expansion. The TUC study challenged the government's assertions that the costs of pit closures would be short-lived and that saving pits would have a severe impact on jobs elsewhere. It argued that the net additional costs of closing pits would damage industry's competitiveness. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said closing pits made no economic sense. The public should be told how much more it would cost to close pits than to keep them open, he said. Pit Closures: The costs to the Taxpayer.

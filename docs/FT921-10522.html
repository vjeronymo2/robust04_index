			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark rises on pay accord THE D-MARK led the way in Europe, as the consequences of the 6.4 per cent pay settlement with German steel workers began to filter through to the foreign exchange markets. Some economists feared that the 6.4 per cent mark would be used as a basis for the next round of pay talks, due to begin this week. Such a move would eliminate any remaining hopes for an easing of German monetary policy. 'People are changing their minds about the course of German rates,' said Dr Mark Austin, an economist with HongKong Bank. The D-Mark strengthened against the lira - rising from 751.40/60 lire to 751.73/83 - and the peseta, increasing from 62.89/92 to 62.99/02. The German currency also took some heart from a weaker dollar as mixed comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, did little to encourage investors. Mr Greenspan said that he felt current easing was enough to turn the US economy around, but added that recent economic performance had been disappointing. Traders said the dollar had not yet shown the effects of the consistently disappointing US data, and added that it could be set for a sharp fall. However, most dealers were prepared to hold on for Friday's employment data, perceived to be the first real economic indicator of the year. Trading was expected to remain in fairly narrow bands. The dollar softened in London from DM1.5975 to close at DM1.5920 and opened in New York at DM1.5965/70. The yen was not immune to the D-Mark's strength, despite speculation that the G7 had informally agreed to keep Japan's currency strong. The yen was trading at 79.33/38 per D-Mark in New York, compared with the 77.30 range at the end of last week. 'That's quite a sharp move in a generally quiet market,' said one trader. 'Maybe it is time to think about Bank of Japan intervention.' Sterling followed the dollar's drift during the day, partly because of political uncertainty. The speculation over a date for the general election was damping any potential buoyancy in sterling. 'If we didn't have the political uncertainty,' said Mr David Cocker of Chemical Bank, 'we could have had investors buying the pound.' In the end, sterling rallied to close unchanged at DM2.8675 in London. Within the European Monetary System, the D-Mark finished at 38 per cent of its allowed swing above the central Ecu rate. Sterling lay firmly locked at the bottom of the grid, while Spain's high interest rates held the peseta steady at the top. However, the Spanish currency was close to its ceiling of 6.18 per cent above the central rate, at 6.09 per cent. Some traders suggested that speculation on a revaluation within the EMS would return as it appeared more likely that German rates would remain high.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BELL HELICOPTER TO LAY OFF 115  </P> <P> Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., whose V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft military project  faces an uncertain future because of defense cuts, said today it will lay off  115 employees to "help improve cost efficiencies."  </P> <P> The work reduction action will affect both hourly and salaried workers and  won't be concentrated in a particular program or production, a company  spokesman said. The military and commercial helicopter maker employs about  7,000 people.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed to eliminate the V-22 project, one  of the largest defense projects for Bell Helicopter. It is being jointly  developed by Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Helicopters of Ridley Township,  Pa.  </P> <P> Proposed cuts in the defense budget have affected other area companies that  rely heavily on such contracts.  </P></p>

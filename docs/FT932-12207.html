			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / The Lex Column: The future tense London had a worrying day yesterday. Heavy futures selling drove the FT-SE 100 down by 35 points. The gilts market decided the auction result was not quite good enough and dropped over a point at the long end. There are benign explanations for both developments. If US speculators really are selling equity futures, the heat could be off quite quickly as their short positions are closed. The gilts market could simply be coming back to earth after allowing auction expectations to run away with themselves. The trouble with the first point is that such bear raids only work in markets that are anyway subject to some degree of uncertainty. As for the second, the gilts market simply cannot afford to lose its composure when it faces calls of Pounds 3bn as well, presumably, as another large auction within the next month. Both markets have reason to worry about institutional liquidity, but the attack on the equity market looks well-timed after this week's economic news. It was not positive enough to change expectations of corporate earnings, but it was sufficient to kill any lingering hopes of lower interest rates. With the gilt auctions now in full swing, the equity market has reached the stage where it needs reassurance on government funding before it can see the way ahead. That is not easy when the gold price is up and D-mark bonds are weak. In the absence of a base rate cut which would steepen the yield curve, a rising currency might attract overseas money into gilts. Disconcertingly, though, sterling again failed to remain over DM2.50 yesterday despite a larger than expected cut in the Bundesbank's money market repurchase rate.</p>

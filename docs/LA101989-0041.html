			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: SOME RULES FOR SELECTING SUITABLE DISHES, UTENSILS FOR  MICROWAVE USE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I've just moved into my first apartment, and I have a microwave  oven. I'm really anxious to learn how to use it but I have one problem. I don't  know which dishes, bowls and so on to use. How can I tell?  </P> <P>  -- TED, Seattle  </P> <P> DEAR TED: The two main things you need to determine about the suitability of  dishes for microwave use are whether or not they are safe for a microwave and  whether or not their size and shape are good for this purpose.  </P> <P> First, don't use anything with gold or silver trim or anything made of metal.  Microwave-safe materials include glass, ceramics, pottery, special  microwaveable plastics and paper. Most products on the market now are marked to  indicate the suitability for microwaving. Older items and those you're not sure  of should be checked by the following method.  </P> <P> To find out if a dish is safe, place it in the microwave and next to it place a  glass measuring cup with one cup of water. Heat on full power for one minute,  then check the temperature of the dish. If the dish is cool and the water is  very warm, the dish is safe. If the dish is slightly warm, it can still be  used, but only for very short-term warming. If the dish is hot, though, it's  not for the microwave.  </P> <P> Because of the way a microwave oven cooks, certain sizes and shapes do a better  job than others. Food takes longer to microwave in a deep container than in a  shallow one and often requires stirring. A shallow container exposes more food  surface to the microwaves, so more of the food cooks at the same time.  </P> <P> Round and oval casseroles give more even results than square or rectangular  ones. More energy penetrates the corners, so the food there is apt to overcook,  giving you dried-out corners and underdone centers.  </P> <P> Straight-sided dishes and pans are preferable to those with slanted sides. The  straight sides keep the food at a more uniform depth and this provides more  even cooking. In sloped dishes, the food on the edges receives more energy  because it's not as deep, so it cooks faster and can overcook before the center  is done.  </P> <P> Ring-shaped pans are best for foods such as cakes and muffins that can't be  stirred during cooking. The open center allows the microwaves to contact the  food from all sides as well as top and bottom for more uniform cooking.  </P> <P> Before you spend a lot of money on new cookware, experiment with the dishes,  casseroles and bowls you have to see which ones give you the results you want.  More than likely those you already have will do fine.  </P> <P> Microwave ovens are great. Once you get the hang of it, you'll ask yourself how  you ever got along without one.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: On Halloween I give the little ghosts and goblins that come to my  house a toy instead of candy. The children get enough candy as it is and I feel  better knowing that I have given them something different.  </P> <P> I fill a large bowl with party-favor yo-yos, packs of baseball cards, balls and  other inexpensive items that can be found in most grocery stores with the  birthday-party supplies.  </P> <P>  -- LINDA, Montville, N.J.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have both an automatic drip coffee maker and an individual  one-cup cone to use for single cups of coffee. I've found two tricks that  really help me.  </P> <P> To make the filters separate easily, I turn each layer inside out. The filters  come off one at a time without a struggle.  </P> <P> When I need a filter for the one-cup cone, I just fold a regular filter in  half, then in half again. Open one side of it and you have a cone. It's much  less expensive than buying the special cone filters.  </P> <P>  -- AUDREY, Diamond Bar, Calif.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Since I have three small children, we always have several  different kinds of cereal open at one time. The inner bags in the cereal boxes  never roll down and stay shut so the cereal didn't stay fresh. Now when I open  a box of cereal I pour the contents into a gallon-size zip-closing bag. We have  crisp cereal again, plus it's safer from ants, weevils and cockroaches.  </P> <P>  -- JEANETTE, San Angelo, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: This past summer we were plagued by tiny ants in our yard. This  was not only annoying to us but to our cat, which did not appreciate their  intrusion upon his food dish.  </P> <P> We solved the problem by partially filling a shallow dish with water and  placing his food dish in the center of it. The mini-moat effectively thwarted  the ants until the pests were eliminated from our yard by the exterminator.  </P> <P>  -- DOUGLAS, Newington, N.H.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I often buy lemon juice in the small disposable lemon-shaped  juice bottles. When they are empty, I rinse them well and give them to my  children. They fill them with water and drink from them while outside playing.  </P> <P>  -- CATHY, Garland, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I had a family dinner at my home, and since my family is rather  large we divided up what each family would bring. On my list was a tossed  salad.  </P> <P> I needed to make a lot of salad but didn't have a large bowl or anything to mix  the salad in. So I came up with a great idea. I washed the vegetable crisper  from my refrigerator and mixed the salad in it. It worked fine and the dinner  was an event to remember.  </P> <P>  -- DEBBIE GIBSON, Casper, Wyo.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I enjoy making homemade deep-dish pizza. One thing I didn't enjoy  was ending up with a soggy crust.  </P> <P> So now before I add the filling to the crust, I sprinkle on some cheese.  </P> <P> The crust is delicious and crisp now.  </P> <P>  -- BETTY ELIZA, Billings, Mont.  </P> <P> DEAR READERS: Diane Hampton of Hartford, Conn., wrote in and shared her  substitute for zucchini bread.  </P> <P> She uses yellow squash in place of zucchini and adds currants and chopped nuts  to the recipe. The texture is great and it has a new, delicious taste.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When you skin chicken parts before cooking them, don't throw the  skin away. Boil it in lightly salted water, covered, for about 20 to 25  minutes. Remove the skin and discard it.  </P> <P> Pour the broth into a bowl and set it in the refrigerator. When the fat has  hardened on top, remove it by carefully skimming it off. You now have a tasty  and low-fat chicken broth.  </P> <P>  -- MRS. A., Silver Spring, Md.  </P></p>

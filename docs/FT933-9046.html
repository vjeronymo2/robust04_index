			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Accountancy Column: Chinese practitioners ready for their great leap forward - The search for new investors is resulting in radical reform of accounting practices GETTING TO grips with business in China is like trying to grapple with chopsticks for the first time. One slip and the food can easily slide from the grasp, crashing into a bowl and splashing soy sauce in all directions. The fledgling role of Western accounting in the world's most populous country is equally precarious. But a series of initiatives is now poised to bring about radical reform. The search for overseas equity is forcing a number of large Chinese companies to overhaul their accounting practices in an effort to meet tough listing requirements. Several tens of thousands are adjusting to different standards for joint ventures already in place. But from last month, many hundreds of thousands more - supposedly all Chinese enterprises - have on paper also been required to comply with new, more internationally-oriented reporting requirements. Traditional Chinese accounting was well geared to cope with the demands of the Communist system in the region. Like the equivalent in the former Soviet Union, it served the purposes of the state effectively. It is less equipped to cope with changing pressures on the economy in the 1990s. The system was funds-based. The emphasis was to show how money provided by the state was used, and how far production quotas were being met. There was less interest in profits or the long-term viability of an enterprise. The format was rigidly set out in law, with strict requirements on how accounts were presented. Mr Neal Stow of Price Waterhouse says that in the UK, directors may change an accounting treatment to achieve a desired figure; in China their counterparts had to carry out the transaction itself in a different way if they wanted to change a number while complying with the regulations. The Chinese system was also geared towards statistics, providing data for economic planning to the different ministries and especially to the tax authorities. That means there is extensive financial information on each enterprise, though most of it is stored manually. The quantity of data, combined with low staff turnover so that those who prepared the figures are generally still contactable, means that accountants have been able to re-cast figures shown in previous years more in line with international standards. The conversions often produce substantially different results. Mr Meocre Li, who takes over as partner in charge of Hong Kong and China for Arthur Andersen next month, says Chinese accounting lacks the concept of prudence, so there are generally no provisions for bad debts or obsolete inventory. On the other hand, enterprises were required to make provisions - taken after profits - for staff welfare, bonuses and other costs. He lists a wide range of other differences: accounts are not consolidated; foreign currency transactions are translated at meaningless official rates; depreciation is far slower than in the West; and there is inconsistent application of capitalisation of interest charges. When Andersen re-cast to international standards the accounts of Shanghai Vacuum as originally reported, net profit rose from Rmb14.7m to Rmb73.4m (Pounds 8.6m) for the nine months to September 30 1991, and net assets fell from Rmb293.8m to Rmb198.6m. At Shanghai Chlor-Alkali, net profit fell from Rmb69.7m to Rmb3.3m for the year to December 31 1991. The smaller net change at China Southern Glass - cutting profits from Rmb10.4m to Rmb8.5m in the seven months to July 31 1991 - concealed large variations that cancelled each other out. Joint ventures have always been required to report more in line with international standards. But since July, the Ministry of Finance's 'Accounting standards for business enterprises', with a similar thrust, theoretically became mandatory for all companies. Even this new standard differs from international requirements, Meocre Li stresses, in forbidding full consolidation, for instance. But he says: 'With world accounting going in one direction, I don't think China has a choice.' Earlier this year, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu won a Dollars 2.6m contract from the World Bank to help design new standards. Mr Ted Lee, the firm's managing director for China, says it expects to produce about 30 general and special topic standards and a further 10 for industry sectors over the next three years. Price Waterhouse has been separately awarded a contract to recommend changes to financial reporting for banks. For those trying to interpret Chinese accounts in the past, Meocre Li points out another difficulty. The country's approach to auditing has been as different from other parts of the world as its financial reporting. The standards used by the local certified public accountants (CPAs) vary considerably, with only vague official guidelines in place. The annual audit is normally conducted by discussion over just one or two weeks, and up to a maximum of three weeks for even the largest businesses. There is no history of auditors verifying evidence from third parties, and they are not generally present at stock takes. Meocre Li says there is also a potential conflict of interest under the existing system, since audit firms are themselves essentially branches of the Ministry of Finance, to which they report their findings and on which they rely for information on the enterprises being scrutinised. Mr Patrick Paul, senior partner elect of Price Waterhouse for Hong Kong and China, expresses what he calls 'question marks rather than reservations' about the nature of auditing in China. He wonders how far it is essentially a Western concept requiring confrontation and probing by junior staff, which sits uneasily with Eastern ideas of 'saving face' and respect for seniority. Certainly even for the 'Big Six' firms eager to expand in China, there is extreme sensitivity over handling businesses' figures. Any qualification would destroy the chances of a stock exchange listing. Instead, there have been considerable delays in producing the accounts of companies being prepared for flotation while adjustments are made. That has not deterred the international accountancy firms from expanding in the country. At present, most of their business has come from tax, investment and due diligence work for foreign clients looking for Chinese joint venture partners. Most of the firms say they are unlikely to be generating profits within the country for at least five years. Stretched to capacity in the meantime, there are suggestions that they are subsidising their fees to gain important contracts. Yet few doubt the need to exploit China's rapid expansion, and have lost little opportunity to exploit new regulations or test grey areas in the law in their efforts to expand their operations. Andersen has probably gone furthest. During most of the 1980s, the firms were only able to establish 'representative offices' which were not permitted to generate income. Andersen managed to create a wholly foreign-owned business in Shanghai in 1991, which allowed it to hire local people and conduct business. Along with several other firms, it has now established a joint venture which allows it to carry out all the functions of local CPAs. It plans to build a training centre in China, and is already hiring many young local staff. Mr Ivan Chan, managing partner for China, says the recruits are highly-skilled. The only problem is the country's one-child per family rule has created a pampered new generation with high expectations, making staff retention difficult. But Meocre Li is confident that the effort will be well rewarded in time. By the year 2000, he predicts that Andersen in China will be generating revenues of more than the Dollars 100m a year currently billed in Hong Kong.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS SUSPEND RAMIREZ FOR REST OF SEASON  </P> <P> Ralph Ramirez, Cal State Fullerton's starting third baseman, has been suspended  for the rest of the season, Coach Larry Cochell said.  </P> <P> Ramirez, a senior, was dropped from the team after an incident in the dugout  during Fullerton's loss to UC Riverside Tuesday. Cochell said that after being  lifted for a pinch-hitter, Ramirez kicked over a chair. When asked to pick it  up, Ramirez kicked it again, Cochell said.  </P> <P> Sources close to the team said the incident was one of many disciplinary  incidents Ramirez was involved in this season.  </P> <P> Ramirez was hitting .276 with four home runs and 26 runs batted in. He was  second on the team with 24 errors. Fullerton, seeking an National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. playoff berth, finishes the regular season with a three-game  series at Fresno, starting today. Randy Graves, a freshman, will replace  Ramirez at third.  </P></p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / E German liquidity warning Eastern Germany's small and medium-sized enterprises are undercapitalised and face serious liquidity problems unless they receive fresh injections of capital and easier credit facilities, the Ifo Institute in Munich and the Institute for Economic Research in Halle warned yesterday. Despite optimistic official forecasts of 9 per cent GDP growth this year in the five eastern states, the institutes show that growth remains concentrated on the construction and food processing sector while the manufacturing base remains uncompetitive. This is because of continuing low levels of productivity which in some sectors, particularly steel and manufacturing, are 40 per cent below west German levels, while wages are currently only 20 per cent below west German levels. Eastern Germany's GDP will total DM239bn (Pounds 100bn) this year, but the total wage bill will exceed DM257bn.</p>

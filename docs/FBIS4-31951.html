			<p>BFN     [Text] Colonel (Plafait), authorized representative of the  UN Headquarters for Bosnia-Herzegovina, today presented  Brigadier General Enver Hadzihasanovic, commander of the General  Staff of the Supreme Command of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army,  with a proposal to deploy UN observers in charge of monitoring  and reporting on the observation of the cease-fire agreed upon  in Geneva on 8 June, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army press center  informs. The proposal of the UN Headquarters for  Bosnia-Herzegovina is in accordance with the conclusions of the  meeting of the commanders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the  United Nations. It envisages the construction of 66 observation  points in the southwest and northeast sectors.    The Serbian aggressor's side has not delivered its proposal  to the UN Command for Bosnia-Herzegovina yet. The final version  on the observation posts can, therefore, be expected at the next  meeting. The General Staff of the Supreme Command of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army continues to insist on an improved  number and place of deployed UN observers, especially in the  Bihac and Gorazde regions. If the observation posts are not set  up on the territories temporarily controlled by the Serbian  aggressor's side, then we will not accept and allow observation  posts to be constructed on the free territory of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, is written in the statement by the Army  Press Center.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army proposal on the number of  liaison  officers and line of administration and command has been  accepted in its entirety by the UN Command for  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The proposal facilitates efficient  surveillance and reporting by the incumbent commands on the  observation of the cease-fire.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Higher debt trims Perkins to Pounds 10m A SHARP rise in interest costs resulting from a near doubling of debt was in part blamed by Perkins Foods for a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 10.1m in the six months to end-June. However, the interim dividend is being raised from 1.7p to 1.75p from earnings per share of 4.3p (4.8p). Lower earnings reflected the increased cost of borrowings, declining margins, rationalisation costs, the issue of 4m shares to pay deferred considerations and the relocation of the company's catering meat services. Net debt increased to Pounds 23.8m (Pounds 13m), including convertible loan notes worth Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 5m), with Perkins showing a net cash outflow of Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 7.1m). Interest payments rose to Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 445,000). Gearing at the end of the half year was 62 per cent (29 per cent) up from 34 per cent at the year end. Perkins said gearing usually peaks in the second quarter following payment of final dividend and deferred consideration. Mr Ian Blackburn, finance director, said gearing should fall to about 50 per cent by the end of the current year. Turnover rose to Pounds 198.7m (Pounds 176.3m), reflecting marketing efforts and a currency translation gain which contributed 15 per cent of the rise. Margin pressure in the company's continental European operations, however, meant operating profits virtually flat at Pounds 11.4m. All four of the company's divisions traded profitably although chilled foods made lower operating profits of Pounds 2.34m (Pounds 2.85m). The mushrooms division also returned lower operating profits of Pounds 484,000 (Pounds 583,000). Frozen foods made profits of Pounds 6.56m (Pounds 6.53m) and fresh produce made Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 3.14m).</p>

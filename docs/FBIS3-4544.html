			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The 26 February issue of the Thai papers  MATICHON and KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT carry editorials on the Supreme  Command's petition to the police to investigate former Lao  Generals Vang Pao and Thonglit Chokbengboun on the charge of  violating national security.    The 600-word MATICHON editorial, on page 2, entitled: "Vang  Pao -- A Man in a Wrong Era," says: "The action by the Supreme  Command can be regarded as sincerity on the part of the Thai  Government in showing the Lao Government that it has not ignored  rightist attempts to undermine the Lao Government. Efforts by  these rightists to organize the overthrow of the Lao Government  amounts to an anachronism. The Cold War, when ideological  differences between neighboring countries led to their support  of subversive activities against one another, is over."    The editorial continues: "The current world is one of  cooperation for economic development and prosperity," adding  that the situation between Thailand and Laos has developed into  an era of cooperation for mutual benefit.    "Therefore, Gen. Vang Pao and his followers who continue to  cling to building up an army to topple the Lao Government are  living in the wrong world. It is odd that Vang Pao has chosen to  live in exile in the United States surrounded by modern  technology and thinking. Vang Pao was once a political pawn  serving the United States. One wonders, however, if he is still  serving in the same capacity or simply could not shed his past.    "The Thai Government must keep in touch with world  developments. If Thailand wants to be the region's economic  leader, the Government must show its sincerity in engaging in  economic cooperation with its neighbors -- Laos, Burma, or  Cambodia. So far, to its credit the Government has shown that  it has not gotten involved with rebel groups opposing those  governments. This will win their trust and eventually their  economic cooperation."    The 600-word KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT editorial, on page 2,  entitled: "The Stand Must Change With Time," says: "It is  strange that the Thai Government did not take action against the  Lao rightist generals itself, letting the Supreme Command do it  instead. The government has direct responsibility here. It is  possible that it does not have enough information, as in case of  the arms cache in Chanthaburi Province.    "In any event, the action against the Lao rightist generals  should have been taken long ago, when the Lao People's  Democratic Republic [LPDR] Government received the recognition  of the international community, including the United Nations.  The action was not taken earlier possibly because previous Thai  governments nurtured the hope that the rightists would be able  to overthrow the LPDR Government and return to power. It knew  that the rightists remained active and used Thai territory as a  sanctuary for their operations in Laos. At that time the LPDR  Government accused Thailand of supporting the Lao rightists.  However, the Thai Government ignored the accusation, and thus  made the Lao rightists more bold in their subversive activities."    The editorial continues: "The publicized action by the Thai  military against Vang Pao and his followers is necessary because  Thailand has to show its clear stance toward the LPDR as  diplomatic and trade contacts with that country become  increasingly greater. The Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge will be  opened soon, and Thailand cannot afford to be unclear in its  stand. Gen. Vang Pao and his followers ought to understand  their own position and Thailand's new position and quickly cease  subversive activities against the Lao Government."</p>

Peto was of the opinion that the SZDSZ is clearly in the  middle of the political arena, the Federation of Young Democrats  is somewhat to its right, with the parties of the government  coalition still farther right. The Hungarian Socialist Party is  to the left of the party.    The chairman of the largest opposition party spoke in detail  about the party's election strategy. He mentioned as the first  and most important basic principle to safeguard the cleanness of  the elections. Peto also said the SZDSZ would refrain from a  negative campaign and mud-slinging, focussing on the party's  program instead of criticizing the programs and political  activity of the other parties.    The SZDSZ chairman said the 1994 elections will basically be  of a different nature and content than in 1990, at which time  the change in political system was at stake, while this spring  voters will have to choose between democratic parties, by  considering the success rate of governmental work over the past  four years. The most important goal for the SZDSZ is to achieve  a liberal majority, and with this to take over from the current  government coalition.    As regards political cooperation with other parties, the  agreement concluded with the young democrats remains guiding for  the SZDSZ, and it will definitely respect it, Peto said. The  Hungarian Socialist Party is a political and election opponent  of the free democrats, he added, who must be defeated at the  elections.    With respect to the situation in the public service media,  Peto said the SZDSZ is not ready to participate in a "media law  show" that sanctifies the current condition.</p>

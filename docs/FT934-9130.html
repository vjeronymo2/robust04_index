			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / West sees danger in end of rouble zone THE COLLAPSE of the rouble zone could save Russia more than Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn) a year - but push many of the other ex-Soviet republics deeper into economic crisis, possibly provoking political unrest, experts in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank said yesterday. The comments mark the first acknowledgement that the Russian rouble zone has all but collapsed over the last two weeks, with seven republics now having left, or announced their intention to leave. Their moves are partly a result of the tough new conditions which Russia is imposing on its former CIS partners, demanding that the republics should be subservient to Russia's central bank rules, and deposit gold and hard currency reserves with it, to end the subsidies which the republics have been receiving. Experts in the IMF and World Bank calculate the loss of cheap credits and subsidised energy will cost the republics involved - Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - Dollars 15.5bn a year. Given that many are already in economic crisis, the moves could trigger unrest which could affect the 25m ethnic Russians living in these republics, officials added. Russia tightened its conditions for membership in the rouble zone in September, immediately after the banning of the Russian parliament. The savings in credits to Russia in the coming year will mean that almost 15 per cent of its estimated gross national product will be available for its own use - though at the cost of deepening crises on its borders. The republics which will be most affected include: Ukraine, the focus of the most international concern and where inflation is estimated to be about 70 per cent a month, has repeatedly devalued its temporary karbovanets currency. Efforts at reforms in the country have been put aside in favour of so far unsuccessful policies of state regulation. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, are formerly loyal members of the rouble zone. On Wednesday President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan announced they would jointly issue their own currencies, the Kazakh tenge and Uzbek coupons, a decision which has caused a crash in the old (pre-1993) Russian roubles they were using. Armenia, the most desperate of all ex-Soviet republics, says it cannot meet the Russian conditions because it has almost no hard currency or gold reserves, and has no means to stop the economy's slide into chaos. Few industries are working and with minimal energy supplies another freezing winter is approaching. Georgia and Azerbaijan are hard hit by internal conflicts and the cost of looking after hundreds of thousands of refugees. They have their own currency coupons, but they are highly inflationary, especially Georgia's.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS;  </P> <P> THEATER;  </P> <P> HAUNTING 1-WOMAN SHOW LOOKS TO EASTERN MYTHOLOGY  </P> <P> Interested in Japanese and Chinese mythology? How about contemporary dance and  music? Ghost stories? Brenda Wong Aoki fuses these elements into her solo  storytelling performance Saturday at Ventura High School.  </P> <P> "Obake" is Aoki's own creation, a collection of four ghost stories influenced  by Japanese Noh and Kyogen theater techniques and injected with a modern  feminist sensibility.  </P> <P> Props are used sparsely. The kimono-clad Aoki conveys her interpretations  through an expressive voice and body movement that punctuates the narrative.  </P> <P> The stories include such common Eastern mythological images as immortal  monkeys, ghostly lovers and demon quellers. One story is an amusing tale of the  mischievous Monkey King, drawn from a series of Chinese tales, recounting how  he manages to thwart the combined will of heaven and hell.  </P> <P> SHOW TIMES  </P> <P> The performance will take place 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Ventura High School's  Little Theater, 2155 E. Main St., Ventura. Tickets: $7, $5 Ventura Arts Council  member, $2 children, and they are available at Momentum Gallery, 34 N. Palm  St., Ventura. The performance is a benefit for Ventura Arts Council's  Artists-in-the-Classroom program. Call 653-0828 for more information.  </P></p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Observer: Off the record It appears John Major is holding another of his hush-hush fundraising dinners at Downing Street tonight for 15 or so heavy hitters of the business world. Let's hope, for the prime minister's sake, that it's a more profitable affair than last week's so-called private dinner for Gus O'Donnell, the prime minister's outgoing press secretary. Presumably, guests not only will keep their mouths shut but they will be required to open their cheque books; after a decent interval, of course.</p>

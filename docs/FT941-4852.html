			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Resort Hotels reveals loss of Pounds 71m Resort Hotels yesterday released its long-awaited accounts for the year to April 1993, revealing pre-tax losses of Pounds 71m and a negative net worth of Pounds 22.7m. The company is no longer able to cover its interest payments, and a number of restructuring proposals are under consideration to enable the group to survive. Mr Robert Feld, the head of the family that built up the group, yesterday resigned from the board. The other directors are expected to stand down at the time of any restructuring, to facilitate inevitable management changes. Resort Hotels shares have been suspended since July 16, when the company first announced concerns over 'a number of financing and reporting issues'. The hotel group had expanded aggressively in the previous two years, and it admitted to difficulties over property valuations, which led to the lengthy delay in releasing its accounts. The company yesterday announced the extent of its difficulties. It wrote down its properties by Pounds 40.5m to Pounds 64.4m and took a further Pounds 11.5m charge on an inter-company loan to the Country Resorts group, prior to its acquisition in 1993. A further Pounds 8.5m provision has been made against amounts due from management contracts with other troubled hotel owners. In spite of an improving hotel market, the management said it was still unable to cover its finance charges. Hotel Resorts suffered pre-tax losses, before exceptional items, of Pounds 9.4m in the year ended April 1993, after Pounds 4.7m in interest payments against its Pounds 53m bank debt. Mr David Tonkinson, chairman, said the company was looking at a number of options, which would result in a partial debt for equity swap and possibly a merger with another hotel group. The group's financial position has been improved by the Pounds 7.3m sale of four hotels in February 1994, and the company said it believed 'the group's lenders will be sympathetic to the implementation of a restructuring'. Resort Hotels is believed to be in discussions with two other hotel groups, but it is possible that it may consider a further rights issue. Mr Tonkinson said: 'The main reason for our problems was the turbulence in hotel property values and therefore the hardening of the attitudes of the lenders.' Resort Hotels was listed in March 1988, with a value of Pounds 6.7m. It expanded rapidly through a string of rights issues and had a market capitalisation of Pounds 46m at the time of its suspension.</p>

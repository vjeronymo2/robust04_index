			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Radio Progreso at 1200 on 9 February  reports that Cuba plays an active role in the fight against drug  trafficking. Several foreigners have been arrested transporting  drugs within Cuban territorial waters attempting to smuggle  drugs into U.S. territory, which were later incinerated under  official supervision.    An example of the efficiency of the National Revolutionary  Police in its fight against drugs is the case of a man in Havana  City who was arrested for growing marijuana in his backyard.  According to Detective Pablo Ibarra Martinez, Alejandro Valdes  Friel from Cerro Municipality was arrested for growing 62  marijuana plants in his backyard and for the possession of 10  packages of the drug in his home. After being arrested, Valdes  confessed that he had the plants for his own consumption.  Investigators determined that he had been carrying out this  activity for several years and had been previously arrested for  the same crime. The suspect is currently in jail charged with  the possession of toxic drugs. This crime can carry a sentence  of from three to eight years in prison.</p>

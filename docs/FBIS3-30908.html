			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mr. Oliviu Gherman, president of the ruling Social  Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], said at his party's news  conference today that the provisions of the IMF memorandum,  which are a substantial part of the economic policy of our  country, must be discussed in the parliament because the ruling  party is interested in having this accord represent the  political option of all parties and should not be solved through  a simple signature on the document.    Regarding another issue, Mr. Gherman assessed that the open  letter addressed to the parties that belong to the Democratic  Convention and the Democratic Party represents the decision of  the permanent delegation and means that the ruling party is open  for political dialogue. In the view of the PDSR, three stages  are necessary to finalize the dialogue: to establish the  principles for a cooperation in the political arena; to work out  a program regarding the unfolding of the reform in Romania; and  to hold discussions on the basis of a government coalition.    Referring to the recent declarations made by the president  of  the Republic of Moldova and Agrarian Party leader, Ioan Solcanu,  vice president of the PDSR, expressed his concern that such  pro-Russian ideologies tend to become state policy. The message  of the PDSR is the following: We should not forget that all of  us are Romanians and history cannot be distorted according to  momentary interests.</p>

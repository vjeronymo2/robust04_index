			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fears about biotechnology are not based on ignorance Sir, I feel I must take issue with David Richardson's assertion (Farmer's Viewpoint, June 21) that fears about the adequacy of biotechnology safeguards are 'probably based on ignorance'. While I would not dispute that genetically modified organisms offer great potential, it is important to appreciate that, once released into the environment, such organisms will be outside our immediate control and, potentially, will be subject to evolutionary and adaptive processes. One does not have to assume a worst-case scenario, involving the transfer of genetic material between species, to foresee problems. For example, it is obvious to anyone that oilseed rape is colonising set-aside land and marginal habitats, such as motorway verges. A genetically modified, herbicide-resistant strain of this crop could prove difficult to eradicate, presenting an insidious competitive threat to the native flora and hence the fauna. History is littered with the good intentions of scientists who failed to consider fully the implications of their actions. I do not regard myself as an ignorant Luddite because I have no desire to see the mistakes of the past repeated - I have a PhD in biology. Alan Wrelton, Forest Gate, London E7</p>

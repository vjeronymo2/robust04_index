			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Brittan begins to clear his in-tray SIR LEON BRITTAN, outgoing EC competition commissioner, is to propose today a series of decisions to fellow commissioners in a drive to clear his desk before he takes on new responsibilities in January. Sir Leon is due to take over the post of external trade commissioner from January 6, handing over competition policy to Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian socialist. At a meeting today the Commission will be asked to impose heavy fines on an EC-West Africa shipping cartel, approve guidelines for allowing national courts to examine competition cases, and authorise exclusive supply/sales agreements between the German coal industry and electricity generators. Sir Leon began to clear his in-tray yesterday by condemning Ford New Holland, the tractor manufacturer, for allegedly bullying its dealers and trying to restrict the 'parallel' import and export of vehicles to other national markets. Ford has been told to end such restrictions immediately. He also announced the Commission would look into telecoms groups' charges for rental and servicing of data-switching networks to see if they discriminated against third parties renting lines. Proposals on the table today include: Clarification of national courts' rights to investigate alleged cartels and the abuse of companies' dominant positions; Fines on EC shipping companies for operating a cartel between Europe and West Africa, following up an earlier decision to impose fines on an alleged shipping cartel between France and Africa; Setting a new ceiling on state aid to shipbuilders; Approval of Germany's 'Jahrhundertvertrag', under which German electricity suppliers must buy a set amount of subsidised local coal.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / International Company News: Cerus incurs net loss of FFr2.2bn CERUS, the debt-laden French holding group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian financier, incurred a FFr2.2bn (Dollars 360m) net loss last year, writes William Dawkins. The group also revealed it had sold its 14.9 per cent stake in Yves Saint Laurent, the fashion and perfume group, to a company controlled by Mr Pierre Berge, the group's chief executive and co-founder with Mr Saint Laurent. The pair paid FFr545m to buy back the Cerus' stake. The sale has allowed Cerus to reduce its borrowings from FFr4.1bn at the end of 1990 to around FFr800m.</p>

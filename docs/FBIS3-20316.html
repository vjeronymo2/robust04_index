			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Helsinki, March 27 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav  Klaus today ended his visit to Finland and left Helsinki aboard  a plane for Prague.    His Friday [25 March] meeting with top Finnish  representatives focused on Finnish experience concerning the  process of entry of Finland to the European Union [European  Union], something the Czech Republic would like to draw on when  trying to join the EU.    At the meeting, Klaus repeated several times his belief that  the Czech Republic would be the next new EU member. He received  assurances from the Finns that Finland would back the Czech  entry into the EU.    During the talks, both sides took position on the  Partnership  for Peace projects. Klaus said that the Czech Republic saw the  project as a way to a full NATO membership, while Finnish  Premier Esko Aho said his country was above all interested in  peace-keeping operations under the project.    Both sides said there were no obstacles in the Czech-Finnish  bilateral relations and expressed disappointment that the  present bilateral free trade agreement would have to go as a  result of Finland acquiring EU membership. They agreed,  however, that mutually, all possible measures would be taken to  offset possible repercussions of the changes.    On the weekend, Klaus visited Lapland in north Finland as  the  non-official part of his stay. Besides holding informal talks  with Aho, Klaus availed himself of the opportunity to relax.    Finnish media gave Klaus's visit high profile, expressing  admiration over the results of Czech economic transformation.</p>

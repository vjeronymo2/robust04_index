			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Union Discount back in the black with Pounds 4.5m Union Discount, one of the City's leading discount houses, yesterday reported a return to profitability after two years of heavy losses and announced the end of a costly restructuring programme. It has also securitised Pounds 42m worth of leases issued by its two remaining leasing subsidiaries, raising Pounds 38.2m. Mr Ian Martin, managing director, said this gave the company 'breathing space to reduce our involvement on a measured basis'. The company, which is to be renamed Union to reflect its broader spread of businesses, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.5m for the 1993 year. That compared with losses of Pounds 23.5m and Pounds 16m in 1991 and 1992 respectively. It celebrated the turnround with a dividend of 3p, its first for two years. Earnings of 11.5p per share compared with losses of 78.2p. A profit of Pounds 6.5m from the disposal of Winterflood Securities was matched by Pounds 6.7m of exceptional losses from Union's withdrawal from its disastrous 1980's push into term financing. Mr George Blunden, the chief executive who has instigated a radical clean-out since his appointment in June 1992, said the process was almost complete. The only remaining non-core activity is its Sales Aid Leasing businesses, which contributed Pounds 1.8m to operating profit last year, but is likely to be sold in the longer-term. The securitisation of leases from this business is in the form of Pounds 32.5m of senior notes, expected to have a AAA rating, and Pounds 5.7m of Mezzanine notes issued by Union's Sabre Leasing subsidiary which are expected to have an A2 rating. Continuing operations contributed Pounds 4.37m before exceptional items. The management is confident that this represents a profitable core, with upside potential from various new businesses. Union intends to build up Aitken Campbell, its marketmaking arm, and its derivatives business. COMMENT In a short period of time, new management has brought Union Discount back from the brink and it is once more in a position to focus on its money market skills, where it has more than a century of expertise. With capital tied up in lossmaking leasing businesses, its money market activities have been restricted, as have a growing range of related businesses where it can build on its existing client base. Analysts expect pre-tax profit to increase to Pounds 5.5m in the current year. At a share price of 202p, the shares are trading on a prospective p/e of about 10.4, and a premium to net asset value per share of 197p. Given its stage of recovery, further upward movement will be an act of faith in the management, but it has gone some way to earn this.</p>

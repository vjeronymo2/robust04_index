			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (8): End of S4C contract trims HTV's profits - Stewart Dalby tunes in to 'media city' CARDIFF HAS such a vibrant and diverse media scene that it has often been termed 'media city' in its promotions. Depending on where you are and how you set your aerial, it is possible to receive seven different television channels or variants of channels. Similarly, it is possible to tune in not only to Radio Wales but also to the other five BBC stations, as well as a variety of commercial ones. The city has its own morning, evening and Sunday newspapers - the morning paper, the Western Mail, styling itself 'the national newspaper of Wales'. Cardiff is also thought to have more independent television producers than any city outside of London. If video companies and design concerns are included, around 6,000 people are employed in the media industry, some 2,500 of them involved directly in broadcasting. One reason why there is such life in the media sector is the Welsh language. After the failure to get an assembly for Wales, in the late 1970s, a public-service Welsh-speaking television station, S4C, was established in 1982-83. There was perceived to be a genuine need. Between a fifth and a third of people in Wales speak Welsh. Yet it was not just a question of language: there was a cultural identity to be catered for. At the same time, non-Welsh-speaking people were increasingly fed up with hours (often peak hours) of viewing time devoted to programmes in a different language. The fourth channel was therefore a neat political solution to a social and cultural problem. The fact that Cardiff is a national capital, rather than just the centre of a region, influences the printed media, too. John Humphries, editor of the Western Mail, pursues what he calls a twin-track policy: 'We have to compete with all the London-based newspapers - notice I call them London-based and not national newspapers - on international, political and sports coverage. At the same time, we have to supply news about Wales, in which there is great interest.' News of Wales is editionised. The Western Mail has nine editions, regional and otherwise. Two pages of news about Wales are changed each night. The paper feels strongly about local issues. Recently it took David Hunt, secretary of state for Wales, to task for failing to push through parliament the private bill that would have allowed a barrage to be built across Cardiff Bay. The existence of S4C has meant that the two main television channels, BBC Wales and HTV, have prospered, because, in a sense, they had a captive market. S4C has a budget of about Pounds 44m and runs about 25 hours of Welsh-language programmes which go out on Channel 4. Until recently, those which were not produced by the BBC were largely made by HTV. The main commercial channel had a five-year contract to make nine hours a week for S4C. Since the contract expired, however, S4C has turned more and more to the growing band of independent producers. Loss of revenue through the drop in demand from S4C has contributed to a huge dent in HTV's pre-tax profits, though other factors have included: a new exchequer levy imposed in January 1990, changes in the way programmes are made, a poor advertising market, and competition from independent producers in areas other than Welsh-language programmes. Pre-tax profits for the year ended December 1990 were Pounds 5.3m on turnover of Pounds 179m. A direct comparison is difficult, because of a change in the year end; but for the five months that ended December 1989 they were Pounds 7.4m, and for the year ended July 1989, Pounds 14.5m. Hard times have also resulted in severe staff cuts. Some 700 people are now employed, compared with more than 1,000 two years ago One way to improve profits might be to make more programmes for the national network. But the domination of the network system by the big five commercial companies (Central, Thames, London Weekend, Yorkshire and Granada), says Mansel Jones, head of press and public relations at HTV, makes it difficult for medium-sized commercial companies such as HTV to get a look in. HTV faces further competition in that, by 1992, 25 per cent of output must be made by independent producers. But before then - this month, in fact - it faces a stiff challenge when its licence comes up for renewal. The new round of franchises, which will be partly determined by sealed cash bids, is considered unfair at HTV. Mr Jones has compared them to a 'blind crap shoot'. There is a feeling at HTV that the expertise in making programmes for Wales should count for something more than cash in an envelope when the bids are sorted. BBC Wales, too, has been experiencing upheavals. As part of the Funding the Future exercise, which requires the BBC as a whole to save Pounds 75m by 1993, it is looking for savings of Pounds 2m and the loss or contracting out of 300 jobs. It, too, has to commission 25 per cent of its output from independents by 1992. With this shake-up under way, Geraint Talfan Davies, controller of BBC Wales, sees the challenge of the future as making more English-speaking programmes, not just for Wales but also for the national network. Recently, BBC Wales announced that it would, for the first time, appoint a non-Welsh-speaker to a top programme post. BBC Radio Wales already has a substantial number of its programmes networked: last year, it had 306 hours broadcast on other BBC stations. Gaynor Shutte, the new editor of BBC Wales, wants to increase this substantially, not just because it is lucrative, but because it keeps up standards. In contrast, BBC Television Wales networked only 20 hours last year, partly because of its Welsh-language obligations. (BBC Scotland networked 160 hours of its programmes). But Geraint Talfan Davies hopes the number of networked hours will reach three figures in the next few years.</p>

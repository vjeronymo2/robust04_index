			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The impact of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  transport from outside of an area on ambient air quality conditions in non-attainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the first and second points, the Department notes that roughly one-third of the nation's coal-fired power plants and one-half of its gas- and oil-fired power plants are located in non-attainment areas. These are the types of generating plants that, together with non-utility stationary sources and vehicles, are the sources of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Attainment areas: Abstracting from the issue of transport into non-attainment areas, the Department would rely heavily on the information underlying the existing ambient standards for tropospheric ozone. These standards were issued in early 1993. However, at the time the standards were issued, EPA noted that new studies, done after finalization of the criteria document on which the standards were based, might suggest health effects at lower concentration levels. The Department welcomes comment on whether and how these newer studies, which have yet to be formally evaluated by the EPA, should be reflected in a damage assessment. The Department's damage assessment will also consider non-health impacts drawing on studies included in the criteria document underlying the latest standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Non-attainment areas: In non-attainment areas, reductions in electricity demand affect the level of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions in several ways. Any new generating plants in ozone non-attainment areas that are needed to meet growing electricity demand would, under the regulatory structure of Title I of the Clean Air Act, be required to fully offset their NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions before they could begin operation. Alternatively, changes in electricity demand could simply affect the operation rate of existing plants, without triggering offset requirements for the operating company. In this latter case, the initial effect would be an increase in emissions. However, Title I also specifies milestones, or progress requirements, for emissions reduction in non-attainment areas. These requirements are applicable to NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in serious and severe non-attainment areas. If these progress requirements were binding, a change in the level of emissions from the operation of existing power plants could affect the level of reductions that State Implementation Plans would require from other types of sources in order to meet these requirements. From this perspective, a change in appliance efficiency standards could change the control obligations of parties unrelated to appliance purchase decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To develop its analysis on a national scale, DOE will try to develop information regarding the extent to which each of the cases described above characterizes prevailing conditions. In order to develop an acceptable basis for estimating the external benefits associated with NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission reductions in both attainment and non-attainment areas, DOE will be seeking more information on the likely marginal effects of appliance standards on net emissions and the marginal control costs required to meet non-attainment area progress requirements. DOE will also be seeking better data on how damages and control costs might vary seasonally, which may increase or decrease the estimated benefits of particular types of appliance efficiency standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, DOE recognizes the concern that transport of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from attainment areas may affect ozone concentrations in non-attainment areas, even though they do not trigger offsets either through the new source program or via progress requirements. DOE welcomes information and analysis regarding the importance of this issue for a national evaluation of externality damage, and recommended approaches for incorporating it into the quantitative analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the effect of increased tropospheric ozone concentrations on the level of UVB at the surface, represents a potentially favorable externality. The Department welcomes comment on the inclusion of this pathway in the externality analysis, and on the use of information developed in the context of various rulemakings and assessments related to the impacts of stratospheric ozone depletion to estimate marginal damages from reduced ozone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> c. Carbon Dioxide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department believes that the potential for climate change due to an enhanced greenhouse effect, a global scale issue, is the only relevant externality pathway for carbon dioxide emissions. Clearly, this is a high priority issue. In 1992, the world community completed negotiations for a Framework Convention on Climate Change. This convention has already been signed by 152 nations and should achieve a sufficient number of ramifications to enter into force by the spring of 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

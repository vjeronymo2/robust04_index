			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While at present there is no infant restraint that can be safely used with an air bag, vehicle and child restraint manufacturers have undertaken research to develop compatible restraint systems. Ford's comment illustrates that an amendment to permit motion in infant restraints could provide some of the needed flexibility to vehicle and infant seat manufacturers to improve present vehicle and infant seat designs to achieve compatibility. While Ford did not seem to believe motion in an infant seat such as that provided for by this rule would in itself achieve compatibility, NHTSA hopes that air bag-compatible infant restraints will be developed in the near future. Century has demonstrated the practicability of a design that can meet both the need of an infant to be upright in a crash and the need to be supine while under normal driving circumstances. NHTSA believes today's amendment might act as a catalyst for the development of infant seat designs that use motion to manage crash forces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to Mr. Sebring's concerns that a child in an infant restraint that changes adjustment positions during a test can experience acceleration levels on its chest cavity that are not experienced with current restraints, no information was submitted to support this assertion. Further, given that there is no information showing there will be potential safety problems with restraints that change adjustment position, NHTSA does not agree that this rulemaking should be delayed pending research on a test dummy that measures G forces experienced by occupants of these restraints. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Forward-Facing Restraints <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters wanted the prohibition against changing adjustment positions during testing to be removed for all types of child restraints. Century, Ford, and Mr. Koziatek suggested removing the prohibition for forward-facing toddler restraints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has decided not to permit change in adjustment position for other types of restraints. Today's amendment permits such change for rear-facing child seats only. In the case of convertible seats with an infant mode, change would be permitted in the infant mode only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency's reasons for adopting the amendment, discussed in the preceding section, are relevant to infant restraints, but not other child restraints. This amendment does not eliminate the prohibition for forward-facing child seats because there is insufficient reason for doing so. In addition to preventing a child's fingers or limbs from being caught between the shifting parts of the restraint, the prohibition serves to prevent a child seated in a forward-facing child restraint from submarining (i.e., sliding too far forward and downward, legs first) during the crash. The prohibition has been an effective and simple approach to accomplishing those purposes. There is no information that weighs in favor of removing the prohibition for forward-facing restraints, such as information indicating that a change in adjustment position could protect forward-facing children from injury from an inflating air bag.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Friedman suggested removing the prohibition for car beds. He also suggested S5.1.1 of Standard 213 be amended to permit ``permanent deformation'' of the interior surface of a restraint as a means of providing crash protection for the occupant. Mr. Friedman's suggestions are outside the scope of the rulemaking, and have not been adopted by this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Limits on Motion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule does not adopt the proposal that movement of the restraint's seating surface relative to the system as a whole during testing must be unidirectional rotation or translation. Several commenters addressed this issue. Century requested that the rule permit the child seat to reverse its direction during the dynamic test of Standard 213. According to the petitioner: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If NHTSA does not permit the restraint to return to its more horizontal position after the crash, we believe that you have continued to maintain the risk for the [apnea-prone] child that this change was intended to eliminate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ford said NHTSA should ``evaluate the risks involved in abrupt cessation of the movement of the child restraint.'' (NHTSA assumes the reference to ``abrupt cessation'' relates to what Ford believed would result from the proposed requirement that the movement must be unidirectional rotation or translation.) In contrast, Mr. Sebring believed the motion must be only unidirectional rotation or translation. The commenter believed ``there are obvious bending moments produced in the occupant's neck as a result of whiplash action which occurs when the restraint returns post-impact to its original horizontal position.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

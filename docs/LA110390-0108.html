			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> A LITTLE HEALTHY FRICTION?;  </P> <P> MEETING FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON, THE PROGRESSIVE MUSIC-DIRECTOR-TO-BE  AND HIS CONSERVATIVE AUDIENCE CHALLENGED EACH OTHER.  </P> <P> Esa-Pekka Salonen, we are assured, holds the future of our Philharmonic in his  flamboyant hands. Thursday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, he taught  Los Angeles a few more things about his musical persona.  </P> <P> For his first concert of the season, he juxtaposed a pair of French  masterpieces from the turn of the century with two works from his native  Finland, one old and one very new.  </P> <P> The Music Center audience, in turn, taught the youthful music-director-to-be a  few things of its own about local artistic perspectives. Significantly,  perhaps, the house was less than full.  </P> <P> The on-going relationship between the adventurous maestro and our essentially  conservative public will be interesting to observe. Perhaps we should brace  ourselves for a little healthy friction.  </P> <P> It is clear that Salonen is not going to settle for lazy solutions to  contemporary problems. Our potential sonic savior is a man of his time,  unburdened with a lot of historical baggage. His dedication to musical  exploration far exceeds anything we have experienced with his predecessors on  the Philharmonic podium.  </P> <P> This music director won't lull the subscribers with a steady stream of pretty,  familiar tunes. He doesn't particularly want to send the masses home humming.  He does, however, want to send them home thinking.  </P> <P> It won't be easy. Still, if anyone can plead the case for modernism  persuasively in this town, Salonen may be the man.  </P> <P> Los Angeles loves a hero, especially if he looks the part and speaks with a  slight accent. Salonen is handsome, boyish, slim, blond, energetic, capable of  picturesque passion and exotically foreign. He might have been sent to us by  Central Casting.  </P> <P> Luckily, he also happens to be immensely talented. Given time and proper  conditioning, he might just persuade Los Angeles to embrace his progressive  aesthetic.  </P> <P> A push-button ovation greeted his entrance. It soon became clear, however, that  many in the crowd of well-wishers were more eager to clap than to listen.  </P> <P> Before the final pianissimo cadences of Sibelius' "En Saga" could even begin to  evaporate, the mood was shattered by insensitive applause. Salonen looked  startled. He didn't look pleased.  </P> <P> One expected the worst at the end of "Du Cristal," the seemingly chaotic new  piece by Salonen's compatriot Kaija Saariaho that opened the second half of the  program. Philharmonic regulars have been known in the past to make rude  remarks, walk out, even boo when confronted with anything so unhummable.  </P> <P> Not this time. The first-nighters listened stoically and applauded politely.  They registered neither enthusiasm -- which would have been surprising -- nor  disapproval -- which might have been candid. They followed their potential  leader, took their medicine, and looked forward to washing away any dissonant  memories in the waves of Debussy's "La Mer," which was to follow.  </P> <P> Comprehension of the relatively forbidding idiom might have been enhanced,  incidentally, with penetrable annotation. In lieu of a good program note,  however, the management reprinted a chatty, quizzical, quasi-analytical letter  to the composer, written by a Finnish colleague. It only served the cause of  obfuscation. Salonen may want to pay some special attention to this aspect of  his missionary work when he takes up residence here in 1992.  </P> <P> Saariaho's score, commissioned by the Philharmonic in association with the  Helsinki Festival, makes a mighty, multitextured noise. It raves and rumbles  with aggressive force, yet compels attention by constantly shifting rhythmic  gears and frequently altering textural focus.  </P> <P> Just when the music seems most unyielding in its density and toughness, it  reveals an unexpected, even delicate melodic fragment or adds a new splash of  color. Saariaho's complex structural devices demand intense concentration.  Clarification of her intentions will, no doubt, come with repeated exposure.  When Salonen settles in, it might be useful if he gave us a lot of routine  second performances along with the wonted glamorous premieres.  </P> <P> The conventional part of this program on Thursday confirmed his technical  prowess as well as his temperamental abandon. In "Ma Mere l'Oye," he mothered  Ravel's goose with ravishing tone and expressive refinement. In Debussy's  "Mer," long a Philharmonic specialty, he favored storm over calm. In the  process, he invoked shades of Mehta rather than Giulini, but his brisk and  broad performance made sense on its own incisive terms.  </P> <P> In Sibelius' somewhat soggy "Saga," he allowed the music to brood and soar with  poignant theatricality. His abiding conviction made the premature applause  doubly regrettable.  </P> <P> The Philharmonic played brilliantly for its incipient boss in all cases.  Already, he seems to bring out the best in the band.  </P></p>

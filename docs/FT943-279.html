			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Industry output bounces back in Japan Japan's industrial output bounced back a higher-than-expected 3.6 per cent from July to August, confirming that production is settling into a gently rising trend. The turn-round, from a 1.7 per cent decline in July, means output is set to rise by a 1.9 per cent from the second to the third quarters of this year, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry forecast. That would be the third consecutive quarter-on-quarter rise of this important measure of economic activity, representing nearly a third of Japan's GNP. Miti expects output, often volatile, to fall in the next two months, as manufacturers hold back after an unusually strong August. But the trend of average production in the first nine months of this year is 0.5 per cent above the same period of 1993, Mr Bick Beason, senior economist at James Capel Pacific estimated. Stocks of unsold goods were flat last month, by comparison with July, but fell 7.1 per cent over the year, prompting Miti to predict that inventory adjustments would soon be completed. Evidence that some industrial sectors are gearing up for a recovery in demand came yesterday with a survey showing that producers of machinery will increase their capital spending by 3.2 per cent in the year to next March, the first rise for three years. This is led by semiconductor and liquid crystal display producers, which plan a 16.6 per cent rise in investment this year, responding to the growth in demand for personal computers, the Japan Machinery Federation said. Carmakers expect the second biggest sector rise in machinery spending, 2.4 per cent this year, according to a federation survey of its members.</p>

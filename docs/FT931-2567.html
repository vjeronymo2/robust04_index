			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Surprise fall in unemployment: Pound rises sharply as figures boost hopes of economic recovery UNEMPLOYMENT fell last month, for the first time in nearly three years. The unexpected decline sent the pound sharply higher yesterday and raised hopes that recovery is taking root. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by a seasonally adjusted 22,000 in February. The drop was the biggest since November 1989 and kept the unemployment total below the politically sensitive 3m mark. The Department of Employment said there was no obvious explanation for the fall, which confounded City expectations of a 35,000 month-on-month increase. While welcoming the fall in unemployment, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, greeted the news cautiously. 'It would be consistent with previous recoveries for the figures to be volatile for some time,' she said. In the House of Commons, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said he feared the February fall was a 'freak'. 'We are delighted if there are fewer people officially out of work. We hope it will continue for future months and years. But we do fear it is a freak,' he said. Unemployment now stands at 2.97m, compared with 2.99m in January, while the unemployment rate has dropped from 10.6 per cent to 10.5 per cent. The unadjusted total dropped 19,451, but remained just over 3m. Neither the government nor independent economists were willing to read too much into one month's figures, but the fall added to evidence that interest rate cuts over the past few months have stirred economic activity. Building societies, meanwhile, reported that the value of new commitments to mortgages rose 40 per cent last month, and earlier this week there were encouraging retail sales and manufacturing output figures. Prospects for a UK recovery were given a further boost by the Bundesbank's decision to cut its discount rate by  1/2 a point, providing a more favourable environment for lower European interest rates. The fall in unemployment took the currency markets by surprise and the pound immediately rose 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark. Sterling later closed in London at DM2.44, up a net 2 1/2 pfennigs on the day and 5 1/4 pfennigs on the week so far. The pound also rose sharply against the US dollar, gaining nearly 2 1/2 cents in London to close at Dollars 1.475 and closing later in New York at Dollars 1.486. February's drop in the jobless total reflected a reduced number of people becoming unemployed, rather than a higher number finding jobs or joining government schemes which take them off the register. Trends still show a steady increase in the jobless total which is expected to carry on rising for the rest of this year. The February figures, however, suggest a slowing at least in the rate of job losses. In the six months to February, the average monthly rise was 26,700, marginally lower than the 27,700 in the six months to January. Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said the unemployment and mortgage commitments data suggested that the economy was improving. 'It appears that the large rises in unemployment towards the end of 1992 reflected a final shake out by companies in order to get their cost base under control, rather than a new downtrend in orders and output,' he said.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, June 28 (YONHAP) -- "Border trade"  between North Korea and China took its steepest dive ever in the  first five months of this year due to the North's nuclear issue  and economic difficulties, the SING TAO WAN PAO reported Tuesday.    The evening newspaper reported from China's Jilin Province  that border trade between Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  and North Korea, mostly barter trade, came to only 80,440 U.S.  dollars in January-May, nosediving 46.1 percent from the same  period last year.    The volume is only 15.5 percent of this year's goal, the  paper quoted Kim Chong-su, chairman of the prefecture's Foreign  Economic Relations and Trade Commission, as saying.    Yanbian's exports to North Korea amounted to 22.59 million  dollars in the cited period, down 72.4 percent from the same  months last year and reaching only 8.7 percent of this year's  goal.    The paper attributed the unprecedented decrease in border  trade to global economic pressure on Pyongyang caused by the  controversy over its nuclear program, North Korea's shortage of  commodities and energy, poor crops and nonfulfillment of trade  contacts.    The paper said Beijing has been studying ways to prevent  possible unease along the Chinese-North Korean border, noting  that economic pressure by the international community could  create problems.</p>

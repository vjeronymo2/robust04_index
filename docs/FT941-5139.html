			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wembley sells 50% of Pacer Cats in Pounds 17m deal Wembley, the leisure group which owns the national stadium, is selling a 50 per cent stake in Pacer Cats, its computer ticketing subsidiary, in a bid to comply with a banking deadline to cut borrowings by Pounds 40m, writes Tim Burt. Ticketmaster, the US computerised ticketing service, is paying Pounds 11m cash for the stake and will be forming a joint venture to develop the company. Sir Brian Wolfson, Wembley chairman, said the joint venture would assume Pounds 6m of Pacer Cats' debt. 'The transaction is worth Pounds 17m to Wembley and brings us close to the Pounds 40m demanded by our lenders. The banks are very comfortable with the position.' The sale follows the disposal of several assets last year, including National Leisure Catering, Yankee Doodle, another catering group, and the Needles Hotel. It is understood the disposal programme is now within 5 per cent of the total repayments due by March 31. Although the moves will significantly reduce Wembley's net debt, put at Pounds 139m at the interim stage last year, lenders, led by Barclays, have also demanded repayment of a further Pounds 10m by the end of the year.</p>

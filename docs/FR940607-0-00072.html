			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters requested that the agencies provide additional information on what is required in evaluations and who may perform them. The agencies intend to revise their existing guidance on real estate appraisal and evaluation programs for regulated institutions to further address these issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> .3(c)&blank;Appraisals To Address Safety and Soundness Concerns <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies are adopting substantially as proposed an amendment stating that each agency continues to reserve the right to require a regulated institution to obtain a Title XI appraisal whenever the agency believes that an appraisal is necessary to address safety and soundness concerns. This authority may involve the agency requiring an institution to obtain an appraisal for a particular extension of credit or an entire group of credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters raised the concern that the agencies' authority to require a Title XI appraisal for safety and soundness purposes should be exercised only on a prospective basis. Further, several commenters noted that the agencies' authority to determine on a case-by-case basis whether an appraisal is required may lead to inconsistencies among the agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whether an institution will be required, pursuant to this provision or existing safety and soundness authority, to obtain an appraisal for a particular extension of credit, or an entire group of credits, may depend on the condition of that institution. If an institution is in troubled condition, and that troubled condition is attributable to underwriting problems in the institution's real estate loan portfolio, then the agencies may require such an institution to obtain an appraisal for all new real estate-related financial transactions below the threshold that are not subject to another exemption. Thus, for example, a troubled institution whose problems are attributable to trading losses, investment losses, or a defalcation might be allowed to continue to operate under the $250,000 threshold, whereas an institution whose problems are attributable to poor underwriting of real estate loans may be subjected to a lower threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, regardless of an institution's condition, an examiner may determine that a particular real estate-related financial transaction requires a Title XI appraisal. This provision confirms that the agencies have the authority to require appraisals for a particular transaction to address safety and soundness concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A determination that a particular institution will have to obtain appraisals below the threshold will be made by the appropriate agency's supervisory office. Although this provision is intended to be applied on a case-by-case basis to address the problems of a particular institution, the agencies will work to maintain consistency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously stated in the discussion of the appraisal threshold, as a matter of policy, OTS intends to require problem institutions or institutions in troubled condition to continue to obtain Title XI appraisals for loans over $100,000. Given the overall concentration of real estate-related transactions in the thrift industry, OTS believes that a problem thrift or a thrift in troubled condition will, in general, have real estate-related asset quality problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> .4(a)&blank;Minimum Appraisal Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies are adopting five minimum appraisal standards in place of the 14 standards in the prior rule. The final rule includes four modifications to the proposed rule concerning minimum appraisal standards. The final rule requires all appraisals for federally related transactions to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Conform to generally accepted appraisal standards as evidenced by the USPAP unless principles of safe and sound banking require compliance with stricter standards;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Be written and contain sufficient information and analysis to support the institution's decision to engage in the transaction;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Analyze and report appropriate deductions and discounts for proposed construction or renovation, partially leased buildings, non-market lease terms, and tract developments with unsold units;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Be based upon the definition of market value as set forth in the regulation; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Be performed by State licensed or certified appraisers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adoption of these standards will simplify compliance with the appraisal regulation without affecting the usefulness of the Title XI appraisals prepared for federally related transactions. The amendment allows institutions to make use of the USPAP Departure Provision and eliminates several regulatory standards that parallel existing USPAP standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies proposed three alternatives for meeting the statutory requirement to use the USPAP in setting minimum appraisal standards for federally related transactions. Under the first two alternatives, the agencies would have published the USPAP as part of their regulations (either as an appendix to their rules or through incorporation by reference). The agencies have chosen to adopt the third alternative that generally references USPAP, but does not make USPAP a part of the agencies' regulations. The agencies agree with many commenters who believed that Alternative III was the most workable approach because the agencies would not have to republish changes to the USPAP adopted by the Appraisal Standards Board, and references to USPAP in the regulation could be assumed to always refer to the most current USPAP edition. The agencies believe that Alternative III minimizes potential conflicts between an institution's duty to follow the agencies' appraisal requirements and an appraiser's professional obligation to follow the latest USPAP version.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the agencies are adopting Alternative III, USPAP provisions applicable to federally related transactions will no longer be published as Appendix A to the agencies' appraisal regulations. Therefore, each agency has deleted Appendix A from its appraisal regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

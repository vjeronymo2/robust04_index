			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOOD'S REAPPOINTMENT AS CRA LEADER OPPOSED  </P> <P> In a rebuke of downtown development policies, a Los Angeles City Council  committee on Monday voted against Mayor Tom Bradley's reappointment of James  Wood as chairman of the Community Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> "I cannot allow myself any longer to rubber-stamp the confirmation of someone  who is in a position as important as you are," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky.  </P> <P> "You want to create a dense urban core in downtown Los Angeles. Incredible. I  cannot share that vision."  </P> <P> The committee voted 2 to 1 to turn down Wood's reappointment. Yaroslavsky and  Councilwoman Gloria Molina voted against Wood, while Councilman Richard  Alatorre staunchly defended him.  </P> <P> "I think that he has been a good chairman of the CRA," Alatorre said. "The  things that we hold him accountable for, we ought to hold ourselves accountable  for."  </P> <P> The reappointment goes to the full council for a vote next week.  </P> <P> Wood was appointed to the agency's board in 1977 and since 1984 has been  chairman, a position he also held in 1981 and 1982. During those years, the  CRA, with an annual budget of $500 million, presided over the dramatic rebirth  of the city's central business district.  </P> <P> Through most of the last decade, the CRA enjoyed almost a free hand to plan and  subsidize the downtown rehabilitation.  </P> <P> Using a variety of financial incentives such as grants, loans and property tax  revenue, the CRA stimulated nearly $5 billion in new construction.  </P> <P> The agency also helped construct thousands of housing units, many of them  low-income, and the Museum of Contemporary Art. The CRA also has invested  millions of dollars in Skid Row relief agencies.  </P> <P> A combative leader, Wood often wrangled with critics who questioned his -- and  Bradley's -- goal of using hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer funds to  create a bustling downtown of gleaming skyscrapers and apartment towers.  </P> <P> But in recent months, Bradley has moved the agency away from its emphasis on  downtown, proposing instead that the agency spend more time and money creating  low-income housing, revitalizing small businesses in poor areas, creating  child-care centers for the working poor and developing other programs targeted  to the needy.  </P> <P> "I carried out the mission that was given to me by the majority of the City  Council," Wood said during one of several tense exchanges with Yaroslavsky and  Molina.  </P> <P> Wood later told reporters, "I myself am very comfortable with what we've done.  I'm proud of the Community Redevelopment Agency and I'm happy to go before the  full City Council."  </P> <P> Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani said Monday that Bradley firmly backs Wood. "We feel  strongly that Mr. Wood will prevail handily when the entire City Council  votes," Fabiani said. In recent months, he said, Wood has helped redirect the  agency toward an emphasis on affordable housing. "Perhaps it takes a while for  perception to catch up with reality," Fabiani said.  </P> <P> The committee action follows more than a year of open fighting between the CRA  and the council, which last summer gave itself greater control over the CRA,  but stopped short of a complete takeover.  </P> <P> "The City Council has effectively placed the CRA on probation," said Molina,  who chairs the Community Redevelopment and Housing Committee.  </P> <P> She said there are "serious questions" about how well the CRA has mitigated the  impact of the growth for which it has pushed.  </P> <P> "People want underwriting of social programs," Yaroslavsky said, "not more  development of downtown. You accomplished that mission long ago.  </P> <P> "I don't think you get it, Mr. Wood. I don't think you understand what's going  on downtown."  </P> <P> Alice Callahan, director of Skid Row's Los Familias del Pueblo, a service  center for the homeless and poor, said that despite Wood's pro-developer  reputation, "I have learned how to work with him and he's been very supportive  of the programs on Skid Row, and I'm actually sorry to see him leave, if he  does."  </P> <P> But to others, Wood typified what they felt was the resistance at the CRA  toward helping the truly disadvantaged.  </P> <P> Larry Gross, director of the Coalition for Economic Survival, an activist group  involved in rent control and affordable housing issues, called the City Council  committee's vote on Wood "exciting."  </P> <P> Gross said he hopes Wood is replaced with "a person who is more concerned and  committed to ensuring that the CRA builds affordable housing, and does not tear  down more homes than it puts up."  </P> <P> Whatever occurs, Wood will be remembered for his emotion-charged defense of the  CRA and its goals.  </P> <P> Last year, a months-long feud finally erupted between Wood and an interruptive  gadfly who regularly assailed the CRA's policies during commission meetings.  Wood performed a citizen's arrest of the gadfly, William Tut Hayes, 54, who  wound up in jail last September with a sentence of 155 days for repeatedly  disrupting public CRA meetings.  </P> <P> Hayes was released by the courts only after Bradley interceded amid a public  outcry over his jailing. But Wood said then that he "only did what I had to  do."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cellular carriers often have the ability to raise prices for cellular service, particularly by raising prices in a manner that is less visible to the customer. A review by Southwestern Bell of its cellular markets demonstrate the phenomenon: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Chicago has made a number of changes to improve subscriber revenue. These include: November 1987_changed prime hours from 8 am to 8 pm to 7 am to 9 pm; March 1990 began charging for `ring time'; *&blank;*&blank;* December 1990 increased foreign roamer rates from 50&cent;/min to $2/day and 75&cent;/min; May 1991 increased basic monthly access charge to $19.95. This impacts about 40% of the base. For the future, with rates in general being so low, it is our intent to continue to increase rates *&blank;*&blank;* We are also evaluating charges for the Telco interconnection fees associated with their usage. [203139] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the past few years, Boston has initiated several key rate changes to improve subscriber revenue per customer. The changes include the following: July 1989 roamer surcharge introduced; April 1990 changed the billing increment from the 6-second rounding to full minute; July 1990 introduced a free of peak plan with a premium monthly access charge; June 1991 increased foreign roamer rates 32%; June 1991 raised monthly access charge $2. *&blank;*&blank;* [A]t this writing, while we are implementing a rate increase in June 1991. Nynex has filed a tariff which would lower rates and price their plans below ours across the board. Their actions seem illogical and appear to contradict the steps needed to offset declining customer usage. *&blank;*&blank;* As for the future, SBMS believes there are other opportunities to increase rates in Boston, somewhat dependent on our competitor. *&blank;*&blank;* With monthly access charges relatively low, SBMS will continue efforts to move this fixed charge upward. [203140&hyph;41] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Washington/Baltimore property historically has had the highest subscriber revenue per customer of all the SBMS properties. *&blank;*&blank;* Washington/Baltimore was one of the last SBMS properties to fall below the $100/month average subscriber revenue. *&blank;*&blank;* Plan F, a plan designed to add new customers quickly *&blank;*&blank;* resulted in a large addition of customers, [but] it was priced so inexpensively *&blank;*&blank;* that it drove the Washington/Baltimore average downward. Plan F has been subsequently dropped. Despite the obvious failure of Plan F, Washington/Baltimore has introduced a number of changes to improve subscriber revenue per customer *&blank;*&blank;* Changed the billing increment to full minute rounding; increased roaming rates; *&blank;*&blank;* changed peak hours *&blank;*&blank;*; increased access charges on low end plans. Washington/Baltimore's future changes will focus on gradually increasing rates. This will be accomplished mostly through higher access charges and possibly increased per minute rates.'' [203141&hyph;42] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dallas subscriber revenue per customer has always been good for a large market. *&blank;*&blank;* Over the last couple of years, the Dallas property has been the SBMS leader in implementing changes to improve subscriber revenue. Subscriber revenue per customer has declined 113.8% since 1988 while peak minute usage per customer has dropped 24%. Major factors contributing to this performance are as follows: Changed from 30 second to full minute billing increments; raised access charges on economy and basic plans; introduced `free off-peak' which initially resulted in higher peak usage. Once established, eliminated the offering from low-end plans; increased foreign roamer rates *&blank;*&blank;* Dallas has also increased activation fees, voice mail rates, and other miscellaneous charges. *&blank;*&blank;* Dallas is also reviewing charging customers the interconnection fees charged by the Telco associated with customer usage. In Dallas, this could be as much as 2&cent;/min, which would be a significant boost to subscriber revenue. [203143&hyph;44] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [In l]ate 1989 [in Oklahoma City,] *&blank;*&blank;* roaming rates were increased. In early 1990 billing increments were changed to full minute rounding. [203146] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similar to the other SBMS markets, the West Texas properties have been gradually increasing rates by changing the billing increment, raising access charges and increasing roamer rates. Additional increases in rates will be gradual as in the past so as not to create a competitive disadvantage. Further upward movement of the access charges is the most likely course with the de-emphasis of the economy plans close behind.

Over the 1990&hyph;1993 time period in Miami, the state's largest market, BellSouth's average per minute revenues for cellular service rose 21 percent, while its market share of service revenues rose from 48 percent in 1990 to 50 percent in 1993, despite McCaw's larger share of minutes of use. For the years 1991&hyph;1993, BellSouth's per minute revenues were two percent, nine percent, and 15 percent higher than McCaw's, respectively (in 1990, BellSouth was one percent lower). In Jacksonville, over the same 1990&hyph;1993 period, BellSouth's per minute revenues rose more than 30 percent, while McCaw's per minute revenues varied from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The simplest way to examine cellular service prices is to divide service revenues by minutes of use. This calculation permits an observation undistorted by pricing plans and the like, and often is used by the cellular carriers themselves to measure their performance. The pricing information in this memorandum is based on comparing service revenue and minutes of use, based on data provided to the Department by the BOCs and McCaw in connection with our investigations, and is submitted as Exh. 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  BellSouth Corporation's Opposition To AT&amp;T's Motion for a Waiver of Section of Section I(D) of the Decree Insofar as it Bars the Proposed AT&amp;T-McCaw Merger, pp. 18&hyph;22 (June 28, 1994) (claiming that BellSouth is at a competitive disadvantage due to McCaw's ``City of Florida'' plan that allows its subscribers to have service throughout McCaw's service areas within the entire state at a single ``local'' price). 16 to 25 percent less over the same period. Despite this disparity, BellSouth retained the greater share of both service revenue (1990's 66 percent share has not surprisingly dropped to 1993's still impressive 55 percent share) and minutes of use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nonetheless BellSouth claims that it is at a competitive disadvantage to McCaw by reason of the Decree restrictions. (BellSouth Mem. 28, 33, 41) The Decree does not appear to be preventing BellSouth from charging higher prices than does its rival. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Given the BOCs' Market Power in Cellular Service, Eliminating Equal Access Will Reduce Competition in Cellular Long Distance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today these cellular systems provide equal access, as the Court has required of BOC cellular systems since 1983. A contrary ``development would have been entirely inconsistent with the terms and purposes of the decree, and the Court would not have authorized it.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mobile Service Decision, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  578 F. Supp. at 647. As a result, their subscribers can choose their long distance carrier and have the benefit of whatever competition is present in the long distance market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cellular systems ``can prevent their customers from reaching the interchange carriers of their choice by programming their switches to send all long distance (calls) to one carrier.'' <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, the operators of those cellular systems could reduce competition for long distance service by denying access to competing carriers and requiring cellular subscribers to obtain long distance at prices not set by competition between those competing carriers, subject to whatever constraint exists through competition in the cellular market. As the BOCs have recognized, non-BOC cellular carriers have done just that, <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  BellSouth and Southwestern seek to do the same. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Mandl Aff. &para;6, submitted with AT&amp;T's Motion for a Waiver of Section I(D) of the Decree insofar as it Bars the Proposed AT&amp;T-McCaw Merger (May 31, 1994).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Accord <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , BOC Mem. 9&hyph;10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> E.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> BOC Reply Mem. 23&hyph;24 (Aug. 3, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

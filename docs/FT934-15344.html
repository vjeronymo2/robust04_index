			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Reliance posts 14% advance at midterm RELIANCE Industries, the Indian textiles and chemicals group currently in the middle of the country's largest corporate fund-raising exercise, yesterday posted a 14 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Rs2.07bn (Dollars 66.8m). Sales in the six months to the end of September rose 35 per cent to Rs24.7bn. Reliance said it had performed well in the first half and forecast 'an even better performance on all major indicators in the second half'. Reliance Industries is the flagship of the fast-growing Reliance group headed by Mr Dhirubhai Ambani and his sons Mr Anil Ambani and Mr Mukesh Ambani. Last year it raised funds for two plastics factories being built in partnership with Itochu, the Japanese trading company. Now it is raising Rs8.6bn in the first slice of a Rs21.7bn convertible bond issue for a new company, Reliance Petroleum, which plans to construct a Rs51.4bn oil refinery. If the project goes ahead as planned, the refinery will be India's biggest private-sector industrial investment. Mr Dhirubhai Ambani has built Reliance over the last 25 years from a small trading company into one of India's largest industrial houses, rivalling much older combines such as the Tata group. Unlike longer established houses which are usually highly diversified, Reliance has concentrated on building a vertically integrated group focused on oil, petrochemicals and their derivatives such as artificial fibres, plastics and chemicals.</p>

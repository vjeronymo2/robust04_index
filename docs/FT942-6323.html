			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Mediobanca falls under Ferruzzi investigation Four top executives of Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, were yesterday warned they were under investigation by Ravenna magistrates for alleged irregularities in their role as advisers to the Ferruzzi-Montedison group which collapsed last June. The notice, served yesterday by the Guardia di Finanza, includes Mr Enrico Cuccia, the octogenarian honorary chairman still regarded as the single most influential figure in Italian finance. The other three members covered by the notice were Mr Vincenzo Maranghi, Mr Gerardo Braggiotti and Mr Maurizio Romiti. Mediobanca reacted with an uncharacteristically angry statement expressing its 'bitterness' that it was being 'criminalised' for its attempt to 'save Italy's second largest industrial group from bankruptcy'. Mediobanca, controlled by former state banks and a group of large companies, has watched its share price fall sharply in the last month, just when it is planning to launch a L1,500bn (Pounds 620m) rights issue. This is the first time the inquiry has been directed towards persons in an institution not directly linked to Ferruzzi-Montedison. The magistrates ordered the Guardia di Finanza to take documents from Mediobanca's Milan offices a fortnight ago. This followed denunciations by Mr Carlo Sama, former chief executive of Ferruzzi who is facing corruption allegations, that Mediobanca had abused its role as an adviser and failed to help Ferruzzi- Montedison properly. He also claimed that Mediobanca was aware last June of some L400bn of undeclared bad debts in offshore companies but allowed these to be excluded from the 1992 accounts, technically a criminal offence. Mediobanca said yesterday that it had submitted 'incontrovertible' evidence to the magistrates that it had neither the power nor a duty to vet the balance sheet. However, the Ravenna magistrates said they were obliged to investigate Mr Sama's claims. It is the first time that Mediobanca - under fire for its accumulation of financial power - has been caught up in the corruption scandals. But Mr Braggiotti's father Enrico, former chairman of Banca Commerciale Italiana, is sought by Milan magistrates for allegedly receiving Dollars 50m in the 'Enimont affair' and Mr Romiti's father, Cesare, chief executive of Fiat, has fallen foul of other investigations.</p>

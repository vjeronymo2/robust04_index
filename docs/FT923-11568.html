			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / World Trade News: The painful rush to sew up Nafta pact - Bush may want to present free trade deal to Congress in time for the elections TRADE ministers from Mexico, Canada and the US meet tomorrow in Mexico City in an attempt to resolve their outstanding differences over the proposed North American Free Agreement (Nafta) so that a text of an agreement can be initialled by the end of the month. The flurry of activity, and the spate of concessions Mexico has made in recent weeks, suggests that President Bush may still want the option of presenting an agreement to the US Congress before the November 3 presidential elections. 'The only reason to be hurrying up at this late stage is if they want to sign before the elections,' argues Mr Timothy Bennett, chief adviser in Washington for the Mexican private sector. Mexico has helped the frequently stalled negotiations gather momentum by making a series of key concessions. In return, it has received the promise of an end to US steel and textile quotas, agreement on food and health standards, the establishment of a trinational panel to settle disputes, and the gradual elimination of already low US tariffs. The Mexican concessions appear more telling, in part because, as the most protected economy, Mexico has the most to give away. The government is also run by committed free-marketeers, who would, even in the absence of Nafta, probably have made many of the concessions unilaterally. In one of its earlier concessions, the government agreed to let foreigners own 8 per cent of banking assets in 1993, with no single bank allowed more than 1.5 per cent of assets. Each year the ceiling will increase by one percentage point until the year 2000, when the then 15 per cent limit will be scrapped. However, foreign banks which exceed a certain size will not be allowed to grow through acquisitions, while Mexico will be guaranteed control of the national system of payments. The Mexicans have also agreed to open all but 14 petrochemical products to foreign investment immediately, and of these another nine will be opened up in three to five years. This would leave just five of the current 19 products in the hands of the Mexican state. While the Mexican government has adamantly refused to let private sector oil companies explore for oil under 'risk contracts' - where the companies can keep a proportion of oil they find - it will accept 'performance contracts.' This is where the driller is paid a bonus fee if he strikes oil, or performs his work under time. Contractors are now only paid a flat fee. Mexico will also open up the procurement of Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex)  - about Dollars 5bn a year - and of the Federal Electricity Commission (another Dollars 2bn a year) to US and Canadian companies. But the three countries remain bitterly divided on just how much of the procurement should be opened up, with the US fighting for a full opening, and the Mexicans for something much more restrictive. Mexico's decision to open up the corn sector to US and Canadian growers is perhaps the most significant concession, given the poverty in which most of the country's 2m corn-growers find themselves. Mexico has agreed to purchase 2.75m tonnes of corn a year, according to US corn-growers, and increase over a 15-year period the quota and simultaneously reduce tariffs on corn imports until free trade is achieved. These concessions are conditional on agreement being reached on tariff reductions for Mexican exports of fruit and vegetables to the US. The US and Mexico still disagree on the speed at which US tariffs must be cut on sensitive products and even on what these sensitive products are. Similarly, the three countries have made almost no progress on the car sector. The US is still pushing for a high regional content rule of 65 per cent, in the hope this would penalise non-American producers. The Mexicans and Canadians are hoping for 50-55 per cent, precisely so as not to scare away non-American investors. As if that were not enough, Mexico and the US still disagree on Mexico's rules that require car companies to match imports into Mexico with exports from Mexican plants. The US wants to import two cars into Mexico for every car exported, but Mexico's autoparts makers object. Some kind of compromise will be made which sets a floor on domestic Mexican car production equal to last year's production plus a percentage of last year's total imports. The three countries are also working on another compromise of some complexity. Mexican-based car companies will be able to import finished vehicles into Mexico according to, first, their exports of vehicles from Mexico and, secondly, a percentage of the imports of components made by their Mexican assembly plants. This percentage may start at 18 per cent and after 10 years conclude at 52 per cent. The bewildering array of deals and differences reflect the different visions of North American free trade. The US is determined that their industries gain from the treaty, even if consumers do not. US car companies and textile producers want high rules of origin to block out low-cost Japanese and other low-cost Asian producers. Mexico wants to protect its sacred oil sector from the the north and give weaker industries time to shape up before facing the onslaught of US competition. Like the Canadians, the Mexicans are marginally less inclined to shut out non-American companies from the new regional market by acquiescing to high regional content rules. These conflicting visions of North American free trade will come to a head this weekend - and, just perhaps, be resolved.</p>

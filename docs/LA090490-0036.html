			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Uneventful Monday: The promoter of Labor Day weekend's Rock 'n' Roll's Main  Event at Glen Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino County canceled the third  and final day of the festival on Monday due to poor attendance. Last week,  promoter Michael Scafuto predicted a crowd of at least 30,000 per day, but  attendance figures never rose above 2,000 on Saturday and 4,000 on Sunday,  according to a festival spokesman.

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW: 'PROFOUND' ART CREATED FROM URBAN DEBRIS  </P> <P> Old shoes. Letters from the 1930s. Newspaper clippings.  </P> <P> These are flotsam and jetsam of our lives, ignored in back-yard sheds and junk  piles. Yet such items are infused with personal histories. Perhaps they were  once important to someone. Perhaps it is significant that they were thrown out.  </P> <P> Three artists showing at Pierce College's Art Gallery have filled an exhibit  with such urban debris. Like its title, the show "Found/Profound" offers  current expression that hopes to be empowered by bits and pieces of anonymous,  past lives:  </P> <P> * Betty McDonald builds constructions of scrap wood and wire and, in one  instance, shoes -- "fascinating trash," she calls it. The artist claims to be  guided by a garbage-can intuition.  </P> <P> "Why I pick up what I do is not known to me," she says in accompanying text.  </P> <P> From such basic beginnings, McDonald ambitiously attempts to present her  opinions regarding "aspects of being a woman" as well as "censorship, flag  protection, contemporary icons and our planet in distress."  </P> <P> One particularly striking piece, called "Exposure," features an unclothed  plastic doll perched on a bed of crushed glass. The doll's head is bound in  pink ribbon and black thread. A row of lights along the top lend this  construction a carnival appearance, but block letters warn "DON'T LOOK AT THIS  NUDE." One assumes that the work falls under the "woman/censorship" heading.  </P> <P> * Along a more personal and painful theme, Nancy Halvorsen has produced a  series of images and handwritten texts framed by a gooey, tarlike substance  bristling with bits of twigs and seashells. These works, in both picture and  word, equate the illness of the artist's mother to the destruction of nature.  </P> <P> "She has cancer, just like the rest of the Earth, the cancer of our greed, of  our emptiness and insatiable lust for things for objects to own and devour,"  Halvorsen's text says. "The cancer is devouring my mother, just as the cancer  of our human greed is devouring the Earth."  </P> <P> The centerpiece for Halvorsen's series is a full-page newspaper ad that Exxon  ran shortly after the Valdez oil spill. The company apologizes and insists that  it has taken every possible action to clean up the spill.  </P> <P> Images above and below this ad -- human figures bent in sorrow or twisted in  anger -- cast doubt on Exxon's sincerity.  </P> <P> * Kathi Martin has provided a less assaultive fare. She harks to a less  complicated era before people were desensitized by constant stimulation. The  wood and glass boxes she calls "Los Angeles" are filled with faded letters and  postcards. Tourist pictures show the city as a place of color and beauty. Yet  the images can evoke discord.  </P> <P> "We have visited these very spots last week," Martin writes in the accompanying  text. "We couldn't find a parking place and litter was jammed along the edges  of all the tree lawns."  </P> <P> As Betty McDonald suggests in her text, the most banal items can offer insight  to a society that produced and used them up. McDonald, Halvorsen and Martin  struggle to illuminate such discarded wisdom.  </P> <P>  "Found/Profound" continues through Dec. 6 at the Pierce College Art Gallery,  6201 Winnetka Ave., Woodland Hills. The exhibit is open from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.,  1:30 to 3:30 p.m. and 7:30 to 9 p.m. Mondays; 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and 7:30 to  9 p.m. Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. Wednesdays; and  11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Thursdays.

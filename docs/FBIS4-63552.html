			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Starikevich: "Belorussian [Belarusian] </F> Government Takes Out Loan for Elections"]    [Text] Minsk -- According to the laws of physics, a body  in free fall gathers speed. Approximately the same thing is  happening to the Belorussian [Belarusian] economy -- it seems as  though the Vyachaslaw Kebich government sees its sole task as  being to make sure that the landing (which will be anything but  soft) does not happen before the presidential elections.    All the emergency braking systems available to the Council  of  Ministers have been brought into play. At a routine session of  the Supreme Soviet Presidium 18 July [as published] a decree was  passed under pressure from ranking government officials on the  allocation of loans to the Council of Ministers. The National  Bank of Belorussia [Belarus] is obliged to grant the government  50 billion rubles [R] in both May and June out of the revenue  received in the first quarter. It is interesting that this  revenue came to just R36.6 billion. So there is nowhere for the  money to come from, except from the printing presses. But even  that is not all. Commercial banks have been instructed (!) to  allocate the Council of Ministers loans totaling R400 billion in  May-June. Hardly anyone is likely to be taken in by the bashful  formula "allocate" -- the mechanism of voluntary coercion was  elaborated back in the years of developed socialism and still  functions well to this day.    Stanislaw Bahdankevich, chairman of the National Bank,  announced at a press conference that the money supply in the  Republic had increased 28-fold since January last year. It is  not hard to guess that the Belorussian Government's next  economic crisis will lead to a fall in the Belorussian ruble's  exchange rate. Why is the government taking this action and  where will the money go?    The widely publicized agreement on monetary system  unification is still not having any results. And nor could it  -- that has long been clear to economists. But, as Stanislaw  Bahdankevich noted, "not all of us in the government are  familiar with economics." On the eve of the elections, the  prime minister's team, which has staked a great deal on  unification, would like to have at least some positive effect to  show the voters. The removal of customs duties as of 1 May has  not led to any reduction in prices.    The hundreds of billions -- some freshly printed, others  virtually confiscated from commercial banks -- will be used to  pay workers at budget-funded institutions. Under no  circumstances does the government want to leave voters without  any money on the eve of the elections. And although this golden  rain may be expensive, it will make it possible for the prime  minister to become president.</p>

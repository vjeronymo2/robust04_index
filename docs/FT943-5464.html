			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Wall Street worries The Federal Reserve's chances of piloting the US economy to a soft landing seem to have improved this week. Yesterday's employment figures point to a slower rate of economic growth. Data on manufacturing orders and consumer confidence as well as the important purchasing managers' report - all published this week - also suggest that higher interest rates have taken the heat out of the economy. But Wall Street, which fell yesterday, is in no mood to celebrate. Inflationary pressures continue to niggle. The manufacturing sector is particularly strong, with job creation showing no sign of slowing. If capacity utilisation continues to rise, inflation could result. Bears can get exercised about the overall employment picture too; jobs growth of 180,000 a month is hardly pedestrian and the national unemployment rate is still falling. Since purchasing managers also reported rising materials costs and higher commodity prices that are expected to feed through into the wider economy, it is still possible to paint a bleak picture on inflation - though the worries look overdone. The bigger problem for equities could be that earnings expectations have not fully adjusted to the more relaxed pace of growth. On a multiple of around 16 times this year's forecast earnings, Wall Street is anticipating that the earnings momentum will continue at least into next year. Since the economy is slowing and the best of the rationalisation gains have already been seen, that can no longer be taken for granted. Even if the economy achieves a soft landing, equities could come down with a bump.</p>

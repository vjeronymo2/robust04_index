			<p>BFN     [Text] A media spokesman for the unified Central Command  of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and  the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has  said that intense pressure is being applied on their detainees  inside the prisons of the Israeli occupation authorities to  secure their approval of the Gaza-Jericho accord.    The spokesman said in Damascus today that Israeli  authorities  have been seeking to strike a demeaning and cheap bargain with  the detainees requiring them to undertake in writing that they  support the Gaza-Jericho accord.    The detainees, noted the spokesman, rejected the deal that  seeks to deprive them of their legitimate right to pursue the  fight against occupation and settlement activity. He urged  human rights organizations to move to obtain freedom for the  detainees and guarantee their right to free self-expression.</p>

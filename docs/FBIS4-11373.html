			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 Apr (NA) -- The organization that  groups small- and medium-sized laboratories today maintained  that the draft Patents Law relating to medicines that has been  submitted by the executive branch "will inexorably lead to  uncontrolled price increases of medicines and to a serious  deterioration of the sector's industrial activity."    Cooperala, Cooperative of Argentine Laboratories of  Medicinal  Specialities, says in a communique that the executive branch's  draft "reflects the highest aspiration of U.S. multinational  laboratories."    It adds: "This is in disagreement with the guidelines agreed  upon in this respect by the executive branch in the recently  concluded GATT Uruguay Round."    "In the chapter that refers to medicinal patents, the  Uruguay  Round considerably attenuates the U.S. demands and makes more  equitable the rights and obligations of the 119 countries that  signed the document," the communique states.    Cooperala admits that "although intellectual property rights  are a basic factor for guaranteeing the continuity of individual  creativity and industrial progress, our organization understands  that the creation of a monopoly to implement this factor is  inconceivable."    "We understand that with an adequate percentage of  acknowledgement for the inventor, society can benefit from the  serious competition of all those industrialists who have  adequate capability to develop medicines," the communique  concludes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Khalid 'Abd-al-Rahim] </F>   [Text] Asif Ali Zardari, personal envoy of Pakistani Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto, has said the three-year-old embargo  against the Iraqi people is an inhuman crime committed by  countries that claim to be civilized and to care about human  rights.    In a statement to AL-THAWRAH, Zardari said the fact that the  embargo has been in place for more than three years confirms the  barbarity of these nations, which are killing the elderly and  children through this embargo. The nations which claim to be  civilized should reconsider their stands and heed international  appeals for an immediate lifting of the embargo against the  struggling Iraqi people. They should also have a humanitarian  view and translate it into action.    On the effects of the embargo on the economy of Pakistan,  Zardari said Pakistan had previously broad trade and economic  interests with Iraq and the other Arab states. The embargo has  greatly affected trade in Pakistan. We have lost a great deal  due to the embargo's impact on trade and economic ties which had  earlier revived the Pakistani economy. The embargo has harmed  these interests and inflicted great harm on the Pakistani  economy, he said.    Assessing Iraqi-Pakistani ties, the Pakistani envoy said:  Iraqi-Pakistani relations date back thousands of years. They  have always been strong and close. Since a friend in need is a  friend indeed, Pakistan had to side with Iraq because it is  experiencing difficult circumstances that require extending all  kinds of support to it.    I also consider Iraq my first country because I come from  the  Sind province, which shares deep-rooted relations with Iraq  since the Islamic conquest. Therefore, the purpose of our visit  is to enhance relations between the two Muslim peoples and  friendly countries.    On his talks with Iraqi officials, the Pakistani envoy said:  The talks were conducted in a cordial, frank atmosphere. We  exchanged views to promote cooperation in the interest of our  two peoples.    Asif Zardari handed a written message to Prime Minister  Ahmad  Khudayyir on 9 February addressed from Benazir Bhutto to  President Saddam Husayn.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TOLD TO BAN TUNA IMPORTS;  </P> <P> FISHING: JUDGE ORDERS EMBARGO UNTIL FOREIGN FLEETS PROVE THEY ARE REDUCING THE  NUMBER OF DOLPHINS THEY KILL. MEXICO WOULD BE AMONG NATIONS MOST AFFECTED.  </P> <P> A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Bush Administration to impose an  immediate embargo on imports of tuna caught by foreign fleets until they prove  they are reducing the number of dolphins they kill.  </P> <P> The ruling by U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson, though certain to be  appealed, affects at least five nations: Mexico, Venezuela, Panama, Ecuador and  Vanuatu.  </P> <P> Henderson accused the Commerce Department of failing to enforce a 1988  provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act by not demanding that the  countries prove they are cutting their dolphin kills to levels comparable to  the U.S. tuna fleet's so-called incidental take.  </P> <P> "Simply put," Henderson wrote, "the continued slaughter and destruction of  these innocent victims of the economics of fishing constitutes an irreparable  injury to us all, and certainly to the mammals whom Congress intended to  protect."  </P> <P> Henderson ordered Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to impose an embargo  immediately until the Commerce Department produces proof that foreign fleets  have reduced the number of dolphins killed.  </P> <P> "This is a stunning rebuke for the government's position," declared David  Phillips, executive director of Earth Island Institute, which sued to force the  federal government to take action against the foreign nations.  </P> <P> "Basically, the State Department has been categorically against enforcing these  embargoes," Phillips continued. "They have put dolphin protection at the bottom  of the priority list in dealing with these countries."  </P> <P> Government attorneys could not be reached Tuesday.  </P> <P> The 1988 provision in the Marine Mammal Protection Act required that countries  seeking to export tuna to the United States prove that their dolphin take in  1989 was no more than two times the number killed by U.S. tuna boats.  </P> <P> The U.S. government was supposed to have determined whether the foreign fleets  had complied by the end of 1989, Henderson wrote. The act also required that  exporting countries prove by the end of this year that their 1990 dolphin kill  is no more than 1.25 times greater than the U.S. fleet's kill.  </P> <P> But Henderson accused the foreign nations and this government of foot-dragging,  and pointed out that U.S. authorities only received data on the 1989 catch last  month. The United States has not received any data for 1990.  </P> <P> "The statute requires a fairly simple calculation," Henderson wrote. "In this  age of computers, it is difficult to understand why this calculation would be  so difficult or time-consuming."  </P> <P> Should the embargo go into effect, the impact on tuna fisheries in the five  nations could be dramatic. Phillips estimated that Mexico exports 20,000 tons  of yellowfin a year to the United States.  </P> <P> Other nations export less, Phillips said. But he said the Pacific island nation  of Vanuatu exports 72% of its tuna catch to the United States, while Venezuela  exports 48% of its tuna to this country.  </P> <P> Fishermen long have fished yellowfin tuna by locating herds of dolphin, which  often swim directly above tuna. To catch the tuna, fishermen set huge purse  seine nets. When the nets are shut and hauled aboard, large numbers of dolphins  are killed or maimed.  </P> <P> The U.S. tuna fleet has been phasing out the practice of "setting on dolphins,"  and major domestic canners have stopped buying tuna if the fishing techniques  used to catch them harm large numbers of dolphin.  </P> <P> Still, foreign fleets continue the practice. Phillips said Mexico has as many  as 50 ships using purse seine nets. The American dolphin kill in 1989 was  12,643, down by 36% from the previous year. But a National Marine Fisheries  Service official recently told Congress that dolphins killed last year by  foreign tuna fleets rose by more than 40%, to 84,000.  </P> <P> Henderson said the failure of Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to enforce the 1988 provision  of the Marine Mammal Protection Act "assures the continued slaughter of  dolphins."  </P> <P> "The statute was intended to use access to the United States market as an  incentive for foreign nations to reduce marine mammal deaths. The secretary,  contrary to Congressional intent, has not provided that incentive," the judge  wrote.  </P></p>

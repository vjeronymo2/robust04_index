			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: LUXEMBOURG;  </P> <P> DISTANT TEST FOR U.S. FARMS  </P> <P> Foreign ministers of the 12 European Community nations take up the divisive  issue in Luxembourg on Monday of how far they should go toward meeting an  American demand to reduce continental farm subsidies.  </P> <P> That's the thorniest issue in the so-called Uruguay Round of negotiations aimed  at liberalizing international trade, and a vital one for U.S. farmers hoping to  develop overseas markets.  </P> <P> Also on the agenda will be two other items that have split the ministers in the  past: whether to offer financial aid to Egypt, Turkey and Jordan to compensate  for extraordinary trade losses caused by the U.N. economic embargo against  Iraq; and how fast to move toward a common European currency, which is the  subject of a scheduled EC summit in December.  </P></p>

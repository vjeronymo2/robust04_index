			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Russia and US edge towards N-arms treaty MR Lawrence Eagleburger, US secretary of state, and his Russian counterpart, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, edged closer to a historic nuclear arms reduction treaty yesterday, although doubts remained after several hours of talks, Reuter reports from Geneva. 'We're making progress,' Mr Eagleburger said at a dinner he hosted for Mr Kozyrev at the end of a day of talks. But asked if he could complete the Start II treaty today, he said: 'I can't tell you. We're not going to say anything more until we've got this thing finished. We will be doing our best.' Earlier, Mr Kozyrev had voiced optimism that he and Mr Eagleburger could succeed in efforts to complete the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty before President George Bush left office on January 20. 'I am ready to bet a bottle of whisky and say that we will do such work here which will make it possible for our presidents to have a positive decision after our negotiations today,' he said. At the dinner the Russian foreign minister said he still expected to win his bet. 'So far my glass is full,' he said. But Mr Richard Boucher, a US spokesman, had said after the initial meeting that it was clear the talks would have to continue today. Mr Eagle-burger plans to return to Washington this afternoon, regardless of whether or not he has secured a deal. Start II aims to reduce the two countries' stocks of nuclear weapons by about two-thirds and eliminate land-based missiles with multiple warheads, the most dangerous category of cold war weapons. As the talks began there were three issues separating the sides: the fate of Russian SS18 silos, the role of Russian SS19 missiles and the question of which US bombers should be counted under treaty limits. The US relaxed its earlier position that all silos housing the 154 SS18 missiles should be destroyed. Under the treaty the missiles would be eliminated but Russia had asked to preserve the silos to protect mobile SS25 missiles. On SS19s, Mr Eagleburger said Washington was prepared to allow the Russians to 'download' five warheads from some of their 170 missiles and thus preserve them under the treaty. On the issue of bombers, the US wants to retain the option of loading nuclear weapons on its B1 aircraft as it retires B52 bombers. But Russia says the B1s should be counted under the treaty limits if Washington wants to preserve that right.</p>

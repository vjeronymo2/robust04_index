			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Strength at Saint Louis Sir, In the Lex column article on Arjo Wiggins Appleton (September 22) reference was made to 'the financial weakness of Saint Louis' and the piece questioned whether that is holding back AWA's industrial progress. Your question is irrelevant because it is based on a false premise. Far from being financially weak, Saint Louis has one of the strongest balance sheets in French industry as you yourself recognised only three weeks ago. We have gone on record recently to the effect that we have an aggressive acquisition strategy and a war chest of FFr7bn to fund it. Michel Roqueplo, financial director, Groupe Saint Louis, 23-25 Av. Franklin-Roosevelt, 75008 Paris, France</p>

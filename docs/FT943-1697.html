			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Unilever concedes detergent damaged clothing Unilever yesterday admitted that its revolutionary detergent launched this spring under the names Persil Power and Omo Power was 'defective'. The detergent has been at the centre of an acrimonious row between Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, its US arch rival in the Pounds 6bn a year European detergent market, following claims that it damaged some types of clothing in repeated high temperature washing. Its formula was revised and a new version launched in June. 'We made a mistake. We launched a product which had a defect which we had not detected,' Mr Morris Tabaksblat, co-chairman of the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, said. The re-launched product had remedied the problem, he added. In the first explanation by a senior executive of the problems, Mr Tabaksblat said: 'I think we were very enthusiastic about an exciting new product . . . and did not look closely enough at the negatives. Somewhere between research and marketing, something went wrong . . . under the normal pressure to be first to the market.' The detergent, sold under the Persil name in Britain but as Omo on the Continent, contains manganese catalyst 'accelerator'. This was found to react badly to certain dyes in extreme conditions. The reformulated version uses less accelerator. The flaw was first publicised by Procter &amp; Gamble which discovered it in its own tests. It has used the defect to attack Unilever unmercilessly in the media and the market place. Mr Tabaksblat was speaking in Beijing on the eve of the opening of Unilever's Walls ice-cream plant in the city and the announcement of the company's eighth joint venture which will become its second detergent business in China. He said one key issue appeared to be a lack of 'appropriate safeguards' in tests before the launch. At high temperature and with repeated use, the manganese catalyst reacted badly with certain new textile dyes, which 'were not in our test battery'. However, he expressed full confidence in Unilever's researchers. All detergents caused some minor damage to clothes after repeated washings. The Dutch consumers' association said last week its own tests on the new formula still caused unacceptable damage to clothes and it was no more effective than cheaper detergents.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- Today, Abel Prieto, president  of the Union of Writers and Artists (UNEAC), said it is  necessary to move toward recognizing the country's cultural  unity which includes the contributions of Cuban emigres.    Speaking to the media shortly before the start of the second  session of The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, Prieto said  such recognition is necessary regardless of where the artistic  event takes place and added that the country has been working  toward that goal for some time.    It is a task that has been carried out with some omissions  due to the tension, but thanks to the country's interest, there  are already some publications in existence. They are the result  of ongoing rather than last-minute efforts, Prieto added.    He announced that on 25 April, UNEAC will host a panel  discussion with the participation of emigrants to analyze  possibilities for cultural exchanges and to discuss topics of  mutual interest.    Prieto spoke of ending the stereotypes and schemes  established over the past 30 years and moving on toward the  attainment of serious cultural recognition. To conclude, Prieto  described the attacks by ultraconservative groups on the  conference as ridiculous and stressed the broad ideological  spectrum of the numerous guests.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Kumaratunga wins Sri Lanka presidency Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, the Sri Lankan prime minister, swept home by nearly 2m votes yesterday in the country's presidential election, in what she called a victory for democracy and peace. 'It is a clear mandate for the peace process started by our government,' said Mrs Kumaratunga. 'This was significant as it was done in the face of a strong and inflamatory campaign undertaken by major opposition parties to fan racial violence in hopes it would get more votes.' Mrs Kumaratunga, candidate for the ruling People's Alliance, received 4.7m votes or 62.28 per cent to emerge as winner of the 'battle of the widows' by a big margin. The opposition United National party's (UNP) Srima Dissanayake, widow of the assassinated original candidate Gamini Dissanayake, polled 2.7m votes. Mrs Kumaratunga, the first woman to win a presidential election in Sri Lanka, will be sworn in tomorrow to replace the UNP's Dingiri Banda Wijetunga, officials said. In her new capacity as executive president - a position she has promised to scrap by July 1995 - she enjoys virtually dictatorial powers. Her victory showed that voters on the borders of an ethnic war-zone are not necessarily the most uncompromisingly racist or extremist. The north-central province which is regularly raided by the secessionist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam with sometimes entire Sinhalese and Moslem villages wiped out, voted overwhelmingly for the 'peace candidate'. Moreover, analysts say the military is now prepared to back her efforts to secure peace with the Tigers. Mrs Kumaratunga, 49, had led her party to victory in parliamentary elections in August, ending the UNP's 17-year rule by promising to bring peace to the war-ravaged country and cut the cost of living. The daughter of two prime ministers - she lost both her father and her husband to the country's bloody politics - Mrs Kumaratunga said her government would forge ahead with peace but not at the expense of the majority Sinhalese community.</p>

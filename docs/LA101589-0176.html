			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER TANAKA RETIRES  </P> <P> Former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, 71, who held his seat in Parliament  through the turmoil of being arrested and convicted of accepting a $1.8-million  bribe and after suffering a stroke, announced Saturday through his adopted  son-in-law that he is retiring from politics.  </P> <P> Naoki Tanaka, himself a member of Parliament, told Tanaka's supporters in  Niigata prefecture (state) that their mentor will not run in the next  lower-house election.  </P> <P> Although the stroke in February, 1985, ended the one-time political kingmaker's  clout -- not once has he appeared in public since -- the retirement  announcement stirred a flurry of comment from politicians and business leaders.  The media treated the news in banner headlines, almost as if it were an  obituary.  </P> <P> Admirers and critics both proclaimed it the end of an era in Japanese politics.  </P> <P> "Recalling his unparalleled dynamism, it makes me feel lonely," said Prime  Minister Toshiki Kaifu, whose own mentor, the late Prime Minister Takeo Miki,  permitted authorities to arrest Tanaka in 1976.  </P> <P> In the announcement, the politician once nicknamed "the computerized bulldozer"  thanked his supporters for sending him to the lower house in 16 elections  beginning in 1947, prayed for the continued development of "my beloved Niigata"  and declared that his 42-year political career contained "not one regret."  </P> <P> Although forced out of the prime minister's post by accusations of illicit  financial dealings in 1974 and stung by his arrest two years later in the  Lockheed scandal, Tanaka built up the largest faction of members of Parliament  that any leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had ever amassed. At its  peak, more than 140, or 18%, of the members of both houses of Parliament  pledged their obedience to the man whose formal education ended with the 10th  grade.  </P> <P> Remnants of the Tanaka faction, now led by former Prime Minister Noboru  Takeshita, remain the main bloc of power in the ruling party today.  </P> <P> Tanaka's retirement, ironically, creates an opportunity for the ruling party to  gain a seat in the next election. He abandoned party membership after his  arrest and is listed as an unaffiliated representative.  </P> <P> An appeal of his bribery conviction is pending before the Supreme Court.  </P></p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / New bait to lure savers: Building societies face competition For years, UK savers have been wedded to their building societies. Interest rates have been high, investment has been simple and they have had little reason to move their money elsewhere. All that may be about to change. With gross returns in most building society accounts now at about 6-7 per cent, those who live off their savings have seen their income fall by half in the past two years. Savers have started to notice. In November, the building societies suffered a net outflow of retail funds, to the tune of Pounds 187m. Over the year as a whole, the inflow has been just Pounds 178m, compared with Pounds 5.8bn in 1991. The rest of the UK savings industry thus has an historic opportunity to attract investors. The US market has shown the way. As short-term savings rates have fallen to about 3 per cent, US investors have been switching out of cash and into bonds and equities. UK investors have traditionally been rather less sophisticated than their US counterparts. But new types of financial products may be able to persuade Britons to move some of the approximately Pounds 330bn they currently hold on deposit. Societies are struggling to attract savers while at the same time stimulating the much-needed revival in the housing market through reduced mortgage rates. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said yesterday: 'The potential competition from longer-term investment products means that building society savings rates are close to their effective floor.' There have already been signs that investors are prepared to shift. National Savings proved so successful in attracting funds through its new First Option Bond earlier this year that the building societies mounted a successful campaign to force the government department to cut rates on the bond in July. Insurance companies have had considerable success in marketing 'with-profits bonds' as a half-way house between the building society and shares - the Prudential sold Pounds 350m of its 'Prudence bond' in the first half of this year. With-profits bonds have been so popular that some companies have stopped selling them, because their reserves have not been adequate to back more policy sales. There has been a revival of private investor interest in the gilts market, where long-term yields are now about 8.5 to 9 per cent. Long gilts now offer a higher income than an instant access account for the first time in several years. Enthusiasm for bonds has spread to the unit trust market. The UK bond fund sector has traditionally been tiny, but the recent falls in interest rates and the prospect of low inflation has made such funds seem attractive - Mercury Asset Management's Global Bond Fund, launched in early 1991, has already attracted about Pounds 200m. But what really interests the savings industry is whether the cautious British investor can be lured into equities. Privatisations have increased the number of individual shareholders to about 9.26m, compared with 3m in 1979, but failed to entrench the habit. Figures from ProShare, the organisation which promotes wider share ownership, showed only 200,000 of those who bought shares in privatisations have moved on to purchase other equities. Unit trusts were seen in the early 1980s as an ideal way for many people to enter the equity market - since they offer a diversified portfolio to those with small sums. Sadly, many investors only bought trusts at the top of the market in the summer of 1987, only to suffer losses in the October 1987 crash. But the clouds may be lifting at last. The personal equity plan (PEPs), a tax shelter created to encourage wider share ownership, has grown increasingly popular. All income and capital gains within a PEP are free of tax. This year's Budget relaxed the rules so that existing unit and investment trusts qualified for the full Pounds 6,000 PEP limit. With equities yielding about 4.5 per cent, a top rate taxpayer can now get a higher net return from a PEP than from many building society accounts. The tax-free label helped third quarter sales of unit trust PEPs more than double year-on-year to Pounds 319m, while overall sales of unit trusts fell. But PEPs are unlikely to widen the market for equities substantially; they still carry the risk of loss of capital. This is where a new breed of savings product may have the answer - the guaranteed equity scheme. These normally offer investors the rise in a stock market index, or their money back. This is usually achieved by investing the bulk of the fund in fixed interest securities (which grow to repay the capital) and the remainder invested in equity options and futures (to get the exposure to share prices). The products are not entirely without flaws; few pay income; they require investors to subscribe for a fixed period (normally five years) for the guarantee to apply; and the guarantee does not allow for the effect of inflation. Recent falls in interest rates may also make it more difficult for these structures to work, since more of the fund must be invested in fixed interest and less in options. Nevertheless, the marketing slogan for guaranteed products - stock market investment without the risk - has proved attractive to savers. Midland Bank, for example, recently raised Pounds 40m for a guaranteed equity bond in four weeks. The guaranteed market is still developing. But if a financial services group can come up with the right equity-based product, many UK savers might be persuaded, if not to lose all love for building societies, at least to opt for a trial separation.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH RENEWS VETO THREAT ON MINIMUM WAGE ISSUE  </P> <P> President Bush today renewed his threat to veto legislation raising the minimum  wage beyond $4.25 an hour as Senate Democrats moved to quickly pass a bill  raising the wage floor to $4.55.  </P> <P> House Minority Leader Bob Michel (R-Ill.), who met with Bush and relayed his  comments to reporters, said the President "made it abundantly clear there will  be absolutely no flexibility, not one penny, not one deviation" from his  position on the minimum wage.  </P> <P> Bush met with Republican congressional leaders hours before the Senate opened  debate on the legislation.  </P> <P> The Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) would raise the  hourly minimum from $3.35 to $4.65 by January, 1992, and contains no provision  allowing a lower wage for new workers.  </P> <P> But Kennedy aides said he would offer an amendment making his measure identical  to the House bill passed two weeks ago, which has a final wage of $4.55 and  would allow employers to pay new entrants in the job market a "sub-minimum" for  two months.  </P> <P> Bush has insisted that employers be allowed to pay any new employees a  sub-minimum "training wage" for six months. The GOP leaders who met with Bush  said he also reiterated his opposition to shortening that time frame.  </P> <P> Another of the Republicans with whom Bush met, Sen. Thad Cochran of  Mississippi, told reporters afterward that "the message that was given to the  President by the Senate (GOP) leadership was that we're going to stand with him  on the minimum wage issue. And we urged him not to back down from his  commitment to $4.25 and the six-month training wage."  </P></p>

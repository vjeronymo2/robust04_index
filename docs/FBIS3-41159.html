The proposed hard-hitting anti-drug legislation, which is  designed to give "teeth" to the existing Dangerous Drugs Act  1991 will give powers to Police, Customs and Coast Guard  officers to seize cash being imported or exported; to stop,  board, search, detain, or divert ships; to arrest without  warrant; and to appoint civilians to assist with drug busts at  sea.    The Bill was laid quietly in the Senate on Monday while the  Upper House was engaged in debate on the Petrotrin merger and in  the Lower House on Friday during the Budget Debate. A limited  number of copies was distributed only to members of both Houses.    The Bill is closely patterned after the British Criminal  Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990, which was  specially drafted to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the  1988 United Nations (Vienna) Convention Against Illicit Traffic  in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Even so, a few  sections which are important for the investigation of money  laundering activities in the UK have been omitted from the local  Bill.    The proposed amendments would improve on existing  legislation  by expressly making money laundering an offence--laundering  one's own drug money is still legal in this country according to  the 1991 Act.    The Government hopes that new laws would remove existing  impediments to the prosecution of drug offenders, and cure  deficiencies related to the confiscation and forfeiture (by  local and foreign courts) of the proceeds of drug trafficking.    If accepted and passed by the required special majority of  three-fifths of the members of each House, the Bill could prove  to be a major tool in the war against financiers and  beneficiaries of the drug trade.    It makes extensive provisions for the execution of  confiscation orders, whether made by local or foreign courts.  This is hoped to reap heavy financial benefits from nationals  convicted of drug trafficking in foreign countries.    It provides for onward extradition, in which a person's  return to a foreign territory shall not be debarred only because  the person will be sent from that territory to another, to stand  trial for an offence.    This clause attempts to rectify a deficiency in existing law  which led to the freeing of three Trinidadians in 1986, after  attempts to have them extradited to England failed because they  were really wanted in connection with a heroin-trafficking  operation in the Golden Triangle.    An offence of conspiracy to commit drug-related offences has  been created under the proposed legislation. Any person who  aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of any offence  under the Act would also be guilty of an offence and is to be  liable on conviction to the same penalty as the principal  offender.    The proposed Bill targets those who work for drug barons by  laundering the proceeds of drug trafficking, with intent to help  the trafficker to elude prosecution for a drug trafficking  offence, or avoid the enforcement of a confiscation order in  respect of his illegally acquired proceeds.    It provides for the prosecution of those who conceal or  disguise property derived from the proceeds of drug trafficking.  Anyone who converts, transfers or disposes of that property, or  removes it from the jurisdiction to assist the trafficker, is  also guilty of an offence and can be fined between $50,000 and  $100,000 and imprisoned for five to 10 years.    Unlike the British Act, however, the local Bill does not  make  the concealing of information (or providing false information)  about money laundering an offence. Under the British Act,  references to concealing or disguising property include  references to concealing or disguising the nature, source,  location, disposition, movement or ownership or any rights with  respect to the "laundered" property.    The local Bill provides a kind of amnesty for professionals  (bankers and attorneys, for example) involved in laundering  money for traffickers if they voluntarily disclose information  about the illegal activity. This is subject to conditions that  the disclosure is made before the act is done and the act is  done with the consent of a police officer, or the disclosure is  made after he does the act, but on his initiative and as soon as  it is reasonable for him to make it.    The local Bill also makes it an offence for a person to  receive, possess or convert money or property, knowing that such  money or property was derived from drug trafficking activities.  This clause targets those who provide services or goods which  are of assistance to the trafficker in his illegal activities;  or those who knowingly purchase property for "next to nothing"  or accept gifts from drug barons. It is a defence under the Bill  to prove that the property was acquired for adequate  consideration (equal to the market value of the property).    One of the more far-reaching clauses gives a Customs or  Police officer the authority to seize and detain any cash being  imported or exported, if he has reasonable grounds for  suspecting that it directly or indirectly represents any  person's proceeds of, or is intended to be used in any drug  transaction.    This clause seeks to trap hundreds of people who pass  through  the airports and other ports each year, carrying large sums of  local and foreign currency.    In previous years, anyone found carrying cash exceeding  limits stipulated by Central Bank's foreign exchange policy,  could have been arrested and charged under the Customs Act. But  since the dollar was floated in April this year, law enforcement  officers have had no jurisdiction to even question the origin of  huge sums of currency.    Under the proposed laws, seized cash can be held for an  initial 48-hour period, but its continued detention can be  authorised by a magistrate. The detention order can only last  for three months at a time, but can be renewed and have effect  for up to two years once the magistrate is satisfied that there  are reasonable grounds for the suspicion that the money is  drug-related and that the detention is justified while the  origin or derivation of the cash is further investigated.</p>

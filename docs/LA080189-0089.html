			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY, COUNTY AGREE ON PLAN TO BUILD JAIL, ADD 9 COURTROOMS  </P> <P> San Diego city and county officials Monday announced a 10-point plan to address  the region's jail crisis, committing two historically uncooperative governments  to work together on construction of a 2,700-bed pre-arraignment jail and the  addition of nine courtrooms downtown.  </P> <P> Under the tentative agreement, the city would offer land for jail sites and $3  million in redevelopment money to pay for courtroom construction. In return,  the county would spend $33 million in state funds on construction of the first  phase of the pre-arraignment jail and agree not to move any of the Superior  Courts out of downtown San Diego.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Beginning of Cooperation'  </P> <P> If approved at a joint meeting of the San Diego City Council and the county  Board of Supervisors Thursday, the "memorandum of understanding" would for the  first time make large amounts of city land and money available to the county  for construction of jails and courtrooms -- a responsibility that city  officials have historically asserted is the county's alone.  </P> <P> "It's a tremendous beginning of cooperation between the two legislative bodies  that represent the same constituents," said Presiding Superior Court Judge  Michael I. Greer, who just two weeks ago predicted dire consequences from the  city's decision to add 116 police officers to its force without a corresponding  increase in jail space. "It requires this kind of cooperation in order to  create a solution."  </P> <P> "The days of saying, 'It's not our problem, it's somebody else's problem' are  over with," said Supervisor Brian Bilbray, a member of the committee that  negotiated the agreement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mayor Endorses Basic Pact  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who two weeks ago rebuffed calls from Greer and other  law enforcement officials for city assistance in building jails, endorsed the  basic agreement but withheld comment on specifics until she has an opportunity  to review them, said her spokesman, Paul Downey.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, it is expected to take three years to build the 500-bed  first phase of the pre-arraignment jail. Until then, the jail crowding that  forces police to cite and release more than 100 misdemeanor arrestees every day  will continue, officials said.  </P> <P> On July 24, county jails held 5,160 inmates, more than double their official  capacity of 2,039, making them the most crowded jails in the nation for the  second consecutive year.  </P> <P> "There is nothing that we have done or can do that will give immediate relief  to the tremendous problem that's before us," said Supervisor George Bailey.  </P> <P> In the interim, officials are looking to the completion of the Vista jail for  some help. Bookings into the jail, which has been enlarged from 246 to 545  beds, should begin next month. The jail's capacity will be further increased  when double-bunking of inmates begins almost immediately, said Rich Robinson,  director of the county's office of special projects.  </P> <P> Officials also announced that they will support legislation aimed at allowing  double-bunking in jails built with state money, such as the 1,040-bed East Mesa  facility scheduled to open in the spring of 1991.  </P> <P> Bailey, Bilbray and San Diego City Council members Ed Struiksma and Gloria  McColl were appointed in May to the committee that negotiated the tentative  agreement and announced it at a news conference Monday. Also represented were  the Regional Justice Facility Financing Agency, which oversees spending of  sales tax revenue earmarked for jails, and the city's redevelopment agency.  </P> <P> The terms of the agreement call for the city to lease land to the county at a  "nominal" sum for the proposed new pre-arraignment jail, which is projected to  hold 2,700 inmates.  </P> <P> At a news conference, Struiksma said 40 acres north of California 52, east of  Convoy Street, and a larger parcel on the grounds of Miramar Naval Air Station,  west of Jackson Drive, are two city-owned plots under consideration as jail  sites. The former is the site once envisioned for the proposed SANDER  trash-to-energy plant, and the latter is envisioned as the home of the Police  Department's academy and pistol range. Both areas are within the city.  </P> <P> Struiksma stressed, however, that other parcels, both publicly and privately  owned, are under consideration.  </P> <P> If county lawyers win a court battle to uphold the legality of a half-cent  sales tax earmarked for jail construction, some of the $1.6 billion in revenue  from the tax will be spent to buy the land from the city at fair market value  within 12 months of a final judgment in the lawsuit.  </P> <P> In March, a Superior Court judge struck down the tax as a violation of  Proposition 13, the 1978 initiative that cut property taxes. The supervisors  are appealing.  </P> <P> If the county loses the legal battle, and another major source of funds becomes  available, that money would be used to buy the land, according the terms of the  agreement. In similarly vague language, the city would agree to spend any major  new revenue it discovers to help the county finance, build and operate jails  and courts within city limits. Distribution of fines and booking charges  between the city and county would remain the same if new money is found.  </P> <P> Even without new funding, the agreement commits the county to spend $33 million  in revenue that it will receive from the state in September to build the first  phase of the jail.  </P> <P> Planning and construction of that facility, including preparation of an  environmental impact report and possible mitigation of any environmental  damage, could take three years, Robinson said.  </P> <P> The city's redevelopment arm would make available $3 million already budgeted  for construction of nine new courtrooms downtown. County officials are  negotiating with owners of the former El Cortez Hotel on Ash Street and the  Walker Scott building on Broadway for space for the courtrooms, Robinson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Keep Court Downtown  </P> <P> In return, the county would agree to keep the court system downtown and  maintain it.  </P> <P> "If we had to move the courts out of downtown, it would decimate revitalization  efforts," Bilbray said.  </P> <P> The agreement also resurrects a city plan to hire a private company to build  and operate a 200-bed pre-arraignment jail. Although that jail could be built  more quickly, perhaps in less than a year, it depends on receipt of $12 million  from the Legislature.  </P> <P> Under terms of the agreement, the county would endorse the concept, giving the  city added support in its quest for the money.  </P> <P> The $12 million was part of a request for $34 million in emergency assistance  shot down by Gov. George Deukmejian during this year's budget deliberations.  His staff suggested that the declaration of emergency by O'Connor and the  council was "a publicity stunt."  </P> <P> Patricia Tennyson, director of the city's Inter-Governmental Relations  Department, said some legislators expressed interest in the concept during  recent deliberations, but she would not predict the chances of passage next  year.  </P></p>

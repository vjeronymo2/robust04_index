			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE OFFICIALS CONTINUE AERIAL SPRAYING AGAINST PESKY MEDFLY  </P> <P> I used to think that the spraying of pesticides to kill the Medfly was a  necessary evil with little health risk, until my neighborhood became a  continuous target for spraying. I am now beginning to think that the Medfly  spraying is not only very unhealthy for the environment, but also completely  ineffective.  </P> <P> The saturation bombings are obviously not working. They sometimes spray two  days before it rains and then have to spray again a week later.  </P> <P> Not only do we have to worry about the health risks, but we also have to worry  about one of the five helicopters crashing down into our homes. It is  impossible to sleep with the squadron of helicopters flying directly over your  house. Perhaps the leaders of pest control should change their tactics for  ridding Southern California of the Medfly.  </P> <P> I agree with William Jordan (Commentary, April 23) that "the high-command" of  pest control should try using intelligence rather than physical force. Maybe  Mother Nature will respond better to intellect, for she is definitely not  responding to force.  </P> <P> KRISTINE HOOPER  </P> <P> Montebello  </P></p>

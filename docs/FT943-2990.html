			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Limit on teachers' hours vetoed Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, yesterday ruled out putting limits on teachers' working hours or on class sizes. Her statement, made in evidence to the School Teachers' Review Body, the quango which sets pay and conditions each year, provoked an angry reaction from teaching unions. The traditionally moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers also submitted evidence to the review body, and said the 'highest priority' should be attached to 'steps that relieve workload pressure'. A survey for the union suggested teachers worked an average of 54 hours a week. Mrs Shephard said workload surveys were 'notoriously difficult to conduct'. She added that a 1992 survey by the Department for Education had suggested teachers worked an average of 42.1 hours a week and that 'it would be dangerous to rely too heavily on any one survey'. The department's evidence made no recommendations on the overall level of pay, but suggested that teachers returning to the profession after a career break or moving jobs might lose their entitlement to extra 'experience' pay points. Mrs Shephard said: 'Some experienced teachers believe that the cost of their past experience works against them.' Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the ATL, which called for a 6 per cent overall pay rise, said: 'This is like trying to get blood out of a stone. On the one hand the government demands more effort from already overloaded teachers, while on the other hand there is no reward for hard work and dedication in the classroom.' Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: 'By refusing to consider ways of reducing teachers' workload the government is undermining its own stated aim of improved pupil performance.'</p>

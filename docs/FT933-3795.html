			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Philippines hold gains in record territory SHARE prices remained little changed as selling, which followed the fixing of the settlement price for September futures and options contracts, was countered by index-linked buying and purchases by individual and financial investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 7.60 to 20,817.98, down 1.4 per cent on the week. The release of the Bank of Japan's tankan, or quarterly report on business sentiment, had little impact on investor sentiment. The index reached a high of 20,846.58 in the morning session, and lost ground on profit-taking, hitting the day's low of 20,686.47 in the afternoon. The index recouped some losses on arbitrage related buying. Volume rose to 570m shares against 247m, due to trading linked to futures and options settlement.

In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed at 1283.60, up 0.67. Steel companies continued to lose ground. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, fell Y9 to Y333. Other leading steel makers, which announced interim losses for the current fiscal year, also lost ground. Kawasaki Steel fell Y11 to Y329. Brokers were weak following reports by the Nikkei Shimbun, a business daily, that Sanyo Securities had sought financial aid from banks and other creditors due to mounting losses at a finance affiliate. The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in Sanyo, but the broker and ministry of finance officials later denied the allegations. Nomura Securities fell Y20 to Y2,160 and Daiwa Securities lost Y20 to Y1,440. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y7,000 to Y922,000, turning higher for the first time in seven days. Railway stocks were higher on the last day of subscriptions for the offering of 1.4m East Japan Railway shares. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 31.95 to 22,780.99 in volume of 29.2m shares. The index rose for the first time in four trading days on hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y190 to Y9,740 on profit taking. Roundup FOREIGN demand helped some Pacific Rim markets higher. MANILA remained in record territory, helped by heavy foreign buying of Manila Electric. The composite index added 7.45 to 1,919.22, for a 2.2 per cent rise on the week. Manila Electric A shares rose 4 pesos to 206 pesos. TAIWAN ended higher on hopes for lower interest rates and the weighted index rose 31.74 to 3,873.06, 1.5 per cent higher on the week.

BOMBAY closed higher on buying by state-owned financial institutions and by foreign fund managers, and the BSE 30-share index rose 42.35 to 2705.07, for a weekly gain of 1.5 per cent. HONG KONG saw some late overseas demand help to erase early losses and the Hang Seng index edged up 6.69 to 7,593.45, 1 per cent higher on the week.

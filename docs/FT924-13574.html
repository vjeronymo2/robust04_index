			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Georgia to set up powerful defence council GEORGIA'S ruling state council is to create a defence council with sweeping powers, in response to the violent clashes with separatist rebels in the Abkhazia region, local journalists said. It would have the power to pass decisions that will be 'mandatory for all organisations and citizens across the state', they said. The eight-man body would be headed by Georgia's newly elected leader Mr Eduard Shevardnadze. The state council said the formation of the defence council was caused by 'a most difficult situation threatening territorial integrity of the country'. Mr Shevardnadze, elected overwhelmingly as Georgia's leader on Sunday, said his prime task was to bring order to the country, swept by ethnic unrest. He said force would be used if needed to quell bloodshed in separatist Abkhazia, where hundreds of people have been killed in fighting between government forces and rebels backed by mountain fighters from Russia's Caucasus region. Georgia and Abkhazia yesterday appeared to be closer to a battle on the outskirts of the Abkhaz capital, Sukhumi, a day after the postponement of talks to end the fighting. Georgia was reported to be moving tanks, artillery and other armour near the Gumista river, north of the capital, across which the two sides are facing each other. The Abkhaz president, Mr Vladislav Ardzinba, said 'counter-measures' would be taken. 'We must liberate our territory from the invaders. But we'd like to do it by peaceful means,' Mr Ardzinba said in his stronghold of Gudauta, 40 km north of Sukhumi. Two Georgian soldiers were reported killed yesterday as separatists tried to launch an attack on the capital. The Abkhazian side, quoted by Interfax news agency, said its forces killed at least 30 Georgian troops in fighting on Tuesday in other parts of the rebel region. Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday gave South Korean officials the contents of the black box recovered after the Soviet Union shot down a Korean Airlines jumbo jet in 1983, killing all 269 crew and passengers. Its existence and contents had been denied by Soviet leaders in the past.</p>

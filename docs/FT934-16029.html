			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Arts: Niels Bjorn Larsen at 80 storms the stage as Coppelius  -Ballet Niels Bjorn Larsen was born on October 5, 1913. His entry in ballet dictionaries identifies him as a Danish dancer, ballet-master, choreographer, artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet for more than a decade, and 'the company's most distinguished mime'. What must now be added to this curriculum vitae is that on Tuesday night, to celebrate his 80th birthday, he once again stormed the 'Old Stage' of the King's Theatre as Doctor Coppelius. And he was marvellous as ever - as a devoted observer of his art, I would venture 'more marvellous than ever' - in a role he has danced for 48 years. The tradition of mime performance is one of the glories of the Royal Danish Ballet. The Bournonville repertory has ever depended upon a framework of 'natural' observation to set off the grand dance sequences. The life of a location, its bustle and character, its crowds and the bright interplay of personalities, fascinated Bournonville, and his ballets were often souvenirs of places he visited - Paris, London (he made a piece about the Crystal Palace exhibition), Bruges, Moscow, and, supremely Italy, which he adored. (His Napoli is as true an aspect of Danish nineteenth century art's fascination with the sun-lit south as the paintings of Marstrand.) It is in showing this local colour to us that Danish dancers and mime artists have, across the years, become so expert, so truthful in their playing, and Danish ballet itself has gained so greatly in distinction. (That the Danes also dance with such joyous grace is the other vital part of Bournonville's bequest to his heirs). Niels Bjorn Larsen has been one of the exemplars and beacons in this tradition of dance-acting. We were fortunate in London, during Peter Schaufuss' years with English National Ballet, that Larsen was a frequent guest - his Madge in La Sylphide is, for me, the definitive reading of the role, terrifying in malevolence and power, and with a nice edge of venomous humour. We first saw him in London 40 years ago, when the Royal Danes made their first big tour: then, as now, he gave his roles a weight, an intensity of observation, so that character seemed wholly and marvellously alive. For his 80th birthday performance - and it is certainly not a farewell: he has much to do, and much still to show us - he returned to a role he has made his own. The Danes' staging of Coppelia tells a credible story of peasant love in a believable setting - this might well be Galicia, rather than the usual Ruritania. It is also unlike other versions in text: the choreography has developed over the years from a Copenhagen production at the turn of the century. It is, in its present happy revival by Frank Anderson and Anne Marie Vessel, jolly and coherent in its folk style - you sense that these villagers have seen a plough, unlike the usual droves of balletic toilers whose hands have been dirtied by nothing more than a window-box. The production is wise, and heart-warming. (The celebrated sequence when Swanilda tests her beloved Frantz' fidelity by the rattle of seeds in an ear of corn, is replete with feeling). Henriette Muus and Lloyd Riggings were the lovers on Tuesday night - sprightly and sweetly sincere in feeling. But, of course, we were there to see Niels Bjorn Larsen, and he was tremendous. The characterisation treads, and with what finesse, a narrow path between eccentric comedy (the old chap - Coppelius, that is] - is forgetful, and given to antic bursts of activity) and wild dreams of magic. At every moment Larsen speaks to us. His playing is a marvel of timing, each gesture phrased and placed with subtlest understanding, each moment bright with a psychic energy as lively as his still astonishing physical resource. He tells us the truth, both comic and, at the last, tragic, about Coppelius. It is rare theatrical art, and as with the motto over the proscenium of the King's Theatre - 'Not for pleasure alone' - it has moral dignity, because of the humanity that inspires the reading. At the end of the evening there were cheers, flowers, presents, hats thrown in the air, embraces. We were saluting a superb performer who has embodied the ideals of his theatre throughout an illustrious career - and, most happily, continues to do so.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Man in the news: Act of faith on history's stage - F W de Klerk History draws a fine line between the visionary leader and the dreamer: both have visions, but only one succeeds in making his dreams come true. Mr F W de Klerk of South Africa may this week have made the fatal mistake which separates the one from the other, when he decided - against all the odds and against the principles which he had so long espoused - to hand over white power and accept majority rule. It was one of the more extraordinary reversals in the history of nations, which provides few examples of men who abdicate power without being forced to do so. And it was certainly never Mr de Klerk's intention: not when he acted on his initial vision of a peaceful multiracial South Africa, and released Mr Nelson Mandela from prison nearly four years ago; and not when, during the violence and anarchy that have followed, he refused better deals than the one he has now accepted. The deal he has signed will give him a place in a multiparty government of national unity, and an unenforceable commitment from Mr Nelson Mandela, likely to be the next president, that his views will not be ignored in cabinet. But Mr Mandela let there be no mistake about his intentions: he will try to obtain Mr de Klerk's assent for government action; but where he cannot, he will proceed nonetheless. The majority will rule, and the minority will have no constitutional power to stop it. Power will be shared, but only so long as it suits Mr Mandela to share it. Government spokesman Dave Steward speaks of the 'deep underlying symbiotic relationship' which underpins power-sharing; but it is hard to see that happy relationship surviving long under the strains of cohabitation. Yet Mr de Klerk did not set out to bargain away white power: his supporters did not elect him to do so; those who voted resoundingly for him in last year's white referendum were promised a different outcome. He set out, ironically, to avoid the fate of the white minority regime in Rhodesia, which waited to negotiate until it had fallen from strength, and was left with an ineffectual 20-seat bloc in a 100-seat national assembly, under black majority rule. The plan was for the South African government - which had never lost a liberation war and had successfully crushed dissent before opening negotiations - to negotiate from strength to guarantee the best future deal for whites. This was supposed to include entrenched powers for minority parties in cabinet, including what amounted to a veto for Mr de Klerk's National party on important issues; and autonomy for regional governments, to provide a check on central government power. Until recently, the National party was not interested in the argument that conventions of multiracial power-sharing would develop over time; it argued that whites' fear of majority rule would make them reject a constitution which embodied it. All that has changed: government negotiators insist the constitution lays the basis for a 'convention' of power-sharing, and that Mr Mandela has accepted a gentleman's agreement to respect it. But minorities have neither a veto in cabinet, nor any blocking power; they could walk out of cabinet, but this would not bring down the government. Moreover, the constitution fails to entrench powerful regional government, which was another National party demand. It is a measure of Mr de Klerk's image as a shrewd politician who skilfully fights his corner that many observers assume not that the president has conceded defeat, but that he has a trick up his sleeve which will deliver real power into his hands in the end. That may yet be true: for Mr de Klerk seems genuinely to believe the ANC cannot - and will not try - to rule without the National party. He is gambling on the fact that his party's power in fact will far exceed that in law. That power, say government negotiators, is based on the party's strength in the civil service and security forces (packed with Afrikaners since 1948), the economic clout of whites, the favour of the international community (which Mr de Klerk sees as his ally) and the votes of the National party electorate. His negotiators now argue (albeit belatedly) that constitutional guarantees are worth nothing unless the party proves it is indispensable to the country's new rulers: that restoring stability, the ANC's chief short-term goal, cannot be achieved without security force co-operation, which only the National party can deliver. But Mr de Klerk does not intend simply to play the role of what political analyst Steven Friedman, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, calls 'gate keeper to white confidence'. Mr de Klerk believes a 'silent majority' of black, coloured and Indian voters will flock to the NP from the ANC - whether in response to spiralling violence, or because coloureds and Indians will reject the ANC as an African party, or because other Africans fear the prominence of the Xhosa tribe in the ANC leadership. Only next year's election will tell whether Mr de Klerk imagines votes where they do not exist, and sees powerful backers where none are present. Recent opinion polls have given the NP 11 to 13 per cent of the national vote, and though this is almost certainly understated, the constitution agreed this week will do little to bolster his white support. Dissent over the constitution could yet split the party, with hardline ministers furious at the deal. Mr de Klerk's act of faith in his electoral support may pay off. If it does, it will indeed guarantee his party, and the Afrikaner nation which he set out to protect, a more secure long-term future than the minimum entrenched powers available from the ANC. But the risks are enormous. If he is wrong, Mr de Klerk could end up forfeiting all effective minority power, and being branded a traitor by his own people (many of whom already name him so). It would be a tragic irony if the man who had the courage to end apartheid should do no more than exchange one form of racial domination for another, and be forced off the stage of history at what ought to have been his greatest hour.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Forte Sir Hugh Wontner's dismissive remark that Italians make good hotel managers has always rankled with the Forte family. So it would be surprising if Forte's arrangement with Ciga was purely a management deal. At one level it is a way of expanding in Europe on the cheap, as Forte is committing only Pounds 33m in cash to the venture. Its return, though, will be limited by the fact that it will lease rather than own the Italian hotels in Ciga's portfolio. Ciga's debts are ring-fenced by the arrangement, but Forte's partner clearly does not have the cash to pay for the continual refurbishment that hotels require. That will have to be generated out of operations. The deal is also at the upper end of the market, rather than the middle, which would be Forte's more natural domain, given its roadside catering strength. That, however, may betray the real purpose. Forte is gaining rights to a luxury brand that will enhance its claim to eventual ownership of the Savoy. It will now be negotiating from a position of much greater strength.</p>

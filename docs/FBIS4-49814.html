			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhengzhou, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Henan  Province is determined to help the 7.6 million of its people who  live below the poverty line cast off poverty by the end of the  century, senior provincial officials said.    The goal was forwarded in a recent plan of the provincial  government, corresponding to a similar plan newly made public by  the central government.    According to the plan, the province will inject nine million  yuan every year into poverty-relief projects in the six poorest  counties in addition to funds from the central government for  the 28 poorest counties in the province.    Though painstaking efforts over the past eight years have  reduced the province's impoverished population from 13 million  to 7.6 million, the figure still accounts for one tenth of the  national total, the officials admitted.    By the end of 1993 the province still had 4,800 villages  whose per-capita incomes were under 300 yuan a year, the  official-set poverty line.    The officials said most of the impoverished people live in  places where the natural conditions are harsh, either too  mountainous or often hit by floods or drought, or where endemic  diseases are rampant.    The province still has over one million people and 400,000  head of domestic animals afflicted by water shortages, 2,300  villages inaccessible to motor traffic and 1,600 villages  without electricity, the officials said.    Large enterprises will also be encouraged to help poor areas  develop their own industries, as they have the technicians,  technologies and market information that poor areas often lack.    In addition, cities may be paired, the ones with relatively  better developed economies helping the poorer ones in  technology, marketing and training of technicians, the officials  said.</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Arts: Pig in a Poke - Theatre Somewhere in hell lurks a circle of theatre critics condemned to summarise the plots of Georges Feydeau's farces. Feydeau himself improvised, but stuck to this rule: 'when two of my characters should under no circumstances encounter one another, I throw them together as quickly as possible.' It would be hard to miss with this play. The Oxford Stage Company unlooses the Feydeau madness bykeeping to a tight adaptation byKenneth McLeish, transplanting the action to Edwardian Camberwell. This results in an evening of wickedhilarity. An Argentinean black-pudding dealer called Pennyfeather arrives in London and is taken for an operatic tenor named Amoroso; his host, Wembley, ties him into a singing contract.' Amoroso' falls in love with Wembley's wife, whom he mistakes for the wife of Wembley's friend, Oakleigh. But soon, after a flurry of crossed notes, both women believe he loves them. A mistaken anecdote leaves the husbands thinking him impotent. He then falls for Wembley's already affianced daughter. The essence of this delightful form makes the plot the action, and changes it with each line. Well-plotted tragedy starts every scene as close to its end as possible, but well-plotted farce never finishes anything. Feydeau adds linguistic twists: 'I'll accompany you' says a pianist to 'Amoroso', who replies, 'where?' Feydeau also knew, with Dr Johnson, that men in hope believe improbabilities. The less like a tenor 'Amoroso' sounds, the more latitude he gets. An unlikely 'voice cure' which is really a love message seems to work for a while, but you don't need David Hume to tell you about the pitfalls of causality. Mark Dornford-May, the versatile director, maintains surefooted contact with Feydeau's sheer and vertiginous terrain. Claudia Mayer's conservatory set allows space enough for confusion. Paul Greenwood and Robin Kermode as Wembley and Pennyfeather catch the pulse of the plot, quickfire and quidditative. The women, too, are excellent, with Linda Spurrier and Tessa Wyatt superb as unacknowledged rivals for Pennyfeather's love. The play moves at autobahn speed. The best lines fall to the fiance (Grant Parsons) of Wembley's daughter (Tamsin Olivier). Rejected in love, he turns to Wembley, 'Then I ask for the hand of your younger daughter' - 'I haven't got one' - 'I'll wait.' On tour to: Oxford, Worthing, Cambridge, Poole, Winchester, Bury St Edmunds</p>

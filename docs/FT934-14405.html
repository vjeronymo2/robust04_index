			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: A classic example - Directors' transactions HOW CAN one avoid talking about Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance broker? It is such a classic example of just how accurate an indicator directors can prove, particularly when they deal in unison. Back in April, a total of nine directors sold more than 1m shares at 234p. Of these, the largest sales were executed by directors who had received SBJ shares in consideration of their shares in an acquired company. Interim results in September came as a nasty surprise to the market and, with the company slipping into the red, the shares were hit hard. Nevertheless, directors wanted to buy the shares again. In all, 10 directors purchased a total of 125,000 at 144p. John Saville is chairman of J. Saville Gordon, a property investment company. One might expect him to have pinpoint accuracy when it comes to buying and selling his own shares. But history suggests that his timing could be a little less than perfect. His most obvious aberration was to sell 1m shares at 32.5p in August last year - just before the price began to rise. Now, he has sold 500,000 at 60p each.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 No of Company                     Sector        Shares    Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bilton                        Prop        14,008       91          1* Birse Group                    C&amp;C       100,000       29          1 Brammer                       EngG         7,000       20          1 Dalgety                       FdMa         9,000       45          1 Laporte                       Chem         2,054       13          1* Legal &amp; General Grp           InsL         7,350       38          1 London &amp; Manchester           InsL        54,645      210          1* Low &amp; Bonar                   Pack        20,000       69          1 Macro 4                       Elns        17,000      118          1* Saville Gordon J              Prop       500,000      300          1 Sleepy Kids                    Med       275,000      105          2 T &amp; S Stores                  Stor       101,700      153          3* Taunton Cider                 Brew        28,000       56          1 Time Products                 BuSe        15,000       34          1 TT Group                      EngG       100,000      308          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- N Atlantic Small Co           InTr        23,500       97          4 Quayle Munro                  OthF        27,000       34          3 S Staffd'shire Wtr            Watr         2,000       31          1 Steel Burrill Jones           InsB       125,000      180         10 Whitegate Leisure              H&amp;L        67,283       30          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Huge operation to save dollar THE DOLLAR rose nearly four pfennigs from its low against the D-Mark yesterday after concerted central bank intervention stopped a probable free-fall of the US currency, writes James Blitz. For the first time in more than a year, the US Federal Reserve and most of Europe's central banks acted in unison to buy dollars as the currency dropped to DM1.4463, a hair's breadth from its historic low of DM1.4430. The decision to intervene at around 3pm London time also supported sterling and the Italian lira by weakening the D-Mark. The fall of the pound and the lira had, until then, been raising ever wilder rumours about a possible realignment of the European Monetary System. Analysts in London said the operation, which must have involved the purchase of hundreds of millions of dollars, was a success as far as the dollar/D-Mark rate was concerned. The dollar ended at DM1.4815 after a previous DM1.4610 close, as dealers heeded that the Fed had abandoned the policy of 'benign neglect' of the currency. Central bank intervention has been well respected by the market since the 1980s, and dealers are unlikely to go short of dollars again at around DM1.4500. In New York the US unit further rallied to finish at DM1.4935. Dealers still found reasons to be bearish. The fundamental factors that have kept the D-Mark strong still exist. The fear that the Bundesbank will put up its emergency Lombard rate to control its money supply problem hangs over the market. The yawning differential between German and US interest rates will continue to drive the temptation to buy D-Marks. And it is not in the US authorities' long term interest to promote an expensive dollar, following June's trade deficit that exceeded Dollars 7bn. There are also doubts about the strength of sterling and the Italian lira. Although the pound rallied to a high of DM2.8530 following the intervention, it dropped back to close at DM2.8425, down  1/2 pfennig on the day. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London, said: 'The devaluation tag still hangs over the pound, and the Bank of England may have to intervene again.' The prognosis for the lira also remains gloomy. Before the concerted intervention began, the Bank of Italy was heavily intervening in the market, as its currency slipped to L762 to the D-Mark. It eventually closed at L760.30. Traders believe the policy of raising the discount rate, which the Italians have done by 1.75 percentage points in the last fortnight, may fail to check the currency's fall. By lifting rates, the Italians are increasing the cost of financing their budget deficit.</p>

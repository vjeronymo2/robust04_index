			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S NO JOKE: COMIC STRIPS ARE BIG BUSINESS  </P> <P> Attention shoppers! The following items, thanks to the comics industry's  expanded nucleus of marketing devices, are now available at your local  department store:  </P> <P> Garfield balloons, greeting cards and pajama tops. Garfield coffee cups, party  napkins, alarm clocks, nightgowns, stuffed toys and stickers. Garfield shirts,  calendars, books, house slippers, mud flaps for trucks, bookmarks and women's  underwear.  </P> <P> Not to mention Garfield on suction cups clinging to car windows.  </P> <P> "We designed those to go on bathroom mirrors and people's picture windows. It  never occurred to us that people would stick them on car windows," says  Garfield's creator, Jim Davis.  </P> <P> "That brought us a lot of attention and it makes us nervous. People are talking  about it too much," he says. "I have a closet full of cartoons that have  mentioned this."  </P> <P> It was a marketing strategy that backfired, but one of the few such problems  Davis has had to worry about on the way to seeing his funny orange cat become a  pop-culture icon.  </P> <P> This is a story about comic strips and big business, about an industry in which  a cartoonist like Davis can draw a cartoon cat and end up with much of the  profits from a major pet food chain's $73-million advertising campaign. Davis  was in Allentown recently for the unveiling of ALPO Petfoods Inc.'s new line of  cat food, which is being advertised with commercials featuring Garfield.  </P> <P> If the comics section seems little more than a frivolous bunch of cartoons and  running gags, consider what's been happening behind the scenes of the nation's  funny pages:  </P> <P> * A decision by Universal Press Syndicate to yank its comics from The Dallas  Times Herald and sell them to the competing Dallas Morning News prompted the  Herald to file suit against the syndicate. Times Herald attorneys argue that by  losing such strips as "The Far Side," "Doonesbury" and "Tank McNamara," the  newspaper will be at an unfair disadvantage in Dallas' newspaper wars.  </P> <P> * Cathy Guisewite, creator of "Cathy," has hired an attorney to challenge  certain aspects of her contract with Universal Press. Guisewite declined  comment on the dispute, but industry sources say she is charging that her  contract violates California's labor laws which restrict companies from  compelling employees to sign contracts of more than seven years in duration.  </P> <P> * "Calvin and Hobbes" creator Bill Watterson recently told an audience of  students that comics have been "cheapened and corrupted" by product licensing.  "Syndicates are only too happy to sell out the comic for a quick buck,"  Watterson said.  </P> <P> * "Family Circus" creator Bil Keane waged a successful battle last year with  King Features syndicate for the rights to own his comic and its characters; the  agreement came 10 years after the syndicate he once worked for threatened to  bring in another cartoonist to draw "Family Circus" if he didn't approve the  terms of his contract.  </P> <P> "I do know of a couple of situations where certain cartoonists are demoralized  by the fact that the characters they invented 20 or 25 years ago are owned by  the syndicate, and are not theirs," said Mell Lazarus, president of the  National Cartoonists Society.  </P> <P> Their morale hasn't been helped by the newspaper industry's decline in recent  years. Cities with two competing dailies are now few, a fact that forces  syndicates to scrounge for potential customers.  </P> <P> Paul G. Eberhart, assistant director of sales and international sales manager  for King Features, said syndicates are paid roughly the same fees for most  strips they were 10 years ago. The fee newspapers will pay is determined by the  paper's size, whether it faces stiff competition from another paper, and the  strip's popularity. Newspapers can pay anywhere from $10 to $500 weekly to run  a comic strip.  </P> <P> "In the good old days, when you had two-newspaper towns, editors would go out  and aggressively buy comics hoping that one would catch on and develop a  following. Now they're less eager to take chances on a new strip," said Brad  Bushell, vice president and sales manager for the New York-based syndicate,  United Media.  </P> <P> Artists and syndicates are at odds over the question of who should own the  rights to a comic strip, and Bushell said artists are becoming increasingly  vocal on the issue.  </P> <P> In all but a handful of cases, syndicates own the rights to each strip and its  characters. That means that United Media's United Feature Syndicate owns the  rights to "Marmaduke," not its creator, Brad Anderson. Cartoonists have  traditionally surrendered the rights to their strips when a syndicate agreed to  represent them. Now some cartoonists are sorry they did.  </P> <P> "I do not own my creation and I feel that one should. In that respect, I'm sure  all cartoonists feel the same way," said Bob Thaves who draws "Frank &amp;  Ernest." "I have asked for the rights time after time, and they have refused.  They view it as a corporate asset, and they probably don't think they should  give it away."  </P> <P> Syndicates spend from $15,000 to $30,000 to sell a new comic strip, Bushell  said. That means they need to be assured that a popular cartoonist won't stop  drawing his strip or take it to a competitor before the syndicate makes a  profit. In many cases, cartoonists are asked to sign contracts of 10 and 20  years, said Richard S. Newcombe, who founded Creators Syndicate two years ago,  and now serves as its president.  </P> <P> Newcombe believes that cartoonists should have the ownership rights to their  work, and to walk away from working conditions they don't like.  </P> <P> "It should be voluntary at all times, just like a marriage. If the creators are  very unhappy then they should have the right to renegotiate their contract or  leave. And that was called radical when I started," Newcombe said.  </P> <P> Not all cartoonists would walk away if they had a chance. And Lazarus admits  that it might be hard for the public to sympathize with their angst; the  nation's newspaper cartoonists earn from $50,000 to $30 million annually,  according to industry analysts. The two top moneymakers are Charles Schultz's  "Peanuts," and Davis' "Garfield."  </P> <P> "I'm doing well. I can't complain," Davis said. "If you have a good program,  good salesmen and good reputation, it really doesn't matter who owns the  rights. I am in a very small minority of cartoonists who is content with his  agreement."  </P> <P> So is Anderson, who draws "Marmaduke" for United Feature Syndicate. About 10  years ago, a manufacturer began producing Marmaduke dolls, a move that angered  Anderson because he had not authorized their sale. The syndicate's attorneys  contacted the manufacturer and distributor.  </P> <P> "They made them pull the toys off the market and destroy them. If it had been  me trying to handle this alone they probably would have snowballed me,"  Anderson said.  </P> <P> Yet Eberhart expects that more cartoonists will follow Keane's example and try  to wrestle ownership rights away from the syndicates. To the cartoonists who  want rights to their work, ownership is a question of principle.  </P> <P> "The cartoonist is the guy who should be steering the ship, not the other way  around," Keane said. "I considered it morally wrong for a corporation to own a  creation."  </P> <P> Keane does not see anything wrong with a cartoonist making additional income by  having "Family Circus" characters endorse infant formula or laundry detergent.  And he, like most cartoonists, isn't opposed to seeing his strip generate  spin-off products such as greeting cards.  </P> <P> "That's a result of our marketplace, which has changed dramatically," said Bob  Duffy, Universal's vice president for sales. "A lot of the auxiliary businesses  that many cartoonists are in have become very important."  </P></p>

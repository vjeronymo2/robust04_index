			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Lobbyists attack environment agency plans The government produced plans for its long-promised environment agency yesterday, only to have them roundly attacked by the environmental lobby as ineffective. The new agency, intended to be the main regulator of the environment, will be created by a bill which will be presented to parliament as soon as possible with a view to having it up and running by April 1996. The agency, unveiled at the Conservative party conference by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, will combine the functions of the pollution inspectorate, the National Rivers Authority and the local waste regulation authorities. But it will not contain the drinking water inspectorate or any of the specialised agencies which regulate the nuclear industry. The agency's brief, contained in a six-clause 'management statement', will be to provide effective environmental protection, but without imposing an excessive burden on industry. The bill requires the agency to 'take into account the costs which are likely to be incurred, and the benefits which are likely to accrue' from its actions. Although the agency will be established as an independent entity, the bill says that ministers shall 'from time to time', give it 'guidance' and the agency must pay attention. Mr Gummer said the agency itself will have to be fit and lean. The combined staffs of the agencies it will incorporate amount to about 9,000 people, but the Department of the Environment expects it to end up employing fewer than that. The plans were welcomed by environmental regulators as a way of strengthening an integrated approach to pollution control, although the rivers authority has said that it is worried that the agency's regions will be based on political boundaries rather than catchment areas. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, denounced the plan as 'a cost-cutting exercise which will lead to weaker, not stronger protection of the environment.' Environmental groups were also quick to attack what they saw as government failure to deliver its promised strong environmental regulator. Mr Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, said: 'The new agency will have no overriding legal duty to protect and enhance the environment. It will not live up to its name.' Several critics said the new bill would weaken the powers contained in existing environmental legislation. The Council for the Protection of Rural England was concerned about the high priority given to economic interests in the management statement. 'By having to assess the cost implications of everything it does, the agency may be unable to champion effectively the environment cause.'</p>

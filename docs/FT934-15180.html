			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / A challenge to pole position: Britain's magnetic appeal to overseas investors, once unparalleled in Europe, is under threat Mr Douglas Farrar is a rarity in Redruth, Cornwall: 'I'm the only Yank businessman down here. But the family has been made very welcome, even if we don't speak proper English.' As managing director of the European subsidiary of Contico International, a Missouri-based manufacturing group, Mr Farrar is responsible for the company's Pounds 4.3m investment in the Cornish town. His factory opened a year ago to make a range of plastic household products for sale across Europe; the plant is cramped and within two years the 71-strong workforce should rise by more than half again. Contico had considered other European locations. But in spite of worries that British workers would reject a 24-hour-a-day production regime, the comparative ease of setting up shop, generous grant aid and the English language - notwithstanding any transatlantic variations - gave Redruth the edge. But if 36-year old Mr Farrar feels isolated he can take comfort from the ranks of expatriate managers like him, supervising the colossal sums which foreign investors have injected into the UK's industrial base during a period of unprecedented inward investment activity. News that Mercedes-Benz, traditionally a hallmark of German engineering excellence, is actively considering Britain as the site for its planned small car manufacturing plant has caused considerable excitement in Whitehall. But there is also concern in industry and government that Britain's best days as a magnet for industrial investment may even now be over; foreign investment, which has helped supplement the damaging domestic shortfall in home-grown manufacturing capacity and technological skills, could increasingly be directed elsewhere. A study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research in London underlines the importance of foreign direct investment. It concludes that nearly one-fifth - more than Pounds 40bn - of the Pounds 220bn invested in UK industry in the past five years has come from overseas. The percentage of foreign-owned assets in the UK in relation to its total net assets - not including oil and financial services - now approaches 20 per cent. Five years ago, the figure just topped 13 per cent. Of all non-EC companies with operations in the Community, nearly 40 per cent of them have opted for the UK. Both the US and Japan, the biggest external investors in European industry, have invested more in Britain than in any other EC country. Last year, according to the Department of Trade and Industry, overseas companies initiated another 303 projects in Britain, aided by Pounds 100m of regional grants. The electronics, automotive, food and service sectors have proved the most active; the inventory of foreign investments so far involves 3,500 US, about 1,000 German and more than 200 Japanese manufacturing businesses. Overseas-owned companies provide some 16 per cent of all UK manufacturing jobs. In spite of the political debate over whether Britain's success in winning foreign investment is rooted in its alleged 'sweatshop economy' or in more positive characteristics such as deregulation and low corporation taxes, the UK appears to have left the European competition standing. But are things set to change?. While global recession has inevitably cut from its 1990 peak the level of inward investment, the fear is that other pressures might permanently undermine Britain's success. According to Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry: 'The task of attracting inward investment on the scale we have seen in the past five years will become increasingly difficult.' Mr Davies' prediction seems safe, with some of the biggest investors refocusing their overseas activities. The US, which makes one-third of all its European investments in the UK, could be looking much closer to home. 'The US preference for the UK is changing,' says Mr Martin Gerra, president of Global Affiliates, the Washington-based international business consultancy, and a former manager of international economics at International Business Machines. He says that closer trade links between the US, Mexico and Canada, even before ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement, will give rise to a big increase in cross-border investment. 'Over time, US investment in Europe, relative to total foreign investment, will inevitably decline.' Japan, the second largest investor in the UK, remains keen to invest in a country offering an EC foothold and which Japanese companies say has been welcoming and supportive. But the rush of activity which has made Japanese names commonplace on industrial estates in towns such as Telford could be over. 'Japan had a lot of catching up to do, which led to their investment boom,' according to Prof Douglas McWilliams, formerly chief economic adviser to the CBI and founder of the Centre for Economics and Business Research. 'In 1981, only 4 per cent of its assets were overseas, against 30 per cent for the US. But big Japanese companies have moved fast to raise the figure to an average of 15 per cent and now the pace has slowed. The UK will remain popular with them but investment is likely to decline over the next few years.' A study by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand concludes the UK also risks losing out on further, high-quality foreign investment. Mr Vince Taylor, one of the authors, says: 'The UK could be squeezed during the remainder of the 1990s between higher cost, but more centrally-located competitors within the EC, and the emerging economies which can undercut our cost base and which now appear able to match the UK in terms of quality.' Though there is no evidence that inward investors are more likely to close down plants than local owners, companies are also intensifying the search for economies of scale as the European market becomes less fragmented. For example, CPC (UK), a subsidiary of the US food group, recently announced a switch in production of Knorr brand soups and stock cubes from Scotland to France and Italy. 'Where you close down will be as important as where you open up,' emphasises Mr David Rees, head of Ernst &amp; Young's European location service: 'There could be good, strategic reasons for siting second and third investments away from the first.' Britain's position, he emphasises, is not helped by its continuing image as a less than wholehearted EC member, though ratification of the Maastricht treaty might help allay such perceptions. Dr Wilfried Vossen, managing director of Plant Location International, the Brussels-based location consultancy, offers another view: 'If not signing (Maastricht's) social chapter means Britain's cost structures continue to provide a competitive edge over many of its European partners, then its record on inward investment should be safe.' Competition to attract inward investment looking for a home within Europe is also escalating, with the number of investment promotion agencies working on behalf of regional authorities and local councils multiplying. Coopers &amp; Lybrand calculates agencies worldwide have doubled in five years. Mr Christopher Priston, director of the Invest in Britain Bureau, an arm of the DTI, claims it is 'still easier to put up a brass plate in the UK' than in most EC countries. But some such as France - previously giving low priority to attracting overseas investors - are working hard to make up lost ground. Mr Priston, whose bureau handles 4,000 inquiries annually on everything from the incidence of earthquakes to membership of exclusive London clubs, warns that Britain must 'continue to improve transport infrastructure to help compensate for its location in Europe and also to raise skills training'. Britain will also have to be demonstrably supportive to companies which have already set up shop. According to Prof McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research: 'You cannot underestimate the importance to inward investors, particularly the Japanese, of feeling the government is prepared to bat on their behalf.' With some new investors into the UK privately complaining of being feted before their arrival, only to be promptly abandoned afterwards, the IBB is now contacting 1,000 established foreign companies to see if it can help solve any problems they may have. A decision by Mercedes-Benz to choose Britain would inevitably be greeted by politicians as further proof of Britain's magnetic lure to world-class manufacturing companies. Potential new investors, however, will not like being trampled in the rush by those anxious to win their favours. The mere prospect of Mercedes making cars in Britain led initially to an unco-ordinated scramble by companies and organisations to help secure the deal. 'Mercedes would be a real propaganda coup and we cannot afford to shoot ourselves in the foot,' says a DTI minister. 'It would give a very timely boost to an inward investment programme which we cannot allow to falter.'</p>

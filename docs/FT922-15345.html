			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rates still stable THE UK money market was in a lacklustre mood again yesterday as one opinion poll showing a Labour surge in the marginal Birmingham, Northfield, constituency caused only a flicker of interest. Mr David Coleman of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said: 'It has given the market a bit of a fright, but otherwise it has been a very quiet day.' The survey, conducted for the Birmingham Evening Mail, showed a 14 per cent swing to the Labour party. In spite of the poll, dealers continued to fret over the prospect of a hung parliament. Although sterling remains at the bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism grid, some comfort was being drawn from the currency's continuing stability. Analysts said this reflected growing confidence in the market that the pound would not be realigned within the EMS, whichever party won the election. At the short end rates remained soft, with the key three-month interbank rate moving fractionally from 10 13/16 - 3/4 per cent to close at 10 7/8 - 13/16 . At the longer end, the one year rate stayed locked in at 11 1/8 -11. The June sterling contract opened two basis points up at 89.08 but drifted down during the day to 89.03. The Bank of England forecast an initial shortage of around Pounds 350m but later revised it to around Pounds 500m. It did not operate in the market in the morning but bought bills totalling Pounds 210m in the afternoon, including Pounds 185m of band 1 bank bills and Pounds 25m of band 2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The Bank provided late unspecified assistance of around Pounds 280m, so that by the close it had more or less taken out the shortage with total help of Pounds 490m. The overnight rate dipped to 9 per cent during the day but finished at around 10 per cent. German call money was steady to firmer on the last trading day of March. Banks quoted rates of between 9.60 and 9.75 per cent, after 9.60/70 on Monday. Traders said the Bundesbank would keep call money around 9.50/60 as April began. The US Federal Reserve refrained from reserve management operations yesterday. The Funds Rate traded at 4 per cent, the Federal Reserve's presumed target, at the usual operations time. Economists had anticipated little chance of a reserve addition.</p>

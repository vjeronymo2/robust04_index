			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bleak outlook in the housing market - The problems facing National Home Loans THE RECESSION in the UK housing market has claimed several casualties but the near-collapse of National Home Loans, the specialist mortgage lender set up in 1987, is the most spectacular victim so far. Two years ago, when Mr Richard Lacy, its founding chief executive, was deposed in a boardroom coup, NHL was the size of a top ten building society and looked set to weather the recession better than most of its competitors. Its core mortgage business appeared to be in good shape - and the group had diversified into wholesale banking, leasing, consumer finance and commercial lending. Mr Jonathan Perry, who stepped up last Friday from non-executive director to become chairman in succession to Mr John Darby and chief executive in succession to Mr Kevin Milner, faces an almost unrecognisable situation. The group is overshadowed by a Pounds 47.9m pre-tax loss in 1991. National Mortgage Bank, its banking arm, and the leasing, commercial lending and consumer finance subsidiaries have been separated from the rest of the business and are being managed by Mr Ian Hay Davison who has a mandate, discreetly endorsed by the Bank of England, to run them down and close them. 'The bank has been dead since July. Realistically, we could not expect it to take any extra deposits,' says Mr Perry, adding that the decision to close it was, nevertheless, very recent. Mr Hay Davison, apart from winding down the bank, has also to offload Pounds 140m in commercial loans; about Pounds 90m in leasing agreements and Pounds 90m of consumer loans. Although Mr Perry says he enjoys his new job and says he will stay in it until NHL is healthy again, he looks more like a stop-gap pontiff in charge of an organisation heading for a slow death. The outlook is plainly very bleak. Any faint hopes that an outside buyer - perhaps a foreign bank - might be found for the company have now evaporated. Since its cash crisis last summer, the banks have been chary about making new cash available for NHL. How did the group get into this situation? Last autumn it had 12,000 of its 71,000 accounts in arrears - though Mr Perry says that since then NHL's arrears, like those of most other lenders, have stabilised. Nearly two thirds of the mortgages in trouble were self-certified borrowers who did not have regular salaries. This week, negotiations with four bank syndicates - one thought to be the ten UK banks which last summer had to put up a Pounds 200m cash life boat to prevent the collapse of National Mortgage Bank - got under way. Mr Perry says that he is not looking to them for more time or for fresh cash. 'We do not have cash flow problems,' he says. However, he confirms that some of NHL's five-year funding falls due for renewal this year. The business he heads now consists of a mortgage book of Pounds 700m. NHL is doing virtually no new lending. Instead, its hopes are pinned on selling off perhaps Pounds 100m of high quality mortgages in a securitisation to raise fresh cash. As the book shrinks, NHL is left with a higher proportion of problem debts. Asked if he is worried about being left with a book which is just a rump of bad debts, Mr Perry chuckles and says that these days it is possible to securitise arrears as well as high quality mortgages. If he accomplishes his mission, NHL will no longer be the diversified consumer financial services group it was in 1990 when it had assets of Pounds 2.47bn, but a relatively large mortgage administrator with a balance sheet well below Pounds 500m and aspirations some day to return to mortgage lending. As for NHL's 70,000 mortgage customers, in theory they are not affected by the company's misfortunes. But many of them are stuck with a mortgage interest rate of 12.1 per cent or 12.65 per cent - far above the prevailing market rate of 10.95 per cent. Those of them that can afford to do so will probably want to remortgage to another lender. That will not be bad news for NHL, for to exit from the company, many borrowers will have to pay early redemption penalties, thereby making a useful addition to NHL's cash flow.</p>

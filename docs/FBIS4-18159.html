			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with incoming Conservative Party leader </F> Jan Petersen by Heidi Borud; place and date not given]    [Text] Jan Petersen is giving advance warning of a strong  EU [European Union] offensive. "There will be no Norwegian EU  membership if the Conservative Party does not do its part of the  job."    The day of the Conservative Party's national conference is  approaching and the party's incoming leader made it clear that  the EU question will be center-stage when Conservatives gather  in Bergen on 8-10 April.    He also made it crystal clear that the Conservative Party  shares the Labor Party's view on the timing of the referendum:    "It should be held after Sweden and Finland have reached  their decisions. In a situation in which many people think that  it is a key consideration that we should have an answer to the  question of what our neighbors are doing, it is obvious that we  cannot deprive them of this information."    Jan Petersen was the Young Conservative leader in the  campaign year of 1972 [year of Norway's pervious referendum on  EU/EC membership]. He is now looking forward to leading the  Conservative Party into a new referendum:    "We lost last time. This time we are going to nail this  thing," Petersen said.    Like Labor Party leader Thorbjorn Jagland, he hopes that the  debate will pass off a little more calmly this time: "We should  argue rather than agitate."    Petersen will have an easier job than Jagland when it comes  to maintaining control over his own party members. Even though  there are EU doubters in the Conservative Party too, they do not  constitute a dominant group among the 17 percent of voters who  currently profess Conservative sympathies.    Petersen himself said: "Given the good results from the  negotiations I am counting on unambiguous support for them at  the Conservative Party national conference. Conservative  themselves are impatient to get started."    The country's incoming Conservative Party leader is generous  in his praise of the government: "It has done a good job. We  Conservatives have always stressed that Norway should speak to  the rest of the world with one voice. Both the government's  negotiators and the EU's people have done a good job. The EU's  negotiators have shown themselves to be sensitive to our special  requirements. This makes me optimistic," Petersen.    He believes that the credibility of the "no" side will now  be  put to the test:"This applies both in respect to the results of  the negotiations, and the EEA [European Economic Area]  agreement. According to the `no' side, there was no limit to  the catastrophes the four freedoms [of movement for goods,  services, labor, and capital] would bring down on us. We have  now been part of the EEA for three months and so far no  catastrophe has occurred.    ``What the `no' side has tried to do is to portray the EU  countries as something totally alien and unknown. In this  respect the EEA agreement was a useful lesson for us. We went  through 12,000 pages of EU laws and it turned out that the EU  countries' social systems are very like our own.''    In the Storting the lawyer from Oppegard has chiefly  concerned himself with foreign policy. He is deputy chairman of  the Storting Foreign Affairs Committee and he is leader of the  delegation of Norwegian parliamentarians to NATO.    However, as the incoming Conservative leader he knows that  he  now has to be an well-rounded. He has to be a match for Prime  Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland.    Are you able to understand why in the last election many  Conservatives voted for the Labor Party because there was no  other government alternative?    "I can only note the fact that a few did so. But it is the  voters who must give us the political weight which can give us  government responsibility again."    So in the run-up to the 1997 Storting election the  Conservative Party together with other nonsocialist parties will  come forward as an alternative to the Labor Party?    "Our aim is to seek political power. But the Center Party's  shift to the left is the problem. Naturally the Conservative  Party wants to be a real alternative to the Labor Party."</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Committee set up to combat sleaze Mr John Major yesterday tried to staunch the continuing allegations of sleaze against Conservative MPs by announcing that an independent law lord is to head a new committee to examine standards of conduct in public life. Amid continuing allegations that MPs were paid by companies to ask parliamentary questions, the prime minister said the committee, to be headed by Lord Nolan, would contain nominees from the three main political parties and would produce its first report within six months. Mr Major said in a statement to the Commons that Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, had completed an investigation into specific allegations made by Mr Mohammed Fayed, the chairman of Harrods, that ministers were paid to ask questions on his behalf. He said Sir Robin had found 'no evidence' that Mr Neil Hamilton, a junior minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, had been guilty of such actions. However, he told MPs that other allegations had been made since Sir Robin had completed his report, and that he had to consider whether they prevented Mr Hamilton from carrying out his responsibilities as a minister. 'I believe they do,' Mr Major said, 'and he agrees and has resigned from the government.' In announcing the creation of the committee Mr Major said there was public disquiet about standards in public life and that action to deal with the problem was now 'imperative'. He had therefore decided to set up a body whose terms of reference would be to 'examine current concerns about standards of conduct in public office, including arrangements relating to financial and commercial activities, and make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements which might be required to ensure the highest standards of propriety.' Mr Major added: 'This country has an international reputation for the integrity and honour of its public institutions. That reputation must be maintained and seen to be maintained.' The prime minister said the committee would look at the responsibility of a range of public office holders, including: Ministers, civil servants and their advisers. MPs and members of the European parliament. Members and senior officers of all non-departmental public bodies and NHS bodies and non-ministerial office holders. Non-ministerial office holders. Members and other senior officers of other bodies discharging publicly funded functions. Elected members and senior officers of local authorities. He gave an assurance that the committee would examine whether cabinet ministers could take up directorships in companies with which they had been connected while in office, and that it would examine the privileges and perks of appointees to quangos. Mr Major admitted that he had considered creating several types of body to carry out the investigation, including a royal commission, a committee of privy counsellors and a Speaker's conference. None of these had been deemed suitable, and he had chosen 'standing machinery'. Apart from Lord Nolan, the committee would include the nominees of the Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders and other representatives. Mr Major said it would be open to the committee to take evidence in public or private, and that it would probably want to deliberate in private. He added: 'I hope the committee will be able to produce at least a first report covering the main areas of current concern within six months - and then stay in being as a standing body to advise the government of the day.' But he also made clear that he did not expect the body to replace the Commons' own machinery, in particular the committee of privileges, which he regarded as the 'the proper way to consider issues affecting individual members of this house'. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, welcomed the creation of the new standing committee, saying it was 'plainly sensible and necessary'. He warned Mr Major, however, that the new body must investigate the individual cases against ministers and MPs in the cash-for-questions affair. Otherwise, he said, the Commons privileges committee, which is due to investigate the allegations, should conduct its hearings in public. He said: 'There will be justifiable public concern that the general inquiry is being used to sweep the particular allegations from public view, when it is these allegations that have given rise to the public concern.' Mr Major failed to give Mr Blair this assurance. He said that Lord Nolan's committee would 'restore confidence where confidence may have been lacking' and that the privileges committee should continue to meet in private.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US wins and loses copper smelter projects ONE BIG copper smelter project in the US was cancelled yesterday almost exactly at the same time as another was given the go-ahead. RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, said it would apply for permits to build a Dollars 880m smelter at its Bingham Canyon complex near Salt Lake City, with capacity to produce 272,000 tonnes of copper a year. But Mitsubishi Material Corporation of Japan said it could no longer afford to wait for permits for the smelter it planned at Texas City, Texas. It has been battling US authorities and environmentalists over the smelter, designed to produce 182,000 tonnes of copper a year, since 1989. 'We cannot afford to continue the project for cost and time reasons,' said Mr Takeshi Nagano, MMC's chairman. Cancellation of the project, which would have been a showpiece for Mitsubishi's own smelting technology, had been expected in the industry. Many employees had been switched from Texas to work on another copper smelter Mitsubishi plans for Thailand. Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, said he had no doubt that his group's project would also cause environmental controversy. But, whereas Texas City was a greenfield project, RTZ's would replace an existing smelter with one that was environmentally vastly superior. 'Also the Bingham Canyon complex is already a major part of the local economy,' he pointed out. The mine and smelter employ 2,400. The new RTZ smelter will use 'flash smelting' technology developed by Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group, followed by 'flash converting,' a process developed by Outokumpu and Kennecott, the RTZ subsidiary which operates Bingham Canyon. RTZ said this would enable more than 99 per cent of the sulphur contained in the copper concentrate being processed to be captured and sulphur dioxide emissions would be reduced to one twentieth of the allowable level in Utah. In addition, although the new smelter would have double the capacity of the existing plant, it would use two-thirds less water and require only one half as much energy per tonne of copper produced, said RTZ. In the past few years Kennecott has spent more than Dollars 625m to modernise and expand Bingham Canyon. A Dollars 219m fourth mill line started up in January and this will boost annual production of copper concentrates (an intermediate material) by 25 per cent to 1m tonnes. Bingham already exports 40 per cent of its concentrates (mainly to Japan) and without the new smelter it would have to send half its concentrates elsewhere for smelting. Mr Wilson said RTZ would save 7 cents a lb of copper produced (Dollars 154 a tonne) on transport costs alone. The new smelter's operating costs would be half those of the existing plant. For commercial reasons he refused to give details of present costs. RTZ was still keeping the industry guessing yesterday about its Lihir Island gold project in Papua New Guinea, one of the biggest known gold deposits outside South Africa. Mr Wilson said a feasibility study for the Dollars 770m project was being prepared for submission to the PNG government by the end of this month but refused to be drawn about whether this indicated RTZ would go ahead if the government agreed to the conditions contained in the study. The study looks for 2.8m tonnes of ore to be treated to produce 600,000 troy ounces of gold annually for the first five years of operation. The PNG government has been putting pressure of RTZ to make up its mind and in July extended the UK group's prospecting licence for only nine months instead of the usual two years. Mr Wilson said RTZ had applied for another renewal of the licence. RTZ owns 80 per cent of Lihir, via Kennecott, with Niugini Mining, a subsidiary of Battle Mountain Gold of the US, having the other 20 per cent.</p>

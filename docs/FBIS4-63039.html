			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Feliks Babitskiy article: "Not Everyone Decides on Cadres. </F> Is This Right?"]    [Text] It seems that cadre rotation is under way again in  the upper echelons. And given that this process is managed on  virtually equal terms in our country by both the prime minister  and the president, it is not always easy to work out from whom  the initiative stems and in what connection. We will try  nevertheless.    The appointment of Nikolay Travkin as minister without  portfolio came as a surprise to a great many people and caused,  as often happens, quite a lot of gossip. Malicious tongues  immediately christened him the "minister for the shah's affairs"  [ministr shakhovskikh del]. The initial rumors that Nikolay  Ilich would now officially represent Viktor Chernomyrdin on the  Presidential Staff have been neither confirmed nor denied. Our  source on Staraya Ploshchad merely reported evasively that the  new cabinet minister's functions would be defined in the course  of the next week (our conversation took place on 10 May, despite  the fact that the appointment, according to that same source,  occurred back on 29 April!). However, we still do not know  today what the esteemed Mr. Travkin will be doing. He himself,  during an impressive interview on radio Ekho Moskvy, suggested  that in his new job he "will be engaged in the same thing as now  -- economic reform in agriculture."    Certain observers have thus gotten the impression that the  main thing for the initiator was to bring Travkin into the  government. And consequently, they suggest, this is just the  start of his career. He may shortly have to replace one of  today's active participants. Let us not forget that Aleksandr  Zaveryukha, who is responsible today not just for the reform but  also simply for the operation of the agricultural sector, is a  very influential figure in the government. He is virtually the  only cabinet member capable of saying "no" to Chernomyrdin and  Yeltsin. It is only natural that Travkin, even if he had the  desire to do likewise, would simply be unable to do so, since if  your "no" as well as your "yes" is to carry weight, you need not  just to enter the cabinet formally but also to have thousands of  informal links with the Agroprom [State Agro-Industrial  Committee] commanders and the smart operators of the  agri-business.    In short, Zaveryukha is backed by the agrarian lobby, while  Travkin has no backing. Consequently, while the former may  pursue (and is actively pursuing) his own policy, one which does  not please everyone, the latter may merely pursue the policy of  the person who appointed him. It is not difficult to guess the  identity of the "absent party," as it were. You merely have to  recall who in terms of Aleksandr Kharlamliyevich's duties is his  chief. There are, as you will know, in fact two, and there is  every reason to suppose that both might be interested in  changing a strong vice premier for a weak one -- Zaveryukha for  Travkin. The sowing season is, as you know, drawing to a close  now, and Mr. Travkin's administrative functions are still  undefined....    Sergey Shakhray announced yesterday that he was resigning as  deputy chairman of the Russian Federation government. At a  press conference held at the Russian Foreign Ministry press  center he read out the letter he had sent to the Russian  president and head of government. In the document Shakhray  asked to be relieved of his post as deputy chairman of the  government "in view of the appointment of a new minister for the  affairs of nationalities and regional policy without even formal  consideration of the opinion of the vice premier in charge of  the problem." Sergey Shakhray stated that his resignation "does  not mean that he is going over to the opposition to the  president and government or signify any kind of personal  umbrage."    It has to be said that this is not the first attempt to  remove Shakhray from the position where he was in perpetual  charge of decisionmaking on his beloved nationalities question.  The last time was a year ago, when two vice premiers in charge  of these problems -- Shakhray and Polyanichko (known to be a  personal friend of the premier) -- appeared in the government at  the same time. I do not know how their ill-concealed antagonism  would have ended up if the latter's tragic death had not  occurred in the Caucasus mountains, to open the account of  political assassinations in Russia.    Nikolay Yegorov, the new minister for the affairs of  nationalities and regional policy and former head of the  Krasnodar Administration, unlike his predecessor, was occupied  with problems concerning relations among different peoples not  "in response to the dictates of his heart" like Shakhray, but  purely out of "official necessity," but again, unlike him, he  enjoyed a good deal of success here and may be justly proud of  the fact that no conflicts occurred on the territory entrusted  to him despite all the ethnic diversity and the proximity of at  least four trouble spots.    Yet another sensational piece of last week's news connected  with cadre changes demands attention, namely the meeting between  Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, during which the  latter demanded that the premier take the election results into  account and present ministerial portfolios to the winning party  (meaning, of course, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia)  rather than the losers (clearly meaning the Party of Russian  Unity and Accord and Russia's Choice). Zhirinovskiy asked that  the posts of minister of the economy, minister of internal  affairs, minister for nationalities, and chairman of the State  Committee for the Management of State Property be given to his  supporters.    As always when Vladimir Volfovich is involved, the press,  instead of (forgive my cynicism) sensibly saying nothing, broke  into a panic, which is merely what he was after. They even  recalled how Hitler, having won roughly the same percentage of  the vote in the elections, was "in consolation" appointed  chancellor and also appointed his own ministers. And soon the  "nationally elected president" Hindenburg was safely dumped from  major politics. Following a logical train of thought, my  colleagues automatically posed the rhetorical question: Once he  has his own people in government, won't Mr. Zhirinovskiy want to  take the matter of "phased constitutional reform" into his own  hands and dismiss, for example, the president?    You ask, we answer! Of course he will want to, and how. But  if he ever does do something like that, then it will only be  thanks to certain inveterate paid hacks who consistently create  publicity for him and force us in effect to do the same even as  we deny their "scoops."    Yes, it is true, Zhirinovskiy was received by Chernomyrdin.  Such a privilege is available to the leader of the third-largest  Duma faction. But careful readers of the agency reports on this  topic would have noted that the premier said nothing in response  to his guest's demands. Conclusions should be drawn from that.</p>

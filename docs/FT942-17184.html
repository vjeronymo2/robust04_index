			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Severfield-Reeve displays sharp recovery to Pounds 0.4m Severfield-Reeve, the USM-traded structural steel group, swung from losses of Pounds 987,000 to profits of Pounds 407,000 pre-tax for 1993. Turnover of continuing activities improved by 39 per cent to Pounds 21.7m. Earnings emerged at 2.19p (losses 5.53p) and a final dividend of 0.25p is proposed for a 0.5p (nil) total. Margins in the second half were lower as a result of disruption to production caused by the installation of new equipment. However, the move enabled the group to raise production capacity by 25 per cent from October onwards, the 'benefits of which will be seen in 1994 and beyond'.</p>

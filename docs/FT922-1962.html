			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BTR sells cables stake to partner for Pounds 37m BTR yesterday sold its stake in a joint venture cables business acquired through the takeover of Hawker Siddeley, to partner Delta for Pounds 37m cash. Delta said the purchase of the outstanding 36 per cent minority stake was the 'post-script' to the merger in 1988 of the two companies' cable interests. 'We have acquired the whole of Hawker's cable business, without having to pay a premium for it,' said Ms Alexandra Hockenhull of Delta. The purchase would push Delta's gearing - which was 13 per cent at the end of 1991 - up slightly. Pre-tax profit attributable to the minority stake in Delta Crompton Cables last year was Pounds 2.7m, Ms Hockenhull said. The net asset value of the minority stake is Pounds 34.2m. For BTR, the Pounds 37m should help to cut the group's weighty debt, which last month was reported to represent about 90 per cent of shareholders' funds. Every Pounds 25m is estimated to reduce gearing by 1 percentage point. The sale was sparked by BTR's Pounds 1.55bn acquisition of Hawker Siddeley, the UK engineering group, last year. Delta had first option on the Hawker stake in the case of a takeover. An independent valuation set the selling price. Delta Crompton Cables was subjected to a wide-ranging restructuring following the merger, including closing three of the nine cable sites. 'We will now derive 100 per cent of the rationalisation,' said Ms Hockenhull. Delta Crompton Cables makes energy, communication and high performance cables for the industrial and regulated electricity markets.</p>

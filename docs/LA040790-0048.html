			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT OFFERS GUIDE FOR THE '90S ON HOW TO CLEAN UP L.A. AIR  </P> <P> Acknowledging that Los Angeles has the worst air quality in the country, Mayor  Tom Bradley and other city officials released a report Friday outlining  possible solutions for the coming decade.  </P> <P> A major focus of anti-pollution efforts will be attempts to heighten public  awareness of contaminated air and water as well as personal garbage disposal  habits, according to the report by the city's Environmental Quality Board.  </P> <P> "The 90s have got to be a time of both public education and citizen  participation," said Felicia Marcus, a former member of the Environmental  Quality Board who helped write the report. "People are going to have to  understand that when they flush their toilets, that's not the end of the  process and their responsibility."  </P> <P> The 87-page report, entitled "The State of the City's Environment Primer,"  contained little new information, but is intended as a basic resource for the  public on local environmental problems and solutions. It is to be available at  all branches of the Los Angeles Public Library.  </P> <P> The report catalogues the city's environmental woes, beginning with "the worst  regional air quality in the nation" and a continuing "plague" of sewage spills  that have polluted Santa Monica Bay.  </P> <P> It goes on:  </P> <P> "The average Southern Californian's love affair with the automobile, the lack  of a clean regional mass transit system, the rapid growth in industry and  population, the warm desert air, the cool ocean breezes, the surrounding  mountains, all contribute to a pall of smog that hangs over the city on most  days.  </P> <P> "The explosive economic growth and development of Los Angeles, combined with  its varied, appealing geographical and physical attributes, has created a city  on the verge of reaching the limits of its ability to provide its residents  with clean air and water, adequate municipal services, a functioning  infrastructure, and an aesthetically-pleasing environment."  </P> <P> Despite the grim descriptions, neither Bradley nor the board members present at  a press conference Friday would say what measures might be taken by the city.  </P> <P> "I don't think I want to lay out for you the things that we're going to have to  do," Bradley said. "It is my hope that we will carefully review and evaluate  every step that must be taken as well as those things that we will suggest."  </P> <P> Bradley, while conceding the city's air is the worst in the nation, was upbeat.  </P> <P> "Let us not point to what is the greatest problem that we face. We're not  trying to deny any of those," Bradley said. "I think that we are equal to any  city in the country in terms of our awareness and our commitment to the  environment."  </P> <P> The report contains 94 recommendations on a range of environmental issues  including toxic and hazardous waste, sewage and waste water, coastal and harbor  pollution, and open space. Many of the recommendations call for prodding other  governmental agencies into action.  </P> <P> One suggestion called for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to  conduct epidemiological, viral and bacterial studies to determine health risks  for people who use the beaches and swim in Santa Monica Bay.  </P> <P> After heavy rainstorms, the city routinely is forced to dump raw sewage into  the bay. Expensive projects are underway to halt the problem.  </P> <P> There was no economic assessment contained in the report.  </P></p>

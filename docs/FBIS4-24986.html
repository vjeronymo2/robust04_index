			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- China is expected to  reap another good harvest of summer crops this year despite a  decrease of sown areas of some crops and soaring prices of  agricultural materials.    Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed today  that the total harvesting area for summer oil-bearing crops this  year amounted to 5.3 million hectares, an increase of 330,000  hectares over last year. Output of oil-bearing crops would  register a greater increase, he said.    By now, the provinces of Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu,  Jiangxi and Sichuan have all reported increases in harvests of  such crops. The increase, along with the imports of edible oil,  would greatly ease supplies soon, the official said.    The official said that China's summer grain will also reap a  good harvest despite a marked decrease in sown areas.    But the official warned that it was too early to be sure of  a  good summer grain output, because while the southwest is busy  harvesting, the north is still waiting.    The official therefore urged all localities to concentrate  on  the final work with the crops and to watch for the weather in  harvesting time so as to ensure an excellent output.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Copper-coloured outlook When RTZ bought BP Minerals in 1989, it became owner of the giant Bingham Canyon copper mine in Utah, the largest in the US. It was a bold move. Spoil heaps more than 1,000 feet high, clearly visible from the centre of Salt Lake City 15 miles away, were a huge environmental liability. Bingham had also been shut down by labour troubles in the mid-1980s, and much of the processing plant was obsolete, writes David Lascelles. But RTZ thought it had a good deal, because Bingham's copper deposits were world class and, with good management, capable of being mined at low cost. The board approved a Dollars 1.1bn programme of investments to raise ore recovery and modernise the smelter and refinery. It also gave the operating company back the name that BP had removed: Kennecott. Three years later, RTZ has managed to get Bingham's production costs down, but weak copper prices have squeezed profits. Mr Bob Cooper, Kennecott's newly appointed chief executive officer, says: 'Kennecott is positioned to handle that. We are the lowest-cost US producer.' Mr Cooper thinks Bingham can even aspire to produce the cheapest copper in the world if it uses technology to the full. 'Now that we're run by a mining company and not an oil company, it's very different,' he says. 'BP wanted quick returns.' The environmental aspects are more complicated. Bingham is a potential target of Washington's Superfund programme, under which sites are compulsorily cleaned up at the owner's expense. To head off this risk Kennecott is negotiating an action plan with the authorities. A Dollars 30m water containment and landscaping project has already been launched, and the new smelter will help clean the air. Mr Kent Gray, director of remediation in Utah's Environmental Quality Bureau, says: 'There's a lot of concern from the public and regulatory agencies. But we're pleased with the progress Kennecott has made.' A point going for RTZ - which claims to have raised Kennecott's environmental standards since it took over - is that it is one of Utah's largest employers, so the state is keen to avoid regulatory overkill. RTZ has asked Kennecott to prepare plans showing how the two-mile wide pit will be shut down when the ore runs out in 35 years - something it had not previously done.</p>

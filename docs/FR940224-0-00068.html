			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. 405 KAR 10:050 Bond Forfeiture <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Kentucky proposes to revise this regulation by adding section 2(5) which provides for the return of unused forfeited bond funds to the person from whom they were received, subject to the right to attach or set-off the funds under state law. The provision applies where the cabinet has not completed the reclamation plan on the forfeited site and the site, including any related off-site disturbances, is completely overlapped by a subsequent permanent program permit and is completely disturbed by the overlapping permittee. As proposed, the provision is limited to interim program sites forfeited on or after July 15, 1988, and to forfeited permanent program sites. While there is no direct Federal counterpart to this proposal, the Director has determined that it is not inconsistent with the Federal rule at 30 CFR 800.50(d)(2) which provides for the return of unused funds to the person from whom they were collected where the amount of performance bond forfeited is more than the amount necessary to complete reclamation. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposal is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The public comment periods and opportunities to request a public hearing were announced in the June 11, 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 32618), and the November 5, 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 58997). The public comment periods closed on July 12, 1993, and November 22, 1993, respectively. No one requested an opportunity to testify at the scheduled public hearings so no hearings were held. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Kentucky Resources Council (KRC) filed written comments on July 23, 1993 (Administrative Record Number KY&hyph;1331), and supplemented those comments on November 30, 1993 (Administrative Record Number KY&hyph;1259). A summary of those comments and their disposition is set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 405 KAR 10:050 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> KRC expressed concern that the revisions to subsection (5) might result in the release of forfeited bonds in cases where the permit area is completely disturbed under an overlapping permit, and where there is off-permit disturbance that should be addressed under the forfeited bond. As a result of the concerns raised by KRC, Kentucky revised 405 KAR 10:050 section 2(5) in its October 19, 1993, resubmission by making specific reference to the inclusion of any off-site disturbance. In its November 30, 1993, letter, after reviewing Kentucky's revisions, KRC restated its concern with particular reference to ``those cases, for example, where the former mining operation has caused damage to the hydrologic balance (such as loss or damage to water supplies, pollution of groundwater resources), or where other off-site damage might not be readily apparent or yet manifest, the allowance of a return of unused bond funds where the site is overlapped by a new permit and bond may result in unfunded liabilities''. In its Statement of Consideration (Administrative Record Number KY&hyph;1333) filed by Kentucky on September 2, 1993, the State discusses these issues in some detail. In specific response to KRC's original concerns, Kentucky stated that it ``has no intention of releasing forfeited bond funds when there is off-permit disturbance for which the original bond stands liable and such disturbance was not encompassed in the overlapping permit.'' In response to comments filed by another party (Item 7, Statement of Consideration), Kentucky stated that ``[T]he original permittee's bond does not become ``unused'' and ``more than the amount necessary to do reclamation'' within the meaning of KRS 350.131(2) until the new permittee disturbs the entire overlapped area, triggering a reclamation obligation on his behalf. Prior to that, the new permittee could delete the unreclaimed area from its permit. The Cabinet must be assured that the original forfeited funds will in fact be unnecessary before it can release the funds.'' Finally, in response to KRC's concern regarding liabilities that may not become apparent until after a bond has been released, there is no authority in SMCRA or the Federal regulations to retain bond funds after all release requirements have been met, for such unknown liabilities. The State can always pursue the original permittee if such liabilities occur. The Director feels that the clarification provided by Kentucky adequately responds to the concerns raised by KRC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

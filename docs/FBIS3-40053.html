			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Rome, Feb 25 (AFP) -- Italian Defense Minister  Fabio Fabbri said Friday [25 February] Western nations were  again facing a Russia problem, but urged them to deal with it  with dialogue and firmness.    "The void left by the Warsaw Pact cannot last long. Either  the West fills it or Russian hegemony will return," Fabbri told  journalists here.    "The West is again facing a Russia problem," he said, adding  that this "delicate issue must be treated by combining dialogue  and firmness."    Russia was politically and economically weak but its  conventional and nuclear weapons also made it strong, he said,  adding that its weaknesses and internal contrasts could explain  why it was "asking for a new Yalta and claiming a freedom of  action in what it defines as its intangible sphere of influence."    He was referring to the Yalta accords, reached between  Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill three months before the end of  World War II, by which the Soviet Union gained hegemony over  East Europe.    Fabbri said statements by Italy's opposition communists that  NATO had outlived itself and should be disbanded were "not in  the interest of Italy, Europe or the West."    "Never more than today has the Atlantic Alliance been a  pillar of security for the West and the international order."</p>

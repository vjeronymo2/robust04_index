			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Fred Claire's phone rang off the hook last winter. Everyone wanted Ramon  Martinez. It took the Dodger general manager about two seconds to answer each  call. Thanks, but no thanks. . . . "The two people on our current roster we  absolutely were not going to move were Ramon and Tim Belcher," Claire said the  morning after Martinez struck out 18 Atlanta Braves and joined Sandy Koufax in  the Dodger record book. "Our future is with young players. We're never going to  gain back our consistency by trading away the Martinezes, the Belchers and the  Jose Offermans." . . .  </P> <P> Offerman is the latest phenom from San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican  Republic, a 21-year-old shortstop who is tearing up the Pacific Coast League at  Albuquerque. . . .  </P> <P> The last time the Dodgers traded away a young pitching prospect, it was a  mistake. Sid Fernandez, then 21, went to the New York Mets for Carlos Diaz and  Bob Bailor on Dec. 12, 1983. No wonder Claire wouldn't even let the  Philadelphia Phillies get around to mentioning the 22-year-old Martinez's name  in talks involving Lenny Dykstra. . . .  </P> <P> Would Claire deal Martinez, who has a 6-3 record, for Dykstra, who is batting  .400-plus, today? "I wouldn't trade Martinez, period," Claire said. . . .  </P> <P> Martinez had four chances to at least tie the National League strikeout record  Monday night -- and the Dodger Stadium crowd groaned every time he got an out  without a K. . . .  </P> <P> Vin Scully wondered aloud if a Dodger fielder might be tempted not to go all  out to catch a foul ball with Martinez aiming for records and the team ahead,  6-0. . . .  </P> <P> This might be the first year since 1982 that the city of New York doesn't have  a title contender. What a shame. . . .  </P> <P> Byron Scott's 7-year-old son, Thomas, served as bat boy for the Cincinnati Reds  during their series at Dodger Stadium. Byron's buddy Eric Davis wanted Thomas  to accompany the team to San Francisco after he brought the Reds so much good  luck here. Byron said sorry, but Thomas had school. The Reds lost, 10-1, at  Candlestick Park Monday. . . .  </P> <P> I don't miss the game-winning RBI stat. Box scores are cluttered enough as it  is. . . .  </P> <P> There's already speculation in Durham, N.C., about Mike Krzyzewski's successor  should the Duke coach accept a five-year, $10-million offer from the Boston  Celtics. Most frequently mentioned are former Blue Devil players Bob Bender and  Jeff Mullins. . . .  </P> <P> Ex-USC tailback Aaron Emanuel made a good impression at the New York Giants'  mini-camp. . . .  </P> <P> Eight of UCLA's 11 incoming freshman football players from the state of  California will participate in the North-South Shrine game July 28 at the Rose  Bowl. . . .  </P> <P> Guards Darrick Martin of UCLA and Harold Miner of USC have been invited to try  out for the U.S. junior national basketball team. . . .  </P> <P> It wasn't too shocking that Indiana voted against admitting Penn State into the  Big Ten after Bobby Knight complained about the length of trips to University  Park, Pa. . . .  </P> <P> With the early elimination of Cal State Fullerton went one of the best names in  the NCAA baseball tournament -- pitcher Huck Flener. . . .  </P> <P> The St. Louis Cardinals may never run out of catchers from UCLA. Rookie Todd  Zeile is a former Bruin and the Cardinals took Paul Ellis, who led the NCAA in  home runs, with the 30th pick as compensation from Boston for Tony Pena. . . .  </P> <P> I'm not hearing much talk on the street about the World Cup. . . .  </P> <P> Tennis should join the 20th Century before it's too late and allow coaching  from the sidelines during matches. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: John Salley and Arsenio Hall. . . .  </P> <P> The Pat McCormick and Friends Growing Up Education Foundation -- the pet  project of the four-time Olympic gold medal-winning diver -- will benefit from  the proceeds of a sports memorabilia dinner and auction Monday at 6 p.m. at the  Williamsburg restaurant in Long Beach. . . .  </P> <P> NBC made a good choice when it hired Todd Christensen as an NFL commentator.  Just know when to stop talking, Todd. . . .  </P> <P> What disabled list? Jockey Kent Desormeaux, who cracked a rib in that spill  that left Chris McCarron with two broken legs and a broken arm Sunday, expects  to be back riding at Hollywood Park as early as Friday. . . .  </P> <P> The Forum ought to lower its fight prices. The scale of $15-$90 was too stiff  for the junior flyweight title card the other night. . . .  </P> <P> Ray Mercer's unbeaten record doesn't impress me. . . .  </P> <P> Remember when boxing gloves were brown and then red? Blue seems to be in vogue  now. . . .  </P> <P> The heavyweight nobody wants to fight is Razor Ruddock.  </P></p>

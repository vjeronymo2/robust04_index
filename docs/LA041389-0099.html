			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> At least six masked attackers stormed the stock exchange in Frankfurt, West  Germany, beating employees and throwing firebombs onto the main trading floor,  authorities said. Two people were injured. A police spokesman said the attack,  carried out before trading began, was apparently intended to draw attention to  a nationwide prison hunger strike by members and sympathizers of the terrorist  Red Army Faction. Three suspects in the attack were captured. Supporters of the  prison protest also claimed responsibility for an arson attack on a branch of  the West German electronics firm AEG, the spokesman said.  </P></p>

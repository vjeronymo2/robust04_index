In lieu of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing emission data on idle CO emissions, smoke emissions or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particulate emissions from methanol-fueled diesel certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles the Administrator may, on request of the manufacturer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow the manufacturer to demonstrate (on the basis of previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission tests, development tests, or other information) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine will conform with the applicable emission standards of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;86.090&hyph;8 or &sect;86.090&hyph;9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certification engines.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Emission data on such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines tested in accordance with applicable emission test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures of this subpart and in such numbers as specified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These data shall include zero-hour data, if generated, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission data generated for certification as required under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;86.090&hyph;26(c)(4). In lieu of providing emission data on idle CO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions or particulate emissions from methanol-fueled diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification engines, or on CO emissions from petroleum-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or methanol-fueled diesel certification engines the Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may, on request of the manufacturer, allow the manufacturer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate (on the basis of previous emission tests, development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests, or other information) that the engine will conform with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicable emission standards of &sect;86.091&hyph;11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) A statement that the vehicles (or engines) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which certification is requested conform to the requirements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;86.084&hyph;5(b), and that the descriptions of tests performed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ascertain compliance with the general standards in &sect;86.084&hyph;5(b),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the data derived from such tests, are available to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) (1) A statement that the test vehicles (or test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines) with respect to which data are submitted to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the applicable standards (or family emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits, as appropriate) of this subpart are in all material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respects as described in the manufacturer's application for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification, have been tested in accordance with the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedures utilizing the fuels and equipment described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the application for certification and that on the basis of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests the vehicles (or engines) conform to the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this part.

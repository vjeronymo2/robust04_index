			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Flattery, cash and threats foiled They threatened. They flattered. They cajoled. And finally they threw more money at the problem. But still it was not enough to stave off last night's government defeat over value added tax on fuel. The defeat was all the more devastating since it followed strenuous efforts by business managers to dragoon prospective rebels into line. These efforts culminated just two minutes before the end of last night's final Budget debate, when Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, acceded to backbench demands for more compensation for pensioners. To judge by the relaxed air on the Tory front bench immediately before the result was announced the government thought it had won. But it was not to be. By 10.20pm the waving ballot papers on the opposition side of the House were hailing the defeat. What may have fooled government business managers was the extent of opposition among the nine Tory MPs without the whip since last week's vote of confidence on Europe. Eight of these voted against or abstained. The government's futile attempts to win the day began last Tuesday, when Mr Clarke unveiled new compensation measures for pensioners in his Budget speech. But it quickly became clear that his package had failed to allay Tory misgivings. Accordingly, when MPs left for their constituencies two days later government business managers got on the telephones, seeking to sound out the detailed concerns of likely rebels. On Monday afternoon the whips reassembled at Westminster. In what was widely seen as an early sign that the government was in difficulties, the meeting went on longer than expected. Meanwhile in Brussels the chancellor went on the offensive with a warning that MPs would look 'extremely foolish' if they blocked the government's proposals. Mr Clarke was backed up by business managers warning that an increase in income tax or the general rate of VAT was a distinct possibility if the government lost the vote. But just before 8pm the government was rocked when Mr David Sumberg, MP for Bury South, announced on the Commons floor that he would vote with Labour. By early yesterday afternoon Westminster was livening up. As Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, opened the last day of Budget debates Mr Clarke and Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, embarked on a series of meetings with the most likely rebels. Emerging from a meeting with Mr Ryder soon after 5pm Sir Andrew Bowden, MP for Brighton Kemptown, explained that ministers had not conceded his calls for an extra Pounds 88m worth of concessions to pensioners. At an increasingly tense Westminster MPs who were confidently expected to vote with the government were seen in animated conversation with whips and ministers in another bad sign for the government. Then came another crucial meeting between Mr Clarke and potential rebels, at which the government is said to have made clear for the first time that it was prepared to put up more money, in response to Sir Andrew's demands. This appears to have been enough for him. But 15 Tory MPs defied the government.</p>

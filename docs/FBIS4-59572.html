			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The discovery of a transmitter equipped with a  microphone inside a wall in the Islamic Republic of Iran's [IRI]  embassy in London has led to the disclosure of Britain's  intelligence and spying operations, know as ME6 [as heard]  against the IRI. Iran's deputy foreign minister in European and  US affairs, Mr. Mahmoud Va'ezi, in an exclusive interview with  the Central News Bureau of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic  Republic of Iran, which was broadcast on the nationwide  television channel last night, exposed further details of the  ME6 spying operations against Iran's embassy in London and  considered it as the British statesmen weakness in Irano-British  relations.    Iran's deputy foreign minister also said: Following the  disclosure of this issue, the British charge d'affaires in  Tehran was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and Iran's severe  protest was conveyed to the British Government.    In response to the question as to what impact will these  kinds of anti-diplomatic acts leave on the two countries  relations, Mr. Va'ezi said: Irano-British relations are not  normal for they have been faced with abundant problems. The  main issue is the existence of certain (?roles) in the British  Government. Mr. Va'ezi's direct reference to this issue that  problems in the Irano-British relations arise from groupings  inside the Conservative British government is significant in  view of problems which have led to weakness in John Major's  government. It shows that the British statesmen have problems  in following a coordinated policy in relation to Iran. Bringing  up such claims as links between Iran and the Irish strugglers,  which was categorically denied by Iran, further discredited John  Major's government. On this basis, spying operations in a  foreign embassy, which against all the international accepted  standards and diplomatic practice, will put further pressure on  the Conservative British government.    Some analysts consider John Major's weakened position as the  factor behind such controvertial operations by the ME6 and they  argue that the British officials' silence indicates difference  of views and crisis which exist in the British Government.  Nevertheless, since the Iranian Government is waiting for the  British Government's answer, the British statesmen are unlikely  to keep their silence. Hence they have to explain about their  political mistakes.</p>

The municipal government approved 3,650 foreign-funded  projects involving contractual investment totalling 7.016  billion U.S. dollars last year, increases of 82 and 110 percent  respectively over the previous year.    A municipal government official in charge of foreign  investment said that of the 120 transnational corporations set  up in the city, 60 percent began to make profits last year.    The city approved 205 large projects each with an investment  exceeding 10 million U.S. dollars last year. These projects  account for a total investment of 4.24 billion U.S. dollars, 60  percent of the total.    The official noted that 1,037 of the approved projects are  involved in banking, trading, commerce, real estate and  improving urban infrastructural facilities.    By the end of last year, more than 3,000 industrial projects  had gone into production, becoming a new force in Shanghai's  economic development.    Experts here attributed the soaring investment in Shanghai  to  the large-scale development of the Pudong area, a  newly-established economic zone, and the daily improvement of  investment conditions.    So far, the city has approved 6,939 foreign-funded projects  with contractual investment totalling 13.705 billion U.S.  dollars.</p>

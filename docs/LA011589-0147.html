			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GLARING HOLE  </P> <P> Perhaps nowhere is the gap between goals and accomplishments more evident than  in the annual ritual of the State of the City address.  </P> <P> The address is one of the highlights of the mayor's ceremonial leadership,  giving her the opportunity to cite her accomplishments and her priorities for  the coming year. Last year, Mayor Maureen O'Connor chose a Soviet arts festival  as the goal she would showcase, and indeed she has made considerable progress  toward that goal. She has put together more than $5 million for the festival, a  proposal she sponsored almost single-handedly.  </P> <P> This year, she has declared that improving programs for children is her goal.  We hope that O'Connor feels even more strongly about the "Year of the Child"  than she did about the "Year of the Arts." The needs of children urgently need  attention. And she has shown that she can raise funds when she puts her heart  into a project.  </P> <P> But we were dismayed by how lightly she dismissed some unmet goals she has  espoused in the past.  </P> <P> The failed efforts to produce a growth-management plan, which took up much of  the City Council's and community's civic energy last year, is the most glaring  example. First, the council and the mayor abdicated their responsibility by  deciding to put the plan on the ballot rather than adopting it outright. Then,  the council adopted a plan with the flaws of too many compromises. Finally, the  mayor sat on the sidelines during most of the campaign.  </P> <P> The result is that the city still does not have the growth-management plan that  it needs. Yet this fact merited only a sentence in the annual report and no  mention in the speech.  </P> <P> We know there are limitations to a State of the City address and even an annual  report. And there are limitations to the power of the office of mayor under San  Diego's council-manager form of government.  </P> <P> But surely San Diegans deserve at least a mention of the issue that dominated  the civic agenda last year. A glimpse of the mayor's revised goals on growth  management would have fit in nicely in a speech dedicated to the future.  </P></p>

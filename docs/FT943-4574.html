			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Arts: ENO looks to Lottery for cash Yesterday English National Opera announced rebuilding plans for its Coliseum home. In other words it launched its bid for Lottery cash. The ENO is looking for between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m to modernise one of architect Frank Matcham's grandest and most ornate Edwardian theatrical extravaganzas. The sum is much higher than anticipated, but Shaun Woodward, best known as a former director of communications at the Conservative Party, who is leading the appeal, has based his estimates on 1998 building costs. The money will go towards a smarter front-of-house, a regilded auditorium, and more civilised backstage facilities, plus such money-making propositions as a glassed-over roof-top restaurant overlooking Trafalgar Square. An anoynmous friend of the ENO has already pledged Pounds 1m and there is another Pounds 250,000 in the bag. Woodward will go for both Arts Council and Heritage Fund Lottery money. Contacts should help: he knows well Peter Gummer, who chairs the Arts Council's Lottery division. But to be certain of Lottery support against frantic opposition, Woodward knows he must make a strong case for the ENO. He is pushing its mass appeal and high standards. 'If this place closed, the wider opera audience would have nowhere else to go.' To underpin the bid, general director Dennis Marks has already announced a 1994-95 programme which combines new productions of popular favourites, such as Tosca, with operas likely to appeal to enthusiasts, such as Khovanshchina and The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahaganny. In his first year, Marks has raised attendances by 2 per cent, to a still worryingly low 62 per cent of capacity, but subscriptions are up 30 per cent and plans to introduce new productions of Turandot, Fidelio and a Jonathan Miller Carmen should see the box office take improving at the same time that Woodward woos corporate and private friends, and the Lottery providers. Woodward knows that the ENO must raise at least a third, say Pounds 15m, of its target from its own resources. He hopes to sell the ENO to companies as the opera house for their workforces rather than for their boards. If all goes well the ENO will close for its facelift in mid-1998 and re-open on New Year's eve 1999. The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, also plans to be closed at this time for its refurbishment, which equally depends on Lottery funding. Its appeal, for around Pounds 100m, will probably be launched next year. On Tuesday another celebrated London arts venue announced its application for Lottery aid. The Riverside Studios, alongside the Thames at Hammersmith, is looking for Pounds 3.3m for a complete overhaul and to pay off debts. The debts, Pounds 300,000, are the most worrying. Unless the money is found by the end of March, new director Bill Burdett-Coutts' efforts to make the Riverside matter again will be doomed. He is already finding it a challenge: the local authority has rejected his plan to moor a ferry by the Studios as a new performing space and restaurant on the grounds that it will disturb the ducks. A strong programme opens this week with new plays by Berkoff and continues with a London Comedy Festival.</p>

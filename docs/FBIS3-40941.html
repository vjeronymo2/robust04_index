"It is national treason," Vyacheslav Chornovyl, leader of  the  nationalist opposition movement Rukh, told AFP. "The United  States and Russia have brought Ukraine to its knees."    The treaty, under which Ukraine pledged to get rid of all  the  nuclear weapons on its territory, was signed at the Kremlin by  Kravchuk, US President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris  Yeltsin.</p>

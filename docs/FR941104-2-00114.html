			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CSW and Energy are not seeking Commission authority to finance the construction of the Project at this time. However, the Partnership may incur certain expenses in connection with the development of the Project (``Development Expenses''). The total amount of the Development Expenses will not exceed $12 million. CSW and Energy propose to fund the Development Expenses by capital contributions, loans or open account advances through the various subsidiaries to the Partnership. Loans or open account advances would have a final maturity not to exceed 25 years and would bear interest at a rate per annum not in excess of the prime commercial lending rate as in effect from time-to-time at Mellon Bank plus 4%. The Applicants believe that this rate approximates the current market rate that the Partnership would be able to secure from nonassociate third party lenders for loans of this type. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (70&hyph;8493) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (``Maine Yankee''), 329 Bath Road, Brunswick, Maine 04011, an indirect subsidiary of New England Electric System and Northeast Utilities, both registered holding companies, has filed an application under Sections 9(a) and 10 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maine Yankee proposes to acquire nuclear fuel in amounts of up to $90 million, through December 31, 1998, in connection with the operation of its pressurized water nuclear powered electric generating plant in Wiscasset, Maine.

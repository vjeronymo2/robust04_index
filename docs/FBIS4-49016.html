			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Sun Benyao (1327 2609 1031) and Qian Yonghong </F> (6929 0737 5725)]    [Text] Hohhot, 30 Apr (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier Li  Pent attended celebrations of the 1 May International Labor Day  in Hohhot, Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region this evening.    In the evening, the premier met with model workers from  various fronts in Inner Mongolia and posed for a picture session  with them. He extended Labor Day greetings to the working class  and people in the autonomous region and throughout the country.    He said his visit to the four Central Asian nations and  Mongolia was successful because it had expanded China's  good-neighborly friendship with these countries and had  accomplished the anticipated objective. Success in diplomatic  work has been made possible through the remarkable achievements  in reform, opening up, and modernization drive; while an  independent and peaceful foreign policy has in turn provided a  favorable external environment for domestic economic  construction.    He said: In the past nearly 10 years, I have visited Inner  Mongolia on three occasions and witnessed its great  achievements. The autonomous region is rich in natural resources  and enjoys unity of nationalities; therefore, it has great  potential for growth. So long as the people of all  nationalities in Inner Mongolia earnestly implement the party's  line, principles and policies and work concertedly under the  leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang  Zemin as the core, Inner Mongolia will certainly score even  greater achievements.    He pointed out: Model workers who are pace-setters in  various fronts have made outstanding contributions to the  socialist modernization drive. Guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China has  implemented the policy of reform and opening up and promoted  vigorous economic growth. Now is the time for large numbers of  people to come forth and to develop their ability to the full.  More advanced models will certainly emerge on all fronts.  While promoting the building of material civilization, we  should also attach great importance to spiritual civilization.  It is hoped that model workers shall exemplify themselves in  building not only material civilization but also spiritual  civilization. They shall make still greater contributions to  the motherland's prosperity.    At 2000 in the evening, Premier Li Peng, accompanied by  regional party secretary Wang Qun and government chairman  Wuliji, attended a soiree held by the autonomous region to  celebrate the International Labor Day, and viewed a brilliant  ethnic literary and artistic performance. At the end of  performance, the premier ascended the stage, put on Mongolian  costumes, and had pictures taken with performers.    Ismail Amat, Ye Qing, Yao Zhenyan, and Han Zhubin attended  the soiree.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OVERSIZE HOMES BANNED ON SMALL TOPANGA CANYON LOTS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved planning  regulations Tuesday that will stop the construction of large houses on small  lots in the rugged Topanga Canyon area.  </P> <P> For years, Topanga residents had complained that the area was being overbuilt  by property owners who erected huge houses on parcels that were subdivided more  than 60 years ago for weekend cabins.  </P> <P> County officials also expressed concern that the buildup was causing septic  tank problems and posed a fire hazard because inadequate driveways resulted in  cars being parked on the windy narrow roads, blocking access for emergency  vehicles.  </P> <P> Under the new regulations, a mathematical formula will be used to determine the  maximum size of a house based on the size of the lot and the average slope of  the site.  </P> <P> The guidelines were amended last week, however, to allow existing residents to  rebuild comparably sized houses if their residences are destroyed.  </P> <P> "We're very happy that the long process has ended and now Topanga has a unified  set of regulations that can put a stop to the misplaced construction that was  inappropriate for the steep slopes," said John Leary, attorney for the Topanga  Town Council and two area homeowner groups.  </P> <P> About 3,600 vacant lots could be affected by the ordinance, said Bob Hoie, a  county supervising regional planner.  </P> <P> The regulations will take effect in September.  </P></p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Selecting a steady growth path - Andrew Bolger reports on the recruitment agency's expansion plans Select Appointments (Holdings), the UK-based recruitment agency which was rescued from financial collapse three years ago by a group of Swiss investors, has renewed its ambitions to become a leading international group. The USM-quoted company has made seven acquisitions this year and now operates in 12 countries. Its market value, which slipped to Pounds 540,000 before the 1991 takeover, now stands at Pounds 77m, following a Pounds 44m rights issue in August. Select is backed by former managers of Adia, the Swiss-based recruitment agency. Floated in 1987, the agency had seen its profits and share price collapse after a period of debt-financed overseas expansion. Mr Tony Martin, a former Adia director who became chairman and chief executive of Select in 1992, said: 'We are trying to take the cyclicality out of the business, which has been the weak point of recruitment.' Mr Martin said the aim was to build a group which was diversified both geographically and sectorally. Currently more than half the group's turnover is in the US, but expansion into continental European is a priority. Mr Martin believes that companies are realising the need to manage their payroll actively - often their biggest single cost. 'The days of everyone working from nine-to-five, five days a week are over. Most companies now have core workers, surrounded by contract workers and then temps,' he said. The increasing involvement of women was also leading to more flexible working patterns. Mr Martin said that in 1992, 1 per cent of the US workforce was placed in temporary jobs by private agencies - and that proportion had now nearly doubled. 'The process is more advanced in the US, but we expect to see a similar rate of progress in the UK. About 15 per cent of the UK workforce is now temporary or part-timers, and that proportion is expected to rise to about 25 per cent over the next three to four years,' he said. His clients were starting to restructure their staffing levels. 'More and more of our business is planned, long-term contract labour.' Select also points to a skills shortage, which has emerged unusually early in the recovery. In the UK, the agency has jobs for 100 heavy goods vehicle drivers and for word processor operators, if they can handle a broad range of software packages. Mr Martin commented: 'If we really are in for several years of steady growth, as the politicians suggest, these shortages will become really acute.' The Swiss investors in Select launched a Pounds 7.5m rescue, injecting Pounds 2.5m in exchange for 90 per cent of the equity, Pounds 2.5m to cut debt and Pounds 2.5m for working capital. Operations in the US, Australasia and France were sold. The Swiss have so far invested a total of Pounds 35m in Select, although their share of the equity fell to 80 per cent following the August rights issue. The investors intend to keep their money in the group, but want institutional investors to dilute the Swiss equity stake to about 50 per cent as a result of further acquisitions and rights issues. At the time of the takeover, Select had 30 branches for secretarial and administration staff in the UK, mainly in the south-east of England. It now has 51 branches in the UK, spread from Newcastle to Bristol, and has moved into computing, accounting and light industrial vacancies, such as drivers. Select also has small operations in Switzerland, Hungary and Greece - but acknowledges that it must get into the European heartland of Germany, France and the Netherlands. Other operations are in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and Japan. Mr Zach Miles, finance director, said the agency sought businesses with further growth potential run by experienced local managers, who knew the country and culture and kept an equity stake in the business, the local name of which would be retained. The group is not just expanding by acquisition - it has started up new ventures in Hungary, South Africa and Singapore. It is also prepared to franchise operations and inject cash into businesses. Since acquiring a Californian accountancy agency for Pounds 4.2m last year, the number of branches has grown from eight to 12. Select suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 600,000 in 1993, but is forecast to make Pounds 2.5m this year and Pounds 7.5m next year. Select claims to be building its network with an eye to the bad times, not the good. Mr Martin said: 'We are prepared to forego some profitability in the good times to avoid the expense of laying off staff and closing branches when next there is a downturn.'</p>

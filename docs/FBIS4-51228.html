The appointment will become final upon approval by the  cabinet.    Liang, 64, will succeed Samuel Shieh, whose five-year tenure  expires next week. He is expected to be sworn in June 1.    He previously served as chairman of Chang Hwa Commercial  Bank, chairman of the First Commercial Bank, deputy governor of  the Central Bank, and economics professor of National Taiwan  University.    The senior banker graduated from National Taiwan University  in 1953 and took his master's degree from the university in  1959. He later pursued advanced studies in the United States,  where he took both his master's and Ph.D. Degrees from  Vanderbilt University in Nashville in 1964 and 1970 respectively.    Asked to comment on his appointment, Liang pledged that he  would do his best in his new job and seek transparency in the  central bank's policy making process.    Liang is a well known advocate of Taiwan's financial  liberalization and internationalization strategy. Market forces  should be key to the development of financial markets, he said.</p>

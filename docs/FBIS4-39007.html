			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 0820 GMT on 5 June, in its program  entitled "Aerospace salon," carries a 4-minute report on two  major hushed-up space launch failures in 1969, at the height of  the space race between the USSR and the United States. The  report shows for the first time previously classified pictures  of two launch failures.    In the first decade of the space age, the U.S.'s Mariner-IV  probe had already succeeded in sending back to Earth the first  pictures of Mars, while all six Soviet Mars probes had failed to  reach their target.    "In 1969, the United States was planning to launch a further  two Mariner probes to Mars," the program says. "For this reason  the leadership of the Soviet Union ordered the leading  enterprise for interplanetary probes, the Lavochkin  scientific-production association, to urgently create probes for  the orbital exploration of Mars."    On the basis of the new UR-500K rocket, later redesignated  as the Proton rocket, the Lavochkin enterprise hastily developed  the five-tonne M-69 Mars probe. However, following the  successful launch by the United States of Mariner-VI on 25  February 1969, the first attempted Soviet launch of a M-69 Mars  probe on 27 March failed. Just "438 seconds after its launch  the rocket's third stage motor exploded" and the probe perished.  Later the same day, 27 March, the Americans successfully  launched Mariner-VII. On 2 April, the second attempted Soviet  launch of an M-69 probe produced yet another failure.  "Immediately after the start of the launch, a fire broke out in  the rocket's first-stage motor" and after rising just a short  distance, the rocket plunged back to Earth close to the  launching area.    The Ostankino television program showed footage of both  space launch failures. "Very few people have previously seen  this footage," the program says. Two official TASS  announcements about the successful launching of Mars-2 and  Mars-3 probes, which had been compiled beforehand and later had  to be cancelled before their publication in the media, were also  shown on screen. At the time, the Soviet media did not mention  these failures.</p>

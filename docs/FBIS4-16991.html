			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Yuryeva report: "Students Stage Organized Protest"] </F>   [Text] As we reported, the Russian Association of Trade  Union Organizations for Students in Higher Educational  Establishments [RATUOS] staged a picket of the White House 12  April in order to draw the government's attention once more to  the plight of the student population.    Government staff received representatives of the association  and a constructive conversation took place between them -- the  students were promised that the unpaid stipend owed them will be  paid and measures will be taken to prevent such a thing  happening in the future. Apart from this, the student leaders  agreed to meet with Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov. After this the  student pickets were withdrawn.    But representatives of political organizations which use any  opportunity for self-advertisement remained in the area by the  White House. After the picket was over, they organized  themselves into a column and set off for Novyy Arbat, where they  clashed with the militia.    The RATUOS press and information center put out a statement  from the chairman of its governing body, O. Denisov, expressing  regret about the participation of several students in the  unauthorized march but placing most of the blame for what  happened on representatives of extremist organizations which  used the students' nonpolitical event for their own purposes.</p>

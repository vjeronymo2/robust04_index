			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Changes to audit liability considered THE accountancy profession has established a group to present proposals to the government early next year on changes to the law on professional liability. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has set up a steering group to consider the options for reform in response to growing concerns over legal actions against auditors. The initiative builds on work conducted by the institute's business law committee and on a campaign for change launched by the largest six accounting firms earlier this year. It represents a widening of interest in the subject by the profession, and echoes support from the Confederation of British Industry. Mr Graham Ward, chairman of the new group and a partner with accountants Price Waterhouse, said the options included the introduction of a cap on liability; removal of section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act, which prevents auditors from limiting their liability; or amending the law that makes auditors jointly and severally liable in litigation. His group will prepare a paper for approval by the council of the institute at the end of this year or the beginning of 1994. The government has asked for more information about precisely how many firms are affected by large-scale lawsuits, and crucially whether the problem is likely to persist or is merely related to the recession.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND NOW, A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR THE NEW NC-17 MOVIE RATING  </P> <P> The protests against the much-needed NC-17 rating are naive.  </P> <P> Luckily, for some time film distributors had been able to easily overcome the  "no X-rated-film-advertising/censorship" problem: Simply release a film with no  rating at all.  </P> <P> Hence there is absolutely no difference between the NC-17 rated "Henry &amp;  June" and numerous unrated films over the years.  </P> <P> JIM and PATTY DEE  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo  </P></p>

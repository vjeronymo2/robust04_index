			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] Seven days of talks on the disposal of military  land ended fruitlessly yesterday, with China accusing Britain of  a lack of cooperation.    The failure dashed hopes of a long-expected deal at the  Joint  Liaison Group session expected to be held early next month.    Emerging from yesterday's talks, Chinese team leader Chen  Zuoer lamented that China's reasonable appeals for information  had been unsuccessful.    He criticised the British side for holding back information  China had been seeking for the past seven years, but did not  specify what was wanted.    And he rejected "rumours" that China had made new demands on  the handover of military sites.    China has reportedly asked for a slightly bigger naval basin  and decided to hold back one of the 25 military sites it had  promised to hand to the Hong Kong Government for development.    "This does not comply with the facts. The fact is that the  talks on the handover of the military sites are still going on  between the two governments, and this will continue," he said.    His British counterpart, Alan Paul, attributed the failure  to  the complicated nature of the issue.    "If it were not, we would not have been talking about it for  seven years," he said.    "We have done our best over this time to reach an agreement.  We have not been successful. We are obviously disappointed but  not despondent because both sides will continue to strive for  agreement."    It is understood the British side deemed the new Chinese  demands to be unacceptable, both to them and to the Legislative  Council which will have to approve funds to reprovisioning of  military facilities for China.    Foreign Office spokesman Bill Dickson said he was not aware  of Mr Chen's claims of secrecy: "The British side has gone to  enormous lengths to provide the Chinese delegation with  information."    He said he did not expect yesterday's outcome to have any  impact on the Joint Liaison Group plenum.    In Beijing, a senior mainland official warned Britain not to  repeat the mistakes of the political negotiations when it seeks  co-operation on other issues.    "China still wants to have co-operation on other issues...  (We) hope that the British side can show sincerity and not  repeat what it has done over the political question," said the  deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Chen  Ziying.    "The difference between clever and stupid people is that the  former will not repeat the same mistake. (We) hope that we are  all clever people," he told a business delegation from Hong Kong.    Earlier, in the territory, a deputy director of XINHUA (the  New China News Agency), Zhang Junsheng, accused Britain of  leaking to the press its determination to push ahead with the  airport financing arrangement outlined in the fourth package of  proposals.    Mr Zhang said Britain should make its stance clear at the  Airport Committee meeting set for this week.    "Any problems between China and Britain should be sorted out  through the Airport Committee discussions. The fact that  Britain announced the re-opening of the talks while at the same  time unilaterally publicising its stance on the fourth proposal  will have a detrimental effect," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party of </F> Democratic Kampuchea, by station correspondent on 26 June; place  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] My respects to His Excellency Mr.  Chairman. Thank you for allowing me to interview you on behalf  of the Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia  [VGNUFC] radio. Here is my first question: Recently, the masses  throughout the country were very indignant with Hun Sen for  insulting His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk in a message dated  18 June 1994; what is your opinion on this matter?    [Khieu Samphan] Thank you, comrade representative of the  VGNUFC radio. Our nation and people know very well that it has  always been His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's wish to bring  about national reconciliation and to unite all Cambodian  factions so that peace in the Kingdom of Cambodia can be  restored. The king sees that the situation in our country has  been steadily deteriorating. For a long time, he has repeatedly  referred to this serious situation. If my memory does not fail  me, he has talked about this situation since the end of 1992.  Apart from his majesty, every simple Cambodian citizen has a  duty to be concerned with and express his view on the destiny of  his own nation. The king is even more duty bound toward and  responsible for the destiny of the nation. The king clearly  understands that there is only one way to get out of this  desperately serious situation, namely, through national  reconciliation.    The king, therefore, has all along expressed his opinion on  national reconciliation. He also proposed that a roundtable be  held between Cambodian leaders; however, he was resolutely  opposed by Hun Sen. Afterwards, he proposed that, since a  roundtable was not feasible, at least there should be  discussions and consultations. He offered himself to be the  bridge so that meetings or consultations could be held to  produce some results -- at least 10 or 20 percent. However, Hun  Sen was still opposed to this idea. Hun Sen opposed roundtables  and refused to meet with the Party of Democratic Kampuchea.  Still, his majesty the king kept trying until there was the  roundtable in Pyongyang, where a roundtable commission was  formed to carry on the talks. Yet, Hun Sen was still working to  sabotage the roundtable and the meeting of the roundtable  commission.    In that situation, still not satisfied with his efforts, the  king granted a press interview in Beijing on 11 June in which he  again mentioned the deteriorating situation of the country. He  expressed the view that one cannot solve the problem through  war, which can only cause death and destruction to the nation.  He said that, in the face of such a situation, he could not  remain indifferent and could not die with his eyes closed. Just  because of that, Hun Sen wrote a letter dated 18 June to insult  and disparage the king. Hun Sen said it was ridiculous of his  majesty, out of hunger for power, to try and use the press to  overthrow Hun Sen and call for demonstrations to topple him.  Hun Sen then declared that he was categorically opposed to the  formation of any national reconciliation government. Hun Sen  reminded his majesty that the current Hun Sen was different from  the Hun Sen he knew in the past, and he insisted that his  majesty give him an answer, saying he was waiting for an answer  so that he could take further action.    It is regrettable that Hun Sen used such filthy language  with  his majesty the king. The king, at his advanced age, could  easily be Hun Sen's father. There is no reason for Hun Sen to  insult him like that. The king is a national leader, respected  by both our people and the rest of the world. He has great  experience in national government. What he did was only to  kindly remind Hun Sen to open his eyes and see how grave our  country's situation is and how seriously it is deteriorating.  He merely asked for national reconciliation. There is no  reason for Hun Sen to insult and disparage him in this way.  Does he deserve to be a son of Cambodia, a minister, or a prime  minister? Is there any justification for him to insult the king  like that? He did not insult just the person of the king. He  insulted him because he had asked for the cessation of war, for  national reconciliation in line with the desire and need of our  nation and people.    Such a lese majeste, legally speaking, deserves severe  punishment. Everybody knows how serious this offense is in the  law of our country and the world.    [Correspondent] In your opinion, why then did Hun Sen do  what  he did?    [Khieu Samphan] Before answering this question, I would like  to tell you that in my opinion our entire nation and people have  the same view as I do. This is not just a question of Hun Sen  insulting and disparaging his majesty. The substance of his  majesty's statements, as I have already informed you, is that  which is held by both his majesty and our entire nation and  people. Therefore, this reflects the current conflict between  two policies, two forces, in our country. On the one hand,  there are the forces that continue to ignite the war and oppose  national reconciliation; and on the other hand, there are the  forces of our nation, people, and peace-and justice-loving  countries in the world that want to see peace restored and  national reconciliation achieved in Cambodia.    In writing the letter to insult and disparage his majesty,  Hun Sen overtly represented communist Vietnam and the bad  elements in the Western alliance in his opposition to the king,  national reconciliation, peace, and the Cambodian nation and  people.    [Correspondent] As you said previously, in the 18 June  letter, Hun Sen wrote that the current Hun Sen was different  from the Hun Sen of the past, for this was a Hun Sen who  demanded that his majesty give him an answer; and Hun Sen said  he was waiting for an answer in order to take further action.  In your opinion, what did Hun Sen mean?    [Khieu Samphan] In my opinion, Hun Sen wanted to say that in  the past Hun Sen was merely a puppet of communist Vietnam. Only  communist Vietnam was his boss. No countries recognized the  so-called State of Cambodia then and no countries recognized Hun  Sen as prime minister. Now, following the signing of the Paris  agreements, after the bad elements in the Western alliance have  tampered with the Paris agreements, after the UNTAC [UN  Transitional Authority in Cambodia] elections have been held,  and after the bad elements in the Western alliance have colluded  with communist Vietnam in conjuring up the two-headed  government, Hun Sen has won the backing of both communist  Vietnam and the bad elements in the Western alliance as well as  the recognition of the United Nations. Moreover, the bad  elements in the Western alliance are giving him arms. It was  for these reasons that Hun Sen was flexing his muscles and  showing them to the king and others. Hun Sen threatened that if  he did not get the right answer from the king, he would make a  liberal use of his military and police forces. When he wrote  that he was waiting for an answer from his majesty in order to  take further action, Hun Sen meant to cow his majesty into  stopping making statements about peace, the end of war, national  reconciliation, roundtables, and the roundtable commission's  meetings. If his majesty continued to talk about them, Hun Sen  would take brutal action.    In my opinion, this was not only a threat, an intimidation  against his majesty. It was a threat, an intimidation, and an  attempt to gag other parties and other personalities, including  some ministers in the two-headed government who support his  majesty, have the same opinion as his majesty, want to solve the  problem peacefully, and want to end the war. In other words,  Hun Sen wanted to intimidate and cow everybody with the use of  brute force in the form of both the military and police forces.  Hun Sen, Chea Sim, and Sar Kheng undermined the roundtable,  shut off the Democratic Kampuchea office in Phnom Penh, closed  down newspapers, ordered their fascist policemen and soldiers to  assassinate journalists, summoned journalists for harassment,  and arbitrarily arrested, incarcerated, and shot people in Phnom  Penh and the provinces. All these fascist actions were made to  oppose national reconciliation and close the mouth and plug the  ears of the people to prevent them from talking or hearing about  national reconciliation so that communist Vietnam and the other  bad elements in the Western alliance could jointly send in arms  to carry on the war and destroy the Cambodian nation and people  and Democratic Kampuchea.    [Correspondent] If that is the case, what is the frame of  mind of our Cambodian nation and people?    [Khieu Samphan]) Hun Sen clearly upholds the banner of  communist Vietnam, the banner of national treason, the banner of  those who have sold out their nation against the king, the  country, and the people. He upholds the banner of war, the  banner of fascism, corruption, and oppression of the people. He  orders the fascist policemen and soldiers to persecute, arrest,  incarcerate, and slaughter the nation and people and allows  Vietnamese immigrants to arrogantly grab our land and orchards,  steal the fish in our rivers and lakes, rob us of our forests,  take all our jobs, and seize even vending stalls in our markets.  Our nation and people will surely fight back because they can  no longer stand it. They are rising up and fighting. Our  people refuse to live like a snake and die like a frog without  struggling.    The current situation is like a painful boil full of pus on  the verge of eruption, with Hun Sen pricking it with a stick.  Everybody knows that the students, teachers, civil servants,  and even some ministers in the two-headed government want  national reconciliation and oppose war. Our people oppose war.  The soldiers of the two-headed government also oppose war.  Everybody knows all about this. The foreign press in general is  writing about it. The soldiers and even the officers of the  two-headed government have told foreign newspapers that they no  longer want to die in the place of Hun Sen, Chea Sim, and Sar  Kheng. What does all of this mean? Does it not mean that the  soldiers of the two-headed government are opposed to war and  those who have kindled it?    The two-headed government can no long conscript soldiers.  They have used fascist soldiers and policemen to surround  villages and schools and still they cannot conscript many  soldiers. The few who were conscripted later on deserted.  Those who were ordered to go to the battlefields ended up  deserting. Because it failed to conscript soldiers, the  two-headed government issued a law mobilizing the militia. Yet,  it could not mobilize as many of them as they wished. What can  it mean other than that the people are opposed to war?    Moreover, the para troops [former non-communist resistance  fighters] of Prince Ranariddh and Dien Del have become very  frustrated. They were integrated into communist Vietnam's  puppet army and placed under the command of communist Vietnam's  puppets in the most ignominious manner. Communist Vietnam's  puppets have only contempt for them and treat them like their  running dogs. Communist Vietnam's puppets have ordered them to  fight and die in their place. When they refuse to fight,  communist Vietnam's puppet leaders shoot them dead. Their wives  and daughters at home have been raped and their cattle stolen.  Some soldiers of Prince Ranariddh who had no land to stay on  and no huts to live in once occupied a piece of land at O Bek  K'am in Stoeng Meanchey [a Phnom Penh suburb]. Prince Ranariddh  together with Hun Sen, Sar Kheng, and Yu Hokkri dispatched  artillery pieces, small arms, and armored cars to surround and  kill them.    Now the para troops of Prince Ranariddh, like those of Dien  Del, have been almost completely disbanded and decimated. When  Prince Ranariddh and Dien Del tried to conscript more para  troops in Oddar Meanchey, Thmar Puok, Preah Net Preah, and other  places, they met with a stiff resistance from the people. No  one wanted to join them any more. The anger of Prince  Ranariddh's and Dien Del's para troops has seethed for months,  and now with Hun Sen insulting and disparaging his majesty no  one at all wants to become a para soldier of Prince Ranariddh or  Dien Del. The former para troops are returning to their  hometowns and an increasing number of them are joining the  people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea in the  struggle to defend their villages and hometowns.    In conclusion, our nation and people oppose war and want  national reconciliation. Hun Sen is upholding the banner of  communist Vietnam and the bad elements in the Western alliance  in igniting the war. Our nation and people vigorously oppose  them. Their fate is sealed in the history of the ages.    [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Do you have  something else to add before ending this interview?    [Khieu Samphan] I would like to recall and emphasize the  position of Democratic Kampuchea as follows: Democratic  Kampuchea is the victim and not the instigator of war.  Communist Vietnam is the instigator of war. It sent hundreds  of thousands of its troops to invade Cambodia at the end of  1978. Recently, it colluded to form the two-headed government  and it combined forces to attack Democratic Kampuchea in Stoung,  Phnum Chhat, Anlung Veng, Pailin, and other areas while  Democratic Kampuchea merely exercised its right to self-defense.  Although it has a complete right to self-defense, Democratic  Kampuchea has continued doggedly to seek meetings and talks so  as to reach a better mutual understanding with others and  gradually find common points in a move toward realizing national  reconciliation and securing sufficient national forces to solve  the nation's major and minor problems. All of this is because  Democratic Kampuchea clearly understands, as his majesty has  already pointed out, that war means death, the death of not just  a few people but of the entire nation and people; it means  racial extinction. This is because the war gives an opportunity  for Vietnam to send massive numbers of its people into Cambodia  to swallow this country up. Therefore, only with national  reconciliation can the nation survive. Achieving national  reconciliation, as an important personality in Phnom Penh said,  is like boring a hole in a piece of wood. You cannot make the  hole just by merely placing the drill on the wood; you must  drill it little by little until the drill is through. This  means that just a couple of rounds of talks or negotiations will  not make national reconciliation. We need more meetings and  consultations.    I firmly believe in the force of our nation and people. I  believe that the force of national reconciliation will surely  prevail. The truth about this has been proven by history.    [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to  interview you today. Before taking leave of you, I would like  to wish you the best of health and success in your lofty  patriotic mission. Thank you.</p>

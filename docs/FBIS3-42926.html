			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Daniya Zavdatovna Bagapova, deputy chairman </F> of board of Central Volga Commercial Joint-Stock Bank, by Viktor  Saklakov in Moscow and Samara; date not given: "The Bank of the  Volga Region's Rebirth"]    [Text] The main goal of the staff of the Central  Volga Commercial Joint-Stock Bank is the restoration of the  Samara region's former reputation as one of the centers of  Russian business. It is attaining this goal successfully. In  just three years, the bank has become one of the largest  financial institutions in the oblast. Its capital stock has  increased from 60 million rubles to 6.5 billion. According to  independent estimates (particularly the KOMMERSANT rating), it  holds a steady position among the 20 most reliable banks in  Russia. Our correspondent asked one of its administrators,  Deputy Chairman of the Board D.Z. Bagapova, to say something  about the operations of the bank.    "When we founded our bank, we were relying on the strength  of  regional industry," Daniya Zavdatovna said. "The founders  included such well-known production units and organizations as  the Samara Metallurgical Joint-Stock Company, the Samara  Aircraft Engineering Enterprise, the Progress Plant, the  Kuybyshev Railroad Administration, the Kuybyshevazot Joint-Stock  Company, and others. We were naturally hoping to establish a  stable, solid, and modern bank. This is not a simple task,  particularly under present economic conditions, now that former  state firms have had to enter into market relations so suddenly,  without any preparation. Obviously, the difficulties inherent in  this process have a direct effect on our operations. After all,  serving the municipal and oblast economy can account for up to  80 percent of the bank's operations. Nevertheless, in 1993 we  managed to achieve a significant rise in most indicators and  strengthen our position among the leading commercial financial  institutions in the region. Our credit volume last year was 240  billion rubles, and our profits were around 42 billion rubles."    [Saklakov] Many financiers are complaining that investments  in economic development are tantamount to suicide in today's  economy. What is your opinion?    [Bagapova] There is no question that investments in  long-term  projects always entail risks, but we are still doing this. The  size of our investments is constantly growing. Our investments  in the last nine months of last year amounted to a billion  rubles. Of course, we are more likely to finance highly  profitable ventures. We extended credit for the construction of  a linoleum plant in Otradnyy, we took on the restoration of hops  plantations, the products of which were once exported to almost  every part of Europe, and we are supporting the development of  the rural communities of the Volga Germans and other  agricultural production units supplying the population with  food. We could invest more, but the problem is the regrettable  lack of so-called ready money in the country--i.e., funds  available for fairly long-term loans, even at high rates of  interest. It is impossible to concentrate only on the present.  We have to find some way of developing our industry, and this  cannot be done without "ready" money. The government should be  the source of this money (or at least find ways of obtaining  it). At this time, however, plants are using most of our credit  to pay wages. The giants of metallurgy, the aerospace industry,  and the petroleum industry are not getting anything from the  center. It is as if we bankers are the only ones who care about  the future of the economy and of the previously mentioned  aircraft engineering plant. In fact, according to a recently  passed law, the interest on deferred credit payments will come  out of the bank's profits.    [Saklakov] Is there really no appreciation of the fact that  you are participating in the development of leading enterprises?    [Bagapova] None at all! The law draws no distinctions  whatsoever between us and the banks subsidizing commercial  structures. Everyone is put in the same category, but the most  surprising part of the whole situation is the constant violation  of the precept that a law cannot be applied retroactively. It is  only in our country that they can make a decision today and name  some time in the distant past as the date it went into effect.  The credit regulating fund of the Russian Central Bank is a good  example of this. It would seem to be a good thing to have a  strong national financial reserve to cover unpaid loans. We  thought so when were depositing 20 percent of the bank's  receipts in this fund. Today around 20 billion rubles of just  our funds are frozen there. The money is being kept in the fund  to no one's benefit, and there has not been a single case in  which anyone has used the deposited funds as insurance. It is  not even possible to buy the money at the Russian Central Bank  loan rate for subsequent use.    [Saklakov] Is the possibility that common sense will prevail  in our country someday our only hope?    [Bagapova] We are waiting impatiently for this day. No one  wants to follow orders today, but legal standards, particularly  in the interrelations of commercial banks with the Russian  Central Bank and, consequently, with the state, must be more  explicit. People have implied that we are simply profiting from  economic difficulties, but this is certainly not the case. The  government and the new parliament cannot leave the banking  structure to its own devices. We need the kind of laws that will  allow the banks, as the circulatory system of the state, to  function in a beneficial atmosphere, with only limited  interaction, as partners, with the Russian Central Bank.    [Saklakov] Please tell us about your work with your tens of  thousands of private depositors.    [Bagapova] The residents of Samara Oblast have deposited  more  than 25 billion rubles in the bank and its 18 branches. We want  to open bank service centers wherever possible (including some  on the grounds of enterprises), and we are expanding our network  of branches. We are the only bank in the oblast to make  cost-of-living adjustments in deposits, and we are doing this at  our own expense. Our consumer credit operations are extensive,  and we buy and sell privatization checks, stock, and other  securities. The public appreciates our bank's use of all of the  tactics and strategy of its financial operations to guarantee  the safety of deposits. Suffice it to say that our reserve fund  already exceeds our capital stock. This means that we can insure  our clients against many unforeseen developments.    [Saklakov] As I understand it, Daniya Zavdatovna, you  readily  offer services connected with foreign currency operations.    [Bagapova] The bank was granted a general license by the  Russian Central Bank for all types of foreign currency  operations. Enterprises in Samara are active in business abroad,  and we intend to help them in these operations. We already have  an administration for foreign economic operations and a network  of currency exchange centers. We hope to extend credit in  foreign currency in the future.    [Saklakov] What kind of relationship do you have with other  banks?    [Bagapova] The days when new banks were viewed as rivals or  as dire enemies are over. After all, each bank has found its own  niche in the financial system, and now we have to unite our  efforts, exchange information, and agree on a common approach to  problems. I personally feel that the goal of our bank should not  be the attraction of more clients by any means possible, but  competition for clients with services of higher quality. We lose  many opportunities when we do not bother to inform the public of  our views on economic issues. It is time for bankers to be  represented in the government and in legislative spheres.    [Saklakov] You come from a family of financial employees,  and  you know the traditions of this system. Do you sense a for  technological changes in this field?    [Bagapova] We are understandably dissatisfied with many  aspects of bank operations. It has been a long time since  personal computers on the desks of staff members were a novelty,  and now we hope to sign a contract with the Swiss IBS firm on  comprehensive automation. This will allow us to offer our  clients better service, increase the number of services, and  speed up our operations dramatically, so that transactions can  be finalized in a single day. This system will unite the central  office with bank branches and with trade and consumer service  enterprises and pave the way for the use of credit cards in this  country and abroad. We hope to develop a network of our own, and  not only in our own region. We plan to open branches in 180  cities of the Russian Federation and the CIS countries. We are  now analyzing financial flow charts in the interest of our  clients, to determine different ways of making new business  contacts.

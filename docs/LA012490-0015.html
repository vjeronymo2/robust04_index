			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS FOR GORBACHEV  </P> <P> With regard to the editorial "Gorbachev's Secession Crisis" (Jan. 16), I should  like to comment on what was not mentioned in the editorial: namely on the  identity crisis now facing the Soviets.  </P> <P> It is clear to me, as an American of Lithuanian descent, that the residents of  Sovietized countries must feel strongly about the loss of their national  identity in such a process.  </P> <P> Just how Soviet officials react to the current upsurge of nationalism remains  to be seen. The fact that many of the Baltic and Armenian "rebels" seen in the  press are relatively young men and women is significant. They were not around  when their countries became republics but they probably heard stories of the  good, old days from their elders.  </P> <P> What is evident is that many residents of what is called Vilnius, a city of the  Soviet Union, feel that the original name of that age-old city should be  restored and made the capital of Lithuania. I consider Vilnius to be Vilna, and  I suspect that present-day Lithuanians may feel the same way.  </P> <P> There is no comparison between the Sovietization of established nations into  the structure of a republic and the unification of states in our country. Each  American state still retains its individual traditions, customs and practices.  We did not change place names in the states as the result of the Civil War. The  same cannot be said about the Soviets.  </P> <P> SHELDON J. KARLAN  </P> <P> Buena Park  </P></p>

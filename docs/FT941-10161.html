			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Companhia Vale do Rio Doce cuts iron ore prices Brazil's state-controlled mining giant, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, has cut iron ore prices to match the discounts offered by Hamersley, a company official said yesterday, reports Reuter from Rio de Janeiro. CVRD had closed several contracts with Japanese clients, including Nippon Steel Corporation and Kawasaki Steel Corporation, that included 9.5 per cent reductions for sinter feed and 5.9 per cent for lump ore, the official said. Officials of the Brazilian company were due to sign contracts with various German clients in Dusseldorf tomorrow and prices offered on those contracts were likely to be similar to those agreed with the Japanese, he added.</p>

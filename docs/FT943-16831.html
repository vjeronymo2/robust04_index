			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Turks defy Russia on shipping: Curbs imposed on Bosporus traffic despite protests Turkey was yesterday set on a possible collision course with Russia, after unilaterally imposing new shipping regulations for the Bosporus and Dardanelles. Russia and other Black Sea states claim the rules are in breach of international treaties. Russia, Greece, Cyprus, Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria have all publicly protested. Under the new rules ships must forewarn Turkish port authorities of their cargo and vessels more than 150 metres long must seek permission to go through the straits that divide Europe and Asia. The straits are a vital trade route for Russia and newly independent Black Sea states. However, Turkey has mounted a diplomatic campaign to win international support for the measures on safety grounds. It fears the projected increase in tanker traffic, as central Asian oil finds come on stream, will be an environmental and navigational threat, a point which was underscored by a collision in March in which more than 20 people died. Congestion is likely to increase after the opening of the Danube-Main-Rhine canal system. According to minutes from a meeting in May of the International Maritime Organisation, the London-based United Nations body that handles maritime disputes, Russia and other states argued that the Turkish proposals contravened the 1936 Montreux Convention, which guarantees unhindered passage for merchant vessels in peacetime. The IMO said yesterday Turkey's regulations were national laws and had no international application. Western diplomats are waiting to see if the Turks apply them to foreign-flagged vessels. Both Russia and Greece want Turkey to support international action within the IMO to deal with safety concerns. In May, the IMO's maritime safety committee recommended more modest changes, including introduction of traffic separation lanes and a requirement that ships over 200 metres long go through the straits during daylight. Both measures take effect in November. Shipping experts say the long-term worry is that if left unchallenged, Turkey's action may set a legal precedent and provide Ankara with discretionary powers to impede shipping. Greek officials confirm that in April a Greek-registered tanker, the Olympic Armour, was prevented from going through the straits because it was too long. Turkey clearly also has a commercial motivation. It is keen to see western oil companies in central Asia use a proposed Turkish pipeline to the Mediterranean. The new rules, if implemented, could result in costly delays in shipping oil through the straits, currently the main route for Russian and central Asian oil exports, and persuade oil concerns to look more favourably on Turkey's proposal. Diplomats say the disagreement underscores wider differences with Russia over regional policy. Turkey is at loggerheads with Moscow on a range of issues from Russian peacekeepers in the Caucasus and central Asia, to Moscow's diplomatic role in former Yugoslavia. But the danger is that Turkey, in pursuing commercial gains, is hampering efforts to deepen trade ties with the region under the auspices of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation (BSEC) organisation, in which Ankara has been the driving force. High-level discussions - including a Turkish-Russian meeting on Thursday at the BSEC foreign ministers' conference in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi - have provided no breakthrough.</p>

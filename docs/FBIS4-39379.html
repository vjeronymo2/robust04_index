			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Go-between in controversial $60 million arms deal  between Estonia and TAAS Israel Industries Ltd., Leonid  Apananski, had in 1992 sponsored the election campaign of three  prominent members of the ruling Fatherland Party, former Defence  Minister Indrek Kannik told the Estonian Radio on Tuesday.  Kannik said Apananski had sponsored present Foreign Minister  Juri Luik, MP Mart Nutt and himself with 9,000 kroons ($692).    "I am sorry that those documents from Fatherlandos  election-time archive should have come out now," Kannik said  while adding that the archives had stayed with Tiit Pruuli, the  former adviser to Prime Minister Mart Laar. Kannik also said  Laar and Pruuli had advised them to ask Apananski for campaign  funds. Kannik's interview came a day after MP Aivar Kala had  accused Kannik of accepting Apananski's funds.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Spain tightens bank fraud law The Spanish parliament yesterday approved legislation giving the Bank of Spain a degree of Bundesbank-style autonomy, along with amendments establishing strict rules to prevent illicit enrichment by the bank's officials. The move reflected the intense public debate over the central bank prompted by tax evasions and fraud allegations linked to the disgraced former governor Mr Mariano Rubio who was freed on bail yesterday after two weeks in prison. The law, first drafted in 1992, lays down that investments by senior bank employees must be independently administered and closely supervised by the market regulator, the National Securities Market Commission. Mr Rubio is being investigated in connection with tax evasion and falsifying public documents when he was central bank governor in the late 1980s. The law gives the Bank of Spain the responsibility of setting monetary policy and prohibits it from financing the treasury and other public institutions. The government, in consultation with the Bank of Spain, nevertheless retains control over exchange rate policy.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Technology issues push Dow lower Wall Street US technology stocks resumed their downward slide yesterday, depressing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and sending the Nasdaq composite into a tailspin, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow finished 25.68 off at 3,699.09, its lowest level since May 17, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 3.46 at 449.63. New York SE activity remained moderate, volume amounting to 256.5m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite shed 1.97 to 431.25, while the Nasdaq composite suffered its third big setback in four sessions, dropping 11.89 to 700.85, now more than 100 points off its March zenith. There was no solid news to trigger the renewed weakness in the computer sector. It appeared to be a continuing reaction to Lotus Development's profits warning earlier in the week. However, some analysts said SoundView Financial Group's downgrading of Cisco Systems, a computer networking concern, was the catalyst. With relative calm returning to the foreign exchange markets, equity investors had attempted to build on Wednesday's solid advance. The dollar was helpful, climbing above Y101 on speculation that central banks were preparing to intervene to support the US currency. The rescue mission did not materialise but the dollar held firm nevertheless. Bonds were supported early in the day by developments in the foreign exchange markets. The day's economic news was not uniformly positive but neither did it seem to present any obstacles. The Commerce Department said orders of durable goods had risen by 0.9 per cent in May, against expectations of a 0.4 per cent gain, but most of the overall increase came from a rise in aircraft orders. Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported an increase of 3,000 in claims for unemployment benefit last week, while economists had expected a slight decline. Both sets of data pointed to a moderating growth rate which, on balance, is positive for equity investors hoping that the Federal Reserve will delay its next move to lift interest rates until late summer. Still, stocks appeared to be in a holding pattern, with the activity in bonds or currencies, and the fresh economic data, failing to generate either excitement or disappointment. The blue chips were showing moderate gains by mid-morning, but tailed off as the afternoon began, mirroring a slow, steady erosion of the bond market's early gains. However, by mid-afternoon, technology issues had clearly broken into retreat. On the Nasdaq, Lotus shed a further 7.38 per cent, or Dollars 2 5/8 , to close at Dollars 33 3/4 , while Microsoft declined Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 50 1/8 and Wellfleet Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 21 1/4 . Cisco fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 21. On the Big Board, Micron Technology lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 31 1/4 , Texas Instruments Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 74 1/8 and IBM Dollars 1 to Dollars 61. In takeover news, the aborted battle for Kemper pushed the insurance company's share price up Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 , a new 52-week high. The trading followed an offer by Conseco to buy the company for Dollars 67 a share in cash and stock, and the subsequent withdrawal of a Dollars 60 a share cash bid by GE Capital, a General Electric subsidiary. Canada Toronto finished weaker after moderate trading. The TSE 300 index fell 17.6 to 4,034.5 and declining issues outnumbered advances by 426 to 336. Most of the index's decline came in the final hour of trading. Turnover totalled 54.2m shares. Nine of the 14 stock groups lost ground. The transportation sector led the way down, dropping 1.99 per cent. Industrial products and energy were off 1.07 and 1.02 per cent respectively. Hollinger retreated CDollars 1 3/4 to CDollars 14 3/8 on news that the London Stock Exchange was investigating a 34 per cent fall in the shares of its UK newspaper subsidiary, The Telegraph plc, after the company cut the price of the Daily Telegraph. Brazil Sao Paulo closed 1.83 per cent down in local currency terms in thin volume after investors stayed on the sidelines and traders worried about today's performance. Brokers said the US stock market's fall yesterday afternoon, coupled with concern about volatility in the dollar and a lack of local news, kept investors out of the market. The Bovespa index lost 586 points at 31,400, after having risen in the morning session to 32,734. Volume was low at Cr454.5bn (Dollars 181.9m).</p>

This document was  signed by the representative of Nagorno-Karabakh, Bako Saakyan  as well. The meeting was mediated by Russian Defense  Minister, Pavel Grachev.    TURAN's Moscow's correspondent was told by the Russian  Defense Minister that this document could be called "a protocol  on intentions". It means that "the parties expressed their wish  to cease hostilities, withdraw troops and withdraw from all  occupied territories". Until now, an agreement defining the  specifics has not been adopted yet. Presently, military experts  are working on a draft of these agreements. The same source  says that preliminary results of the work will be officially  announced by the end of February and a cease-fire will be  declared officially on March 1.    At the same time, a reliable employee from the Azerbaijani  Ministry of Foreign Affairs told TURAN's reporter that "it is  too early speak about that, since it is doubtful that both  parties will agree to and implement the adopted obligations.  The Armenian party has violated all earlier concluded  agreements and occupies Azerbaijani territory", said the  employee of the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It  should be mentioned that the Russian peace initiative which  special envoy of the Russian President, Vladimir Kazimirov, put  forward in January for all intents and purposes coincides with  the terms mentioned in the protocol of the Defense Ministers.  Geydar Aliyev opposes Moscow's initiative.    The strict position of Pavel Grachev and his demands that  the  parties accept the terms of the truce, suggest that he is likely  to force Baku [to] accept Moscow's conditions.    These facts are confirmed by the fighting in the  Kelbadzharskiy region of Azerbaijan. According to sources in  the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry, special Russian troops took  part in recent fighting against Azerbaijan. There are Russian  troop divisions located in Armenia.    The latest Armenian success in the Kelbadzharskiy region  would have been impossible without the participation of Russian  troops, say military observers of the Azerbaijan Defense  Ministry.    Russia once more applies the infamous carrot and stick to  achieve its political aims. Pavel Grachev wants to pursue this  policy having already succeeded diplomatically in Georgia.</p>

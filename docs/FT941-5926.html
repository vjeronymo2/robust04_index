			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Quebec politics dampens business hopes: How separatism fears are overshadowing economic gains Quebec's business community is holding its breath, not sure whether to celebrate the end of a long, deep recession or to worry about the political future of Canada's French-speaking province. A provincial election, to be held later this year, is shaping up into a closely fought battle between the ruling Liberals, who have held office for nine years, and the separatist Parti Quebecois. If the PQ wins it has promised to hold an independence referendum within 12 months of taking office, giving Quebecois an opportunity to reverse their decision to remain part of Canada which they made in a similar vote 14 years ago. The prospect of a PQ victory has become as much - if not more - of a talking point in Montreal's clubby business community as the surging exports, a turnaround in corporate profits and the improved housing market which all signal the start of a long-awaited economic upturn. 'The economic climate is very good,' says Mr Jean Douville, president of Schroders &amp; Associates Canada, an affiliate of Schroders, the UK merchant bank. But Mr Douville, himself a Quebecois, adds that renewed political nervousness 'is certainly worrisome'. The PQ insists that business has nothing to fear in a sovereign Quebec. Its leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, is an astute economist who was once described as the best finance minister that Canada never had. In particular, PQ leaders have begun to lobby for an independent Quebec's accession to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Nevertheless, fears of a messy divorce and uncertainty about how well Quebec would fare by going it alone are unsettling business confidence. The PQ's last term in office in the late 1970s and early 1980s was marked by a flight of capital and people to neighbouring Ontario to the west, and the US to the south. The scare was exemplified by Sun Life of Canada, the country's biggest insurance company, which moved its head office from Montreal to Toronto. The jitters have started to resurface. The gap between the yield on 30-year bonds issued by Quebec and by the neighbouring province of Ontario has widened from about 12 basis points last autumn to 33 basis points late last month. Mr Yves Auclair, a Quebec bond specialist at Burns Fry in Montreal, says that 'the typical holder of Quebec bonds has gradually scaled back his weighting over the past four months'. Among long-term bonds issued by Canada's 10 provinces, only impoverished Newfoundland offers a higher yield than Quebec to attract investors. However, the spread between Quebec and Ontario bond yields narrowed to 21 basis points last week on the heels of opinion polls which show waning support for the separatists. One poll put the Liberals ahead of the PQ for the first time in more than a year. The federalist forces received another boost this week when the Liberals unexpectedly won a by-election in a French-speaking constituency east of Montreal. Anecdotal evidence suggests that while many companies are continuing to invest in Quebec, political uncertainty is also causing them to review their Quebec operations. The separatist forces were bolstered by the strong showing of the PQ's federal counterpart, the Bloc Quebecois, in the general election last October. The BQ is now the official opposition in the House of Commons in Ottawa. Its canny leader, Mr Lucien Bouchard, is likely to play a leading role in the coming election campaign. Mr Bouchard is in the US this week enjoying a level of status and publicity not conferred on the separatists since they were voted out of office nine years ago. His itinerary has included a meeting with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general. The BQ has made use of its strength in parliamentary debates and question periods to remind Quebecois that being part of the Canadian federation brings more costs than benefits. Prior to the by-election upset this week, Mr Parizeau was exuding confidence. The PQ had won a string of by-elections, including one last week in which it captured a Liberal - and supposedly federalist - stronghold. The Liberals' new leader, Mr Daniel Johnson, took over from Mr Robert Bourassa as premier in January amid low expectations. Mr Johnson has a low-key style and made many political enemies during his years as a tight-fisted cabinet minister in charge of the province's civil service. Senior diplomats in Ottawa had concluded that the coming election was the PQ's to lose. But recent opinion polls and the by-election result show that the fight is far from over. Mr Johnson is following a formula much like that which steered the federal Liberals to victory in the general election. Instead of being drawn into a constitutional debate, Mr Johnson is trying to spread a message that the best way to generate jobs is through a strong economy unfettered by political uncertainties. Like many others in the business community, Mr Douville is crossing fingers that the strategy will work. He notes that 'it's a lot easier for people to accept the status quo when they've got some money in their pockets'.</p>

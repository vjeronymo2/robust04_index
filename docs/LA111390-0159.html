Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BARNES SEEKS APPEAL OF BAN  </P> <P> The attorney for shot put world record-holder Randy Barnes said today he was  trying to arrange a Dec. 22 hearing for his client's appeal of a two-year  suspension from competition.  </P> <P> Barnes was suspended last week by the International Amateur Athletic  Federation, the world governing body for track and field, after testing  positive for steroids at a meet in Malmo, Sweden, in August.  </P> <P> Attorney John Dowd said a hearing date hadn't been finalized, but he was  shooting for late next month.  </P> <P> Barnes has said the IAAF's drug testing procedures in his case were shoddy. He  has denied taking steroids and insisted that the sample tested by the IAAF was  not his.  </P> <P> Barnes' appeal will go through The Athletics Congress, the national governing  body.  </P> <P> Barnes' world record is 75 feet, 10 1/4 inches, set in May.  </P></p>

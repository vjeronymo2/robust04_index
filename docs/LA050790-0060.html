			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> LIGHT, DARK RESET INTERNAL CLOCKS  </P> <P> Carefully timed doses of bright light and total darkness can help night shift  workers quickly reset their internal clocks so they stay alert on the job and  sleep soundly during the day, scientists reported last week in the New England  Journal of Medicine. The approach appears to be the first quick, practical cure  for the night shift blues, the on-the-job sleepiness and daytime insomnia that  plague many of the nation's 7 million night workers.  </P> <P> According to the principal developer, Dr. Charles A. Czeisler of Boston's  Brigham and Women's Hospital, the technique works this way: People moving to  the night shift reported to work -- in this case, a hospital lab -- at midnight  and spent the next eight hours sitting at a desk. While they worked, a bank of  lights 4 feet away shone with 16 cool-white 40-watt bulbs.  </P> <P> Then they drove home, pulled down blackout shades in their bedrooms and stayed  in total darkness from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. After just two days, the time on their  internal clocks shifted almost 10 hours. So instead of hitting the low point in  their daily cycle about 5 a.m., this happened around 3 p.m. when they were  still asleep. Those who got the light-dark treatment noticed an immediate  improvement in their alertness and performance and were able to sleep two hours  longer a day.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 4 Apr (EFE) -- Two years after the 5 April  1992 coup of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, the economic  isolation has been left behind and Peru has obtained $10.291  billion in foreign investment. The total direct investment for  production over the last two years has reached $1.619 billion,  while commitments for the short and medium term, through  contracts with 14 foreign companies, have reached $6.75 billion.    During the same period, another $1.922 billion entered the  Peruvian stock exchange, especially the Lima stock market, with  investments involving 1,312 foreigners (768 Chileans, 338  Americans, and 84 British). Most of the investments were made  through the sale of state companies and granting mining and oil  concessions to companies from Argentina, the United States,  Spain, Canada, China, Chile, South Africa, the United Kingdom,  and others.    Those with the greatest impact were the sale of the National  Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru and the Peruvian Telephone  Company for $2.002 billion and the signing of a contract to put  into operation the largest Peruvian natural gas deposit,  Camisea, with the Anglo-Dutch Shell Company with an initial  investment of $2 billion. According to experts, the great  participation by investors is attributed to the incentives  granted by Peruvian laws, which are considered by some people to  be the most liberal in Latin America.    In the post-coup period, Peru was also able to return to the  financial international community after reaching agreements with  the IMF and the World Bank, although it has not yet been  readmitted by the commercial banks. The IMF and the World Bank  had virtually alienated Peru from their institutions since 1985  when then Peruvian President Alan Garcia unilaterally restricted  the payment of the foreign debt. Talks with the Bank Committee  of creditors began last year, but are at a standstill due to a  lawsuit by the U.S. Chemical Bank for a debt of $72 million,  which will apparently be resolved soon.    Peru needs to reach an agreement with the private banks, to  which it owes about $6 billion, so as to allow alternate  financial sources that would give greater impulse to the plans  for modernizing its economy. A choice proposed by Peru is to  sign an agreement based on the Brady Plan, by which it would pay  $1 billion in exchange for being forgiven 50 percent of the  debt, about $3 billion.    The economic and financial stability obtained by Peru is  also  based on the harsh blows dealt to the terrorist groups, mainly  the Shining Path, which in 1992 was about to destabilize the  Peruvian Government. The downfall of this gang began in  September 1992 with the capture of its chief, Abimael Guzman,  and it fell even further when he asked for a peace agreement.  The Shining Path, although divided and weakened, is, however,  still active, and every so often tries, each time with less  force, to spread terror in an effort to scare away investors.    In the political field, the Fujimori government has become  internationally legitimate after holding three elections which  were endorsed by observers of the OAS and other organizations.  The unanimous international repudiation of the "Fujimori coup"  has also been left behind, and now Peru is normalizing its  relations with the rest of the world.    The internal political opposition, however, has not forgiven  Fujimori for the coup. It still accuses him of being a  "dictator," and is trying to form a single front headed by  former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to prevent  his possible reelection in 1995. The preelectoral polls indicate  that Perez de Cuellar is the favorite candidate for winning the  elections next year, but Perez has not yet decided to run.    Some analysts believe Perez de Cuellar can guarantee the  continuity of the economic model, but others, like former  Economy Minister Carlos Bolona, fear that Perez, with the  support of the left and the right, will be pressured by those  sectors, and that his eventual government will be "unviable."</p>

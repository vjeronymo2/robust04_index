			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, April 18 (AFP) -- The European Union  called here Monday [18 April] for an international programme of  humanitarian aid in response to the "human tragedy" in Rwanda,  and said it was ready to take part.    A statement issued during a meeting of EU foreign ministers  also appealed to the warring Hutu and Tutsi tribes in Rwanda to  stop fighting and resume negotiations under the Arusha accord  signed in August last year.    The accord provides a framework for a negotiated settlement  leading to democratic elections that would bring the minority  Tutsis into government.    Tens of thousands of people have been killed and wounded in  Rwanda since inter-tribal bloodshed resumed on April 6.</p>

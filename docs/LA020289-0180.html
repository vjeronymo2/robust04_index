			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOTES  </P> <P> Pacific Scientific said it has agreed to sell its infrared analytic-instrument  business in Maryland and a manufacturing plant in Anaheim to undisclosed  buyers. The Newport Beach company did not disclose a purchase price for the  Maryland unit but said it exceeded "book value," or the value of the property  minus depreciation. Under the agreement, Pacific Scientific will also receive  royalties based on the unit's future sales for a 5-year period. The  analytic-instrument business is part of Pacific Scientific's Instrument  Division, which is based in Silver Springs, Md. Last August, the company  announced a restructuring plan that includes the sale of two of the division's  three product lines and the sale of its Kin-Tech division plant in Anaheim. The  company said it is engaged in discussions with a potential buyer for a second  Maryland product line. Pacific Scientific said it expects to complete the sale  of the 9-acre Kin-Tech facility within 150 days to an undisclosed buyer. The  Kin-Tech unit, which manufactures aircraft products, and most of its 260  employees are being relocated to a smaller facility closer to a company plant  in Duarte. Pacific Scientific is a diversified manufacturer of electronic  instruments and aerospace products.  </P></p>

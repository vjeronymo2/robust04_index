			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: IWP improves to IPounds 11.8m IWP International, the Dublin-based industrial holding group, reported a 7.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 11.8m (Pounds 11.6m) on turnover up 2.8 per cent to IPounds 95.2m for the year ending March 31. The advance was achieved 'despite unfavourable economic conditions in the UK and the currency crisis which prevailed in Ireland in the second half of the year' according to Mr Joe Moran, chairman. The group comprises 18 companies divided into two main divisions, manufacturing chemically-based household products and printed cartons and self-adhesive labels. Its main markets are the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands. The household division performed particularly strongly with operating profits up 14 per cent to IPounds 8.97m on turnover ahead almost 7 per cent at IPounds 48.8m and now accounts for almost 70 per cent of group profits. The packaging division's operating outcome dipped to IPounds 5.07m (IPounds 5.36m) of turnover of IPounds 43.1m (IPounds 42.9m), mainly reflecting price competition. The small telecommunications interests incurred a small loss. Some IPounds 4.2m has been spent on acquisitions in the past year, while one of the two companies involved in telecommunications was disposed of for a consideration of IPounds 2.1m in shares in VMX, a California-based electronics company. Mr Moran warned that trading conditions continue to be 'difficult . . . we cannot at this stage be over optimistic about the current year'. Earnings per share were up 13.5 per cent to 31.9p (28.1p) and a final dividend of 4.25p is recommended for a total of 7.25p (6.6p).</p>

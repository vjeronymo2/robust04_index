			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Bull in search for new capital BULL, the French state-owned computer-maker which last week sealed a wide-ranging alliance with IBM, the US computer giant, is working with the Finance Ministry on how to raise substantial new equity capital. Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull chairman, told Les Echos newspaper yesterday that neither IBM's arrival nor the recent equity capital injections solved Bull's long-term financial problems. IBM is expected to pay around Dollars 100m for a 5.7 per cent stake in the French group, although the final details have yet to be settled. 'IBM's contribution is not useless, but it is not up to the size of our recapitalisation problem. It is significant and constitutes a mark of confidence,' Mr Lorentz said. He would give no details of how much Bull needed, beyond adding: 'We are reflecting on complementary measures of two types: firstly, a transitional arrangement for the two years ahead, awaiting a real recovery; secondly, something more durable.' Bull had long term debts of FFr9bn (Dollars 1.66bn) in its last balance sheet, for 1990. It is due to publish 1991 results towards the end of this month, which are expected to show operating losses half the FFr2.4bn operating deficit in 1990. A similar reduction can be expected from the FFr6.8bn net loss shown in the same period. Bull received FFr2bn in fresh capital from the French government last July and expects another FFr2bn this year, said an official. Both equity injections are being investigated by the European Commission, but officials feel that Brussels is unlikely to declare that they amount to unfair state aid now that IBM has agreed to invest in Bull on commercial terms.</p>

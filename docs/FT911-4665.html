			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Money Markets: London rates ease INTEREST RATES had a slightly softer tone in London yesterday, with news of a bigger than expected March UK public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 3.1bn having little impact. A further decline in bank base rates is expected,but not in the immediate future. June short sterling futures continued to discount a cash three-month interbank rate of slightly less than 11 1/2 per cent at delivery. In quiet trading on Liffe the contract opened a little higher at 88.68 and finished at 88.67 compared with 88.66 previously. On the cash market three-month interbank eased to 11 7/8 -11 3/4 from 11 29/32 -11 27/32 per cent, while 12-month money fell to 11 3/8 -11 1/4 from 11 1/2 -11 3/8 per cent. The Bank of England initially forecast a money market credit shortage of Pounds 250m, but revised this to Pounds 350m at noon. The authorities did not operate in the market until the afternoon, when help was given via the purchase of Pounds 307m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 145m, with a rise in the note circulation absorbing Pounds 75m and bank balances below target Pounds 105m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 75m to liquidity. In Frankfurt call money eased to 8.80 from 8.85 per cent after the Bundesbank added a net DM800m at this week's securities repurchase agreement tender. The central bank accepted bids totalling DM25.9bn at a two-tranche tender, offsetting expiring pacts of DM25.1bn. It provided DM16.8bn of DM28-day funds at a fixed rate of 8.60 per cent and DM9.1bn of 63-day money at variable bid rates, mostly 8.90 per cent. Tax payments will keep credit conditions tight in the immediate future, but this will be partly offset by redemptions and interest payments on government paper. The Bundesbank does not plan to hold a press conference after today's regular council meeting, and sentiment in Frankfurt suggested that a rise in official interest rates is unlikely, despite the recent speculation. Credit policy was tightened a notch with a rise in the fixed rate at last week's securities repurchase agreement, but there has been no similar move this week.</p>

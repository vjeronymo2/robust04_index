This evening, in its community center  with adjoining rathskeller, the general secretary of the  Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is speaking before 100 people.  And Peter Hintze was lucky to be able to do so because the local  CDU meeting faced stiff competition from the general membership  meeting of the gun club. The residents of Neu Wulmstorf came  nonetheless, though the average age of the audience must have  been a good bit over 50--these days by no means an unusual  phenomenon for CDU gatherings. Here he stands then, the  43-year-old general secretary who is, after all, still nine  years older than Christian Wulff, the leading candidate of the  Lower Saxony CDU, whose election campaign Hintze wants to help.  One female visitor utters an involuntary sigh over his youth  before Hintze begins to speak and attempts to break down the  northern Germans' brittle reserve--a difficult problem for  someone who does not want to phrase things too aggressively or  in a recklessly exaggerated manner. At least the smile has  disappeared from the corners of his mouth at the end of a long  day of election campaigning, which gives the appearance of a  little more credibility when the subject is unemployment or the  war in Bosnia.  <H5>  The Game Behind the Game </H5>   To put it briefly: All in all, the arguments were  convincing,  the appearance was a success though not an overwhelming one, the  applause was friendly and brief. That is the way it is with  Peter Hintze, and it would certainly be a plus for the  credibility of politics if the man, like an itinerant preacher,  were able to appear at thousands of these meetings and campaign  for his cause in tenacious detail work. Pastor Hintze is,  however, not an itinerant preacher but rather the general  secretary of the CDU, which is why he cannot constantly travel  about the country but really must be the big spokesman in  Bonn--or, as a confidant puts it: "We do not need the light  cavalry on the flank but the heavy artillery in the center."    In the meantime, to be sure, the bombardment has begun and  the general secretary has discovered that he himself, as  military people say, has come under friendly  fire--under fire from his own ranks. The difference, of  course, is that Hintze has been purposely chosen as a target, as  the whipping boy for a battered government, as a scapegoat for a  party that has come down in the world. Displeasure over sobering  public opinion figures, over lethargic and discouraged party  loyalists, over the loss of the political leadership role, and  over the lack of success is focused on Hintze. The CDU is  seizing upon its general secretary in a prophylactic move, as it  were, to explain the election defeat that appears to be evermore  ominous. The general secretary, on the other hand, lacks the  political weight and power to defend himself against the  cannonade and to thwart the game behind the game. And it is for  this reason that the case of Hintze is so typical of the  condition of the CDU, riven as it is by internal conflict and  where--if one only looks a bit more closely--a huge power  struggle for the legacy of Helmut Kohl is beginning to break out  and where any unanimity appears to be lost.    What then is the situation with general secretary and the  game behind the game? Peter Hintze was put into office at a time  when the Union appeared to have a lightweight opponent in the  Social Democrats. The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD)  was providing its own headlines and its leadership team was more  than preoccupied with itself. At the time--on 25 April 1992 to  be exact, which is also Hintze's birthday--on that day then,  Helmut Kohl invested State Secretary Peter Hintze with the  office of the general secretary in a four-hour speech in  Oggersheim. It is no secret that Hintze was not his first  choice--Hans-Peter Repnik, state secretary in the Ministry for  Economic Cooperation, and Juergen Ruettgers, secretary of the  parliamentary caucus, had already declined. Hintze accepted  because, as he himself says, he had the choice between a  tranquil life in the Ministry for Women and Youth or the  kamikaze job in the Adenauer House.    Hintze took office under difficult circumstances: The CDU's  opinion poll results were no better than today and the  leadership team at party headquarters had been completely  replaced. Only two years before the great election marathon,  Hintze had to do without an experienced team and start all over  again from the beginning with a young crew. Within the power  structure, the Adenauer House increasingly declined in  importance in relationship to the Chancellor's Office, the  caucus, and the party because Hintze also had to put internal  conditions in order during his first year and did not use the  time to achieve greater importance for his house in its external  relations. More important, however, was the fact that the Union  caucus, with Wolfgang Schaeuble at its head, developed a  powerful dynamism that literally bowled over the young general  secretary and his even younger team.    Hintze assumed the new office although he knew he lacked  political prominence. All of his predecessors had a field of  technical expertise in which they had been able to shine: Kurt  Biedenkopf as an economics expert, Heiner Geissler as a  specialist in social issues, and Volker Ruehe as a policy expert  in foreign affairs and defense. Hintze, on the other hand, was  aware of the fact that no laurels were to be won with the issues  of women and youth, which were considered soft in Bonn, or even  with his experience as expert for civilian service [for  conscientious objectors].    He therefore concentrated on the CDU's renewal--an  undertaking that, to be sure, succeeded in the Adenauer House,  but failed miserably in the party. The CDU is, surveys show,  unattractive to young people. The connection to voters under the  age of 40 has been broken. Again and again Hintze tried to seize  upon issues and promote them--thus far without success. It was  more by accident that his initiative to liberalize business  hours gained momentum during last summer's legislative break,  yet the chancellor, who had apparently underestimated the  dynamics of it, jumped from the train at the last minute and  left Hintze in the lurch. Hintze's successes in containing the  tax debate following the Duesseldorf party convention, for  example, or in the coalition fight over the AWACS deployment,  found no resonance with the public. Finally, the classic issue  for a general secretary--reform of the party and making it more  accessible, has long been taken over by Parliamentary Caucus  Secretary Ruettgers.    Hintze thus remained a strangely colorless figure and his  initiatives turned out rather ridiculous--such as the  demonstration he organized for nursing care insurance in front  of SPD headquarters where, in the manner of a Young Union [CDU  youth organization] project, he put up posters and allowed the  event to be taken over by SPD National Secretary Verheugen.  There is always something timid and immature about Hintze's  public appearances which has gained him the reputation of an  earnest schoolboy--not least of all because of his youthful  appearance. He acts stiff and defensive before the cameras, with  a mixture of studied aggressiveness and lecturing  paternalism--both of which come across as disingenuous and  artificial. His news conferences often go awry and his  statements are characterized by toothless sarcasms.    And now comes the astonishing aspect: There is also a  different Peter Hintze. There is a perceptive analyst, a  polished wordsmith, and an aggressive fighter. There is a  general secretary with firm views on the condition of his party  and precise plans for its recovery. There is an election  campaign manager with a keen understanding of the modern media  campaign, of the needs of the younger voter groups, and of the  limitations and potential of using party VIP's. There is the CDU  politician Peter Hintze who is thoroughly aware of his role, who  keenly observes what is happening around him and to him, and who  reports on the chaotic forces with which he has to struggle  every day in order to keep the CDU juggernaut on track while at  the same time having to contend with intrigues, feuds, and  treacheries. And because the man can speak so objectively about  himself, one very quickly comes to the second biggest problem  that, in addition to his lack of political prominence, plays a  role: the discrepancy between the public perception of Peter  Hintze and his real personality. It is simply a case of Hintze  having a serious problem of self-presentation, of him sharing  with his party chairman a shyness in front of the camera, and of  basically performing two roles.    Now that the election campaign is drawing nearer, they are  all jumping on him and demanding an aggressive and polemical  general secretary. In the laender party associations, in the  ministries, and even in the Chancellor's Office the call is  heard for the big stick and for the bulldog--a role Heiner  Geissler and Volker Ruehe once performed. "Ruehe certainly was  considered a crude guy, but he was effective," says a member of  the leadership rank. The party is thirsting for arguments, it is  demanding guidelines for the campaign, and it wants to know how  the CDU can once again tackle the job. For the time being,  Hintze cannot provide an answer--but who can in a Union where  resignation is everywhere rampant? Thus, they attack the general  secretary's methods: the computer network he had installed to  provide information to the kreis offices; the Adenauer House's  work with the press; the lamentable appearances at podiums in  front of colorful signs--all symbolism and not strategy,  activity for the sake of activity instead of content. Last week  the chancellor appointed journalist Peter Boenisch as special  advisor for the election campaign as he has done in previous  years as well, and although the man will not have any strategic  assignment and his true role cannot yet be properly assessed,  this is now being interpreted as a blow to Hintze.  <H5>  Like a Reed? </H5>   Lost amid all this turmoil and carnage is the fact that  Helmut Kohl knew perfectly well two years ago who he was  bringing into the Adenauer House. He knew that Hintze prefers  softer tones, that this general secretary would bring a new  style--friendly, objective, and not polemic. Furthermore, if one  assumes that Helmut Kohl continues to stand by Hintze, that a  change of general secretary would damage the chancellor himself  more than it would help him, and that a successor will also not  be able to change the downward trend, then the question is  raised as to the purpose of this crusade. Is someone--if it may  be put this way--beating the sack instead of the donkey? Is the  party's displeasure with its chairman being taken out on its  general secretary? But the explanation is also reasonable--and  one can hear it at many levels of the party--that a serious  struggle has set in at the leadership level of the CDU to get  the best starting position for the period after the election  when Helmut Kohl's fate will be decided.    Heiner Geissler has conceded that his successor has a good  heart. That, as he knows, will not be enough for Hintze to  survive the power struggle because the party traditionally shows  little consideration for good hearts. For this reason he much  prefers the analogy with the reed: Its toughness, he warns,  should not be underestimated--and especially not the sharpness  of its edges.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Land Travel Collapse: Customers vent anger on Tjolle MR VALERE TJOLLE, chairman of the Land Travel coach company, went to the Unicorn Hotel in Bristol yesterday to face the people whose holidays he had ruined and his colleagues in the travel industry whose fingers he had allegedly burned. If the gaunt and drawn-looking Mr Tjolle expected to be given credit for his courage in turning up, he was immediately disappointed. The hundreds of creditors present, many of whom were elderly, were in an angry mood which turned uglier as details emerged of the Pounds 400,000 of company funds paid into Mr Tjolle's bank account. The procession to the microphone of aggrieved customers and suppliers included several who called, to cheers, for Mr Tjolle to be locked up. Mr Robert Buller, of liquidators Grant Thornton, found himself the target of some of the hostility, particularly when he suggested that television cameras should be excluded from the meeting. His warning to creditors that they risked being sued if defamatory statements were captured on camera was greeted with cries of 'What a bloody cheek]' The cameras were allowed in. Mr Tjolle, pale and dressed in a dark suit, told creditors Land Travel had carried more than 1m travellers and had given them a 'very, very good time'. He added: 'Land Travel was a very creative travel company and had an enormous amount of devoted support from its staff, its customers and suppliers almost up until the end.' His voice close to breaking, Mr Tjolle said: 'So far as I'm concerned this is a very sad time. Our staff have lost their jobs, our customers have lost their holidays and our suppliers have lost their money. I personally feel that I have let you all down.' As Mr Tjolle, who filed for personal bankruptcy last Thursday, refused to answer any questions on the advice of his solicitor, the meeting at times came close to anarchy. Mr Tjolle sat impassive as creditors threw a jug of water and papers at him. Mrs Glenys Dwyer, of Bristol, said that she had paid Land Travel Pounds 3,000 to take 47 deaf people to Paris, a trip that had never taken place. Mrs Dwyer, who is deaf, spoke through a sign-language interpreter. She repeated a complaint by many creditors who said they had been pressed into making payments to the company in the weeks before it collapsed. Mr Leon Sarkis, general manager of Monde Sans Frontiere, a Paris-based travel company, said Land Travel owed him Pounds 250,000. Mr Sarkis said that on one occasion he had lent FFr230,000 in cash to the company to enable it to buy tickets to the Euro-Disney resort. He added that he had been told the company could not get any cash as the banks were closed because it was a Saturday. He said the money had not been returned. Mr Buller gave the meeting details of financial transactions between Mr Tjolle and the Granada Group, which owned Land Travel between 1987 and 1990. When Mr Tjolle bought the company from Granada he obtained its Pounds 2.2m loan to Land Travel for a consideration of Pounds 1. He converted it into loans to Land Travel from himself, Pounds 2m of which was long-term, repayable in 1996, and Pounds 200,000 of which was short-term. In the years after Mr Tjolle purchased Land Travel from Granada it made heavy losses. They totalled Pounds 1.8m in 1990-91 and Pounds 2.7m in 1991-92. Mr Buller said that Mr Tjolle appeared to have received the Pounds 400,000 in the period before that stipulated in the loan he purchased from Granada and in preference to the general body of Land Travel creditors.</p>

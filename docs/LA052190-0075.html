			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA STUDENT IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER SHOOTING AT PACOIMA GAS STATION  </P> <P> An 18-year-old UCLA student studying to be a pediatrician was in critical  condition at UCLA Medical Center on Sunday after being shot in the head by two  young men who police said confronted him at a pay phone in Pacoima.  </P> <P> Police said Ricardo Olivares, who has no gang connections, stopped with several  friends at the corner of Laurel Canyon and Brand boulevards to buy gas about  12:45 a.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> While his friends pumped gas and bought snacks at the convenience store,  Olivares walked to a nearby phone booth, police said.  </P> <P> Two young men, believed to be gang members, confronted him and a fight broke  out, police said. One of the men pulled out a handgun and fired several shots,  police said. The attackers fled and have not been found.  </P> <P> Family members and friends waiting outside Olivares' room in the intensive care  unit Sunday described him as a friendly, hard-working young man who was in the  wrong place at the wrong time. One friend called the attack "an atrocity."  </P> <P> As a student at San Fernando High School, Olivares served as vice president of  the student body and once was named student of the month. He was accepted last  year for admission at UC Berkeley and Stanford, as well as UCLA, according to  family members. He chose UCLA because it was close to home.  </P> <P> "He is a model person," Olivares' brother Victor said.  </P></p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Arts: The Artifice - Theatre Susanna Centlivre (c 1667-1723) was one of the first women playwrights. She was also the most prolific and popular of either sex in the early part of the 18th century, a period which included Congreve, Farquhar and Wycherley. She continued to be a box office success with such plays as The Busy Body and The Wonder until well into the reign of Queen Victoria. In the present century she has been forgotten, except as a curiosity. There is much to be curious about. She probably came from Lincolnshire, attended Cambridge dressed as a boy, and then became a strolling player. Somewhere she must have picked up French, for the French influence in her works is very strong. One of her husbands (she may have had three altogether) was killed in a duel. The last was Joseph Centlivre, who occupied a senior place in the Queen's kitchen, just below the level of master cook. Alexander Pope, who mocked Mrs Centlivre in 'The Dunciad', thus referred to her as the cook's wife. In politics she was a Whig and a Protestant. As a dramatist, her great merit was that she wrote parts that actors like David Garrick wanted to play again and again. So it is good to see her revived at the delightful Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond. There must be a question mark, however, over the choice of play. The Artifice is her last work. It ran only three nights at Drury Lane in 1722. John Wilson Bowyer, an American who wrote a book (1952) about Mrs Centlivre, says that it contains 'some of the worst elements of three dramatic schools - light manners, busy intrigues and sentimental reformation  -and is really a failure in all.' Wilson Bowyer did not understate. The Artifice has no central plot, only a number of subplots which do not relate to each other much. The common themes are marital infidelity and the pursuit of wealth and titles, but without the interweaving that you would find in a Congreve or a Sheridan. Still, Mrs Centlivre could certainly write. There is a pompous country gentleman called Mr Watchit, played here by David Timson, who is very jealous of his wife - and locks her up while he philanders. Louisa, a Dutch lady jilted by an Englishman, enjoys herself by pretending that she has poisoned him while they share a last embrace. She wins him in the end. Best of all is the ambitious Widow Heedless (Auriol Smith), worth Pounds 20,000, embittered by her first marriage and resolved not to marry again beneath the level of a lord. She succumbs to a captain of a regiment who was posing as her footman. Individually, these parts are sharply drawn. Others, like Sir Philip Moneylove who thinks that money is all that counts, are much flatter. The pity is that none of them fits together. But such shortcomings in the text are at least partially overcome by the infectious enthusiasm of the production by Sam Walters. The performances are better than the play, and this is a curiosity worth seeing. Orange Tree, Richmond until March 27. (081) 940 3633</p>

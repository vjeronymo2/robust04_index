			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Angolan Government is claiming major military  successes in its war against the UNITA [National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola] rebels. For several weeks now,  UNITA has been putting increasing pressure on towns, such as  Malanje and Kuito. Aid flights have been badly interrupted and  civilians have suffered badly in the sieges. But now the  government claims there has been a turnaround and that the UNITA  tide is being pushed back. It says all the UNITA forces in Kuito  have been driven out of the city. Robin White asked our Luanda  correspondent, Chris Simpson, if he could confirm that.    [Simpson] It seems to be born out by independent sources as  well. The government have been gaining the upper hand. We  understand they now control the road between Kuito and Kunje,  four miles to the north. So, that is quite an important  territorial victory, if that is proven to be correct.    [White] How much of Kuito is left standing?    [Simpson] It is difficult to know but I think it is very  clear from those people who were based there previously that the  last round of fighting has been particularly intense. When I  was last in Kuito in February, it was a very battered city.  Virtually every building was covered in bullet holes and one  fears that the intensity of the recent fighting would have  reduced it even more [words indistinct]. What people used to  say when you talk to them there was how they thought it should  be turned into a war museum. It wasn't a proper place to live at  all, and I am sure they will feel that now as well.    [White] How important is Kuito?    [Simpson] Well, it is very much seen by UNITA as part of its  heartland. What they always tell you is that Jonas Savimbi went  to school there. They won an overwhelming victory in the  elections there in 1992. It is very much part of their  constituency, their heartland. What may alarm UNITA is that if  the government recaptures or gains complete control of the  airport that could have serious implications that the government  could use the airport to strike out at UNITA positions around.  I mean, UNITA still controls a vast wave of territory around  Kuito, pretty much the whole of the Province of Bie.    [White] You think UNITA can get back [word indistinct]?    [Simpson] Well, in this war, there are very few clear-cut  victories and the government may be sounding rather bullish at  the moment talking about an important victory, but it is very  much a [words indistinct] changes around quite rapidly. I am  sure UNITA is capable of striking at government positions  elsewhere in the country. They have certainly been putting a  lot of pressure on N'Dalatando [words indistinct] and I  certainly think it is certainly premature to talk about the  government having firm control of Kuito for a foreseeable future  even.</p>

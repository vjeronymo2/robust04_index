			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Balaguer cites 'intrusion' President Joaqun Balaguer of the Dominican Republic has attacked what he called 'foreign intrusion' in the country's domestic affairs, following renewed US criticism of the conduct of the election which kept him in power, Canute James reports from Kingston. Speaking on Tuesday, at his inauguration for a seventh term, the president echoed statements by government officials that some countries, mainly the US, were becoming too involved in the politics of the Caribbean country, and were intent on unifying it with Haiti. Both countries share the island of Hispaniola. His statement followed the publication of a letter from Ms Donna Hrinak, US ambassador to the Dominican Republic, which was sent to the country's electoral board. She suggested an investigation of the May 16 election. Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, who was deemed to have lost the presidency narrowly to Mr Balaguer, has been supported by foreign observers of the election, and by the US government, in his charges that the elections were tainted.</p>

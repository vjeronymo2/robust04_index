			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Wanted: revenue, electricity and IMF deal - Jose Galang on a Philippines economy of deficits, 'brown-outs' and loan delay fears NEARLY a year after a surge in optimism that followed an orderly transfer of political power, the Philippine economy appears headed for hard times again. Gross National Product growth in the first three months of the year, according to preliminary government estimates, was only 0.9 per cent, down from the 2.2 per cent rise in the same period last year. The slight rise was registered only with the help of the sustained inflows of foreign exchange from the 2m Filipinos working abroad, according to government data. Without a dramatic improvement in the power supply, which was blamed for a nearly 3 per cent contraction in industrial activity during the first quarter compared with the first quarter of the previous year, the GNP growth target of 3.5 per cent this year is unlikely to be met. The Philippines Chamber of Commerce and Industry is forecasting between 2 and 2.5 per cent. Mr Cielito Habito, the socio-economic planning secretary, recently insisted that the growth goal could still be achieved. It will, however, require some harsh policy measures to raise government revenues. A number of tax proposals are being held up in Congress, putting under a cloud funding for government infrastructure projects designed to perk up domestic demand. Congress begins a two-month recess tomorrow, although President Fidel Ramos has called for a special session to consider the tax bills. One is aimed at introducing quarterly collection of value added tax instead of annual and a second seeks an excise tax system on cigarettes and beer. Both bills are aimed at improving revenue collection. Mr Habito has indicated that if Congress fails to pass the bills, the government may again have to impose an import levy and possibly also raise tax rates on fuel products. The last time the government imposed an import levy - in 1990, also because of stalled tax bills in Congress - the local manufacturing sector, which remains import-dependent, suffered a slump. Government revenues at the end of April were nearly 14 per cent below target, with the shortfall of 13.7bn pesos (Pounds 338m) leaving little room for manoeuvre for the rest of the year. The shortfall may have already put in jeopardy the Philippines' negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a medium-term programme. The country is seeking Dollars 800m under an IMF extended fund facility to support its 'growth-oriented' programme over the next three years. Previous programmes involved austerity-type bailing out or stabilisation measures. The one being sought now places the emphasis on export-led growth and capital spending on infrastructure projects. The negotiations, deadlocked over IMF concerns about Manila's ability to raise targeted revenues, now seems certain to be delayed until September, not least because Mr Ramon del Rosario, Mr Ramos's finance secretary nominee, has just been rejected by the congressional commission on appointments. Some commission members charged that Mr del Rosario had 'always followed the IMF'. Several leaders in the legislature have over the past few years been critical of the big budgetary allocations for repayment of debts incurred mostly during the administration of the late Mr Ferdinand Marcos, deposed in 1986. The family of Mr del Rosario, a former banker, has also been accused by his critics of benefiting from certain policies implemented by the Ramos government. Another reason why the IMF negotiations are likely to be delayed is that Mr Jose Cuisia, the central bank governor, confirmed this week that he would be retiring at the end of June. However, this week Congress passed a law, as required if the IMF deal is to be concluded, replacing the central bank with a new Singapore-style central monetary authority which will be more independent and relieved of its present responsibility for financing the fiscal deficit. Should the Philippines fail to secure the IMF programme, which would have followed the last 18-month standby facility that expired last March, the country may have to go to its commercial bank creditors for new financing. It will also have to pay up some Dollars 1bn in official credits, which would be likely to pull down its international reserves, now at some Dollars 6bn. Meanwhile, energy officials acknowledge that the end to the debilitating power cuts may not come before December, despite the commissioning of six gas-turbine plants in the second and third quarters of the year. Commercial establishments and residential areas in metropolitan Manila and the rest of the main Luzon island currently take turns being hit by power cut-offs, or 'brown-outs', of about six to eight hours a day. The brown-outs have scared away potential investors to the Philippines, according to diplomats. While the improved political conditions and the on-going economic reforms appeared to have gained the interest of some foreign investors, many would rather wait until the power-shortage problem has been resolved.</p>

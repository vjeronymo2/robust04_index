			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> LEWIS MAY MISS GOODWILL GAMES  </P> <P> Carl Lewis said today that he will not try to "bully my way" into the 1990  Goodwill Games, despite a ruling that excludes those who don't compete in next  year's national outdoor championships.  </P> <P> The rule was passed by the International Competition Committee of The Athletics  Congress. The Goodwill Games are in Seattle July 20-Aug. 5.  </P> <P> "If they want me to be there, I'll be there. If not, I won't be there," said  Lewis, a six-time Olympic medalist.  </P> <P> Lewis boycotted this year's championships in his hometown of Houston because of  "ideological differences" with TAC, the national governing body for the sport.  </P> <P> He said he does not plan to compete in the 1990 national championships, to be  held in California in June, because he will not be prepared to run until July.  </P></p>

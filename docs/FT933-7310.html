			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / W European car sales 'to slide': Decline forecast to outstrip fall which followed first oil crisis THE decline in new car sales in west Europe this year will be steeper than during the recession following the first oil crisis in the early 1970s, according to the latest forecast by DRI, the UK-based automotive analysts. West European new car sales are forecast to fall by 16 per cent this year to 11.3m, from 13.5m in 1992. The outlook for next year is also gloomy, with sales in the region predicted to rise by only 2.9 per cent to 11.66m, with the expected further small declines in Germany and Italy offset by modest increases in demand in the UK, France and Spain. West European car production is set to fall by 2m vehicles or 15 per cent this year to 11.4m, from 13.4m in 1992, says the DRI report. Output is unlikely to regain the 1989 peak of 13.7m until 1996, with the start of stronger recovery delayed until 1995. The UK is an exception, however. Output is being boosted by development of three Japanese car plants established by Nissan, Toyota and Honda. UK car production is forecast to rise from 1.3m in 1992 to a record 2.1m in 1998. According to DRI, Toyota is expected in 1996 to add a second model range, the Toyota Corolla small family car, at its Pounds 700m UK plant. It forecasts that Toyota car output in the UK will rise from 37,000 units this year, the first year of production, to 273,000 by the late 1990s. Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, Toyota president, said in June the group was considering production of a second model range in the UK. By 1998 Japanese car production in the UK is expected to reach 800,000 units a year - accounting for about 37 per cent of British car output and allowing the UK to move from fifth to third place in the European production league, ahead of Spain and Italy. In addition to the steep recession in west Europe, new car sales are falling in Japan, where the DRI report forecasts a 6 per cent drop this year to 4.19m units, an unprecedented third successive annual decline from the peak of 5.1m in 1990. The declining demand in west Europe and Japan means new car sales worldwide are expected to contract by 3 per cent to 33.02m this year, the second significant decline in the last three years. New car sales worldwide totalled 34.05m last year after peaking at 35.01m in 1990. Sales fell by 3.3 per cent in1991. However, global sales are forecast to recover from these setbacks next year with a 5.4 per cent rise to 34.8m. Continuing steady growth is expected to take worldwide new car sales to 41.3m by 1998. Much of the growth next year is forecast to come from North America, Asia and east Europe. Car sales are already recovering in North America, with an increase of 4 per cent to 9.55m this year expected to be followed by a further rise of 6.1 per cent in 1994. The strongest growth worldwide is expected to come from outside the leading car-consuming regions of west Europe, North America and Japan, however. The DRI forecasts a 21 per cent increase in global car demand from 1992 to 1998, with most growth coming from South Korea, China, Thailand, Latin America and east Europe. New car sales in China more than doubled in 1992 to 321,000, from 145,000 in 1991. Sales are expected to triple to 1.05m by 1998. A similar development is forecast for Thailand, with sales jumping to 540,000 by 1998 from 121,000 last year and 66,000 in 1991. The Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan) is also expected to be the main focus for growth in world car production for the rest of the 1990s.

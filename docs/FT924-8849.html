			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Bronfmans battle to restore market confidence THE industrial, property and financial services empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family is battling to shore up investor confidence following a sharp decline in share prices of companies within the group. Several Bronfman companies as well as their main banker issued a barrage of denials on Friday to counter rumours that they are in severe financial difficulty. The slump in the share prices complicates efforts by at least one Bronfman company, the financial services group Royal Trust, to raise new equity. Royal Trust's share price tumbled more than a third on the Toronto stock exchange last week after the company announced a large third-quarter writedown. Royal Trust also said its board had approved a CDollars 200m (Pounds 99.5m) equity issue. Royal Trust shares closed at CDollars 2.87 on Friday, down from more than CDollars 9 last January. Among the Bronfmans' holding companies, the share price of Brascan fell CDollars 1.38 on Friday to CDollars 16.25. Edper Enterprises lost 35 cents to CDollars 4.50. The latest nervousness stems partly from difficulties at Royal Trust and Bramalea, a property developer. Bramalea, whose share price has sunk this year from more than CDollars 5 to 41 cents, has warned it might file for bankruptcy protection if creditors fail to approve debt-restructuring proposals. Pressure on the Bronfman shares is said to have come from short-sellers in the US. A Bronfman group spokesman also linked the rumours to recent developments among other families which dominate much of Canadian business. Property and property finance markets have been unsettled since the collapse last May of Olympia &amp; York, controlled by the Reichmanns. Last Thursday, the Thomson family, controlling shareholders of Thomson Corp, the international travel and publishing group, said it had raised CDollars 545m by selling a large chunk of its stake in Hudson's Bay Co, Canada's biggest department store group. The businesses controlled by brothers Peter and Edward Bronfman are estimated to account for between 5 per cent and 15 per cent of the total market capitalisation of the Toronto stock exchange. The 'Toronto Bronfmans' are cousins of the family which controls Seagram, the international drinks company. The businesses of the two branches are separate. Hees International, the Bronfmans' merchant banking arm, said the group knew of no material developments not already disclosed. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said rumours it had withdrawn lines of credit to the Bronfman group were 'totally unfounded'.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: GrandMet in Pounds 84m bid for Scottish distillery - Move with Robertson &amp; Baxter ends active week GRAND Metropolitan ended a week of hyperactivity yesterday by combining with Robertson &amp; Baxter, one of Scotland's largest private companies, in a recommended offer for North British Distillery which values the Edinburgh-based grain whisky distiller at Pounds 84m. GrandMet's move follows the appointment of Mr George Bull as chief executive, the restructuring of its North American food and eyecare businesses, the sale of its Chef &amp; Brewer pubs, and the acquisition of Glen Ellen wines in the US, all within the last seven days. The offer is being made through Lothian Distillers, a new company jointly owned by IDV, GrandMet's drinks division, and R&amp;B. The partners already hold 38 per cent of North British and together buy 60 per cent of its output. Its grain whisky is used in blending IDV's J&amp;B brand, and for Famous Grouse and Cutty Sark, which R&amp;B blends respectively for Highland Distilleries, one of its shareholders, and Berry Bros &amp; Rudd. Mr James Bruxner, chairman of J&amp;B, said yesterday: 'This joint venture is the best means of safeguarding the long term viability of North British in a highly competitive market.' The move would ensure continuity of supply for the partners' brands and enable North British to develop as a supplier to the rest of the Scotch whisky industry, he said. North British, established last century by a consortium of wholesale whisky merchants, has 600 shareholders. They are being offered Pounds 9 cash for each share, including a special dividend of Pounds 3, or Pounds 6 in 7 per cent loan notes plus the dividend. The company, which accounts for about 12.5 per cent of the industry's capacity, last year made profits of Pounds 9.8m on sales of Pounds 31.3m. Grain whisky prices have been under pressure because of surplus stocks in the industry and production generally has been cut back. Guinness closed the smallest of its three grain distilleries, at Cambus, earlier this year.</p>

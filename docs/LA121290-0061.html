			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWSUIT SEEKS REMOVAL OF HANUKKAH MENORAH;  </P> <P> HOLIDAY: AMERICAN JEWISH CONGRESS SAYS 28-FOOT DISPLAY IN BEVERLY HILLS PARK  VIOLATES CONSTITUTIONAL SEPARATION OF RELIGION AND STATE. BACKERS CLAIM IT IS  SYMBOLICALLY SIMILAR TO PRESENCE OF A CHRISTMAS TREE.  </P> <P> The American Jewish Congress and four Jewish residents of Beverly Hills have  filed a federal civil rights suit against the city of Beverly Hills in an  effort to force the removal of a 28-foot Hanukkah menorah from a municipal park  bordering Santa Monica Boulevard.  </P> <P> The large candelabra was installed by Chabad, a Brooklyn-based movement of  Hasidic Jews, which has sought for years to obtain the same prominence in  public places for the Hanukkah symbol as is given to Christmas trees.  </P> <P> But Carol Plotkin, associate director for the American Jewish Congress' local  office, said her group believes minority rights are best served by barring all  such objects.  </P> <P> "There are plenty of opportunities to put up creches or menorahs or any other  religious object on private property. Government should be free of any  religious objects," she said.  </P> <P> The suit was filed Monday, the day the menorah was installed. The menorah is a  symbol of the eight-day Hanukkah holiday, which celebrates the rededication of  the temple in Jerusalem after a victory over foreign occupiers 2,100 years ago.  The holiday began Tuesday evening.  </P> <P> It is marked by the exchange of gifts, the eating of traditional foods and the  lighting of candles in menorahs, one for each night until all eight candles are  in place. The Chabad menorah is scheduled to be lit at a celebration on Sunday  that is expected to draw 2,000 people.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills City Atty. Greg Stepanicich defended the city's approval of the  Chabad menorah, saying that state and federal courts have allowed holiday  displays if they make a larger statement about "cultural diversity and  pluralism."  </P> <P> "In our case, we do have a lighted Christmas tree, a lighted 'Seasons  Greetings' sign, and now we've allowed the menorah as part of that overall  holiday message," Stepanicich said. The city also pays for lighted signs  showing carolers and other traditional Christmas figures over main streets in  the Beverly Hills business district, he said.  </P> <P> Stepanicich noted that in a landmark case last year, the U.S. Supreme Court  allowed the display of a menorah and a Christmas tree side by side in the entry  of a county building in Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> But Plotkin said that because of its size and prominence, the Beverly Hills  menorah amounts to a "stand-alone display" during the day. The Christmas tree  and the "Seasons Greetings" sign are far less visible except when lit at night.  </P> <P> Rabbi Boruch Shlomo Cunin, West Coast director for Chabad, was out of town and  not available for comment.  </P> <P> Marshall B. Grossman, Chabad's attorney, said that the electrified carolers in  the commercial district are "out-and-out Christmas decorations and nobody  objects to that, but when it comes to a menorah that attracts thousands of  people in the celebration of this season, the American Jewish Congregation  yells foul."  </P> <P> In their suit, which was filed with the help of the American Civil Liberties  Union, the plaintiffs charged that the city violated the 1st Amendment's ban on  the official establishment of religion.  </P> <P> Specifically, they said, the City Council -- all five members of which are  Jewish -- was wrong when it voted earlier this year to allow the display of  "any and all" religious symbols on public land.  </P> <P> Mayor Allan L. Alexander declined to comment on the suit, but he said that the  decision had proven so controversial that the City Council plans to reopen the  question at a public hearing in January.  </P> <P> In addition to the American Jewish Congress, a civil rights organization  claiming 4,000 members locally and 50,000 nationwide, the plaintiffs are Eve  Slaff, widow of former Beverly Hills Mayor George Slaff, Alan Sieroty, a former  state assemblyman and state senator, and Devera Lurie Waldman and Charles  Waldman.  </P> <P> All four live in Beverly Hills and they pass the site of the menorah  frequently, the suit said.  </P> <P> "I'm opposed to using public grounds for that purpose," Slaff said. "My  husband, George, before he died was very active on this particular issue, so  I'm carrying on his position."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPEAR FINANCIAL CHASING SUCCESS IN SMALL PARCELS  </P> <P> Charles M. Spear was recently at a party when a woman approached him and asked  if he was the man who runs Spear Financial Services in Glendale, a small  discount stock brokerage that also sells annuities and other insurance  products.  </P> <P> Spear, chairman of the company, confirmed that he was. Then the woman told him  that her husband had invested his life savings in Spear Financial's stock at $6  a share. Today, the stock sells for $3.  </P> <P> "She said she thought it might be good for me to look her in the eye," Spear  recalled. "I haven't done very much for them."  </P> <P> It's not wise investment strategy to put your life savings into any one stock,  and Spear surely would like to see Spear Financial's stock go higher -- he owns  about 8% of the shares himself. But Spear, a stocky, 46-year-old Cleveland  native, makes no apologies for his company's performance.  </P> <P> After starting the firm in 1983, he built Spear Financial's revenues to $14.1  million by 1987, when the company earned $1.7 million. But in the aftermath of  the 1987 stock market crash, when small investors were scared away, Spear's  sales were knocked down to $11.5 million in 1988, producing a $1.1-million  loss. Now the company is again profitable and Spear predicts that its sales  will climb to $20 million this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 25,000 Active Accounts  </P> <P> Still, few would confuse the bearded Spear with that other Charles of discount  brokerage, Charles Schwab, whose Charles Schwab Corp. is the nation's biggest  discount broker. Schwab maintains 1.2 million active accounts versus 25,000 at  Spear, has 2,200 employees to Spear's 200 and revenue in 1988 that totaled $392  million.  </P> <P> Schwab also spent nearly $12 million on advertising last year to draw more  clients; Spear spent about $500,000. But Spear isn't convinced that advertising  is as cost-effective in getting new customers as simply buying other brokerages  with established customers. To keep growing, Spear has gone shopping, buying  even tinier discount firms in California -- such as Chris Harris Securities,  First Los Angeles Discount Securities and Kall &amp; Co. -- often at prices of  less than $100,000.  </P> <P> What makes Spear's brokerage services stand out? "I don't have anything  special," he said. Spear Financial tries to offer strong service, he said, but  then all companies try to do that. His minimum commission on a stock trade is  $38, just under Schwab's $39. But Quick &amp; Reilly, another discounter, has a  $35 minimum, and Kennedy, Cabot &amp; Co. in Beverly Hills charges just $20 on  some trades.  </P> <P> But Spear does not see brokerage services as his key to success. Selling  insurance-related investments and other financial products, such as mutual  funds, through banks and savings and loans is where Spear sees his future  growth.  </P> <P> Some banks and S &amp; Ls can sell annuities and other insurance products  directly, but often they simply refer customers, in exchange for a fee, to  another firm that specializes in such products. Spear owns just such a firm,  James Mitchell &amp; Co., which he purchased a year ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assumed, Paid Debt  </P> <P> In the Mitchell deal, Spear assumed or paid off $2.2 million of Mitchell's  debt, and will pay Mitchell himself a yet-to-be decided amount of Spear stock  based on Mitchell's performance. (Spear said Mitchell likely will end up owning  a bigger stake in the company than he does.)  </P> <P> The annuities that Mitchell sells are issued by an insurance company, which  then pays a fee to Mitchell. Mitchell in turn splits its fee with the bank or S  &amp; L. Mitchell and the financial institution can each earn a few hundred  dollars for each transaction, depending on the size of the annuity or other  investment sold.  </P> <P> Annuities are contracts in which a person makes an up-front lump payment with a  guarantee of receiving payments in the future, usually at retirement. Yields  earned by the annuity in the meantime are typically tax-deferred.  </P> <P> The insurance business provides higher profit margins (about 15 cents per sales  dollar before taxes) than a discount brokerage and has stronger growth  prospects, Spear said. For example, last year, Mitchell had pretax earnings of  $333,000 while Spear's brokerage business had a pretax loss of $1.85 million.  And in the first six months of this year, Mitchell accounted for $5.6 million,  or 55%, of Spear Financial's $10.1 million in total revenue, which yielded a  modest overall net profit of $43,569 for the company.  </P> <P> Spear figures that the discount brokerage business will usually show a profit,  but the Mitchell insurance business "will outpace the growth of anything else  I've got around here."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Move Praised  </P> <P> Spear director Donald Weeden, who led the fight for deregulating brokerage  commissions in the mid-1970s, praised Spear's move into insurance because it is  tied to banks and S &amp; Ls. Those institutions are likely to be more  deregulated in the coming decade, which will prompt them to look for new  investment products to sell.  </P> <P> "More and more banks will want to get into that business and will find Jim  Mitchell is probably as good as any vehicle," Weeden said.  </P> <P> Spear also is in the specialist business on the Pacific Stock Exchange. Three  years ago, he bought four specialist seats. A specialist is the person who  actually handles trades and keeps an orderly market in certain stocks on the  floor of an exchange.  </P> <P> Spear's approach does have its critics. J. Anthony Forstmann, a former Spear  Financial director and general partner of the money-management firm  Forstmann-Leff Associates in New York, complained last year that Spear could  probably make more money as an investment banking firm, which services big  institutional customers. And because Forstmann held nearly 16% of Spear  Financial's stock, his unhappiness worried Spear.  </P> <P> Forstmann did not return telephone calls requesting comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Friendly Buyer  </P> <P> Forstmann finally bailed out by asking Spear to sell his stock. Spear last  month found a friendly buyer in Keystone Provident Life Insurance, a provider  of many of Mitchell's products, which paid the then-market price of $2.375 a  share, or $2.6 million.  </P> <P> Spear's foray into insurance was in keeping with his reputation for trying  different tactics within financial services -- even though they don't always  work.  </P> <P> Spear formed his company to offer brokerage services only to investors with  personal computers, enabling them to trade electronically, and was one of the  first to do so. The business grew very slowly -- prompting Spear to become a  traditional discount broker for investors with or without computers -- but now  Schwab, Fidelity Investments and other big investment firms offer the same  computer service.  </P> <P> In 1985, Spear also introduced a service enabling individual investors to trade  certain stocks 24 hours a day. Such off-exchange "third-market" trading is  mainly reserved for large institutional investors. But the New York Stock  Exchange soon forced Spear to abandon his service, and Spear acknowledged that  it drew few customers anyway.  </P> <P> "It's a very innovative firm," said Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president of  Charles Schwab Corp., although Spear "doesn't affect what we're trying to do."  </P> <P> Spear earned a business degree from Ohio University and a law degree from Case  Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1968. He went to work for First  National Bank of Chicago, ostensibly as a lawyer, but eventually became its  head trader of stocks and bonds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bolster Performance  </P> <P> In 1981, two partners of Trust Co. of the West brought Spear to Los Angeles to  bolster its investment performance, then Spear decided to open his own firm two  years later.  </P> <P> He started by merging his firm with an obscure, publicly held shell company  whose stock was worthless. Then he sold stock to investors for $2 a share, or  $3 million. The stock quickly jumped as high as $8.75 a share, even though  Spear wouldn't earn his first profit until 1986.  </P> <P> With his stock again in the $2 range, the question is whether Spear's firm will  become a takeover target. Just as Spear grew by acquisition, firms such as  Schwab have lately added customers by purchasing smaller brokerages. Quick  &amp; Reilly, for instance, recently agreed to buy OvestMarine from Marine  Midland Banks.  </P> <P> But Spear said his firm is not for sale and claimed that his two biggest  stockholders -- Keystone Provident and Sanyo Securities of Japan, which  together own about 35% of the stock -- would support him in battling an  unwelcome bid.  </P> <P> Truth be told, they would have a responsibility to consider an attractive offer  regardless of their fondness for Spear. But Spear said that "if somebody tried  it, I'd fight like crazy."  </P></p>

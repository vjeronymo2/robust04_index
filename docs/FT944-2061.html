			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Let's not talk turkey this year - Cookery Cooks who have cooked more Christmas turkeys than they care to remember often dream about, and may even plan on, serving something different on December 25. But when it comes to the crunch the conservative will of the family nearly always wins. Ah well. Console yourself with the thought that if you give in and stick to the inevitable bird and all its trimmings that large family gatherings seem to expect and demand, at least the Christmas day mood in your household will be more peaceable than in those in which novelty has been forced on the natives. It is only when small groups of like-minded adults join forces, and children and grandparents are notably absent, that alternative Christmas celebrations stand any real chance of coming to happy fruition. For those who have managed to escape the year-in year-out routine, here are some celebratory suggestions that centre on seafood rather than poultry. Those committed to the same old Christmas menu as usual might like to save these ideas for January dinner parties. DOVER SOLE WITH OYSTERS AND MUSHROOMS Three good size Dover soles are enough to serve four people as a main course, or six as a first course, but as this is Christmas I would use four fish. Ask the fishmonger to skin and fillet them for you and bring home all the trimmings - essential flavourings for the sauce. 4 fine plump Dover soles; 1 1/2 dozen oysters; 4-6 oz chestnut mushrooms; 1/2 pt double cream; 2 tablespoons Noilly Prat; half a lemon; 2 tbsp chopped parsley. Simmer the fish trimmings and mushroom stalks in 1 1/2 pt water for half an hour. Strain and reduce to  3/4 pt to concentrate flavour. Just  1/2 pt is needed for this dish. Save the remaining  1/4 pt for another day (you could use it, for example, to make the scallop and squash ravioli recipe given below). Boil the Noilly Prat until reduced by half, mix it with  1/2 pt of the stock, season lightly and reserve. Slice the mushrooms, put them into a small saucepan with the cream, some sea salt and a grinding of pepper. Half-cover and bring very slowly to simmering point. Remove the lid and simmer for about 10 minutes until the liquid is somewhat reduced and sticky. Stir occasionally during this time to prevent a skin from forming. Set aside. Shuck the oysters. Lay the sole fillets in a buttered gratin dish and pour the oyster juices over them. Add a grinding of pepper and a squeeze of lemon and lay butter paper over the top. (Everything up to this stage can be done ahead.) Cook the fish on a pre-heated baking sheet in the oven at 375'F-400'F (190'C-200'C) gas mark 5-6 for 5-6 minutes. Transfer the fish carefully to a warmed serving dish and keep hot while you finish the sauce. Boil the sole cooking liquor for a minute or two and gently reheat the mushroom cream. Add the first to the second and bring back to simmering point. Continue simmering briefly if needs be to achieve good consistency. Chop the oysters roughly and slip them into the pan. Stir to immerse them, then quickly cover with the lid and turn out the flame but leave the pan where it is for 5 minutes. That way the oysters will heat through without danger of toughening. When time is up, check seasoning, spoon the creamy mixture over the fish and sprinkle lightly with parsley - like a green backbone down the centre of the dish. SCALLOP AND SQUASH RAVIOLI Decorative and flavoursome, this will serve six as a not-too-substantial main course. To make more of a meal of it add extra scallops or large raw prawns freshly grilled. If possible enlist a pair of helping hands for the final stage of cooking so one of you can sear the scallops while the other deals with the pasta, then both can assemble the dish. 10 fine scallops; 1 butternut squash; 8 sheets lasagne, home-made or bought (fresh not dried); 1 oz sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained and cut into snippets; 2-3 table-spoons toasted pinenuts; a bunch of basil; 1 generous teaspoon finely chopped ginger root; 1 generous teaspoon coriander seed, freshly toasted in a dry frying pan and reduced to a powder; 2 garlic cloves and 1 onion, both finely chopped; 4 fl oz richly flavoured fish stock; 4 fl oz freshly squeezed orange juice and the finely grated zest of 1 orange; 4 tablespoons olive oil; 3 oz butter. Halve and seed the squash and steam it for 10-12 minutes until tender. Blot dry, peel and quarter the flesh. Cut most of it into  1/4 inch thick slices. Dice the rest finely. Cover and reserve. Clean the scallops, gently separate the corals from the whites and slice each white across into two or three discs depending on the plumpness of the cushion. Set aside. Sweat the onion for 10 minutes in the oil in a heavy-based pan with a well fitting lid. Add the garlic and ginger and sweat for 10 minutes more. Cut the pasta into large ravioli squares and prepare the other ingredients as described in the ingredients list. (Everything up to this stage can be done ahead.) Add 1 oz butter to the onion pan. When it has melted and the mixture is hot stir in the coriander and sun-dried tomatoes. Add the orange juice, zest and squash. Cover tightly and cook over a minimal flame for about 15 minutes until everything is well heated through. Shake and stir the contents of the pan once or twice and season with salt and pepper after the first five minutes. When ready, lift most of the solids out of the pan with a slotted spoon (leaving some of the diced squash, onion and flavourings behind with the liquid) and keep them hot in a covered dish in a low oven. Add the stock to the pan and the remaining 2 oz butter cut into dice. Let the mixture bubble up and blend to make a rich sauce and check seasoning. Meanwhile, cook and drain the pasta and sear the scallops in batches in a hot saute pan barely filmed with oil. Scallops need only to glance at the heat; turn and remove them in the order in which you added them to the pan, and keep them hot with the squash. Finally, to assemble the open ravioli, lay some of the pasta squares on a warmed serving dish. Spoon some of the filling over them, sprinkle with freshly torn basil leaves, cover with more pasta squares and pour on some of the sauce. Add extra layers in the same way, ending with the last of the sauce. Scatter with the pine-nuts and strew with basil for the sake of its colour and sweet peppery bite.</p>

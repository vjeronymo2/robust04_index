			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 26 April  issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Material, Human Support for Chinese Muslims Urged    2. Support for al-Azhar To Combat Religious Illiteracy    3. Refresher Course Held for Mosque Imams    4. New Course for Islamic World Imams and Preachers  <H5>  MATERIAL, HUMAN SUPPORT FOR CHINESE MUSLIMS URGED </H5>   In a 350-word column on page one, 'AQIDATI's board chairman  Samir Rajab reports on his recent visit to China. He says he  noticed this time that some of the Muslims there were more  optimistic and hopeful regarding the future. He wonders whether  the economic open-door policy in China has been extended to  cover religious affairs as well.    After noting that this was a good sign, he says: "Frankly,  unless the Islamic states act effectively over all this vast far  region, the Muslims will lose some of the ground they have won."  He warns that "we must support these temporary gains with our  material and human resources."  <H5>  SUPPORT FOR AL-AZHAR TO COMBAT RELIGIOUS ILLITERACY </H5>   In a 100-word report on page two, Nadiyah al-Sayyid writes  that the Specialized National Councils [SNC] under Dr.  'Abd-al-Qadir Hatim have called for the need to place all the  necessary resources at the disposal of al-Azhar so it can  shoulder its responsibilities on the issues of the call and  fatwa. This can be done by reviving the senior ulema committee  or by reinforcing the effectiveness of the Islamic Research  Institute, emphasizing its role in combating religious  illiteracy and publicizing Islam's views on issues affecting  modern society. "The arena must not be left free to incorrect  interpretations by religious extremists." The SNC recommends  that the Awqaf Ministry supervise publicly funded and built  mosques and provide them with specialized preachers who can give  correct religious education to the youths to steer them away  from extremist ideologies. The SNC also recommends that  consideration be given to limiting Friday prayers to major  mosques "to avoid wrong interpretations and endeavors by Islamic  extremists."  <H5>  REFRESHER COURSE HELD FOR MOSQUE IMAMS </H5>   In an unattributed 250-word report on page two, the paper  writes that Awqaf Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub and Deputy  al-Azhar Rector Shaykh Sayyid Sa'ud have distributed  certificates to 50 imams and scholars who attended a course for  mosque imams from the governorates of Suez, Port Said, Ismailia,  and Sinai. Dr. Mahjub explained that the course is considered  "a big step to assist the scholars in discussing the current  issues with the youths." The experiment will be extended to all  governorates.  <H5>  NEW COURSE FOR ISLAMIC WORLD IMAMS AND PREACHERS </H5>   A 75-word report on page three says that the 25th course for  Islamic world imams and preachers organized by al-Azhar will  begin on 1 May. The course will be attended by 30 imams and  preachers from Uzbekistan, Moscow, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Zaire,  Liberia, and South Africa.</p>

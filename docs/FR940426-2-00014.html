In May 6, 1993 decision, the Binational Panel remanded to the International Trade Administration on several grounds. In the December 17, 1993 decision, the three-person majority ordered Commerce to find certain programs non-specific and to find the stumpage subsidies non-market distorting. This finding effectively required Commerce to determine that neither program represents a countervailable subsidy. The NAFTA Secretariat has assigned file number ECC&hyph;94&hyph;1904&hyph;01USA to this Request. Copies of the Request and the Panel decision are available from the NAFTA Secretariat. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> James R.

When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel is established to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether it conforms with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Article 1904.13 of the Agreement, where a Party alleges that a binational panel has seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, has manifestly exceeded its powers, authority or jurisdiction or that a member of the panel has materially violated the Code of Conduct established pursuant to Article 1910, and further alleges that any of these actions have materially affected the panel's decision and threaten the integrity of the panel review process, that Party may request that an Extraordinary Challenge Committee be established under the procedure set out in Annex 1904.13 of the Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Annex 1904.13 of the Agreement, the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada established Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Extraordinary Challenge Committees (``ECC Rules''). These ECC Rules were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53222). These Rules were amended in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 8, 1994 (59 FR 5910). The ECC Rules give effect to the provisions of Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement with respect to Extraordinary Challenge Committee proceedings conducted pursuant to Article 1904 of the Agreement. The ECC Rules are intended to result in decisions typically within 30 days after the establishment of the Extraordinary Challenge Committee. The Extraordinary Challenge Committee proceeding in this matter will be conducted in accordance with these ECC Rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

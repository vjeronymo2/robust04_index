			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Estonian President Lennart Meri who Monday [9 May]  night hosted a reception to honour Poland's President Lech  Walesa and Mrs. Danuta Walesa said the countries shared a bitter  experience brought about by the 1939 pact between Nazi Germany  and communist Soviet Union and later agreements between the  allies and had the responsibility before Europe to avoid history  repeating itself.    "The historic experience of our people and us both springs  up  from the same soil: both reborn Poland and reborn Estonia are  the children of Munich, the Hitler-Stalin pact, Tehran and  Yalta," Meri said.    Meri said that this experience obliges the countries to  think  and act for Europe even if Europe neglects or does not know how  to look into the past in order to understand the future. "Our  experience must become European conscience," Meri said.    Meri said that the paradox in Western democracy lies in the  fact that it cannot defend itself before it is too late although  democracy cannot ever be fatally late, but the price to be paid  later must be paid with blood and suffering.    Meri also touched upon Estonian-Russian relations saying  Russia must show in action that it has cut through its ties with  the defunct Soviet Union and that it is looking for its place in  the world respecting the principles of international law.    "Estonia cannot put up with the recent situation where one  UN  member country threatens another UN member country with military  measures in order to achieve political goals," Meri said on  referring to a statement made on Friday by the Russian Defence  Minister, Pavel Grachev, on considering increasing its military  presence in Estonia if it felt the rights of ethnic Russians  were not protected.    Estonia remains the only Baltic state with whom Russia has  no  formal agreement on troop withdrawal.    President Lennart Meri on Saturday interrupted his visit to  Portugal to return to Estonia and discuss the situation. On  Monday, he asked Russia's ambassador Aleksandr Trofimov to  explain the statement of his Defence Minister.</p>

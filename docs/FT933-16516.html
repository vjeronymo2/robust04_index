			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Spain and France cut intervention rates FRANCE and Spain yesterday moved quickly to take advantage of Thursday's German Bundesbank rate cuts, by cutting their key intervention rates by 0.25 percentage points. The key Bank of France rate was cut from 7 to 6.75 per cent, the same level as its German counterpart, while the Bank of Spain rate fell from 11.25 to 11 per cent. The Bank of France also reduced its short-term lending facility, the 5 to 10 day rate, by 0.25 percentage points, from 8 per cent to 7.75 per cent. French official short-term rates last month fell below their German equivalent for the first time in 26 years. The French government is gambling that the steady reductions in interest rates will stimulate the recession-struck economy. The Balladur administration is also aware that lower rates could be an important catalyst for its ambitious privatisation plans by encouraging savers to move their cash into shares. But the Spanish cut is unlikely to provide immediate economic relief, as evidence mounts that the country is in the grip of possibly its worst recession in 25 years. Figures published by the government earlier this week suggested that gross domestic product shrank by 1.1 per cent in the first quarter of the year. Overall, investment fell 8.9 per cent, internal demand fell 2.1 per cent and consumption stagnated.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, jan. 28 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Friday [28 January] he has received "unofficial"  notice on a German-proposed meeting in February of finance  ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven (G-7)  industrialized nations. A concrete schedule, including the date  and place, is "now under arrangement," and "I would like to  attend if my schedule allows," Fujii told reporters after a  morning cabinet meeting.    Germany has reportedly proposed the G-7 meeting on February  26 in Frankfurt to discuss world economy and aid to Russia.    Meanwhile, Fujii reiterated the timetable is yet not set for  the adoption of a new economic stimulus package and the budget  compilation, saying, "I don't have any fresh factors to comment  on." But he also repeated the government wants to set the  package and the third fiscal 1993 budget before Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa meets U.S. President Bill Clinton in  Washington on February 11.    "As I have been saying, we must create an environment" in  which Hosokawa can explain Japan's economic policies "in view of  international society," Fujii said.    Asked about the economic impact from delayed stimulus  measures, Fujii said the government will "certainly" take the  measures as promised to the public and will also "certainly"  form the third extra budget to finance the measures. He noted  that a delay in the writing of the fiscal 1994 budget will  undermine the economy "psychologically," but "in terms of real  demand, the third budget is "more effective."    Concerning U.S. hopes of Japan including an income tax cut  as  the key measure, he said, "I can't fully comment on that yet.    Fujii said he would "carefully watch" the currency market,  referring to the yen's appreciation to the 108 level against the  dollar on speculation over U.S. pressure on Japan ahead of the  summit. "But there are no rapid movements yet" in the  dollar-yen rate, he said.    Fujii brushed aside reports that a policy-making committee  of  the coalition parties is inclined to separate a consumption tax  hike from the tax cut, and he stressed that a decision on the  tax issue will be left to a joint economic forum of the  government and coalition parties.    The Finance Ministry is insisting that the tax cut and hike  be included in a single program to ensure a financial source for  cutting income taxes before hiking the consumption tax.</p>

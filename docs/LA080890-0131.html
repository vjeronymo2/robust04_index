			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> DAVID SILLS TO HEAD 4TH COURT OF APPEAL  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge David G. Sills, a former mayor of Irvine, was appointed by  Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday to the prestigious post of presiding justice  of the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Sills' appointment to the state appellate court is subject to confirmation by  the Commission on Judicial Appointments. No date has been set yet for that  hearing. If confirmed, Sills would replace Harmon G. Scoville, who retired from  the presiding justice's position April 1.  </P> <P> "It's a great choice," said Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald E.  Smallwood. "He has a marvelous ability to motivate people and get the best from  those around him. He's a hard worker with a good mind and a great sense of  humor."  </P> <P> Sills, 52, was tapped to take the helm of Division 3 of the 4th District Court  of Appeal, which reviews the civil and criminal decisions of Orange County  Superior Court. Division 3 is the busiest appellate court panel in the state,  generating about 1,000 decisions each year.  </P> <P> Other divisions of the 4th District sit in San Diego and San Bernardino.  </P> <P> Sills, an Irvine resident who has been on the Superior Court for five years,  said he was "very excited" by the appointment and looked forward to the  challenge. State appellate justices serve 12-year terms.  </P> <P> Thomas F. Crosby Jr., an associate justice on the 4th District Court of Appeal,  said he and his three fellow justices welcomed the appointment. Crosby said he  and his colleagues were impressed with Sills when he filled in as an appeals  justice for a few months in late 1988 and early 1989.  </P> <P> During that time, Sills wrote two published opinions which are now "landmarks  in their fields," Crosby said. In one, the court held that it was illegal for  Santa Ana police to strike, and in another, the panel decided that the city of  Stanton had illegally tried to zone an adult bookstore out of business.  </P> <P> "I thought it showed both sides of him, because here was one traditionally  conservative decision, which prevented a strike by police, and also a liberal  one, defending the rights of an adult bookstore," Crosby said. "I think it  showed good balance on his part."  </P> <P> Sills was an Irvine city councilman from 1976 to 1985, and served as mayor for  four of those years, presiding over Irvine's initial development boom. He  challenged Nolan Frizelle (R-Huntington Beach) in the GOP primary for state  Assembly in 1982 but lost.  </P> <P> A graduate of Bradley University in Peoria, Ill., and the University of  Illinois law school, Sills maintained a private law practice in Newport Beach  and in Orange for 20 years, specializing in business litigation, before  Deukmejian appointed him to the Superior Court in 1985.  </P> <P> For most of his time in Superior Court, Sills has handled civil cases, and he  has spent the last year assigned to complex litigation, including the sprawling  investors' dispute that stemmed from the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp;  Loan.  </P> <P> Sills is Ronald Reagan's former son-in-law, having been married to Maureen  Reagan from 1964 to 1967, when Reagan was governor of California. Sills'  current wife, Susan, is in public relations.CATHERINE GEWERTZ  </P></p>

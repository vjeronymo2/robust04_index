			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Arts: Sellars kills off Aeschylus - The Edinburgh Festival You may not believe it on the evidence of this production, but The Persians is a very powerful anti-war play. First performed in 472 BC, it went back to the Athenian victory over the Persians eight years earlier. Many of the members of the first audience must have fought in the war as, it is claimed, did Aeschylus himself. Apart from being a strong-structured piece in its own right, the play is remarkable for its sympathetic attitude to the Persians. There is no Athenian triumphalism and the horrors of war are shown from the losing Persian side. There are some similarities with the recent war in the Gulf, although not as many as the director, Peter Sellars, pretends. For example, the Persians in 480 BC must have had reasonable expectation of winning. In the Gulf War only a fanatic could have thought that Iraq could stand up to the air power of the US and its coalition of forces. It was a different kind of contest. Where Sellars is on stronger ground in pursuing analogies is that Xerxes, the Persian leader, survived despite the loss of many of his troops. A parallel with Saddam Hussein is thus not far-fetched and there is certainly nothing wrong with seeking to give ancient plays a modern edge. The key question is whether the deliberate insertion of modernity sharpens or blunts the message. We can safely assume, I think, that any audience going to see The Persians is going to be fairly intelligent, capable of drawing its own comparisons between warfare past and present and probably enjoying reflecting on immutability. From an ideal production of The Persians - namely the original play - an audience would come away marvelling at the wisdom and foresight of Aeschylus. From the Edinburgh production the temptation, to which I fully succumb, is to curse the perversity and tricksiness of Sellars. It does not add to the pathos periodically to introduce the sound of American aircraft bombing Baghdad, nor does it help to have the characters speaking through microphones as a symbol of the way the war in the Gulf was covered by CNN. It is Aeschylus who has been killed. There are other defects. The original has a strong chorus and a powerful part for the messenger who brings the bad news. Neither have much prominence here, yet they are surely central to the play, the chorus for its comments and the messenger for his graphic description of the Persian losses. Again, the original gives some striking lines to the ghost of Darius, father of Xerxes. Here the ghost is dressed in a long white nightgown and communicates in deaf and dumb language with the words coming through a microphone offstage: they are not all the words of Aeschylus. The production, intended as the opening theatrical showpiece of the Festival, runs at the Royal Lyceum for the rest of this week. ***** The only reservation about the Red Shift company's production of Death In Venice is how far it will make sense if you are unfamiliar with the story. Thomas Mann's masterly short novel has already been turned into a movie by Visconti and an opera by Benjamin Britten. A stage version, however, is an even bigger challenge because of the need for greater dialogue. The novel depends heavily on the writing style and the imagination. Red Shift pulls it off by preserving what dialogue there is and distributing the narrative text among the characters. Members of the cast play several roles without the panoply of a full change in costume. At the same time, there is one central character, Gustave von Aschenbach, the Mann-like figure who goes to Venice, becomes infatuated with a young boy whom he scarcely dares approach, and then dies of cholera. Aschenbach is played by Michael Sheldon who captures the loneliness of the well-known writer whose very success makes him feel cut off from the rest of society. Sheldon does it with exquisite delicacy, never lapsing into sentimentality. The company also has a distinctive style with sets: spare, but suggestive and functional. Three panels of dark and light blue are enough to show the sea and the sky outside Venice. Columns open up to allow a hotel reception desk and an altar to descend with the minimum of fuss. Jonathan Holloway directs, the design is by David Roger. The production plays at the Assembly Rooms throughout the Festival before a spell at the Lyric Studio in Hammersmith, then a nation-wide tour. It is sponsored Di Saronno Amaretto.</p>

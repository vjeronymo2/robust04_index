			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Observer: Abracadabra How humiliating. The World Trade Organisation invited photographers to turn up on December 31, to capture the birth of the world's most powerful trade body - and not a single hack accepted. So earlier this week Peter Sutherland, the WTO's caretaker, tried a different tactic. Journalists assembled at a convenient hour, Sutherland took down the Gatt name plate outside the Geneva HQ and replaced it with the WTO's. Champagne corks popped; the historic moment was snapped. Then a lowly official took down the WTO plate and replaced it with the Gatt sign pro tem. Not the best augury for the new dynamic organisation.</p>

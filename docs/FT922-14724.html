			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Books: Christianity and Jews JUDAISM by Hans Kung SCM Press Pounds 35, 753 pages THE CRUCIFIED JEW by Dan Cohn-Sherbok HarperCollins Pounds 17.95, 258 pages HANS KUNG has set himself the ambitious but almost certainly impossible task of reconciling the three great faiths which claim descent from Abraham: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. His slogan is, 'no peace among the nations without peace among the religions; no peace among the religions without dialogue between the religions; no dialogue between the religions without investigation of the foundation of the religions.' This book is the opening of the campaign: it is the first in a trilogy of investigations, the others will deal with Islam and Christianity. Kung aims to discuss the history and theology of Judaism, the Jewish-Christian and Jewish-Muslim relationships, the Holocaust, and the founding and future of Israel. There is much that is fascinating in this massive study, particularly Kung's synoptic view of Judaism's evolution from its disparate originating theologies and tribal traditions. In this regard the fact that Kung has an outsider's view enhances rather than detracts. Some of the historical judgments invite dispute. Kung dates Christian anti-semitism to the 11th century, when a rumour swept Europe that the Jews had warned Sultan al-Hakim of Egypt that the Christians would conquer his empire unless he destroyed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. In the resulting Crusades, Jew and Moslem were together perceived as enemies, Kung says, making inevitable the anti-Jewish Constitutions of Pope Innocent III. But Christian anti-semitism is far older than this; Kung seems to forget Augustine's Tract Against the Jews and other Patristic attacks, and takes barely any note of the anti-semitism in the New Testament itself. On these topics Dan Cohn-Sherbok's account is more persuasive and complete. When it comes to the Holocaust, Kung's analysis is unblinking. Neither the importance nor the horror of the event can be underestimated, he argues, but nor can it be detached from its historical context and treated as an 'absolute', for it lies squarely in the framework of German and human history, and can only be understood in terms of it. Cohn-Sherbok agrees with this view. But Kung argues also that Jewish politicians and thinkers should resist the temptation to use the Holocaust as a premiss in all contemporary arguments, especially in connection with current Middle Eastern questions, because without a fresh beginning based on reconciliation there can be no prospect for peace. In his different, less didactic but angrier account of anti-semitism through history, Cohn-Sherbok paints a bleak, troubling portrait of inhumanity and suffering, a portrait in which few escape the shame of prejudice - even those Enlightenment heroes, such as Voltaire, whom one would dearly wish to see otherwise. Both practising and nominal Christians too conveniently ignore this side of their history. Cohn-Sherbok claims that the Holocaust was inevitable because of the long history of anti-semitism which preceded it, beginning in pagan times and gathering force as Christianity's dominance grew. There is no doubt that anti-semitism is the blackest aspect of Christianity's anyway dismal record, and it is only because there is such a tradition that it was so frighteningly easy for the Nazis first to scapegoat the Jews and later nearly to succeed in their hideous 'Final Solution'. But judgments of inevitability are hard to assess; too much else conspired to make Hitler possible. Some of what he says is utterly convincing: anti-semitism is resurfacing in Europe, and his book is timely, because it warns that if we do not see clearly, and resist strongly, there is no saying where the revivals of nationalism, racism and anti-semitism might end. Both books are required reading. At least two of Kung's aims might be achieved if they were widely read: an increase of understanding of Judaism among non-Jews, and a resolve to forbid a terrible chapter of history repeating itself.</p>

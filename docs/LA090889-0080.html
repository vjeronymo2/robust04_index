			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUNFIRE IN S.F. BANK KILLS 1, WOUNDS 2  </P> <P> Two masked men trying to hold up an armored car opened fire inside Bank of  America's world headquarters Thursday, killing one guard and wounding a second  guard and a bystander before fleeing on bicycles, police said.  </P> <P> The Brink's guards had just dropped off $5,500 in cash at the bank about 10  a.m. when they were confronted by the gunmen, whose faces were concealed by ski  masks, in the concourse between Bank of America's world headquarters and its  Montgomery Street branch, police said.  </P> <P> The gunmen opened fire, hitting the two guards and a bystander who ran to help.  The gunmen then grabbed a pouch and envelopes, homicide Inspector Whitey  Guinther said.  </P> <P> Police said the guards were carrying travelers' checks, securities and bonds,  some of which might be convertible to cash, but had no money on them.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Officer Dave Ambrose said the two gunmen escaped on bicycles  resembling mountain bikes along the narrow streets and sidewalks of the city's  bustling financial district.  </P> <P> The gunmen were described as white males with muscular builds, wearing blue  jackets and blue jeans. One gunman was at least 6 feet, 2 inches tall, weighing  about 200 pounds, in his early 30s. The second gunman was smaller, in his 20s,  witnesses said.  </P></p>

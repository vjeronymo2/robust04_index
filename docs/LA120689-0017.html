			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE CUTS FORCE 140 LAYOFFS AT TRW'S SAN DIEGO DIVISION  </P> <P> Beginning early next year, 140 employees at TRW's San Diego-based Military  Electronics &amp; Avionics Division will be laid off because of a drop in  defense electronics contracts, according to a company spokesman.  </P> <P> Almost 15% of the 950 employees at the division's Carmel Mountain facility and  10% of the unit's total staff of 1,400 will be affected by the layoff, TRW  spokesman Tim Dolan said.  </P> <P> He said about 60 local employees received notice of the planned layoff Friday,  and the rest will receive official notice between Jan. 1 and April 30. No  layoffs are planned at any of the division's other offices, he said.  </P> <P> Dolan attributed the layoffs "to the cyclical nature of the procurement process  rather than the defense cutbacks that everyone is focusing on."  </P> <P> "We have a number of critical programs in the demonstration and validation  phase, and those are winding down in 1989. In 1990, we plan to compete  vigorously for those full-scale development contracts.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, we have to cycle down pending the award of full-scale  production contracts, he said."  </P></p>

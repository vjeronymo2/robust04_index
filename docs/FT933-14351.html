			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Hurd hints at Croatia sanctions MR Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday hinted that the EC could decide as soon as next Monday to implement sanctions against Croatia. The time had come for the EC to 'consider economic measures' against the Croatians, he told members of parliament, write David Owen in London and Laura Silber in Belgrade. Mr Hurd said he thought there was a 'strong case' for having a Moslem 'contingent' among UN troops stationed in Bosnia. He believed, however, that Iran would not be a 'suitable candidate' for providing such troops. Nato yesterday agreed that US, French, British and Dutch strike aircraft could start protecting UN forces in Bosnia, including those in Moslem safe areas, from next week. A meeting of the alliance's ambassadors decided the mission could start from July 22 but left any decision on timing to the UN. The mainly Moslem Bosnian army yesterday appeared to strike back from the air for the first time in the 16-month war in Bosnia when three aircraft dropped bombs on Serb-held targets. If yesterday's incident is confirmed, it would be a violation of the no-fly zone in force over the whole of Bosnia since last October. Tanjug, the Serb news agency, said three aircraft bombarded Serb-held positions near Olovo in central Bosnia. In a bid to raise Dollars 200m, the mininum amount needed to keep the relief operation going, Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to discuss to the plight of 380,000 people trapped in the Bosnian capital.</p>

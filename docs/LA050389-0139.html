Though she has little facial expression, she has smiled, they  said.  </P> <P> "She has been emerging gradually over the last couple of days or three days,"  said Dr. Robert S. Kurtz. "We would still say . . . she is in a delirium.  People in this stage will fluctuate."  </P> <P> Six teen-agers have been indicted on charges of attempted murder, rape, sodomy  and assault in the April 19 attack.  </P></p>

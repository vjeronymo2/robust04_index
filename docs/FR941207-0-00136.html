			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 102. We will extend availability of installment payments to all entrepreneurs' block licensees, regardless of gross revenues. A key factor to the overall success of the entrepreneurs' blocks is the installment payment plan. The installment plan was established to facilitate the entry of small and minority-owned businesses into the broadband PCS market. The top 50 BTAs will be the most competitive wireless communications markets in the country and will require inordinately large amounts of capital. It will be extremely challenging for any entrepreneurs' block participant to compete in these markets. The installment plans will greatly enhance the ability of all entrepreneurs' block participants to raise capital to succeed against major, well-capitalized competitors. As Vanguard points out, disallowing installment payments to large entrepreneurs' block winners of small BTAs unfairly restricts these companies from competing for markets in which they will have a logical interest. In addition, the larger entrepreneurs would be forced to pay for BTAs on the same terms as major companies that do not qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks. While we accept these arguments, and therefore extend installment payments to all entrepreneur's block licensees, we note that the terms of these payments should be less generous than those extended to smaller companies, less able to access traditional sources of capital. Therefore, we will require entrepreneurs with gross revenues exceeding $75 million to make a post-auction down payment equaling ten percent of their winning bids, but then pay the remaining 90 percent of the auction price in installments with interest charges to be fixed at the time of licensing at a rate equal to that for ten-year U.S. Treasury obligations plus 3.5 percent, with payments on both interest and principal required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 103. We decline to reduce or eliminate interest rates entirely because we believe that the present approach achieves the proper balance among our regulatory objectives. In particular, our present tailoring of interest rates to the needs of the designated entity enables licenses to be disseminated to small businesses and furthers the congressional goal of allowing taxpayers to reap a portion of the value of the licenses. Reducing or eliminating interest payments could result in very high bids, which could reduce competition and promote defaults among entrepreneurs. Such an approach could also encourage speculation instead of legitimate applicants who can attract capital. On our own motion, however we will amend 47 C.F.R. &sect;24.711 to permit small businesses owned by minorities and/or women to make interest-only payments for six years from the date of license grant. Under our current rules, principal payments start to come due at the same time the entrepreneur is permitted to transfer the license and immediately following the first, build-out requirement. By deferring payment of principal an additional year, we intend to assist the designated entity in avoiding an unwanted sale of business at the five-year mark in order to avoid payment of principal. Finally, for the reasons discussed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> we believe that our existing requirements for broadband PCS auction applicants adequately measure an applicant's ability to pay. <FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>  We therefore decline to impose more stringent requirements to determine whether an applicant can meet the terms of an installment payment plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 60 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> FCC 94&hyph;246, at &para;45. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rural Telephone Company Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 104. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the Commission established several provisions to help rural telephone companies become meaningful participants in the emerging PCS market. In that proceeding, we defined a rural telephone company as a local exchange carrier having 100,000 or fewer access lines, including all affiliates. In departing from the more restrictive definition adopted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the Commission stated that the revised definition strikes an appropriate balance by facilitating the rapid deployment of broadband PCS to rural areas, without giving benefits to large companies that do not require special assistance. Qualified rural telephone companies are eligible for broadband PCS licenses through a partitioning system, which permits rural telephone companies to obtain licenses that are geographically partitioned from larger PCS service areas. These companies will be permitted to acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses in any frequency block in two ways: (l) they may form bidding consortia consisting entirely of rural telephone companies to participate in the auctions, and then partition the licenses won among consortia participants; and (2) they may acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses from other licensees through private negotiation and agreement either before or after the auction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 105. Under our rules, if a rural telephone company receives a partitioned license from another PCS licensee in a post-auction transaction, the partitioned area must be reasonably related to the rural telephone company's wireline service area that lies within the PCS service area. We recognized in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that rural telephone companies will require some flexibility in fashioning areas in which they will receive partitioned licenses, so we did not adopt a strict rule concerning the reasonableness of the partitioned area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 106. Petitioners variously request the Commission modify our rural telephone company provisions. Century Telephone Enterprises, Inc. (Century) and Citizens Utilities Company (Citizens) argue that the rural telephone company definition adopted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is overly restrictive and excludes local exchange carriers that exceed the access line standard but nevertheless serve predominantly rural areas. Alternatively, Citizens requests the Commission implement waiver procedures. In addition, Hicks and Ragland and TEC urge the Commission to eliminate its partitioned service area limitations, stating that the present rules unnecessarily impede the ability of a rural telephone company to provide service in a technically and economically feasible manner. Finally, MEANS/SDN and TEC contend the rural telephone companies should be afforded the same benefits as other designated entities, including outside passive investment in rural telephone company consortia and bidding credits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 107. We generally will retain the rural telephone company provisions adopted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We remain convinced that our definition of rural telephone company, which reflects the views of numerous parties to this proceeding, will ensure that broadband PCS will be deployed rapidly to rural areas. At the same time, it is narrowly tailored to exclude large local exchange carriers that do not require special treatment. We observe that we can entertain and grant a waiver request if a local exchange carrier that does not satisfy our rural telephone company definition can meet our waiver standard set forth in Section 24.819 of the Commission's Rules to warrant qualifying the LEC for a partitioned broadband PCS license.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 47 CFR &sect;24.819. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

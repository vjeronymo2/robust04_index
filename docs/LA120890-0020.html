			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAUMA CARE AT COUNTY-USC MEDICAL CENTER  </P> <P> Apart from containing several errors, the report ignores some important facts.  Firstly, the Department of Emergency Medicine provides attending staff coverage  24 hours a day, seven days a week.  </P> <P> The attending emergency physician is board certified with up to 15 years  experience in resuscitation. Since this physician is ultimately responsible for  all medical care delivered in the Emergency Department and is the most  experienced physician on scene, he has to have the authority to determine the  initial treatment of emergency cases. The surgical care is determined by the  most senior surgery resident on the scene.  </P> <P> Secondly, the report suggests that "turf battles" have resulted in poor patient  outcomes. In the six years I have spent in the medical center, I can honestly  say that I have never seen or heard of any patient dying in the Emergency  Department because of a "turf battle."  </P> <P> Additionally, I think it is important to point out that the majority of trauma  patients in the U.S. are not initially treated in "trauma centers." In fact  most states do not have specifically designated trauma centers. Patients are  stabilized initially by emergency physicians.  </P> <P> Although emergency medicine is a relatively new medical specialty, residency  training programs have been in existence for almost 20 years and board  certification has existed for 10 years (not one year as stated in the article).  To scrap a system which works well on the basis of the ACS surveyor's report  would be unjust.  </P> <P> EDWARD NEWTON, MD  </P> <P> Director of Residency Training  </P> <P> Department of Emergency Medicine  </P> <P> County-USC Medical Center  </P></p>

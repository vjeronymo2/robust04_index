He said he  checked 115 cartridges collected in the area of the Cave of the  Patriarchs, where the massacre took place -- 89 had been fired  from the Glilon rifle belonging to Barukh Goldstein; 5 had come  from soldiers' weapons; and one was fired by an unidentified  gun. Nadivi said also that he found no indication of grenade  explosions. Several Arab witnesses who were in the cave at the  time testified they heard explosions of the type associated with  a grenade."    Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 4 April  reports that "in today's proceedings police ballistics experts  said one of the bullets found on the scene did not belong to the  gun of Barukh Goldstein but remains unidentified."

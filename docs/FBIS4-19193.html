			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MAR: "Rwandan Crisis: Belgian Prime </F> Minister Dehaene Categorically Denies Rwandan Accusations"]    [Text] Brussels, 12 Apr (BELGA) -- Belgian Prime Minister  Jean-Luc Dehaene on Tuesday evening [12 April] categorically  denied on RTBF [French-language Belgian Radio and Television]  news the accusations leveled by the Rwandan Foreign and  Cooperation Ministry, which questioned the actions of the UN  troops guarding Kigali airport at the time the plane carrying  Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana was destroyed.    In a memo dated 11 April and addressed to the UN mission in  Rwanda (UNAMIR), the Rwandan Ministry questioned the  "inexplicable failures on the part of the UN troops charged with  the security of Gregoire Kayibanda airport and its environs,  failures that made it possible for the criminals to shoot down  the presidential aircraft."    Another part of the memo criticized the "active  participation  of certain UNAMIR elements in Rwandan Patriotic Front operations  against the Rwandan Army."    In reply, Mr. Dehaene said: "These accusations are  completely unfounded. The Belgian UN troops did their job and  did it correctly."    In his reply, Mr. Dehaene also wondered about the  representativeness of the current, self-proclaimed "government"  of Rwanda.    The prime minister pointed out that the circumstances  surrounding the death of President Habyarimana would only become  clear if an investigation were launched by the international  community.    However, without wanting to prejudice the results of the  inquiry, Mr. Dehaene said: "It does, however, now seem likely  that the attack came from inside Rwanda."</p>

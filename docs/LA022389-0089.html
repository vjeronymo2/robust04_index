			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSEUM PLAN FOR LANTERMAN HOUSE OKD BY LA CANADA  </P> <P> After months of deliberation, the La Canada Flintridge City Council voted  Tuesday night to use the historic Lanterman House as a museum, cultural center  and organ recital facility.  </P> <P> The council approved the plan in a 4-0 vote despite homeowners objections that  converting the 74-year-old Craftsman-style mansion into a museum would increase  traffic and lower the value of their homes.  </P> <P> "We've listened well," Councilman Warren Hillgren told the homeowners. "The  Planning Commission has listened to concerns of neighbors and set up conditions  that I think will give you reasonable protection. It's a worn-out expression  saying 'Trust us,' but that's what you have to do."  </P> <P> Homeowner representatives later threatened legal action to block the plan, but  city staff members said they believe that it meets all zoning requirements.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Debated for a Year  </P> <P> More than a year of debate over the future of the Lanterman House culminated in  a public hearing last week at which some residents praised the museum plan.  However, those near the house, in an upscale neighborhood north of Foothill  Boulevard, protested vehemently.  </P> <P> The council postponed a vote when opponents questioned the legality of a  conditional-use permit for the project and the adequacy of an environmental  impact report.  </P> <P> An attorney representing homeowners near the Lanterman House said at the  hearing that the proposal was inconsistent with the city's general plan and  zoning codes, and that the environmental report did not sufficiently examine  alternatives.  </P> <P> "The council must apply the letter and rule of the law," attorney William D.  Ross said. "And there are very technical and substantive provisions that must  be followed. The opponents are questioning what can be called the 'trust me'  approach."  </P> <P> But city officials said Tuesday that the environmental report adequately  examined alternatives and that the permit was consistent with the general plan.  </P> <P> Community Development Director Bill Campbell said conditions placed into the  proposal by the Planning Commission will protect the neighborhood. The  conditions would control the hours the facility is open and the number of  visitors.  </P> <P> In the first of two actions, the council voted 4 to 1 to certify the  environmental report. Councilman Ed Phelps voted no.  </P> <P> "We need to use the issues raised in the appeal as a road map to resolve this  controversy," Phelps said. "A lot of alternatives still need to be addressed  besides whether the EIR is adequate, which, quite frankly, I do not believe it  is."  </P> <P> In a second vote, the council approved the conditional-use permit adopted  earlier by the Planning Commission. Phelps, who owns a house near the Lanterman  estate, did not participate in discussion or voting on the permit because of a  possible conflict of interest.  </P> <P> "I could never vote to have that house destroyed," said Mayor Joan Feehan. "The  house is a real place for real people. I hate to think the history we're going  to leave our children is McDonald's and Jack in the Box."  </P> <P> Disgruntled homeowners near the Lanterman House said they plan to pursue the  issue in court.  </P> <P> "They're forcing us to litigate," said Wayne Collins, whose balcony overlooks  the house. "The points our attorney raised are valid points, and they failed to  address any of them."  </P> <P> The house on Encinas Drive has been the subject of public debate since the  death of Lloyd Lanterman in 1987. Lanterman, the last survivor of the family  that founded La Canada Flintridge, willed his home to the city several years  ago with the stipulation that it be used for civic or community purposes.  </P> <P> After Lanterman's death, the council considered using the house as a city hall  and cultural center, but those plans were shelved after strong objections from  homeowners. Then the proposal was made to convert the estate into a museum,  cultural center and organ recital hall.  </P> <P> Last year, the city received a $500,000 grant from the state's Historic  Preservation Grant Program for restoration of the house as a museum.  </P> <P> City officials did not say when work would begin.  </P></p>

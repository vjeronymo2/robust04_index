			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (8): Supervision reinforced - 'The wild west days of Polish banking are over,' says bank chief The president of the National Bank of Poland, Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, turned up in parliament late on a Friday night last month to tell a packed Sejm that four state-owned banks were having problems. A further 15 private banks and 229 out of 1,600 co-operative banks were threatened with liquidation or facing collapse, she added. Her warning was greeted calmly, without any sign of a run on the banks by anxious depositors in the days that followed. But why did she run the risk? 'Sorting out the problems of the banking sector requires a clear political decision. That's why I went to parliament to explain the situation,' she explains. She hastens to add that 'the wild west days of Polish banking are over' now that the central bank has reinforced its supervisory powers. But she feels the need for wider political understanding of the need to recapitalise several of the largest banks and support a consolidation of the banking system. Ms Waltz told parliament that Bank Handlowy, the foreign trade bank, was the only one among 15 state-owned banks to produce 'good results' last year. All nine of the commercial banks hived off from the BNP five years ago at the start of bank reforms were also in reasonable shape, she added, partly because seven have been partially recapitalised from state funds. Two of the original nine banks, Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK) and Bank Slaski (BS), have now been privatised and recapitalised through the sale of shares to private investors. The EBRD paid Dollars 12.7m for a 28.5 per cent stake in WBK a year ago while ING bank of the Netherlands paid Dollars 60m for its 25.9 per cent stake in Bank Slaski. The remaining seven banks are due for privatisation over the next two years. The emergence of nine privatised regional banks, with substantial foreign minority shareholders, will mark a big step forward in Polish banking. But Cesary Stypulkowski, the president of Bank Handlowy, the biggest and most consistently profitable Polish bank, argues that 15 medium-sized banks are too many for an economy Poland's size. 'Probably four or five stronger banks would be better,', he says. The whole banking sector, he argues, is undercapitalised. 'The total capitalisation of Polish banks, at around 40,000bn zloties, is equivalent to that of the 12th largest bank in Germany,' he notes. 'The Polish economy demands more than that.' Bank Handlowy, which has been transformed over the last three years from a foreign trade bank into a universal corporate bank, alone accounts for a quarter of the total capitalisation of the banking system. It is the only Polish bank which has managed to preserve the real value of its capital base, he says. It raised its provisions from 6.2bn zlotys in 1992 to 9bn zlotys last year after another year of sharply higher profits. Any future capital increase is most likely to come through a stock market flotation of new shares which would dilute the state shareholding and amount to partial privatisation. Meanwhile, the most difficult problem is how to deal with the 70 or so small and undercapitalised private banks which are the weakest part of the banking system, alongside the small rural co-operative banks. Both the government and the central bank are worried about the political fall-out of small bank failures in rural areas. The NBP would like to persuade foreign banks to take over and absorb these smaller banks. But few are willing to accept such a poisoned chalice. Until now foreign banks, such as Citibank, have preferred to set up their own wholly-owned operations, or take stakes in larger, state-owned banks. The central bank also has plans for the 1,600 rural banks, of which more than 200 are in a shaky state. 'We would like to form nine or 10 competitive associations of small co-operative banks and then refinance the new associations,' Ms Waltz explains. Until now one of the main obstacles to the entry of foreign capital into the Polish banking system was the absence of a London Club deal. One benefit of the protracted negotiations, however, is that the 400 foreign banks involved in the outcome have been keeping close watch on Polish developments. Some are expected to seek entry to this fast growing market now that an agreement has been reached.</p>

Over the last two or three years, Marxists have dismissed  the  casteist challenge in Uttar Pradesh [U.P.] and Bihar as  class-based struggle. In light of India's history, which is more  applicable; class struggle or struggle for social justice? The  true nature of the communist-socialist struggle [in India] is  before us now. What will it be, caste or class? What will  laborers base their struggle on? Communists have rested content  that this question has been answered. Now they have had to come  back down onto the Maidan [open space in Calcutta where  processions are held] to deal with this dispute all over again.  Leftist theorists are going back to analysis and ledgers. They  are shaking the dust off of the books of Ram Manohar Lohiya  [communist intellectual].    Along with the casteist politics brought to U.P. by Kansi  Ram, Bihar's caste-based politics is also experiencing a wave.  There are indications of a joining of forces of Dalits and OBC's  [other backward castes]. The Yadavs have been holding  gatherings; also, the Vaishyas and Kurmis. The Telis, Dangis,  Rajputs, Chandras, Chamars, and Chaursiyas are about to do the  same. All in the name of caste! Now the Brahmins and Bhumihars  are beginning to organize. Leaders, both government and private  are attending these gatherings. These are not really political  gatherings but caste assemblages! The recent Kurmi assemblage in  Patna was very impressive and turned everyone's head. It was not  just a show either. Here BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], JD  [Janata Dal], Congress (I) and CPI [Communist Party-India]  leaders joined together, showing the force of the wind blowing  through northern India.    By attempting to swim against the casteism current, Marxists  are getting winded, just like BJP. They are both bewildered.  Recent political developments have served to remind Hindutva  advocates that there is no one basis or point on which to unite  Hindu society. BJP has had to deemphasize Ayodhya in Bihar as  they do not want to be known as a Brahmin or high-caste party.  In order to attract Dalit and Tribal votes, BJP has begun to  organize Raths [processions] based on their respective  traditions but without much success. The party is not too  optimistic over the Sita Ram Keshari case decided in the Supreme  Court.    Even if communist leaders are divided over the Mandal  Commission, they have accepted the U.P. vote as an awakening of  the Dalits. In a short time, two things have taken place; an  escalating rivalry between the Dalits and higher castes  (including OBC's) and Kansi Ram's jihad against communists. His  speeches are not mere rustic rhetoric either. The communists  have been hostile towards social justice for a long time. A long  time ago Lohiya wrote: "Let no one think that it is a matter of  fighting the higher castes. In class struggle, when the  capitalist system falls, caste problems will automatically  disappear. The curse of the caste system is sustained by  capitalism and class differences. Those who regard class  struggle as inevitable and strive for a classless society have  no regard for a caste-based society that thrives on differences."    Caste or class; this old socialist-communist dilemma has  been  stirred up again by Mulayam Singh, Kansi Ram, and Lalu Yadav.  Their cry for ``Social Justice'' has gradually spread over  northern India. It will undoubtedly be an important issue in the  next few elections. Economic issues have been downgraded in this  call for social justice. Leftists are seeing whether or not  these two issues can be combined. Senior CPI leader Chaturanan  Mishra confessed, "We refuse to answer this question. Communists  do not understand the necessity for agitation by lower castes."  CPM [Communist Party India-Marxist] leader Ganesh Sjankar  Vidyarthi also confessed, "Caste conflict has put our party in a  difficult position." CPI-ML [Communist Party-India  Marxist-Leninist] recently held a gathering in Patna called  ``Social Change''. CPI General Secretary Indrajit Gupta  confessed: "Just concentrating on class conflict will get us  nowhere. We need to focus on caste conflict."    The fall of the Soviet Union and China's about face  [economically] has forced India's communists to look within.  Domestically, while BJP's communal wave has subsided, the caste  wave is still rising. Communists are being forced to contemplate  the relevance of Marxist theory. CPI recently held a work  retreat in Hyderabad in which the focus was ``Caste's internal  workings and the question of social justice in India.'' A study  paper was published from this in which the folowing statement is  found: ``Caste-based politics began to escalate in the 1980's  due to lack of economic progress. Leftists have neglected social  and cultural issues. This is why caste politics have taken on a  social theme.'' The leftists, while doing some soul  searching, are still clinging to class struggle as the ultimate  explanation. They want to change caste-based politics into  class-based politics. Leftists are, of course, vey weak in  Hindi-speaking areas. Naxal leader Vinod Mishra fears this  declining influence and hopes to quickly break Dalit enchantment  with Kansi Ram: "In Varanasi, Yadavs have clashed with Harijans  and this will shake up BSP. Kansi Ram cannot solve problems  between backward castes and Harijans." Mishra feels unsure,  however, whether disillusionment with Kansi Ram will send  Harijans toward the leftists camp or toward BJP!    Two years ago, leftists united in Bihar in a land seizure  and  redistribution campaign. This desperate attempt to instigate  class struggle and elevate it over caste struggle was  directionless and leaders were divided on strategy. Lalu Prasad  refused to join hands with leftists despite threats and bribes.  Instead, his party often took the side of landowners. Kansi Ram  refused to go to Harijan slums. In fact, Harijans did not get  tickets to run for SP or BSP; businessmen did. All of these  facts challenge leftist class assertions. They are not very  strong in Hindi-speaking areas anyway. The new circumstances are  causing them to resort to soul searching. Will the communists in  India finally have to admit defeat?</p>

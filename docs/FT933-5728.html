			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Yeltsin tells rival he is sacked: Dismissal of vice-president Rutskoi raises constitutional doubts PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday ordered the sacking of his vice-president and most dangerous political challenger, in what his opponents have dubbed the opening of his 'September offensive' against his enemies. The attempt to dismiss Mr Alexander Rutskoi for alleged corruption appears to be unconstitutional and was declared so by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, leader of the anti-Yeltsin parliament. The sacking of the vice-president was 'balanced' by the dismissal of Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister and a Yeltsin ally. However, Mr Shumeiko announced later that he had been released from his duties at his own request Both dismissals were said to be 'temporary', and both derive from alleged misuse of state funds earmarked for essential imports, allegations about which have been traded freely between the two men. They come at a time when the political situation in Russia has deteriorated into a static confrontation between the various levels of authority - a situation which threatens to impede economic reform and continued financial assistance from the west. Though Mr Yeltsin has a history of avoiding decisive confrontations, the attempt to dismiss Mr Rutskoi pits him squarely against his opponents and may herald a new round in the struggle for power between president and parliament. Significantly, the move was made the day after Mr Yeltsin inspected the army's crack Tuman division near Moscow, units of which protected him during the abortive coup in August 1991. Both Mr Rutskoi and Mr Shumeiko are under investigation, although Mr Gennady Ponomaryev, Moscow public prosecutor, told a newspaper yesterday that 'we do not see a crime' in the evidence presented about Mr Rutskoi. The vice-president, speaking from northern Russia, said that 'this man (Yeltsin) has put himself above the fundamental laws of the constitution'. A statement from the presidential office said the dismissals had been made 'in connection with the harm mutual accusations of corruption by the two men bring to the state'. Mr Yeltsin justified his action on the constitution he has vowed to replace. But none of the clauses cited includes the right to sack his vice-president, who was elected with him in June 1991. The dubious constitutional validity of the decree sets Mr Yeltsin directly against a parliament which sees its main task as defending the existing, Soviet-era constitution. Mr Mikhail Mityukov, chairman of parliament's legislative committee, said: 'The president cannot deprive the vice-president of his status, since they were elected at the same time.' Mr Ilya Konstantinov, leader of the opposition National Salvation Front, said: 'This is obviously the first decision in a series of actions combined under the slogan of 'September offensive' which the president promised us.' Even Mr Andranik Migranyan, a presidential council member, said the news was 'completely unexpected' and admitted that 'perhaps he does not have the right to do it'.</p>

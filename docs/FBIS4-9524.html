			<p>BFN     [Text] Podgorica, 27 Apr (TANJUG) -- Montenegrin President  Momir Bulatovic announced today that a Greek consulate would  open in this Republic.    "In the course of a visit by Greek Minister of Foreign  Affairs Karolos Papoulias some time ago we accepted with  pleasure an offer by our guests to open a Greek consulate in  Montenegro," Bulatovic said, adding that according to what he  had learned, the Greek parliament has approved such a decision.    Replying to a question on the possibility of the opening of  the consulates of other countries in Montenegro, Bulatovic said  at a news conference that there was also interest in the opening  of an Albanian consulate. Unfortunately, he added, "because of  the current political situation, this idea has not yet reached  the phase of realization."    The Montenegrin president stressed that the foreign policy  orientation of the government and the leadership of this  republic is "to accept offers and set up a consular network",  which would also make the entire diplomatic communication of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia more efficient.</p>

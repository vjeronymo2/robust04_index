			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D. V. Lebedev, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences </F> Cybernetics Institute; UDC 629.7.05]    [Abstract] The Problem of Error Accumulation in dynamic  systems because of the effect of Internal Parametric  Perturbations is examined in this article. The obtained  estimates of the accumulated perturbations are used for  determining the frequency of attracting the sources of  ``extraneous'' information about the system motion in order to  reduce its sensitivity to the parameter variations. The  capacities of the proposed approach are illustrated by an  example of estimating the correction periodicity of an  platformles inertial navigational system located on an aircraft  flying along a great-circle-track. The aircraft dynamics are  described and the equations of a platformlessinertial navigation  system are derived. The sensitivity functions were computed by  the statistical testing method. Their mathematical expectation  as a function of the correction periodicity and the rms  deviations from these values are provided in tables. Tables 2,  references 6 Russian</p>

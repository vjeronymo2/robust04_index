			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulchin, North Kyongsang Province, May 31 (YONHAP)  -- Some 5,000 residents of Ulchin County, protesting government  plans to build a nuclear waste dump, staged violent  demonstrations Monday, blocking highway traffic, puncturing the  tires of passing cars and setting fire to them.    At least 60 people including several policemen were injured  when the protesters clashed with riot police during  demonstrations that followed a rally earlier in the day.    Police deployed 5,000 men and placed them at strategic  points  to bring the demonstrations under control. Some 25 residents  were taken into police custody for questioning, police said.    Meanwhile, 88 percent of the county's parents kept their  children at home, forcing them to boycott classes at three  middle and high schools in the area.    The rally was held at 1 PM in Ulchin town square to demand  the suspension of work on the third and fourth nuclear power  generating stations and the resignation of the science and  technology minister, in addition to expressing their opposition  to building the nuclear waste dump.</p>

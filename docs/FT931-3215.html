			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities The chancellor's proposed reform of the advanced corporation tax system looks like a can of worms for UK equities. By lowering the rate of ACT payable by companies on dividends, Mr Lamont will also reduce the credit recoverable by tax-exempt investment institutions from the Inland Revenue. That will reduce pension funds' income from UK equities by Pounds 1bn a year by 1995, when the ACT rate is lowered to 20 per cent. Since pension funds own a large slice of the UK equity market, lower share prices may result. High yield stocks could be hardest hit because their investment returns will fall the most. Fund managers might equally place a higher value on the gross investment income offered by gilts. There is also the thorny question of valuing the pension funds themselves: actuaries valuing equity holdings on the basis of anticipated dividend income may have little option but to break out the red ink. Companies which cannot offset ACT against their mainstream corporation tax should be the beneficiaries. BAT Industries, for example, which wrote off Pounds 96m surplus ACT last year, will have the option in future of paying its dividend out of a designated stream of overseas earnings. If a surplus arises, ACT can then be recovered from the Revenue. The snag is that such 'foreign income dividends' will be paid without a tax credit and are therefore worth 20 per cent less to a pension fund. The company could always increase its dividend by 20 per cent to compensate. But that can hardly be the outcome the chancellor intended.</p>

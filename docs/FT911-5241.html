			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / G7 meeting on post-war world economy THE PROSPECTS for the world economy after the Gulf war and the collapse of communism in eastern Europe were last night assessed in informal talks in London by finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. No substantive statements were made after the discussions which took place over an informal dinner at 11 Downing Street hosted by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. The UK Treasury said the ministers had 'very good and useful discussions on a wide range of subjects.' Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said afterwards: 'We have had a good meeting as always.' Although the ministers from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada left the meeting in good humour, it appeared that several contentious issues were raised in the discussions. On entering Number 11, Mr Waigel confirmed that he had come to London intent on raising the question of 'burden sharing'. This issue of how the big industrial countries should share the global economic costs of Middle East reconstruction after the Gulf war and the reconstruction of eastern Europe has become increasingly controversial in the G7. Germany believes it is getting insufficient recognition for its efforts to help eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. There was also evidence yesterday of tension between the US and Japan, which was believed to reflect US dissatisfaction with Japan's contribution to Gulf war costs. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese finance minister, described a longer than expected bilateral meeting with Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, earlier in the day as 'a friendly argument'.</p>

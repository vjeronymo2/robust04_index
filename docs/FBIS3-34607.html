It said that Arab rights can only be recovered in  full if the Arabs reinforce their solidarity and coordination to  close all doors to the infiltration attempts Israel is trying to  make through numerous channels. [passage omitted]    A Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that "what the  current stage requires most is coordination and a unified Arab  stance. Because Israel is not interested in peace and is  proposing ideas that have nothing to do with peace. It is also  embarking on actions aimed at hitting the peace process, namely  its attacks on the peaceful people in southern Lebanon. The  most recent of these attacks took place the day before  yesterday. It proves that what Israel is interested in is  implementing its plan to torpedo Arab solidarity, which is the  cornerstone of the Arab position's strength."    The official added that the Arabs must shoulder their  historic responsibility now, by not giving Israel the chance to  make its plan a success and control the region and its wealth.  He said that the Arab states are urgently pressed to move  forward with one view to achieve peace, which is in the  interests of Arab states and the region.    The official pointed out that Syria needs a clear and strong  Arab position, because it cannot backtrack on its basic  constants or accept compromises. And that Syria will continue  to work with everyone to achieve a just and comprehensive  settlement that guarantees the Arabs' rights. It declared its  position clearly, namely that there can be no solution, peace,  security, and stability while the land is still occupied. The  Syrian official said that Washington continues to stress through  the contacts conducted between it and Damascus the desire to  establish peace in the Middle East -- a peace that ends tension  and guarantees an atmosphere of stability that eliminates the  dangers threatening U.S. interests. This is why Israel is  resorting to evasions, because it is aware of this reality. It  is not working for the sake of ending tension and establishing  peace. In fact it is seeking to kindle new conflicts in order  to weaken the Arab position and the possibility of improving  relations between the United States and the Arab states.  [passage omitted]</p>

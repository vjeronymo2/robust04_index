			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Price barrier Mr Michael Mann, sales manager at Titan Forge Ltd in east London, was not surprised to hear that factory gate prices - the colloquial shorthand for Britain's producer prices index - rose at the slowest rate since 1968 in the year to July, Emma Tucker writes. The company, supplier of iron railings, balustrades and gates, has not been able to raise the prices of its factory gates for more than three years. 'Prices have been cut to the bone. Sometimes the amount we charge for work just covers the wages,' said Mr Mann. Sentiment is the same at Cornwell &amp; O'Neil, an industrial and domestic gate manufacturer in Greenwich, south-east London. Mr Roy Wilkinson, a partner, said prices at his company had not moved for at least two years. 'Raising prices? We're too frightened,' he said. 'The government needs to cut interest rates and let inflation go - why not?'</p>

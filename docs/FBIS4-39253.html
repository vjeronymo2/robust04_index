			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Yelmakov] </F>   [Text] Novosibirsk, 7 Jun -- A six-page memorandum  originating from the Ministry of Nationalities Affairs and  Regional Policy has fallen into the hands of local newspaper  editors and local bureaus of the central mass media. The  document assesses the socio-economic position of Novosibirsk  Oblast.    In it, Moscow-based experts write: "Income levels of  Novosibirsk Oblast residents have dropped to 37.4 percent of  Moscow levels, while per capita budget provisions in the oblast  amount to 46 percent of the average figure for Western Siberia".  Excessive militarization of the area's economy has been singled  out as being among the causes of this disastrous showing.  Having relaxed the reins in the running of the economy, the  state has left Novosibirsk Oblast residents outside the scope of  reforms: Neither military production nor defense-oriented  science can adjust to the new conditions.</p>

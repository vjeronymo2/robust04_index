			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A MAJOR MARCH  </P> <P> At least 300,000 people marched in Washington Sunday to leave a message for the  U. S. Supreme Court. It said that millions of Americans think the law must  continue to give women the freedom to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy.  </P> <P> Whether the court reads such messages is a matter of debate among legal  scholars, but the crowd of women and men, mothers and daughters, celebrities  and ordinary believers in the cause could not have made a more coherent  statement, one with which we absolutely agree: Government has no right to pry  into a decision as deeply personal, private and agonizing as the one that every  year leads 1.6 million women to have abortions.  </P> <P> The march, the largest ever seen in the capital, was timed to catch the court's  attention as it nears the April 26 date for argument in a Missouri abortion  case. The court is being asked by anti-abortion forces to use the Missouri case  as a vehicle to reverse the 1973 decision in the case of Roe vs. Wade that made  abortion legal under federal law.  </P> <P> Organizers of the march hoped to impress the court -- or at least one or two  justices who conceivably could go for a reversal -- that most Americans don't  want that to happen. At a minimum, they do not want the country to return to  the hazards of illicit and furtive operations that often were involved before  Roe vs. Wade. The march also was intended as a reminder that abortion is a  powerful symbol of the rights of women, even the many who oppose abortion,  because it involves decisions they are determined to make for themselves about  their health and the life they will lead.  </P> <P> Critics of Roe vs. Wade claim that the Constitution contains no guarantees of  such rights. But the court must look beyond legal principle to tenable social  policy and good sense, and both dictate that the right of a woman to choose to  terminate a pregnancy meets both of those tests.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Grumman, Boeing Settle Counterclaims: Details were not released, but the  companies said they have eliminated claims by both parties over the cost of  completing the first two modified Boeing 707s built for the STARS project, or  "surveillance target attack radar system." Grumman won the $657-million STARS  contract in 1985 and is in the final phase of flight testing before handing the  project to the Air Force for its own testing. The disagreement arose when  Boeing requested $122.5 million in addition to the initial $80.2 million that  it was awarded for modifying the 707 airframes.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 29 Apr (EFE) -- Today, Peru rejected a U.S.  State Department statement on the alleged slaughter of civilians  in the Peruvian jungle, and described the U.S. report as  "unfriendly, inaccurate, and inappropriate." The Peruvian  Foreign Ministry has announced that, in the absence of U.S.  Ambassador Alvin Adams, it had summoned U.S. Charge d'Affaires  Charles Brayshaw to personally convey the Peruvian Government's  "strong protest" over this issue to him.    On 28 April, State Department spokesperson Christine Shelly  told reporters that the U.S. Government is concerned about  "recent reports of the murder of civilians by Peruvian military  forces in Huanuco Department, in the central Peruvian region."  Shelly added that U.S. Government officials have asked Peruvian  President Alberto Fujimori "to allow Red Cross personnel into  the area where the massacre allegedly took place to determine  the number of civilians murdered."    The Peruvian Foreign Ministry states in its communique that  Brayshaw was informed that "relations and agreements between  Peru and the International Red Cross Committee exclusively  concern the two parties. Thus, Peru will not accept any  interference from third parties in these matters."    After stating that Peru respects the independence of the Red  Cross, the communique notes that it is "inappropriate" for the  United States "to attempt to mediate in this case without having  received any mandate from the Red Cross," and notes that "this  kind of action may undermine the degree of autonomy the  organization should have."    The communique finally states that Peru considers it  important to maintain a good level of relations with all  friendly countries, "but it cannot accept that the struggle the  Peruvian people are waging against terrorism be treated lightly,  let alone be the subject of unsubstantiated prejudgments."    The Peruvian Foreign Ministry was thus referring to the  sources from which the State Department obtained its  information, namely the National Human Rights Coordinating Board  and a sector of the press, which have charged the military with  having bombed some townships during "Operation Aries," which  began on 5 April.    The National Human Rights Coordinating Board retracted its  charges later and admitted that no bombings had taken place, but  it insisted on charging that urban areas had been hit by mortar  fire and that some people were murdered by soldiers. Later, the  Congressional Human Rights Committee and media organizations  reported that there are no townships in the area of conflict,  which is located on the left bank of the Huallaga River, but  rather it is a stronghold of Shining Path terrorists.    The congressional committee found the remains of several  humans and asked the attorney general to investigate the death  of those people. This task has been entrusted to a special  prosecutor in the Tingo Maria Province, which has jurisdiction  over the Huallaga zone.</p>

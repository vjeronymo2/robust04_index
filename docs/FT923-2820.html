			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Management: Sugarloaf for lunch on the road to Rio - Christina Lamb continues our series on business entertaining The city of Rio de Janeiro may be well down the road to decay but the art of lunching is alive and kicking. Deals are rarely made over the meal - what is traded is information, a vital commodity in a country of such instability. Consequently the main item on the verbal menu is fofoca - the latest gossip from Brasilia. Will the government announce another economic shock plan? What are the latest ways to make money from inflation? Currently most in demand over lunch are outrageous stories on the extent of corruption in high places. But amid all the rumours and uncertainties, business people in Rio do not lose sight of the pleasure of good food and, as a tourist resort, former capital and one-time centre of the Portuguese Empire, Rio has plenty to offer. Many of the restaurants in the centre are dark and smoky, full of thickset men in square-shouldered suits and dark glasses, huddled together eating enormous steaks in a conspiratorial manner. However, the newest place to be seen, called Grill One, is bright and airy, set on top of the city's most modern office block and reached by glass lifts with views over the port. It is crowded and vastly overpriced and one can wait an hour for a table, even with a reservation. Rio offers the ultimate vegetarian nightmare in the shape of the rodizio - a restaurant where you can eat as much meat as you can stomach. Take your table and prepare to be attacked by a constant onslaught of waiters holding enormous spear-like skewers bearing everything from chicken heart and sausages to filet mignon. For something lighter try Mosteiro in the shadow of the Sao Bento monastery, where seafood is more the order of the day. The speciality of the house is casquinha de siri, delicious spicy crabmeat inside a half shell brought to you while you peruse the leather-bound menus. As you sit down, the white-jacketed waiters have an alarming tendency to emerge from the walls in large numbers, almost as if they were about to start formation dancing. If food with a view is more to your taste in one of the world's most beautiful cities, then there are various choices in or near the centre. Rio's on Flamengo beach serves 'international cuisine' but, to compensate, has a splendid view across the bay to the palm-fringed yacht club with the Sugarloaf mountain towering above. La Tour is possibly one of the world's most bizarre restaurants. Revolving on top of the city's largest tower it offers spectacular views but be warned  -the terrible creaking sound, variable speed and indifferent food, often produce a greenish hue in the faces of lunchers. Worse, the tables go round but the waiters and food trollies remain on the central plinth which does not move, so it can take several rotations to make a choice. Rather more civilised is Maxims on the roof of the Rio Sul tower which reopened in 1988 after a first experiment led to bankruptcy. Rio's picture postcard scenery is spread beneath and the prices are far more accessible than Maxim branches in New York or Paris. Perhaps the best restaurant is Santa Fe, hidden away in the cobbled alley just behind the stock exchange. Salads and sandwiches have actually been seen here. But the biggest treat in town is the weekly feijoada, the Brazilian national dish. Originally slave food, it comprises a stew of pig bits and blackbeans served with rice, kale, orange and manioc flour. Traditionally eaten on Friday or Saturday, the best restaurants separate the ears and trotters from the nicer parts for those with a delicate stomach. Lastly and most importantly, do not expect to pay by credit card. With inflation running at 23 per cent a month, plastic is only marginally more useful than Monopoly money.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 9 (CNA) -- The government is  encouraging domestic banks to make inroads into Southeast Asian  countries in tandem with the "southern strategy."    Chen Mu-tsai, director of the Bureau of Monetary Affairs  under the Ministry of Finance, said Wednesday [9 March] that the  bureau has mapped out guidelines on financial support for the  strengthening of trade ties with the Southeast Asian region.    Under the guidelines, Chen pointed out, domestic financial  institutions are encouraged to set up operations in Southeast  Asia to render services to Taiwan manufacturers, who need easier  financial access to increase investment.    Currently, five Taiwan banks have branches in Southeast  Asia,  including the International Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) in  Bangkok, the First Commercial Bank and Chiao Tung Bank in  Singapore, Cathay Investment and Trust Co. in Ho Chi Minh City,  and Hua Nan Commercial Bank, Ltd. in Hong Kong.    Nine others maintain representative offices including ICBC  and Chinatrust Commercial Bank in Manila, the Export-Import Bank  of the Republic of China [ROC] and Chinatrust in Jakarta, and  the First Commercial Bank and Chinatrust in Hong Kong.    More banks are gearing up to follow suit, Chen noted, saying  Taiwan investors wanting to go to Southeast Asia will benefit  from increased availability of financing.    The financial strategy also calls for the export-import bank  to enhance services in loans and guarantees for the export of  technical engineering, export insurance, and overseas investment  insurance.    In addition, domestic leasing companies which have offices  in  Southeast Asia and engage in the business of machinery leasing  will be covered by the credit guarantee fund for overseas  Chinese financing.    Meanwhile, members of the Legislative Yuan's Financial  Committee, including legislators H.H. Ho, C.P. Chen, and H.J.  Hung, are planning to visit Southeast Asia next month to help  promote efforts to enter the banking business in that region.    "We will meet with government officials and parliamentarians  of those countries and get first-hand information on the  establishment of foreign bank offices," Ho said.    The government's southern strategy has been fueled by  Premier  Lien Chan's vacation trip to Malaysia and Singapore at the  beginning of the year and President Li Teng-hui's unofficial  visit to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand in February.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Concerning Japan-U.S. aviation talks to be held  following the Japan-U.S. summit in February, the Transport  Ministry on 6 January decided that it should shelve the question  of revising the aviation agreement for now, and instead  concentrate its efforts on the question of the number of flights  to and from Kansai International Airport, which is due to open  in September. The Transport Ministry has so far called for a  revision of the agreement on grounds that it is unfair to Japan.    In the negotiations on flights into Kansai so far, the  United  States has said that seven companies, including United Airlines  and Northwest Airlines, want to launch services, bringing the  number of flights requested by the U.S. airlines to more than  200 a week -- a number much higher than expected. The United  States has insisted that "based on the aviation agreement, the  United States has unlimited rights to fly into Japan. Nor are  there any limitations on the right to fly from Japan to other  Asian countries or Australia."    In turn, Japan has pointed out that U.S. companies at  present  hold a 70-percent market share for flights between Japan and the  United States. Japan has said that it cannot accept additional  U.S. flights without limit, which would raise the percentage of  U.S. services further, and has insisted that a limitation be put  on the right to fly beyond Japan as well. In addition, Japan  has called for a revision of the aviation agreement, noting, for  instance, that U.S. companies can use almost twice the number of  airports in Japan and the United States that Japanese companies  can.    More recently, however, U.S. demands have become more  realistic, and companies like United and Northwest have more  than halved the number of flights they requested for Kansai. As  a result, now that the time for opening Kansai is nearing, the  Transport Ministry has decided that it should be able to gain  more by concentrating its efforts on the question of flights  into the new airport rather than by seeking a revision of the  agreement. Michihiko Matsuo, administrative vice minister of  transport, said: "We will reiterate our position on the question  of the right to fly beyond Japan, but in the forthcoming talks,  we would like to concentrate more on the question of flights  into Kansai rather than on such a grandiose subject as revising  the agreement."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "S. Pol.": "In Paris the Hypothesis of a </F> Withdrawal of UN Troops Is Shaking the Majority"]    [Text] The debate on Bosnia took a lively turn yesterday  within the majority and between the government and the deputies  supporting it. The UDF [Union for French Democracy] group in  the National Assembly asked that the UN Protection Forces  mandate be extended "without waiting for the spring" in order to  "remove the doubt of a withdrawal which is encouraging the Serbs  to step up their offensive," at the very time when several RPR  [Rally for the Republic] deputies are calling for the withdrawal  of the Blue Helmets from Bosnia.    For the time being, the UDF is demanding that the UN forces  be strengthened, reinforcements sent, and the military command  provided with the "legal and practical means to take action,"  including air cover. "Impotence in face of the unbearable  killing in Bosnia can no longer be tolerated. This conflict is  now a test of the truth of democratic values, of the European  Union's political existence, and of the crediblity of the new  NATO doctrine," the UDF added.    During the defense commission meeting attended by [Defense  Minister] Francois Leotard, several RPR deputies demanded either  the withdrawal of the Blue Helmets in the fairly near future, or  the use of military means. Those speaking in favor of  withdrawal were Robert Andre Vivien (Val-de-Marne); Charles Cova  (Seine-et-Marne); Pierre Lellouche (Val d'Oise), who is  diplomatic adviser to Jacques Chirac; Jean-Bernard Raimond  (Bouches-du-Rhone); and Robert Pandraud (Seine-Saint-Denis), a  former minister, who said: "I wonder who now stands to gain from  dying for Sarajevo; this is not 1914. When people want to kill  each other, they kill each other, and they have been killing  each other in the Balkans for centuries."    Rene Galy-Dejean (Paris) and Alain Marsaud (Haute-Vienne)  advocated a tough intervention. In reply to Jacques Chirac, who  wondered about the possibility of combining intervention and  withdrawal, Defense Minister Francois Leotard said that France  is envisaging the possibility of a withdrawal, but that it must  be multilateral. "We must assess the consequences," he added,  "because there could be a veritable bloodbath." An operation on  Serbian territory, "a step in the escalation of the war,"  strikes him as inconceivable. As for an intervention against  the 200 Serbian batteries around Sarajevo, he thinks it would  require one and a half days for the targets to be destroyed and  would prompt harsh reprisals against an unprotected city.</p>

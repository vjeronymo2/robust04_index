			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME'S LIMBO FUELS LOBBYING, SPECULATION  </P> <P> The suspense over Time Inc.'s future continued to color Wall Street trading and  Washington rhetoric as yet another day passed without action by Time's board on  a hostile bid by Paramount Communications Inc.  </P> <P> Sources said the 12-member Time board is likely to meet today, however, to  discuss how -- or whether -- Time will try to salvage its plan to merge with  Warner Communications. Until Paramount made its surprise $175-a-share offer  last week, both Time and Warner had expected their stock-swap proposal to be  approved by shareholders at meetings on June 23. So far, neither Time nor  Warner has canceled its meeting.  </P> <P> On Wall Street, traders' attention turned anew to Paramount and Warner, which  ranked second and third, respectively, on the New York Stock Exchange's most  active list.  </P> <P> Paramount rose $1.75 to close at $59.50, with nearly 4 million shares -- or  almost 3.4% of its capitalization -- changing hands. Warner rose 75 cents to  close at $55 on a volume of 2.5 million shares -- about 1.5% of its common  shares outstanding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Letter to FCC  </P> <P> One investment banker, who gives Time and Warner "less than zero" chance of  proceeding with their original deal, wagered that Time is "trying to  orchestrate a bid for Paramount" to unnerve the hostile bidder.  </P> <P> In Washington, meanwhile, lobbying was evident at both the Federal  Communications Commission and on Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> Hawaii Atty. Gen. Warren Price III sent a three-page letter to FCC Chairman  Dennis R. Patrick urging the commission to deny Paramount's request to transfer  shares of Time to a voting trust until the agency approves transfer of licenses  related to Time's cable television business.  </P> <P> Price said Hawaii law requires action by its public utility commission before  any cable franchises can be transferred, and he urged the FCC not to "abrogate"  the state's powers.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, two Democratic senators said they were concerned that the battle  over Time would result in greater media concentration. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum  (D-Ohio) reiterated his earlier opposition to the Time-Warner deal and  expressed similar feeling about Paramount's bid.  </P> <P> Such combinations raise "the threat of less diversity and higher prices to end  users -- book and magazine readers, moviegoers and cable subscribers,"  Metzenbaum told the Senate Commerce Committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scouting for Murdoch  </P> <P> Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) asked whether "the national good is somehow served"  by a takeover battle whose outcome may hinge on who has the most cash.  </P> <P> On Wall Street, the price of Time shares fell $4.875 to $175.125. A day  earlier, Time's shares had climbed $5 on rumors that another bid might  materialize.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, an investment banking firm said it was retained last week by media  baron Rupert Murdoch to analyze the battle for Time. "Something's going to  happen, and it's going to create opportunity," said Robert Pirie, chairman and  chief executive of Rothschild Inc.  </P> <P> Murdoch, the controlling shareholder of News Corp. and its 20th Century Fox  Film studio, threatened a takeover bid for Warner in 1984 but sold back his  Warner shares for a profit in a practice regarded as "greenmail." As part of  the settlement, Murdoch agreed not to acquire Warner stock for 10 years, a  Warner spokesman said.  </P> <P> Wall Street analysts continued to speculate Wednesday about the options  available to the Time board. The company might offer to buy Warner, or it might  recapitalize and pay a large dividend to Time shareholders to placate those who  want some cash payment, now that the Paramount offer is on the table. The  merger with Warner might be abandoned altogether, some said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Sell Assets  </P> <P> Each option seems to have a serious flaw that imperils the independence of the  companies involved, several analysts said.  </P> <P> Yet another possibility is a sale of all Time assets. Under federal tax law, a  formal liquidation would spare the company the hefty capital gains tax on the  partial sale of assets that might occur if it is acquired by a debt-laden  company, said Emanuel Gerard, a principal of the New York research firm of  Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Co.  </P> <P> "A formal liquidation is a high-class form of scorched earth. It may be spite,  but it is profitable spite," said Gerard, who left Warner's office of the  president in 1984.  </P> <P> "If the Time board crosses the bridge that it can no longer be an independent  company, that would probably be a way to maximize shareholder value," Gerard  said. "Were that to happen, I believe it would be a seminal event in American  business, and there would be fallout in Washington."  </P></p>

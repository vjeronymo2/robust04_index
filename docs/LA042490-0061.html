			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: FOR EVERY KID WHO DROPS OUT, SCORES DROP IN  </P> <P> It's 1990. Do you know where your children are?  </P> <P> What a question! Of course you know where they are. You read the newspaper and  watch television. Some of them are making touchdowns, winning spelling bees and  earning scholarships. The rest of them? They're doing drugs, getting pregnant,  cruising, skipping school, running away from home, stealing cars, playing with  guns and traveling in gangs.  </P> <P> If that's what you think, you need to be enlightened. There's a huge segment of  the teen-age community that rarely makes it to the pages of the newspaper or on  "film at 11."  </P> <P> By news standards, they're not doing anything that dramatic or that  spectacular. They're just washing cars to earn money for a child's liver  transplant, delivering flowers to nursing homes and hospital patients, reading  to the blind and dishing up food for the homeless on a Sunday morning.  </P> <P> They're hugging the Special Olympians who cross the finish line, picking up  trash from our roadsides, and recycling bottles and cans. They're climbing  mountains to benefit kids with cancer and teaching water safety at parks and  recreation programs.  </P> <P> Some of them are in the counseling business, manning crisis hot-lines for their  contemporaries who are deep into drugs and alcohol and are contemplating  suicide. They're filling out the ranks of the Red Cross and United Way, working  at food banks and Ronald McDonald Houses, and giving aid to police programs.  </P> <P> For every kid who "drops out" of school, there are scores of teen-agers who  "drop in" to tutor a sick child. In fact, according to a Gallup Poll, 50% of  all American teen-agers volunteer on the average of five hours a week!  </P> <P> Every year in my city, young people dump thousands of little rubber ducks (at  $5 a shot) in a canal to stage the Great American Duck Race. It's their way of  showing their involvement against drug abuse. Recently, a high school class  threw a prom for the residents of a home for the elderly. (They actually did  get good media coverage on this.)  </P> <P> Too often, adults don't bother to look beyond the stone-washed jeans, the punk  haircuts, the giddiness, the vocabulary and the culture of youth. But  compassion comes wrapped in many packages. What is perceived as the "Gimme  Generation" contributed heavily last year to the number of Americans who  volunteered $150 billion worth of their time.  </P> <P> In a world where "troubled teens" is a redundancy, it's good to know one out of  every two of our kids has discovered the meaning of life: Find a greater need  than your own and serve it.  </P></p>

Flutist  Jean-Pierre Rampal and violinist Jaime Laredo were among those who performed  with the San Francisco Symphony in a free concert. Mstislav Rostropovich, the  conductor of the National Symphony, stole the show, dancing onto the stage  wearing the heavy makeup of a ballerina, a wig and white tutu. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / North's economy may be reviving SALES, employment and profits fell in the first quarter of the year among companies in the north of England. Optimism about prospects for the year ahead increased, however, according to the latest Business Survey North, published yesterday. Mr John Bridge, chief executive of the Northern Development Company, said the findings suggested that the north's economy could be approaching a 'turning point'. The report, based on responses from 1,017 companies in north-east England and Cumbria, shows exports in the first quarter at their lowest level since the quarterly surveys began at the start of last year. Company profits dropped sharply, showing their first negative balance for a year. But the survey, carried out by the NDC and the Tyne and Wear and Teesside chambers of commerce, records increased investment in plant, machinery and buildings, a rise in expenditure on training and a marginal improvement in domestic and export orders. Business confidence, which slumped in the final quarter of last year, has rallied although it is still below its 1991 third-quarter level. In the latest survey 28.6 per cent of companies predicted an improvement in the April to July period and 17.3 per cent a deterioration, compared with 16 per cent and 27.9 per cent respectively last time. Overall the service sector outperformed manufacturing in the latest quarter and was more optimistic. In manufacturing large companies did better than small ones; in the service sector it was the reverse. Nearly a third of manufacturers cut their workforce, yet more than a third of those which recruited had problems hiring skilled manual workers. The proportion of companies working at more than 90 per cent capacity increased slightly to 21.1 per cent. The NDC funded the latest survey.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert ("AZG", "YERKIR" dailies), 05/31/94 --  The general situation at the RMK [Republic of Mountainous  Karabakh] fronts remains unchanged, and no active military  operations are reported.    Nevertheless, the RMK Defense Army headquarters report, the  Azeri forces shelled the Karabakh defense positions at the  villages of Talish, Seisulan, Hasanghaya in the Mardakertskiy  District and Shurabad and Namirli in the Agdamskiy District. No  casualties are reported.    At the same time "YERKIR" reports, the situation at the  South-Eastern fronts aggravated again in the night of May 25.  Several Azeri units carried fierce shelling of the Armenian  defense positions at the villages of Karakhanbeyli and Gorgan in  the Fizulinskiy District, followed by an offensive attempting to  recapture a number of important heights. Fierce battles have  been carried out in this direction. The RMK armed forces  stopped the offensive and drove the enemy back to the initial  positions. Thirteen Azeri soldiers have reportedly been killed.    Commenting on violations of the cease fire, a representative  of the RMK Defense Army, Serzh Arushanyan, said the Azeri  command is unable to completely control the armed forces. In  particular, they have no power over the units controlled by the  opposition. According to Arushanyan, this is a consequence of  the political tension in Baku. This may again result in further  increase of tension at the RMK fronts, if Geydar Aliyev does not  convince the corresponding spheres in absence of prospects in  continuing the war.    Using the temporary cease fire, the Karabakh side started  the  procedures of exchanging prisoners of war and corpses.  According to the head of a corresponding department Aleksandr  Agasaryan, representatives of the Azeri authorities are not  quite willing to carry the exchange, and prefer selling the  prisoners to their relatives. A number of high-ranking Azeri  authorities make great money through this trade.    Nevertheless, the Karabakh Commission on Prisoners of War  and  Hostages freed 5 Armenians from the Azeri prison, having  exchanged them with 12 hostages, among them 5 fighters.</p>

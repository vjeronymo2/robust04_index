			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hillsdown acquires Allied Domecq's UK biscuit arm Hillsdown Holdings has bought Lyons Biscuits, the UK biscuit business of Allied Domecq, the spirits group which is shedding its food, tea and coffee operations. Best known for its Maryland chocolate chip biscuits, Lyons also makes a range of biscuits for the own-label market. It employs 780 people in Blackpool and is profitable on sales of Pounds 44m a year. Hillsdown is thought to have paid just over Pounds 20m for the company, which it will merge with its Premier Biscuits division. Together, the two niche producers will have about 4 per cent of the UK biscuit market. Premier, a management buy-out from Cadbury Schweppes in 1987, was bought by Hillsdown in 1989. Its sales are believed to be about Pounds 150m. Tetley tea and Allied's baking business are the last two large groups of assets Allied Domecq still has on the block. With earlier disposals such as DCA Food Industries, it appears to be on track to raise a total of about Pounds 800m. Nestle of Switzerland and Tata of India were among the companies that looked at Tetley, the first or second largest producer in the UK, many continental European countries, the US and Canada. Nestle is thought to have balked at Allied Domecq's asking price, while a purchase by Tata would present the Indian company with some complex financing problems.</p>

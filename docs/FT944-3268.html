			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Article of faith challenged: The dispute over flaws in Intel's Pentium chip has alarmed the computer industry, says Louise Kehoe Chastened executives of Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer, are struggling to restore public and investor confidence in the company's microprocessor chips - the 'brains' of more than 80 per cent of all personal computers - in the wake of damaging disclosures of a flaw in its Pentium chip over the past month. The flaw in the chip, Intel's highest performance microprocessor, can lead to miscalculations in some mathematical applications, a fault that Intel argued would affect few users as it would occur so infrequently. The heaviest blow to Intel's reputation came on Monday when IBM announced that it would halt shipments of Pentium-based PCs, pending the delivery of production volumes of a new version of the Intel chip in which the error has been corrected, some time in the first quarter of 1995. IBM's action, which Intel claims is 'unwarranted', has brought renewed public attention to the Pentium problem and cast doubt on Intel's insistence that the flaw is minor and will not affect the vast majority of PC users. As the leading supplier of microprocessors, Intel has much at stake. IBM, in contrast, has little to lose. Pentium PCs account for only about 5 per cent of its PC sales. What is more, IBM is planning to launch PCs based on its own rival PowerPC microprocessors. The controversy has, however, created a crisis of confidence for the computer industry that could have lasting effects. The ubiquitous microprocessor chip is not only the 'engine' in most of today's computers. It also controls a myriad of equipment ranging from car engines and aircraft controls to medical equipment and weapon systems. Its accuracy - until now an article of faith - is essential in these applications upon which life may often depend. The Pentium problem first emerged last month when Thomas Nicely, a mathematics professor at Lynchburg College in Virginia, discovered that his three Pentium computers were producing erroneous results in calculations designed to identify prime numbers (a prime number is a whole number that can be divided only by 1 and itself, such as 2, 3, 5 or 7). Prof Nicely shared his finding on the Internet, a global network of computers, prompting near-hysteria among computer scientists. The story was quickly picked up by the media, creating a public relations crisis for Intel. The chipmaker's response has been an offer to replace Pentium chips if users want a replacement. Operators on Intel's 'hot lines' stress, however, that most PC users should not concern themselves with the issue. The majority of callers have been satisfied with Intel's explanation that the risk of error is low. To date, Intel says that it has agreed to replace only 'a few thousand' Pentium chips; a small fraction of the more than 5m Pentiums shipped to date. Most PC manufacturers have taken a similar approach, offering to replace chips for customers who insist, but encouraging them to ignore the furore surrounding the Pentium chip. The approach seemed to be working. Retail sales of Pentium PCs continued to boom in the US and Europe as recently as last weekend, according to Intel. While Internet devotees were still criticising Intel, it seemed that the buying public was losing interest in the arcane debate. IBM's announcement on Monday that it was halting sales of its Pentium PCs was therefore a blow for Intel. 'We've conducted our own tests and concluded that the risk of error is significantly higher than previously thought and warrants today's actions,' says Rick Thoman, IBM senior vice-president in charge of the company's PC business. Intel maintains that the likelihood of a PC user encountering an error is only once in 27,000 years and that standard off-the-shelf software applications are not affected. IBM, however, says that its tests indicated that users of common spreadsheet programs could encounter errors as frequently as once in every 24 days. In a statement that seemed certain to strike fear into the hearts of corporate computer users, IBM said: 'For a customer with 500 Pentium-based PCs, this could result in as many as 20 mistakes a day.' IBM has no argument with the technical aspects of Intel's analysis, but questions the assumption made by Intel's computer scientists that the numbers used in calculations made by millions of PC users are random and that the number of calculations made per day is approximately 1,000. By inserting non-random numbers into their tests and substantially increasing the number of calculations per day, IBM came up with its very different, and damaging, results. Intel strongly disputes IBM's calculations and hints that the computer company is deliberately trying to undermine its credibility to further its own interests. IBM's tests are 'contrived', Intel executives say. 'If IBM were right, millions of PC users would have already encountered errors,' says Mike Barton, an Intel computational scientist. IBM insists, however, that it has acted purely in the interests of its customers. Some of IBM's largest corporate customers have expressed concerns about the accuracy of Pentium PCs, an IBM official says. 'We have to stand by our products.' IBM says that it shared preliminary results of its tests with Intel last week. However, Andy Grove, Intel president and chief executive, says that Intel first learnt of IBM's decision to halt shipments via news wire services on Monday morning, and that IBM has refused to supply Intel with details of its tests. So far, no other PC manufacturer has followed IBM's lead and Intel hopes that it can contain the problem by continuing to offer to replace Pentium chips if customers are concerned and by placing a lifetime warranty on them. 'We are quite clearly anxious to have this event behind us, but given that this has become a major event in the mass media, involving people who are not accustomed to dealing with sophisticated mathematical terms like random divides, operands and floating points, quite frankly we do not know what to do,' says Mr Grove with a note of desperation. Ironically, the 'Pentium flaw' is far less serious than errors that were found in early versions of Intel's past generations of microprocessors. These problems went largely unnoticed by the media and the general public. Yet Intel's success in establishing its brand name as one of the most recognised in the world through multimillion- dollar advertising campaigns has changed the situation. 'Microprocessors have quite clearly become a part of every person's life, a very high profile consumer item and that has raised the level of expectation forever,' says Mr Grove. 'This incident and the exposure it has received globally will have a lasting impact on the design, verification and manufacturing of microprocessors - everybody's microprocessors. 'The Pentium is the most tested - and I believe the best - microprocessor that has ever been manufactured in the world,' Mr Grove claims. 'But there is no such thing as a perfect microprocessor.' It is almost impossible to ensure that there is no tiny flaw in chips of this level of complexity, which contain more than 3m transistors on a tiny square of silicon, Intel executives explain. 'This is probably a very important moment in Intel history as we continue to evolve into a consumer technology company,' says Mr Grove. The company is learning some painful lessons about how to deal with the concerns of the buying public, he acknowledges. Intel is not alone, however, in facing this crisis of confidence. The reputation of the computer industry is at stake. Privately, leading software and computer systems manufacturers fear that they could become the next target of public disdain, if their products fail to live up to high expectations for accuracy and reliability.</p>

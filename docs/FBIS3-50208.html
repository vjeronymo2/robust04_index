Juhasz spoke to the daily after the  party, registered in October 1993, held a meeting on Tuesday of  about 50 people. At the meeting, the party claimed to succeed  the Hungarian fascist arrow-cross party of the 1930's and  1940's, and denied the Holocaust ever took place.    The new group reportedly wants to rehabilitate arrow-cross  leader Ferenc Szalasi, who unleashed a reign of terror when his  party came to power in 1944. He was executed in 1946 for crimes  against humanity.    Juhasz regretted that Registration Court party synopses  often  differ from actual intentions. "The real motives and aims of  these parties become clear only at their meetings and in their  public statements." The Tuesday meeting makes this group  unacceptable for the government and it violates constitutional  order, Juhasz said. Asked by NEPSZABADSAG, she said the  government feels constitutionally obliged to act against all  forms of discrimination. At the commemoration of the liberation  of the Budapest ghetto on Tuesday, the cabinet was represented  by three ministers, signalling the government's clear position,  Juhasz said.</p>

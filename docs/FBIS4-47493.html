Gaynutdinov; UDC 681.7.062.621.373.826]    [Abstract] The development of highly reflective mirrors  with small losses in scattering and absorption on the basis of  multilayer interference coatings is discussed and the theory of  nonpolarizing highly reflective mirrors is outlined. A method  for designing and fabricating amplitude-phase anisotropic  mirrors with small losses for operation at a wavelength 632.8 nm  at an angle 45 is described in detail and copies of  phase-controllable mirrors smoothly and reversibly changing  phase anisotropy within the limits 10 also are described.  Such a mirror is a backing of KU1 glass fabricated by deep  grinding and polishing to whose working surface is successively  applied (in a vacuum by the cathode-ray method) a current  conducting layer, copper contacts for imparting a working  voltage and the highly reflective mirror itself. The operating  principle is as follows. With the imparting of voltages and a  current of definite strength to the contacts the  current-conducting layer causes heating of the mirror itself, in  which the optical thicknesses of the layers change (these  changes are proportional to the strength of the current fed to  the contacts). With an increase in the current strength fed to  the contacts the range of change in phase anisotropy increases  with heating of the mirror to 80C. The dependence of phase  anisotropy on temperature has a reversible stably reproducible  character. Figures 4; references 12: 6 Russian, 6 Western.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho selling MAN truck importing business for Pounds 20m LONRHO, the international trading group, is selling its UK MAN truck importing business for Pounds 20m. It is the latest in a series of disposals designed to reduce the group's Pounds 1.1bn net debt. An agreement in principle has been reached with MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the second largest German truck maker, which will take responsibility for the distribution, sales and service of MAN trucks, buses and spare parts in the UK. The 25-strong MAN dealer network in the UK would not be affected by the sale, said Lonrho. Lonrho added that MAN 'wished to continue and to extend the development of its UK presence'. MAN accounted for 4.9 per cent of the UK market for trucks above 3.5 tonnes last year, which it is relatively small compared with its presence elsewhere in Europe. It was in eighth place in the UK market, overshadowed by groups such as DAF, Iveco and Mercedes-Benz. Lonrho said that MAN would take over the UK operations 'as soon as practicable' and not later than the end of March. The acquisition is a further step in the trend for leading car and truck makers to take over direct control of the importing and distribution of their products in main volume markets. Mr Robert Dunlop, deputy chairman of Lonrho, said the company believed that 'the funds currently deployed in the truck business could be better utilised elsewhere in Lonrho's operations'. The UK new truck market has more than halved in the last two years with the steepest fall into recession in the post-war period. Lonrho has already confirmed the sale of its 50 per cent interest in Kuhne and Nagel, the German freight forwarder, for DM340m (Pounds 118.8m). Lonrho is also understood to be planning the sale of both the Glasgow Herald and the Evening Times, which belong to the group's George Outram subsidiary. The sale could fetch up to Pounds 200m.</p>

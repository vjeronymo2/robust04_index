			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin announced today that the Kremlin is ready to reduce the  Russian Army from three million to 1.5 million people, according  to reports reaching here.    During a meeting with Amur regional officials in the far  eastern city of Blagoveshchensk, the Russian leader stressed  that the Army does not need such a large amount of technology  and that mobile armaments, which would compete on the external  market, are essential.    Yeltsin also said that, in addition to Malaysia, Russian  arms  will be also purchased by Thailand and Australia.    Observers here believe that it is difficult for Russia to  keep the original number of troops because of a lack of money.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez (Mexico), 21 Feb (EFE) -- Just 24  hours before the peace dialogue between Zapatist rebels and the  Mexican Government begins today, Monday, the Chiapas Supreme  Tribunal of Justice released 28 Indians who have been imprisoned  for months, charged with various crimes.    The release of Indians who are "imprisoned without  justification" is one of the main demands of the Zapatist  National Liberation Army (EZLN), which has been in a state of  revolt since 1 January. The released Indians have not been  charged with belonging to the EZLN, although the press thinks  their release seeks to diminish the conflict of interests  between the rebel group and the government prior to the peace  dialogue.    Arturo Nazar, president of the Chiapas Supreme Tribunal of  Justice, said the decision to release the prisoners -- all of  whom were charged with common crimes -- was made after a  thorough analysis of the cases. Human rights groups said the  Indians were charged months ago with robbery, theft of public  funds, attacking other people, damaging property, raiding homes,  and extortion, even though in some cases they were not even  tried. "The peasants and Indians were released according to the  Law of Suspended Sentence and for having served part of their  sentences, and not because of the peace dialogue," Nazar pointed  out.    When the conflict first began, the Mexican Armed Forces  arrested 70 alleged Zapatists and accused them of bearing  firearms which are for the exclusive use of the Army, homicide,  and association with criminal intent. On 28 January, the  Tribunal of Justice released 38 Zapatists following demands by  the Zapatists and only one week later Congress approved an  Amnesty Law for the armed groups. At that time, each one of the  accused paid $330 for his release. The money came from the  Auxiliary Fund for the Administration of State Justice.    There are still 32 Zapatists imprisoned at the Cerro Hueco  Prison in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas State, some 700  km southeast of Mexico City. They should have been released  after the rebels freed former Chiapas Governor Absalon  Castellanos Dominguez. The release of those 32 prisoners was  requested by the rebels when they liberated Castellanos last  Wednesday, but this request has not been met. Castallanos was  taken hostage by the Zapatists on 2 January. He was accused of  starting a repression campaign against the Indians and of  promoting and supporting the "ladinos" (whites) in committing  injustices against the Indians.    Around mid-January, the Mexican Congress approved an Amnesty  Law for the Chiapas rebels and other groups who might rise up in  arms on the condition they turn in their weapons. According to  Juan Manuel Ulloa, delegate in Chiapas of the Office of the  Attorney General of the republic, the 32 imprisoned Zapatists  cannot receive the amnesty benefits because the EZLN General  Command has not yet turned in its weapons, even though  Castellanos has been released.    It is expected the Zapatists will remind Peace Commissioner  Manuel Camacho Solis, in the dialogue which begins today, of the  promise to release the imprisoned rebels, and that they will  demand compliance, in one way or another, with the commitments  agreed to before the negotiations begin.    The EZLN rose up in arms against the hunger and poverty to  which 1 million Indians of the state have been subjected for  years, and against the agrarian policy and repression in Chipas.  During the first 12 days of the armed conflict, the EZLN waged  combats with the Armed Forces that left at least 108 killed, 500  wounded, and 20,000 evicted from their communities.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Subdued Tokyo investors turn to futures markets INDEX-RELATED selling and buying by public pension and insurance funds dominated activity, and share prices fluctuated in quiet trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average was finally down 45.78 at 19,492.52 after moving between 19,617.51 and 19,368.14. Investors focused on the futures markets in Singapore after rumours that futures buying by a New York based fund had pushed the Nikkei up by 1.7 per cent on Tuesday. Volume fell to 230m shares from 349m. Overall rises led declines by 553 to 455, with 154 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks gained 7.01 at 1,562.39. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.06 at 1,195.42. Dealers said trading would remain subdued ahead of this weekend's Tokyo metropolitan election. The Nikkei is expected to move between 19,000 and 19,500 in light trading. Banks rose on technical trading. Industrial Bank of Japan advanced Y30 to Y2,850 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y90 to Y2,150. Steel issues were hit ahead of the decision on steel dumping by the US, Nippon Steel dipping Y6 to Y360 and Sumitomo Metal Y7 to Y322. Real estate issues lost ground on profit-taking following Tuesday's gains. Mitsui Fudosan shed Y10 to Y1,220. High-technology stocks were weak, with Matsushita Electric Industrial down Y20 to Y1,310 and Toshiba Y13 off at Y687. However, Sanyo Electric rose Y15 to Y440 on reports of plans to increase its imports of products from overseas production bases, and NCR Japan moved ahead Y60 to Y1,250 on the announcement of a computer order. Power utilities firmed on buying by individuals' cumulative stock investment schemes. Tokyo Electric Power appreciated Y50 to Y3,500. Bargain hunting pushed up Nippon Telegraph and Telephone by Y26,000 to Y881,000. Companies having close ties with NTT also gained ground, Oki Cable adding Y40 at Y591 and Daimel Y60 at Y1,100. Individual investors were noted buying smaller stocks. The Tokyo SE second section index finished 12.02 ahead at 2,168.42, while the over-the-counter market added 8.96 at 1,504.03. Hanix, the construction machine maker which filed for court protection last month, traded for the first time since June 1 at Y110, having plunged from the Y2,480 level seen at the end of May. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 14.24 points to 21,523.47 in volume of 21.3m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets again produced mixed performances. HONG KONG saw early gains trimmed after the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group communique failed to mention any agreement on infrastructure projects. The Hang Seng index closed a net 15.91 up at 7,062.64, having advanced 50 points earlier in the day. Wharf Holdings and Jardine Matheson rose 40 cents and HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 20.40 and HKDollars 60 respectively on early speculation, which proved unfounded, that China and Britain would approve a container terminal project. AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index fell below the key 1,700 level in late trade, the market staying volatile ahead of the end of the financial year on June 30. After a weak start inspired by Wall Street's overnight fall, the All Ordinaries remained on the down tack throughout the day to end 17.9 off at 1,698.8, the lowest level since May 25, in turnover of ADollars 277.8m. BHP fell 16 cents to ADollars 13.74 in advance of its results, due tomorrow. Leighton lost a cent at ADollars 1.75 after falling as low as ADollars 1.72, following its ADollars 33m share placing. TAIWAN was pulled higher by a technical rebound, led by financials and blue chips, after its recent extended falls. The weighted index finished 69.68, or 1.7 per cent, up at the day's best of 4,132.17. Turnover was still thin but higher than in recent days at TDollars 16.8bn. JAKARTA edged forward to a peak for the year in moderate trading. The official index rose 2.21 to 358.38. SINGAPORE benefited from late bargain hunting which left the Straits Times Industrial index 3.43 firmer at 1,791.11, after an intraday low of 1,760.42. SEOUL closed sharply lower after profit-taking in blue chip manufacturing issues and financial shares amid worries about the liquidity constraints of institutional investors. The composite index weakened 8.09 to 762.53. Growing labour unrest, including a stalemate at Hyundai Motor, was a further cause for concern. Hyundai lost Won300 to Won28,600. US anti-dumping charges on South Korean steelmakers, ranging from 5 to 18 per cent, pressured the sector. Posco shed Won500 to Won25,700. MANILA continued to retreat in spite of healthy market liquidity and the composite index fell 14.30 to 1,554.66. BOMBAY was undermined by fears of fresh political turmoil following a report by a parliamentary committee investigating a Dollars 1.28bn securities scandal which criticised two ministers. The BSE index lost 17.17 to 2,232.12.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM targets invalidity claimants THE GOVERNMENT'S determination to press ahead with proposals for restricting expenditure on invalidity benefit was emphasised by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons yesterday. He said the number of benefit claimants had more than doubled over the past 10. He said it beggared belief that 'so many more people have suddenly become invalids, especially at a time when the health of the nation has improved'. Mr Major told jeering Labour MPs: 'I make no apologies for looking at this area of expenditure'. Undeterred by fierce protests from Labour MPs, he said the number of people receiving invalidity benefit had more than doubled over the last 10 years from 700,000 to 1.5m while spending had gone up from about Pounds 1.5bn to over Pounds 6bn. 'No responsible government could ignore an increase of that order,' he insisted. Earlier, Mr Major discussed proposals for cutting the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, and Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, at 10 Downing Street. Labour MPs based their onslaught on last week's disclosure that, in a draft letter, Mr Lilley outlined proposals for taxing invalidity benefit, focusing it more on the long-term sick, as well as making it less generous and subject to a tough medical test. According to government estimates these changes would save Pounds 495m in the 1996-97 financial year, and Pounds 1.3bn by the year 2000. While Downing Street officials indicated than no decisions were taken at yesterday's ministerial meeting, new rules are likely to be in place when the chancellor presents his November budget. In the Commons the prime minister faced a blunt demand from Mr Ian Davidson (Lab Glasgow Govan) to sack any minister who proposed 'a drastic reduction in the already inadequate level of invalidity benefit'. Mr Major immediately confirmed that invalidity benefit was being considered by ministers, and maintained that they were 'entirely right' to do so. Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, said later the prime minister had made it 'all too clear' that Labour had been right to accuse the government of planning a Treasury 'raid' on the long-term sick. He accused the prime minister of showing no understanding of the problems of those facing illness, and he urged Mr Major to recognise that high unemployment was the root cause of his problems.</p>

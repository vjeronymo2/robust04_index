			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Feb 28 (AFP) -- The six Bosnian Serb planes  intercepted Monday by NATO warplanes which shot down four of  them had taken off from the northwestern Serb-held airport of  Banja Luka, a French military source said.    The six Super Galeb aircraft were in the air a short period  when they were spotted by an AWACS radar plane which relayed  their location to two US F-16 fighter jets, the source said. He  added that the order to shoot down the planes was given by the  NATO headquarters in Italy after the Bosnian Serb planes ignored  orders to land.    Earlier, the [French] Defense Ministry here said the Galeb  aircraft were in the process of bombing a Moslem-operated  weapons factory near the central town of Vitez when four of them  were shot down.    Speaking in Mostar in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, UN  special  representative for the former Yugoslavia Yasuchi Akashi said he  "understood that (the) two other planes landed in Banja Luka  airport."    Akashi added that he had contacted Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic and the two had agreed "on the importance of  not overdramatising this particular incident."    The Bosnian Serbs have often been accused of using the Banja  Luka airport for helicopter flights which were in violation of a  UN no-flight ban over Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Although the flights were detected by AWACS radar planes,  NATO jets could not intervene as the helicopters were flying low  and in moutainous regions.</p>

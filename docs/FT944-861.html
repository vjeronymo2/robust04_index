			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Property: The new realism - Sellers are willing to accept lower prices After an exceptionally quiet autumn, the property investment market is stirring. The Pounds 1.5bn unsolicited offer for St Martins Property Group, owned by the Kuwaiti government, is the most obvious sign of life. But other, less glamorous, deals completed over the past few weeks could be more significant indications of the overall health of the market. Properties which have been on sale for months have finally been sold. This is not because enthusiastic buyers are offering better prices, but because sellers are now willing to accept the prices on offer. Land Securities' sale last week of its Milton Gate office block in the City of London looks like a case of this new realism among sellers. AP Fonden, the Swedish national pension fund, paid Pounds 76.5m for the property. While that is above the property's March valuation, it is much below the original asking price - thought to be about Pounds 85m. 'We thought we were going to see a lot of activity this autumn but it never happened,' said Mr John Slade of Richard Ellis, the surveyors. 'Expectations on the part of vendors were clearly too high and have had to come down to more realistic levels.' Similarly, Friends Provident's purchase of London Capital Holdings from Citibank followed an unsuccessful attempt to float the company on the stock market in May. Citibank withdrew the planned flotation because stock market investors were not willing to pay a price close to the company's Pounds 240m net asset value. While the details of the Friends Provident deal were not disclosed, it seems likely that the life insurer has paid less than Citibank anticipated in the summer. Realism on the part of sellers bodes well. A healthy property investment market relies on some common ground between buyers and sellers. The snag is that the weight of UK institutional money trying to get into the property market has dissipated over the past year. According to Hillier Parker, the surveyors, institutional cash totalling Pounds 10bn was waiting to be invested in property at the peak of the market in March. Since then interest has fallen. The top funds now have only about one-third the amount available. The drift of institutions away from property partly reflects a realisation that the outlook is not as rosy as it seemed. According to forecasts by the London Business School, capital values will rise by just 2.6 per cent next year against about 9 per cent this year. Moreover, property has outpaced both bonds and equities in 1994. Even without committing additional funds, the weighting of most life and pension funds to property has risen through this year. Funds have been drawing breath after the frenetic activity of the first half of the year, but that will change when 1995 asset allocations are decided,' said Mr Philip Nelson of Nelson Bakewell, the surveyors. 'I sense that the investment market is unsticking.' AP Fonden's latest acquisition also underlines that foreign investment has become a permanent feature of the central London property market. The inflow of overseas funds this year - at about Pounds 1.8bn - is nowhere near the Pounds 3bn-plus annual totals of the late 1980s. But such huge inflows were caused by an extraordinary mixture of sky-high confidence and deregulation in countries such as Sweden and Japan. The evidence of the past four years suggests that central London might, in a normal year, expect Pounds 1.5bn - Pounds 2bn net investment from overseas. 'The UK is now seen by international funds as an established long-term destination for investment in property,' said Mr Peter Evans, head of research at DTZ Debenham Thorpe, the surveyors. Having done well from acquisitions made at the trough of the market in 1991-92, German open-ended funds are particularly keen buyers. Overseas buyers appear to be interested in different types of property than UK funds. Milton Gate - sold on a yield of 8.85 per cent - was typical of the kind of over-rented building foreign investors are keen to buy. In contrast, UK fund managers are willing to acquire properties on low yields if they can scent rental growth. Yields of 5-6 per cent are not uncommon in the City. With money flowing in from overseas, steady interest from domestic institutions and some agreement among buyers and sellers, a healthier flow of investment deals is in prospect for the new year. However, old hands warn that the market may never recapture its heady past. Sir Brian Goswell, head of Healey &amp; Baker's City office, said: 'The market is slow in relation to the late 1980s but activity is normal from a long-term point of view. The difference is that agency fees are much lower than in the past. The feel-good factor among agents is simply not there.'</p>

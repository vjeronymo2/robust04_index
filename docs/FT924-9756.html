			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / East Durham miners offered business incentives FORMER MINERS starting their own businesses are to be offered factories and offices on the edge of the East Durham coalfield rent-free for a year. Helical Bar, the property company which in 1987 acquired the residual assets of the Peterlee and Aycliffe new-town corporations, says its offer, opened yesterday, will be available to any British Coal employees made redundant since June last year. Three units at Aycliffe and 21 at Peterlee are on offer. Helical Bar chief executive Mr Mike Slade said ex-miners would pay Pounds 20 a month for a unit on average - to cover insurance and ground maintenance - instead of Pounds 250.</p>

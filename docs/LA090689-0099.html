			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NANCY REAGAN OPENS WOMEN'S CONFERENCE;  </P> <P> TALK FOCUSES ON ANTI-DRUG DRIVE, WHITE HOUSE YEARS  </P> <P> Former First Lady Nancy Reagan opened the annual Southern California Conference  on Women on Tuesday with a half-hour talk that highlighted her anti-drug  campaign and her tumultuous eight years in the White House as "wife of the most  powerful man on earth."  </P> <P> Organizers of the Anaheim conference had barred the media from covering the  first day of events, including Mrs. Reagan's speech, citing security reasons  and the former First Lady's wishes to keep reporters out. However, Mark  Weinberg, a spokesman for Nancy Reagan, disputed that.  </P> <P> "I think the whole organization (sponsoring the conference) is not desirous of  the press. Mrs. Reagan had no objections whatsoever," Weinberg told several  reporters who simply paid the $35 conference fee and observed Mrs. Reagan's  talk with 3,500 others.  </P> <P> Chief conference organizer Karen L. Smith, approached after the talk, declined  to comment on the barring of the media.  </P> <P> The annual conference has been bathed in controversy recently because its  original sponsor, state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), paid about  $200,000 in fees to his wife, Margene, and conference organizer Smith, who is  his Orange County field coordinator. Campbell has disassociated himself from  the conference, although Smith is still its primary organizer. Feminists had,  in the past, protested the conference, charging that Campbell has frequently  voted against women's issues in the Legislature. Campbell is a staunch opponent  of abortion.  </P> <P> But the former First Lady's talk Tuesday was anything but controversial.  Basically, she covered the same material she had mentioned in several  post-White House interviews.  </P> <P> Peppered with self-deprecating humor and references to "Ronnie," Mrs. Reagan  talked about the "highs" and "lows" of her eight-year stint in the nation's  capital, from the bad publicity she received over replacing the White House  china to the media scrutiny her husband's surgeries attracted.  </P> <P> Those years, she said, "probably changed me forever."  </P> <P> A First Family doesn't "just move in to the White House," she said. "You learn  to live there. . . . But I really came to love that house."  </P> <P> Among the high points: "In one week, I was in the Kremlin (with the  Gorbachevs), Buckingham Palace with Queen Elizabeth and Disney World with  foster grandparents."  </P> <P> She said the lowest point in her White House years came with the attempted  assassination on Ronald Reagan, "when the bullet came within an inch of my  husband's heart. Actually," she added, "I think the bullet got closer to my  heart."  </P> <P> Although her spokesman said Mrs. Reagan had no objection to press coverage of  her talk, and she stressed to the audience that she "would not trade our time  in the White House for anything, the tremendous scrutiny of the media" had both  "hurt" and frustrated her.  </P> <P> "It really is like nothing you've ever imagined," she said with a sigh.  </P> <P> "Remember the china?" she asked, then paused. The crowd laughed. She sighed  again. "Well, believe me, there was a time when I never wanted to hear the word  china again." Mrs. Reagan explained that the new replacement china cost  taxpayers nothing; it was donated.  </P> <P> "Remember my sprucing up some rooms in the White House," she asked  rhetorically. "And remember the flap over the designer dresses?"  </P> <P> Each question was answered with laughter and applause by the crowd, which gave  her two standing ovations and clearly admired her.  </P> <P> Especially difficult, Mrs. Reagan said, were the media accounts -- quoting  former Cabinet officials -- of her alleged influence on the President.  </P> <P> "You can imagine how surprised I was to read I was calling the shots on the  nuclear arms race," she quipped.  </P> <P> Dressed in a pink floral dress and appearing relaxed, Mrs. Reagan used humorous  anecdotes to charm the audience. There was the story of how her husband  accidentally pinned an important dignitary to the woman's chair when the  President accidentally "planted (his feet) on the back of her dress," she said.  </P> <P> "And there was the time when I was wooing a wealthy woman to contribute to the  White House Historical Fund. And my wrap-around skirt unwrapped, and fell  around my ankles," she said to more laughs. "And there I was."  </P> <P> She also discussed her highly publicized campaign against drug abuse whose  watchword is "Just Say No," calling it a five-year battle to convince America  that drugs are indeed a national problem.  </P> <P> Although she stopped short of criticizing President Bush's efforts, Mrs. Reagan  did say that the country's attention should be shifted from foreign countries  that export drugs, like Colombia, to education and the consumer. Her drug  comments were particularly popular with the crowd.  </P> <P> Asked to share a few details of her upcoming book, "My Turn," Mrs. Reagan  declined, saying her publisher has adamantly ordered her not to.  </P> <P> Despite the expressed concern over security, Mrs. Reagan arrived in a limousine  at the front of the hotel, and guests who entered the ballroom to hear her  underwent no special security measures. Secret Service agents stood discreetly  at each side of the stage.  </P> <P> However, several reporters, photographers and television crews were turned away  from the registration desk Tuesday morning by three different organizers who  refused to identify themselves. They claimed that there were "security  problems" with Nancy Reagan, the day's keynote speaker.  </P> <P> Conference organizers claimed that they were following the her wishes.  </P> <P> "This is mass confusion," said one harried organizer. "We invited everybody in  the press, and now they can't come to hear her."  </P> <P> The 7-year-old conference has attracted a bevy of Hollywood personalities, as  well as women leaders in business and politics. Keynote speakers have included  television personality Oprah Winfrey and exercise guru Richard Simmons,  astronaut Sally Ride and Labor Secretary Elizabeth H. Dole, who previously  served as secretary of transportation.  </P> <P> It has grown from a one-day conference that attracted only 500 participants to  a three-day stint at the Anaheim Marriott with 75 seminars and an expected  attendance of more than 10,000 women.  </P></p>

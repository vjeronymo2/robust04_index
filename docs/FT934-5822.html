			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / How To Spend It: A sale to suit ANYONE who finds him or herself in London next Saturday might like to take note that one of the twice-yearly Menswear Designer sales is happening at the Kensington Hilton Hotel, Holland Park Avenue, London W14. The women's version of the event has become something of an institution with many a stylishly dressed woman-about-town buying most of her wardrobe needs at one or other of these sales. What they have to offer is designer wear at very reduced prices. Most of the garments are either excess production or this season's designs that have been over-ordered. Everything on sale has to be at least half the shop price or less. Next Saturday is a chance for the man-about-the-house to replenish his wardrobe. Natty Italian suits (no names allowed but suffice it to say that they come from the biggest names in the land), chic French ones, some English suits, starting at about Pounds 100, lots of casual wear, shoes, socks, shirts, jumpers, overcoats - all the staples of the male wardrobe. The sale is on from 10 am to 5 pm. Entrance fee Pounds 2.</p>

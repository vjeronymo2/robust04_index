			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Ucatt announces redundancies UCATT, the construction union, is to make redundant nearly 10 per cent of its staff because of a decline in membership. Last year the union had a Pounds 500,000 deficit and lost at least 5,000 members. Membership stands at just over 200,000. Sixteen clerical workers will lose their jobs, out of a total of 181 officials and staff. Criteria by which the redundancies will be selected have yet to be agreed with the GMB general union which represents the clerical workers. Mr George Brumwell, Ucatt general secretary, said the cuts were aimed at enabling the union to 'weather the recession and stay independent'.</p>

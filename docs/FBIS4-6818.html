			<p>BFN     [Text] The Taiwanese Government has approved requests from  local companies to recruit more than 100,000 Thai workers  despite frequent news reports Taiwan will stop employing foreign  labor, said Labor and Social Welfare Minister Phaithun Kaeothong  yesterday.    Mr Phaithun said Israel had also shown an interest in  employing 5,000 more Thai workers and South Korea says it wants  to hire 20,000-30,000 workers from Thailand.    The minister was asked about news reports that Taiwan was  considering stopping the recruitment of foreign labor.    He said he had heard frequent reports of this kind.    Taiwan has approved requests from companies to recruit  117,000 Thai workers, equal to 68 per cent of its total foreign  workforce.    Mr Phaithun said the Labor and Social Welfare Ministry  yesterday issued an announcement fixing the brokerage fees which  job placement companies can collect from workers in order to  cope with Taiwan's requirements.    The announcement stipulates a company sending workers to  Taiwan can demand no more than 25,000 baht plus a month's salary  from each worker.    The company may charge the workers airfares for a single  trip  unless the airfares are provided by the employers.    Workers must pay for other expenses such as medical  examinations, skills tests, the translation of documents and  passports.    Brokerage fees collected from workers destined for other  countries will differ, said Mr Phaithun. He said one measure to  control the 174 job placement companies supplying workers to  Taiwan was a requirement that they set up a central organization  to make sure all companies comply strictly with the ministry  announcement. He said the ministry had also been contacted by  Israeli firms wanting about 5,000 Thai workers.    Ministry officials have been instructed to check the work  sites to see if they are secure enough.    South Korea has also shown an interest in recruiting 20,000-  30,000 Thai workers for factories in the form of job training  similar to in Japan. The employment is on the condition that  the workers must have worked for South Korean companies in  Thailand, said Mr Phaithun.</p>

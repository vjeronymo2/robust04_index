The spending, included among the additional outlays for  public works projects, is aimed primarily at improving the  foundation of agriculture and expanding the scale of farms, they  said. The decision is a follow-up to a new global trade  agreement reached last December under the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Uruguay Round accord calls for  opening Japan's rice market to imports.    Of the total expenditures for beefing up agriculture, 145  billion yen will be allocated by the government itself,  officials said.    Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata had  high marks for the decision, saying, "The stage has been set  (for dealing adequately with the effect of the Uruguay Round  agreement on domestic farmers)."</p>

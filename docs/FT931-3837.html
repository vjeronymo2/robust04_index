			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Saints aims for best of both worlds  -Investment Trusts / Philip Coggan reports on Scottish American, which offers both income and an international flavour THE INVESTOR who wants an international portfolio often has to sacrifice income. But Scottish American Investment Company - or Saints, as it prefers to be called - pays quarterly dividends and offers a yield of 4 per cent, barely below the present return on the UK market. The trust was founded in 1873 to invest in US railway bonds. At the time, they were offering 3 per cent when gilts were returning just 2 per cent. The American flavour lasted until the early 1980s, when the trust had 30 per cent of its assets in the region, but the holding has fallen to 11.5 per cent. That is one reason the trust prefers the name Saints to its official title. Like many other Scottish trust groups, it was managed by a firm of Edinburgh lawyers which needed a vehicle to manage its clients' money. It was not until 1970 that a separate management company, Stewart Fund Managers, was established. This, in in turn, merged with Ivory &amp; Company in 1985 to become Stewart Ivory. The present manager is Teddy Tulloch, who joined the firm in 1972 and has been looking after Saints since 1985. He is responsible for asset allocation, but stocks are selected by specialist regional teams. Outside the UK, the trust concentrates on growth-oriented stocks, looking for those with high returns on equity, a strong balance sheet and a positive cash flow. Its UK portfolio has to pay the dividends, so the managers aim for a yield on this portion of around 25 per cent above that on the All-Share index. The 10 largest investments at December 31 were: Davis Service, Independent Insurance, British Telecommunications, Bowater, Christian Salvesen, British Gas, Shell, Powell Duffryn, Boots, and Value &amp; Income Trust. Many trusts gear up (borrow to invest in shares) on the ground that returns from equities beat fixed-interest returns in the long run. But the managers of Saints have set themselves a challenging task. Its main form of borrowing is an issue of unsecured loan stock, which rises in line with the FT-A All-Share index. The argument is that a manager ought to be able to beat the All-Share - otherwise, why employ him? Nevertheless, it means that if the manager does have a bad year investing the gross assets, the effect on the net assets will be doubly bad since the indexed stock (worth Pounds 67.6m at the end of 1992) will have risen in value. Stewart Ivory can take some steps to reduce this risk by hedging in the futures market. As the graph shows, the trust has kept pace with the All-Share only over the past 10 years. It had two bad periods - one in the early 1980s, when it was stuck with too many unquoted oil stocks; and another late in 1989, when it was over-exposed to small companies. Over the past two years, however, the record has improved. Although the trust is 14th out of 19 in the international general sector over seven years, with a return of 142.9 per cent, it is eighth out of 21 over two years. (Figures from Finstat are mid-market to mid-market, with income re-invested over the period to March 1). Allowing for the UK gearing of 20 per cent, the trust's net exposure to UK equities was around 46.7 per cent at end-1992, with other assets split between North America (11.5 per cent), continental Europe (8.1), Japan (5.6), Pacific Rim (8.1), unquoted (6.7), fixed interest (10.3) and others (3.0). The trust has had some success in attracting individual investors (who now own around half) and the discount has narrowed to 13 per cent, compared with 22 per cent at end-1987. The annual report of the company is one of the best in the investment trust field, with clear breakdowns of the portfolio by sector and stocks. Key facts. According to NatWest Securities Limited, the net assets per share on March 10 were 168p, putting the shares, at 145p, on a discount of 13.7 per cent. The net assets of the trust were around Pounds 375m on that basis, and the gross assets around Pounds 450m. The market capitalisation was Pounds 325m and the yield 4 per cent. The manager's annual fee is 0.25 per cent of shareholders' funds, plus 3.5 per cent of total income less borrowing costs. Board. All the directors are independent of the managers. Jack Shaw, the chairman, is deputy governor of the Bank of Scotland. Other directors are: William Berry, senior partner of legal firm of Murray, Beith and Murray; Sir James Mellon, chairman of Scottish Homes; Dr Janet Morgan, an author and director of WH Smith; and Barry Sealey, director of Scottish Equitable. Savings scheme and PEP details. The minimum investment in the savings scheme is Pounds 25 a month, or Pounds 250 for a lump sum. There is an initial charge of Pounds 10 plus VAT, which is deducted from the first payment. The trust is fully Pepable; there is an annual charge of Pounds 25 plus VAT. For those who buy the trust through an independent financial adviser, there might be a charge of 3 per cent plus VAT. This is a change from Saints' previous policy when investors had to pay commission even if they did not consult an adviser. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,800 for a lump sum, or Pounds 150 a month.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Observer: Departure rate One by one the contenders who missed out on the editor's job at The Economist are jumping ship. Mike Elliott, the former Washington bureau chief, has long since left to be Newsweek's diplomatic editor and yesterday Matt Ridley, the youngest of the bunch who left last year, picked up his first non-executive directorship at the Northern Rock Building Society. Now comes news that Jim Rohwer, the mag's executive editor, is quitting after 13 years to join CS First Boston's economics team. The 45-year-old Californian only returned to London this year after three years as Asia correspondent. Now he is heading back to Hong Kong where he will provide the big picture on the region's fast-growing economies. His arrival at CS First Boston should help raise the average age of the firm's teenage scribblers.</p>

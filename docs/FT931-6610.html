			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Indian budget signals loosening of economic reins A WEEK ago, a leading Indian economist said he believed the finance minister would 'wait another six to nine months before letting the economy go. There's so much he still has to put right.' But Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, decided not to wait. This weekend's budget is a bet that, after a squeeze which started in mid-1991, the Indian economy is now ready for solid and long-lasting expansion. It is also an acknowledgement that, after the Ayodhya crisis, Mr P V Narasimha Rao's government is in need of recovering popular support for itself and for economic reform. As Mr Singh said in his budget speech: 'I have used this budget as an opportunity to put economic and social development firmly back on the national agenda.' Initial indications are that Mr Singh has succeeded - at least temporarily. Most industrialists, economists and newspaper columnists welcomed his budget. The question is whether there will be an economic price to be paid for this burst of popularity. Mr Singh had the scope to prime the economy principally because of the severity of the previous austerity drive which has cut inflation rapidly and reduced the fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit has dropped from 8.4 per cent in 1990-1991 to just over 5 per cent. Officials said that if they left revenue and spending policies unchanged, the deficit would fall in 1993-94 to 3.5 per cent. Tax relief, mainly reductions in customs duties, will inject some Rs45bn (Pounds 1.03bn) into the economy. The largest duty cuts will come on capital goods, raw materials and components - so manufacturers will benefit, though they are expected to pass on gains to consumers. Industry is also pleased with the 1 percentage point cut in interest rates and with tax breaks for investments in key sectors such as power. Mr R C Bhargava, the chairman of Maruti, a leading car maker, commented: 'The days of recession are over.' The increases in public spending are aimed at ameliorating some of India's chronic weaknesses and winning support for economic reform from poorer people who benefit little from import duty cuts. Project spending in rural development is going up by 62 per cent, in education 37 per cent and in power investment 22 per cent. The exchange rate reform will also tend to increase government spending. Until this weekend, India has operated two exchange rates - a market rate (last week Rs33 to the Dollars ) and an official rate (Rs26). Exporters and other owners of foreign exchange have been required to change 60 per cent of their funds at market rates and 40 per cent at official rates. The official rate is now abolished - so the government must buy foreign exchange at market prices. Finance ministry officials argue that now is an opportune time to end their squeeze and float the rupee. World oil prices, interest rates and inflation rates are low, so India is cushioned against price shocks. They hope the G7 developed countries' efforts to stimulate growth will boost Indian exports - perhaps by 15 per cent in 1993-94. Export-led growth would promote non-inflationary expansion at home and fund the imports India needs to equip and modernise its industry. If the economy develops as planned, Congress (I) can fight elections this year or next, basking in the glow of prosperity. While general elections are not due until 1996, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the right-wing Hindu party whose supporters stormed the Ayodhya mosque, is demanding an early poll. Elections in four states where BJP governments have been suspended are likely to be held this year. However, three potential dangers loom on the economic horizon. First, with 70 per cent of the labour force in agriculture, India's economic progress is still critically dependent on the weather. A good monsoon last year boosted growth; a poor one now could hinder it and fuel inflation. Next, exporters may not be able to respond quickly to the rupee's flotation, even though it should increase their revenues. Indian manufacturers still suffer from foreign buyers' doubts about quality and delivery schedules. If exports stay sluggish but imports grow in response to duty cuts, the current account deficit will soar, putting expansion in jeopardy. Finally, Mr Singh has postponed some difficult issues such as extending the scope of the tax net. There is no mention of plans for labour law reform - including increasing employers' rights to sack redundant workers. There is political advantage from these delays - but economic modernisation will require that these problems are tackled. Mr Singh is aware serious structural reforms are still needed. His budget contains substantial moves to prepare India's financial system for liberalisation. Notably, the government is injecting Rs57bn in capital into the state-owned banks to help them provide for bad debt. Mr Singh is also cutting the funds they must lend at low rates to the government - from 36 per cent of deposits to 25 per cent over three years - thus releasing more funds for commercial lending. Further, there are measures to beef up supervision of banking and securities after last year's Bombay securities scandal. There is no doubting Mr Singh's personal commitment to pro-market reform. However, it is worth remembering that the initial impetus for reform came not from any ideological conversion in favour of free markets in the finance ministry but from the shock of a balance of payments crisis. As the memory of that crisis fades, so it will become more difficult to advance politically unpopular changes. THE MAIN POINTS The Rupee is to be fully floated from today. The present two exchange rates, official and market, will be replaced by a single market rate. Import duties slashed with maximum rate cut from 110 per cent to 85 per cent. General capital goods rate cut from 55 per cent to 35 per cent with further cuts for export-oriented industries and power generation and distribution. Interest rates cut by 1 percentage point. A five-year tax holiday for investments in power, plus other incentives. Public funds for state-owned banks to provide for bad loans. Permission for banks to raise funds on capital markets. Increases in public investment in power, petroleum and natural gas. Increases in spending on agricultural development, education and infrastructure. Cuts in domestic excise duties expected to reduce prices of consumer goods including cars, television sets, refrigerators, cosmetics and biscuits. No change in basic income or corporation taxes.</p>

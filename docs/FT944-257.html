			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / BA and Virgin reopen price war British Airways will today announce its biggest batch of ticket bargains since its World Offer programme was launched in March, with cut-price fares available on more than 200 routes. The move brought an immediate response from Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic airline, which said it would undercut BA's prices by Pounds 1 on all routes which the two airlines both operate. BA said savings on the usual lowest return fares range from Pounds 10-Pounds 20 on domestic routes to Pounds 454 for flights to Manila.</p>

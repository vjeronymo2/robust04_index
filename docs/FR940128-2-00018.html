			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 11: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  KT reported an average home market packing labor expense for the POI based on the packing labor expenses incurred during each month of the period. Petitioners contend that the Department should use the monthly packing labor expenses in calculating KT's home market packing expenses instead of the POI average. Petitioners assert that the Department's longstanding policy is to use data that are as sales-specific as possible. According to petitioners, in this case the most specific data available are the monthly costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> KT argues that using monthly packing labor costs would distort KT's per unit packing expenses. KT maintains that it is appropriate to spread packing labor expenses over the sales quantities during the entire six-month POI because of fluctuations in monthly sales volumes. KT asserts that this methodology yields a more representative per unit expense for the POI because packing labor is a fixed cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with KT. Normally, the Department prefers respondents to report transaction-specific expenses under the theory that individual prices are set to cover individual ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , transaction-specific) costs. In this case, however, the costs are not transaction-specific. Moreover, because KT's packing labor expenses are fixed, they do not vary by sales volume. Therefore, fluctuations in the monthly sales volumes create differences in the monthly average expense amounts. Because these fluctuations in sales expenses are not translated into changes in the per unit prices, they distort the margin calculation. We agree with KT that using the POI-average minimizes the effect of these fluctuations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we find that the POI average is more representative of KT's per unit packing labor costs. Accordingly, we have accepted this average for purposes of the final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 12: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  KT argues that the Department should affirm its preliminary determination that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to KT's exports of subject merchandise to the United States. KT maintains that there is no history of dumping of subject merchandise imported from Malaysia. In addition, KT claims that its exports were not massive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree. See, the Critical Circumstances section of this notice for further discussion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 13: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Both KT and petitioners contend that the Department should calculate KT's short-term interest rate on U.S. dollar-denominated loans using the interest expenses incurred and the principal outstanding denominated in U.S. dollars rather than U.S. dollar-amounts converted to Malaysian Ringitts. KT notes that calculating the interest rate in this way eliminates from the calculation the effect of exchange rate fluctuations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree. At verification, we noted that KT had calculated its U.S. interest rate by converting U.S. dollar-denominated loans and interest payments to Malaysian Ringitts. We recalculated its interest rate based on the original currency of the loans and the interest payments ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , U.S. dollars) and used this revised rate in our U.S. credit calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 14: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Respondent argues that the Department should calculate KT's U.S. credit period using the date of invoice, rather than date of shipment from the factory. Respondent states that the invoice date is same as the bill of lading date and is the date on which the merchandise is shipped from Malaysia. Respondent adds that because the bill of lading date is the date on which the merchandise leaves KT's possession, the Department would be overstating KT's credit expenses for its U.S. sales if it used an earlier date. However, KT contends that, should the Department find it necessary to use shipment dates, the Department should use the shipment dates in its October 29, 1993, submission. KT notes that these data were verified by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners argue that KT's proposed methodology of using bill of lading date in its U.S. credit calculation should not be used by the Department in the final determination. Petitioners assert that this methodology is contrary to the Department's longstanding policy as stated in the Preliminary Determination of Sale at Less than Fair Value: Welded Stainless Steel Pipe from Malaysia, 58 FR 47,120 (September 7, 1993). Petitioners maintain that the Department should use the shipment dates submitted by KT on October 29, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Money Markets: No joy in sterling THE POUND may have firmed slightly on the foreign exchanges yesterday, but sentiment in the sterling money markets remained decidedly bearish. In the morning, dealers had been nervously expecting sterling to dip below DM2.83, increasing the chances of another base rate rise to halt the currency's fall. There was relief to see it peak at DM2.8413 in the mid-morning, but one dealer put this down to technical factors. 'The Forex market was caught short of sterling and there was a technical move to get back into the currency,' he said. The underlying trend is still gloomy, and many believe that a drop down to DM2.82 is on the cards. Yesterday's decision by the Bank of Spain to lift its key interest rate by 60 basis points added to the pressure on the Bank of England to tighten policy. Dealers did not feel that the UK's decision to tighten controls on government spending had much impact. 'It is a bit of good housekeeping and little more,' said one dealer. 'They are not cutting expenditure, just ensuring that they stay within this year's targets.' Period rates therefore ended the day a little firmer. One-month money closed unchanged at 10 3/16 per cent offered. But everything from 3-month money to 1-year rose to 10 3/8 from 10 5/16 per cent. Trading in sterling futures was a little more bullish than in the cash. But this was because futures traders took sterling's rise at face value, without looking at the underlying factors. In the morning the September short sterling contract dipped six basis points to 89.63 because of currency fears. But as these evaporated for the day, it shot up to finish at 89.72. The December contract fell before closing 4 basis points down on the day at 89.96. The Bank of England forecast another surprisingly low shortage of Pounds 500m in the morning but the market was slow to take it out. The shortages this week have so far amounted to only Pounds 2.8bn. At the start of the week, it had looked as though they might amount to Pounds 4.5bn, so a tough finish may be in store today. The Bank did not operate in the morning. In the afternoon it purchased Pounds 144m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and gave late assistance of Pounds 70m.</p>

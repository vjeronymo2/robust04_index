			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: UK banks seek new identity on Wall Street - Patrick Harverson examines the strategy of 'Americanisation' among foreign securities firms in the US It is just after 7am on a winter morning in New York as 30 equity analysts and salesmen cram into a conference room in the offices of S. G. Warburg, the UK investment bank. Almost everyone in the room is American. The only hint that Warburg is a UK firm is the English voice over the speakerphone - and that is coming from Hong Kong. A similar meeting is taking place at the downtown offices of NatWest Securities, the US offshoot of another UK bank. As at Warburg, there is little to suggest NatWest is a UK firm. Of the 250 staff in its equities division in New York, only 20 are from the UK. At Warburg, just 12 of 257 are British. Like other foreign securities firms seeking to establish a presence in the US, UK investment banks have adopted a strategy of 'Americanisation'. Once the New York units were mere outposts, staffed by expatriates eager to earn their spurs before returning home to promotion. Today, they operate as US firms in their own right, employing local talent to target niches in local markets, as well as carrying on the traditional business of selling US securities to international clients and advising on cross-border transactions. The change has been most marked at Warburg and NatWest, two firms that tried, and mostly failed, in the 1980s and early 1990s to earn respect on Wall Street. At NatWest, an attempt to build a US equities business ran into trouble when the London head office balked at the extent of the New York operation's independence. Mr Arthur Kirsch, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert equities chief who had been hired to run County NatWest Securities (as it was then called), 'did not want to integrate the US operation with the UK and the rest of the global network,' explains Mr James O'Donnell, current chief executive of the New York unit. Under Mr Kirsch, NatWest also tried to break into mainstream US equities trading, but with little success against Wall Street competition. Mr Kirsch left at the end of 1992. At Warburg, a lack of ambition was the problem. For years, the firm's New York office had been run by British bankers temporarily posted to the US. Their lack of knowledge and experience of local markets meant the unit stayed small, sleepy and not particularly profitable. After these contrasting experiences, Warburg and NatWest are trying to forge new identities on Wall Street - and they have set their sights high. Mr Thomas Wyman, Warburg's chairman in New York, says the US operation has to build a name for itself on Wall Street if its parent is to prosper as a global adviser and investment bank. 'Major American corporations don't want to deal with branch offices. They want to deal with banks,' he says. Warburg is focusing on three areas: research; domestic and international sales and trading; and investment banking, particularly underwriting US stock issues. Since March 1992, when Mr Ed Olsen was hired from Salomon Brothers to run Warburg's equities department, the number of US-based analysts has risen from 14 to 34. Warburg has beefed up its share of trading in foreign and US stocks and now ranks fifth among firms trading American depositary receipts. Although it only ranks 25th among Wall Street houses trading New York Stock Exchange listed issues, its volume of listed business has trebled since 1992. Warburg has also grown quickly in equity underwriting, albeit from a tiny base. In 1992, it underwrote four equity deals in the US, lead-managing two. Last year, it took part in 22 deals, leading 11 - crucially seven of these were issues of stock by US companies. Most of these deals were small, however, and few involved big corporate names. The one headline-grabber was a Dollars 113m equity issue for Cummins Engine. Mr Olsen sees further progress in 1994, predicting that by midsummer Warburg will have passed last year's underwriting total. One reason for the increased confidence is the new freedom granted by its parent. Mr Wyman says: 'We have acquired a large measure of self-reliance and independence.' Crucial decisions, such as how much capital is committed to equities trading, are now made in New York, not London. At NatWest Securities, the original problem was too much autonomy. Unlike Mr Kirsch, however, the current chief executive, Mr O'Donnell, worked for NatWest in London and has a good relationship with top management there. NatWest's strategy is two-fold: to become the top non-US equity trading and underwriting firm on Wall Street, and to develop a profitable business in a few specialised sectors, such as researching, and underwriting US equities. It has already climbed from 30th among ADR traders two years ago to ninth. In equities, it ranks 15th among traders of NYSE-listed securities, the highest ranking of a non-US firm, excluding the Anglo-American Wertheim Schroder. As an underwriter, NatWest was involved in 53 deals worth Dollars 14.6bn last year, up from 23 worth Dollars 1.4bn in 1992. It lead-managed 47 US corporate issues, with an average size of more than Dollars 100m. After all the hiring of staff and aggressive pursuit of new business, are Warburg and NatWest making money in New York? Neither firm would disclose details, but Mr Wyman said Warburg's performance was ahead of his expectations. 'We will be a more than useful contributor to group earnings.' At NatWest, Mr O'Donnell said revenues in the current fiscal year should be 20 - 30 per cent up on the previous year's Dollars 100m-plus total. His goal is to take revenues to Dollars 250m over the next two to three years. But a question remains. Both firms have expanded their US equities business during a Wall Street boom. What happens when market activity slows, when institutional investors stop buying and when companies issue less stock? Both claim that growth is being carefully controlled. But, for the time being at least, there is so much work to do that neither seems worried about under-employed staff.</p>

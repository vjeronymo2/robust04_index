			<p>BFN     [Text] In Guangzhou this afternoon, the provincial  government ceremoniously held a meeting to present scientific  and technical awards. This is one of the important parts of  this year's scientific and technical progress month in our  province.    Provincial leading comrades who attended the meeting  included  Xie Fei, Zhu Senlin, Huang Huahua, Lu Ruihua, Lu Zhonghe, Cheng  Zhiqing, Zhang Zhanxia, and others. The state scientific and  technical awards were conferred on 22 projects, and provincial  scientific and technical awards on 163 projects involving a  total of 265 units and 915 persons throughout the province.    Governor Zhu Senlin made a speech at the meeting in which he  said: To attain Guangdong's strategic target of basically  realizing its modernizations by 2010, our province's annual  increase in GDP must reach over 12.9 percent. To accomplish  this strenuous task, it is very important for us to rely on  scientific and technical progress. For this reason, a number of  key laboratories should be established throughout the province,  in addition to technical research and development centers that  are closely linked with production enterprises. We also should  develop technical popularization networks in various localities  and trades. We should actively develop the technology market,  and should encourage scientific and technical research units and  personnel to run enterprises, or to become shareholders of  enterprises in a form of scientific and technical investment to  promote the integration of the market, scientific research, and  production.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei lower after active trading in theme stocks ARBITRAGE unwinding depressed share prices yesterday, although sentiment was also weak on the decline in the yen and Tuesday's fall on Wall Street, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 102.17 to 17,742.87, after a high of 17,972.20 and a low of 17,576.07. Traders blamed late arbitrage-related selling by a leading US broker. Volume rose from 182m shares to 260m on active theme stock trading by Japanese houses. Advances led declines by 448 to 444 with 207 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks added rose 0.25 to 1,347.24 while, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.38 to 1,058.62. Pension funds and investment trusts were seen placing buying orders at lower levels. Life insurance companies also said that they intended to pick up blue chips if the index were to fall further. Traders said that most foreign houses were expecting the index to fall sharply on the futures expiration this Friday. However, leading Japanese brokers have maintained a bullish stance. Daiwa Securities said that the Nikkei should recover the 19,000 level due to a 'technical rebound'. Bio-technology and chemical stocks led activity. Meiji Milk Products was the most active issue of the day, gaining Y2 to Y994, and Nissan Chemical rose Y29 to Y766. Environmental-related theme stocks were also targeted by dealers, with Japan Storage Battery advancing Y20 to Y1,080 and Penta-Ocean Construction up Y2 to Y962. Weak earnings prospects pulled down Toyota Motor, which fell Y20 to Y1,490 on reports of an 8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year ending June 1993. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y11,000 to Y609,000. Investors failed to react to the company's announcement of telephone charge discounts and free prepaid telephone cards for its shareholders. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 13.64 to 20,483.91 in volume of 11.2m shares. Roundup WEAKNESS in the US affected some markets yesterday. HONG KONG fell on profit-taking but HSBC bucked the trend following Tuesday's decline to close 75 cents higher at HKDollars 45.50. The Hang Seng index lost 22.69 to 5,917.50 in turnover of HKDollars 3.84bn. SINGAPORE advanced on good gains in blue chip stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 19.30 to 1,511.41. SEOUL was prevented from falling further after intervention by the stabilisation fund. The composite index closed 1.11 higher at 562.87 in turnover up from Won191.8bn to Won206.9bn .

MANILA rose on buying of oil stocks and the composite index advanced 5.09 to 1,573.34. KUALA LUMPUR was higher on bargain hunting with the composite index up 4.85 to 589.52. Losers outpaced gainers by 119 to 105. AUSTRALIA weakened with the banking sector dragging prices lower. The all ordinaries closed 8.7 lower at 1,665.8. BANGKOK bided its time ahead of the announcement of a new premier. The SET index rose 2.91 to 687.38 in thin turnover of Bt2.91bn. JAKARTA firmed on a peaceful poll and the return to power of President Suharto's party, the Jardine Fleming index rising 1.40 to 69.62.</p>

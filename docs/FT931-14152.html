			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Management: GrandMet toughens options criteria Nestled inside the 1992 Grand Metropolitan annual report circulated this week are details of tough new criteria for executive share options. At the company's AGM next month, shareholders will be asked to approve a scheme which requires the GrandMet share price to have out-performed the FTSE-100 index for more than three years before any option can be exercised. In a corporate governance statement in the annual report, Richard Giordano, GrandMet's deputy chairman and chairman of the appraisal and remuneration committee, says the scheme 'provides a proper balance between motivating and rewarding management on the one hand and protecting shareholder interests on the other'. GrandMet's previous executive share option schemes, adopted in 1983, are now up for renewal. The company argues that the schemes 'materially contributed' to its success and should continue. Its two new schemes could trigger the issue of up to 205m shares over the 10-year life of the options, or 10 per cent of current equity. In the past, any increase in the share price over the three years allowed executives to exercise their options at the price at which the option was given to them. Under the new criteria, the option at the original price can only be exercised if GrandMet's share price not only beats the FTSE-100, but also is maintained above the index for at least six months over a period of three years - to remove the effect of any short-term fluctuations. If this has not been achieved in the first five years after the options are granted, then the shares must beat the index over five years. The scheme appears to echo the guidelines issued last September by the National Association of Pension Funds, Britain's largest shareholder group. It argued that there was concern over whether earnings per share  - the usual key criterion for options - were a reliable indicator of corporate performance. Angus Matheson, chairman of the NAPF's investment committee, welcomed the proposals as one of the first to meet its guidelines.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Peace plan poised on a hair trigger: A look at the potentially momentous outcome of secret Israeli-PLO talks Jericho, for all that its name resonates with history, now seems just another sleepy, dusty Palestinian town in the Israeli-occupied part of the Jordan valley. But if an extraordinary deal hammered out in secret by Israeli and Palestinian representatives in recent weeks becomes reality, it may just be in for something of a revival. If it is consummated and implemented, Israeli troops will withdraw from the Jericho area and from the Gaza Strip, both of which they have occupied since the six-day war of June 1967. For the first time since the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948, their Arab inhabitants will be allowed substantial control over their own affairs as part of a five-year interim arrangement for Palestinian self-rule. And with a lot of luck, a conflict that has claimed thousands of lives and several times brought the world close to war in the past 45 years will have taken a small but momentous step towards resolution. A signed accord between Israel and the Palestinians would itself be of enormous psychological significance, especially if it entails mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, a body that Israelis have grown used to excoriating as a terrorist group bent on their destruction. Progress in Israeli-Palestinian talks could also trigger movement in separate peace negotiations between Israel and Syria, which could - eventually - open the way to a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement. These developments would have seemed all but inconceivable even a few weeks ago. The Arab-Israeli peace talks launched in Madrid in November 1991 had dragged on for 22 months with little tangible sign of progress, and no sign of preparedness by the Israelis or Palestinians to budge from long-entrenched positions. Now, all of a sudden, almost anything seems possible - even, someone suggested yesterday, a summit meeting between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's dour, growling prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, mercurial chairman of the PLO. Small wonder that seasoned Middle Eastern observers were yesterday reeling in disbelief - or that sceptics were pointing to the many hurdles that have still to be surmounted. What has stimulated the current anticipation is the fact that Israel - in the person of Mr Shimon Peres, the country's veteran foreign minister - and the PLO have already apparently reached an outline agreement. According to Israeli and Palestinian officials, the document was finalised at a secret meeting last week in Norway between Mr Peres and Abu Mazen, the PLO official responsible for peace talks. It is expected to be signed formally at the Washington peace talks, which enter their eleventh round this week. Many of the most difficult and sensitive details remain obscure. But what is known is that it outlines a comprehensive plan for a five-year period of interim Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, two or three years into which 'confidence-building' phase, talks about the final status of a Palestinian 'entity', probably in confederation with Jordan, will begin. At the heart of the agreement is the so-called 'Gaza-Jericho First' plan which envisages an Israeli military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and from a hitherto undefined enclave around Jericho. Gaza, a 360 sq km sliver of land, is home to 780,000 economically deprived Palestinians, many living in sprawling squalid shanty towns. A Palestinian elected interim authority will assume full control over Palestinian affairs in Gaza-Jericho but its powers will fall short of a Palestinian mini-state. In the rest of the occupied West Bank, excluding east Jerusalem, the Palestinians will have lesser powers over their affairs. There are sufficient uncertainties to warrant caution about whether the deal will stick. The extent of Israeli withdrawal, for example, remains unclear. The PLO has said the agreement provides for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and military administration. Jerusalem says the agreement means a troop redeployment away from the population centres in Gaza-Jericho but leaves the Israeli army with a security role for settlers in Gaza and for the critical road between Jerusalem and the Allenby bridge border crossing into Jordan. It is also unclear whether Israel will agree to PLO interpretations of the agreement that as soon as the document is signed the PLO leadership, including Mr Arafat, will be able to relocate to either Jericho or Gaza. Despite the doubts, however, the agreement may be different from the dozens of other peace plans that have littered the map of the Middle East - partly through its design, and partly as a result of the atmosphere in which it has been constructed. Mr Arafat, in particular, has been under intense pressure to strike a deal. As a result it was the the PLO, bereft of powerful friends, crippled by internal dissension, mounting criticism from extremists, and a cash crisis, that played the key role in bringing both sides to a draft settlement. From Mr Rabin's point of view, the deal is carefully crafted to deflect potential domestic criticism. Firstly, it leaves untouched the largest potentially hostile community - the estimated 120,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank. The most directly affected settlers - the small community of 4,000 in Gaza - have long been told that they will eventually have to move. Secondly the agreement has no serious impact on Israel's borders or its security arrangements. Indeed, Mr Rabin can exploit widespread enthusiasm for getting rid of Israel's major security headache - the Gaza Strip, which has long been the scene of the worse Pales-tinian attacks against Israeli soldiers. Thirdly the Israeli public has become gradually accustomed to the government talking to the PLO - a move Mr Rabin argues was implicitly sanctioned by the previous Likud government at the 1991 Madrid conference. Nor - despite mounting accusations of betrayal from the right yesterday - does Mr Rabin need to worry that the proposed deal poses a threat to his coalition. For the moment he has an unshakeable majority in the Knesset of 67 votes to 53. Although his coalition is fragile owing to a continuing row with a small religious party, the Knesset coalition for peace is much more solid. All these factors have led the government to believe it has a window of opportunity now to do a deal with relatively small concessions to the Palestinians. Its attractions to the Israelis are many. It seems to contain PLO concessions on the ultra-sensitive question of who should control Jerusalem, long claimed by Israel as its 'eternal and indivisible capital'. Also, the autonomy arrangements for Gaza-Jericho provide maximum reassurance: although the Palestinians will have full internal powers over education, health, economic policy and housing over the estimated 900,000 population of Gaza-Jericho, Israel will continue to be the predominant authority by virtue of the enclaves' dependence on Israel proper. It is bound to exploit this economic dependence to the limit as a way of ensuring that the interim Palestinian authority toes the line. But the agreement does have its attractions for the 64-year-old Mr Arafat as well. It appears to deliver a tangible and rapid step towards Palestinian self-rule. And it should allow the PLO to make a quick start in tackling the deteriorating conditions of Palestinians in the territories who have been drawn to the Islamic fundamentalism of the Hamas movement. The challenge - to deliver rapid economic improvement to Palestinians in the territories - is herculean. If the PLO fails, Israel would have no reason to cede control over any more of the West Bank. If it succeeds in Gaza-Jericho, however, the Palestinian people may be on the road to claiming a respectable portion of its rightful inheritance.

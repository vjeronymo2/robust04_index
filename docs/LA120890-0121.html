			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDSU HAS ITS HANDS, NOT ITS STANDS, FULL  </P> <P> Among the reasons cited for poor attendance at San Diego State football games  were the availability of so many other things to do in this area and lack of  local media support. Hmm . . .  </P> <P> In that same edition, we are informed that SDSU will make no refunds on tickets  for the SDSU-Miami game, although game time has been changed from 7:05 p.m. to  1 p.m., and some ticket-holders might not be able to make the earlier start.  </P> <P> Those with "serious conflict" will be "accommodated" by having their tickets  exchanged for a game (of equal or greater value?) next season. Contractual  agreements with fans be damned.  </P> <P> SDSU should consider changing its nickname from the Aztecs to the Cavaliers.  </P> <P> HENRY COPELAND  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries stage recovery in quiet trading session US Treasuries recovered from early weakness yesterday in a quiet, technically-driven session following Tuesday's powerful rally. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/32 lower at 87 27/32 , with the yield rising to 7.249 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was  1/32 better at 99 15/32 , to yield 5.394 per cent. An uneasy calm descended as the session opened. Bonds showed modest gains in early activity, as dealers followed through on the previous day's buying spree, which propelled prices higher and pushed down yields after a fortnight of relentless selling pressure. By mid-morning, the market's efforts to adjust to its turbulent ride began to take a toll. The early activity petered out, and the longer end of the maturity range slipped into negative territory. The downward drift followed a report in the Washington Post that the Federal Reserve would wait until the financial markets steadied before raising interest rates for a third time. Near mid-day, the long bond suddenly dropped by nearly a point, but when a broad sell-off failed to materialise, prices crept back to near their opening levels. In view of the market's volatility, the afternoon recovery was encouraging. Traders were also pleased that prices held up after news of strong March sales by US motor vehicle manufacturers, which suggested the possibility of mounting inflationary pressures. UK gilts opened firmer yesterday, encouraged by the overnight gains in US Treasuries and a firmer pound. However, they fell back in the afternoon in tandem with a weaker opening in the US. The June contract of the long gilt future on Liffe went as high as 108 31/32 , but lost most of the day's gains by the late afternoon when it fell to the day's low of 107 5/8 . It then picked up to 107 13/16 for a gain on the day of just  3/32 . Dealers said there was still no evidence that the buyers' strike was over in the gilts market, despite the improvement in market sentiment since the long Easter weekend. Indeed, one dealer reported that multi-currency funds were selling gilts in favour of US Treasuries. The release yesterday of stronger-than-expected money supply data for March, which could indicate that retail sales were healthy last month, did not have a great influence on the market. The February data showed that UK institutions were net sellers of gilts for the second month running to the tune of Pounds 338bn but that overseas investors made net purchases of Pounds 1.5bn, the highest monthly figure since August. In addition, the figures indicated that the Bank of England gave only limited support to the gilts market in February, with unofficial purchases of up to Pounds 250m. German bunds failed to make significant gains after the Bundesbank cut its repo rate by three basis points to 5.73 per cent, in line with market expectations, since the cut was effectively neutralised by a unexpected net drain of DM1.8bn from the banking system. The market had expected the Bundesbank to add a net DM2bn to DM4bn, so the net drain pushed call money to around 6.15 per cent from around 5.80 per cent. The June contract of the Bund future on Liffe traded between a high of 97.36 and a low of 96.86 during the day and in the late afternoon it was quoted at 96.97, up 0.13 point on the day. Italian government bonds remained volatile yesterday following the announcement late on Tuesday that Mr Silvio Berlusconi had suspended talks on the formation of a new government. Dealers said that investors were still wary of committing themselves to the market until the political situation improved. The June contract of the Italian government bond future on Liffe traded between a high of 113 and a low of 111.95 during the day. By the late afternoon, it stood at 112.20, down 0.65 point on the day. French government bonds ended off the day's highs ahead of today's auction of OATs. The Treasury has said it will sell between FFr18bn and FFr20bn OATs due April 2004, February 2004 and October 2025. The Bank of France's monetary policy council also meets today, but dealers said that a cut in the 5.90 per cent intervention rate was unlikely. The June contract of the notional 10-year French government bond future on the Matif came off the day's best level of 123.92 to trade at 123.78 in the late afternoon, down 0.12 point on the day.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / OFT will 'look into' computer game costs THE OFFICE of Fair Trading yesterday confirmed that it was looking into prices charged by the big video game manufacturers, but said it had not yet decided whether to launch a formal investigation, Richard Donkin writes. The OFT is under pressure from consumer groups concerned about the prices charged for video games by Sega and Nintendo - which dominate the Pounds 400m-a-year UK video games market - at a time when video game sales are at the forefront of the Christmas buying spree. Check it Out, the Consumer Association's magazine for teenagers, said concerns about video game prices dominated its mailbag. Sega and Nintendo sell combinations of hardware and software retailing at anything between Pounds 100 and Pounds 150. Hardware prices have been falling in recent weeks, forcing down margins for retailers, who have been prepared to take their main profits on the accompanying software. Even software margins are running in the mid 20s per cent in many stores, lower than on most toys. One large UK retailer said it would welcome an investigation. It said software prices were artificially high. Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the electrical retailer, said the toys were 'a source of enormous amusement and entertainment and probably better value than an awful lot of other toys that probably don't get through Christmas day'. Sega Europe and and Nintendo both said they had not been contacted by the OFT and could not comment. Sega added that it believed the outcome of any investigation would 'reassure customers that the company is acting entirely properly in pricing as in other matters'.</p>

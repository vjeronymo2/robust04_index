			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / People: Woods for Bridport-Gundry Bridport-Gundry, the medical, aviation and defence products group that has just parted company with its group managing director, 50-year-old Brian Cowley, has recruited Geoffrey Woods as its new chief executive. Chairman Pat Darley says that Cowley, who had been in the post for just over four years, went 'as a result of lack of confidence. Clearly things were not working out', but he was not prepared to elaborate. The company that once specialised in fishermen's netting has moved into the fibre technology business, making a range of products from restraint systems for Deutsche Airbus and the space shuttle to medical sutures. Woods, 45, who joins next week, had been managing director of Toray Textiles Europe, a subsidiary of the Japanese company. He had previously distinguished himself by being one of the youngest managing directors within Courtaulds, the company he joined as a graduate trainee in 1969. Darley, who predicts that his arrival at Bridport will not herald a change of strategy, says he was chosen for his strong marketing skills.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Call for probe into Lloyd's MPs Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, yesterday called for a government inquiry into how Tory MPs who are members of Lloyd's left syndicates before they made big losses. He urged the prime minister to look 'into the way that a member of your cabinet, Lord Wakeham (the leader of the Lords), and other leading Conservatives in 1988 were taken off selected Lloyd's syndicates which later suffered three years of catastrophic losses.' Mr Hain asked: 'Were they the beneficiaries of insider information while millions of pounds of losses were dumped on ordinary Lloyd's investors?' Mr John Major said Mr Hain, who he criticised for making inferences against Conservative MPs under privilege of parliament, should bring forward any information suggesting impropriety.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> UNIQUE L.A. SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The vision of Supt. Anton has got to go beyond individual programs. He has to  think of a reconfiguration of the entire school system, or the schools will  graduate (a few) success models like him while the vast masses of Latino,  minority and poor children will go under educated.  </P> <P> Out of 210 mostly Latino elementary schools, only one is at or above state  school averages in reading, writing and math.  </P> <P> He can help shape a radical vision for major change in the ways schools  operate. The way the school district operates is just out of whack. It's  top-heavy, too rigid. Parents don't have any real power. It's possible (to  bring major change) because there's a national movement to restructure school  districts. New York, Chicago, they've done it. But the challenge is not to  imitate what Chicago has done. The challenge is to create something unique to  the Los Angeles experience.  </P></p>

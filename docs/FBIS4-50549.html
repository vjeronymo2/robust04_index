			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Newsletter" by XINHUA reporter Xing Heping (6717 0735 </F> 1627): "King Sihanouk in Phnom Penh"]    [Text] Phnom Penh, 18 May (XINHUA) -- After attending to  state affairs in Phnom Penh for 40 days, King Norodom Sihanouk,  who is deeply loved by the Cambodian people, left here today for  China to continue his medical treatment there.    Sihanouk, who is 72, returned to Cambodia on 8 April. Before  he returned to Cambodia, he had received six months of medical  treatment in Beijing. The results were quite satisfactory.  With the approval of his doctors, he returned to his nation for  recuperation. When Sihanouk stepped out of the plane, people  could see that the king was in high spirits, and his face was  filled with a kindly smile.    The doctor by his side suggested that while in Phnom Penh,  he  should have lots of rest and eat nutritious food so as to  restore his health completely, but faced with a complex  political situation and the task of full-scale reconstruction in  Cambodia, Sihanouk, ignoring the fact he was recuperating from  illness, immediately began to work arduously. His schedule was  very tight. He worked from morning to evening accepting  credentials, meeting domestic and foreign guests, and attending  nongovernmental activities, and frequently he worked until late  at night.    Sihanouk is very much concerned about peace and national  reconciliation in Cambodia, to which he has devoted much of his  time and energy. Not long after his return, the bloody  conflicts between government troops and those of Democratic  Kampuchea in the northwest region were expanding. Worried about  this, he put forward a proposal on 22 April for convening a  peace and national reconciliation roundtable conference. The  leaders of both sides expressed their support the same day, but  the serious confrontation and distrust created by war and  political conflicts over a long period of time can in no way be  dissipated in a short period of time. Both sides could not  agree on the venue for the meeting, and the roundtable meeting  slated to open on 2 May was aborted.    After that, Sihanouk was disappointed with the way each side  stuck to its own view. While continuing to mediate between the  two sides, he mobilized public opinion and popular forces to  push forward the peace process. On 2 May, Sihanouk met with  responsible persons and reporters from over 30 newspapers, radio  stations, and television stations in Cambodia. After that, he  braved the heat to meet with the chief monk of Cambodia and more  than 500 monks in front of the palace. During the meeting, he  repeatedly expounded on the importance of placing national  interests above all else by immediately stopping fighting and  restoring peace. He said that according to the Constitution,  he, as king, is forbidden to engage in political affairs.  However, peace is not a political issue between political  parties; it concerns the vital interests of every Cambodian, and  he has the responsibility to express his views and put forward a  proposal.    On 4 May, while wearing a traditional national costume, King  Sihanouk stood on the rostrum of the east gate of the palace,  took part in a peace rally, and made a 40-minute speech. At the  end of his speech, he told those in attendance that his doctor  had discovered that the number of white blood cells in his body  had decreased due to overwork. He said that the state of his  health was not very good but that he did not mind, and he added  that he would continue to work to end the war and to restore  peace in Cambodia.    In following his doctor's request, Sihanouk limited his  daily  activities to two sessions, and each session was not to exceed  two hours. In fact, this rule was often broken. On 12 May,  after a long trip by car, he took part in a Buddhist ceremony at  a temple for seven hours. Two days later, he traveled by car to  (Kompiseu) County in Kompong Speu to call on villagers and help  them solve housing and drinking water problems.    Before 1970, Sihanouk used to meet with ordinary people on a  regular basis. After he returned to Phnom Penh this time, he  has received at his palace ordinary people every week to listen  to their opinions. There, he told the officials present his  views about solving the problems. Sihanouk is very kind to  children and handicapped people. At the new-life-day activities  for Cambodian children held on 11 April, Sihanouk braved the  33-degree heat [Celsius] to distribute clothing to 300 shabbily  dressed orphans and poor children. He personally measured their  sizes. When he received handicapped people in the palace, he  extended his regards to every one of them. It was very touching.    Before his departure, Sihanouk comforted his people, saying  "I will return in two to three months after leaving the country  for medical treatment. After my illness is cured, I will  continue to serve the country, the nation, and the common  people."</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Arts: The Brandenburgers in Bohemia - Opera The Chelsea Opera Group, whose regular concert performances of neglected works are a valuable asset to the London music scene, has in the past enjoyed particular success with Slavonic repertory - the body of operatic literature most under-represented in the west - and Sunday's performance of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia was no exception. Smetana's first opera (premiered in 1866), though uneven, is full of vivid music. With its idiom derived from mainstream European opera, The Brandenburgers anticipates only here and there the composer's mature 'Czech style', but several appealing folkish episodes make it worth hearing regardless of the shortcomings - revealed all too clearly at the Queen Elizabeth hall in Deryck Viney's stilted translation - of its libretto. Although The Brandenburgers was a great success at first - for a while it even overshadowed Smetana's second opera, The Bartered Bride - the work has always been hostage to its country's fortunes. With a plot based on an incident during the 13th-century Brandenburg invasion, it has provided discomfort for any occupying force; the opera was, of course, too close to the bone for the Nazis, who banned it. Sunday's concert had a valuable link with Czech operatic tradition in its conductor, Vilem Tausky. The 84-year-old came out of virtual retirement, eager to do The Brandenburgers, the only one of Smetana's eight operas he had never conducted before. A pillar of post-war operatic life in Britain, Tausky was given a heartwarming reception. In spite of physical frailty, he galvanised the orchestra and chorus into one of their best recent performances, and led a lively account of the piece. One longed, ungratefully, for Czech singers, but the Chelsea Opera Group mustered a worthy cast with only a few small-voiced or score-bound exceptions. Helen Kucharek's fresh soprano made her affecting as the heroine Ludise, and she was nicely complemented by Jacqueline Bremar, lively as one of her sisters, Vlcenka. Jeffrey Carl was a musical Tausendmark, but as the villain of the piece lacked vocal heft. The tenor Donald Stephenson's peasant leader Jra was vivid in his crowd-inciting song-and-dance number, and Mark Beesley's Mayor of Prague had dignity. The most powerful singing came from Jeremy White's bass Old Villager, whose Act 2 prayer (with chorus) is one of the opera's finest passages.</p>

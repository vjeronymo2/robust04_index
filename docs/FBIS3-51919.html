In a meeting with 102 presidents of  the Havana People's Councils, Lage, also the secretary of the  Council of Ministers, suggested that no more licenses be granted  or that they be suspended for craftsmen whose products are made  with raw materials of a dubious origin.    The participants in the meeting advocated the need to  increase taxes on surplus profits and price regulations.  Likewise, the presidents of the Havana People's Councils,  stressed that domestic messengers ought to pay taxes since they  are earning much more than what Interior Commerce established.  Other issues discussed in the meeting were Havana's garbage  removal system and the delivery of the winter campaign products  to the people.    Pedro Chavez, president of the people's government in Havana  and member of the Central Committee, was also present at the  meeting.</p>

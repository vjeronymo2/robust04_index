			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 (XINHUA) -- China International Trust  and Investment Corporation (CITIC) yesterday signed an agreement  with the Bank of Tokyo, enabling it to issue yen-denominated  commercial paper worth up to 15 billion Japanese yen.    Under the accord, the maturities of the short-term funds  range from two weeks to nine months. The interest rate will be  fixed at the time of issue and the Bank of Tokyo will act as the  issuing agent for China in the deal.    Hong Yun-cheng, president of CITIC Industrial Bank, said  that  this short-term measure may help cut money-raising costs and  diversify China's access to the world's capital markets.    Hiroyuki Nakao, senior managing officer of the Bank of  Tokyo,  said: "China's creditability runs high in Japan. Banks and  other financial institutions are ready to go with the cp  [commerican papere] program."    This is the first time that China has moved to issuing  commercial paper in an overseas capital market.</p>

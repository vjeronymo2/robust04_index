			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: MAN truck unit falls into the red MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the German commercial vehicle maker, fell into loss in its last financial year to the end of June but will return to profit in the current year, according to Mr Rudolf Rupprecht, group chief executive. The company, a subsidiary of MAN, the German engineering group, suffered a 9.2 per cent fall in production to 32,657 trucks and buses in 1993-94 from 35,948 a year earlier and a record 41,590 in 1991-92. Turnover fell by 4.6 per cent to DM6.9bn (Dollars 4.4bn) from DM7.2bn, and the group next month is expected to disclose a loss of between DM50m and DM100m. The financial performance of MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, Germany's second largest manufacturer of trucks after Mercedes-Benz, has been undermined by the steep recession in the European truck market. Pre-tax profits fell to DM60.5m in 1992-93 from DM506m in 1991-92 and net profits to DM31.5m from DM255m. Mr Rupprecht said demand for commercial vehicles had begun to pick up in recent months, led by higher demand from MAN's European export markets. The value of the group's order-book at the end of June had fallen marginally to DM2.3bn from DM2.4bn a year earlier, but the volume of new orders had been rising during the first six months of 1994. In the year to end-June the value of new orders rose by 8.3 per cent to DM6.8bn from DM6.3bn in 1992-93. New orders from foreign markets jumped by 22.6 per cent to DM3.2bn, while those from the domestic market declined by 2.1 per cent to DM3.5bn. MAN has been forced to restructure during the recession and is cutting 4,500 jobs or around 16 per cent of its workforce. The number of employees fell to 25,463 at the end of June from 28,917 in mid-1992 and another 1,000 jobs are to be cut during the current financial year, said Mr Rupprecht. Truck sales in Germany are expected to decline further in 1994 by between 5 and 10 per cent, said Mr Rupprecht, but will begin to recover next year. Sales have begun to pick up in other west European markets, however, led by the UK, Scandinavia, France, Spain and the Benelux countries.</p>

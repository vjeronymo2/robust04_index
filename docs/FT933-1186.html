			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (36): The floodgates have opened - Latin America / International capital is pouring in after 10 static years, writes Stephen Fidler. Digesting it, rather than attracting it, is now the main problem LATIN AMERICA has made an unexpectedly rapid return to favour in the international market for capital after a decade of recession brought on by economic mismanagement and a resultant excessive build-up of debt. Following 10 years in which access to foreign capital was severely restricted, many countries are now suffering from the opposite problem: a surfeit of capital inflows. These inflows have often artificially elevated exchange rates, thereby helping to suck in imports and hurt exports, and swollen the money supply, making more difficult the task of curbing inflation. In the first six months of this year, borrowers in Latin America raised Dollars 10.7bn in foreign bond issues alone, more than in the whole of 1992. Other capital entered the region in the form of equity investment  - into stock markets, into privatisations and increasingly new share issues and some into direct investment in new production capacity - and in bank deposits, this to take advantage of monetary policies which have been keeping real interest rates high. A complex combination of factors internal and external to the region has been behind this change of heart by international capital. Externally, low interest rates on bank deposits in the US have encouraged an outflow of funds to Latin America to take advantage of high interest rates. The flow of funds into banks in most Latin American countries, regardless of economic performance, has led to suggestions that the phenomenon of capital reflows to Latin America has had little to do with the region's economic reform programmes. Instead, a former Latin American government minister has suggested that interest rate differentials have been high enough to encourage funds to flow to Mars. It has also been argued that the weak performance of other traditional asset markets in the industrialised world has led investors of all types to seek higher returns in new markets. This raised the question of the sustainability of these capital flows when conditions in markets outside Latin America improve. Fears that the flows would cease have been partly answered by the continuation of capital flows into the region even as stock and bond markets, particularly in the US, have been performing strongly. Indeed some investment specialists argue that the trend towards increased investment into all so-called emerging markets is, if not a permanent phenomenon, part of a long-run cycle which will take years to go into reverse. Mr Michael Howell of Baring Securities in London points out in a study of cross-border capital flows that: 'Capital left the old world in roughly five waves from the mid-1840s: 1845-54, 1863-72, 1881-90, 1903-14 and 1919-24.' Capital flows in 1992 could have more in common with what happened 100 years ago than in 1982, he suggests. Supporting this contention, there is growing evidence that traditionally conservative institutional investors in the US and in Europe are entering the market for Latin American assets in increasing force. Inside the region, it is now clear that the debt crisis of 1982 set off more than almost a decade of recession. It also began a process of economic reform which has led governments first to improve macroeconomic management, for example by bringing budget deficits more into check, and second to open up the economy more to the forces of the market. In many countries, this has taken the government out of many areas of economic endeavour. The changes have also brought down tariff barriers and abolished import quotas, paving the way for the development of regional free trade arrangements. These trade arrangements, led by the North American Free Trade Agreement which groups the US, Canada and Mexico, offer the prospect over time of transforming economic relations among countries in the Americas. This has meant that Latin Americans themselves have been an important, if not the main, source of external capital as they have repatriated money placed abroad in preceding decades to protect it from arbitrary government and economic mismanagement. All this has produced a resumption of economic growth in most countries of the region. That growth remains positive for most countries, according to a majority of economic forecasts this year, even though it appears to be slowing down in a number of important economies. Still, a July survey of economists forecasts by the British group Consensus Economics suggests growth for the region this year of 3.4 per cent (3.3 per cent without Brazil) and 3.0 per cent next year (3.4 per cent without Brazil). This compares with forecasts of 2.6 and 3.2 per cent for North America and -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent for Europe. But if Latin America has turned the corner, it is still in the woods. The 1980s saw a significant drop in real incomes and a deepening of the problems of poverty so that as many as 180m of the continent's 460m population may now be in poverty. The 1980s also saw a further collapse in the ability of government adequately to perform even its slimmed-down role. In many countries, military rule had already eroded the pillars of government during the 1970s; governments' ability adequately to fund educational, health and social programmes deteriorated further in the 1980s economic crisis. Public investment, especially in education, is widely seen as necessary to provide skilled labour for the needs of the investors of the 1990s. Only with education, it is argued, can poverty be reduced and economic growth be converted into development. Looking ahead, the central question is therefore whether the economic reform will yield sufficient benefits quickly enough to a broad enough group of people for them to reject populist economic solutions in countries which, in contrast to a decade ago, are primarily ruled by elected governments. The answer to this will in part hang on how much of the renewed capital flows will be channeled into productive investment and how much will go into consumer spending which will produce an initial spurt of growth but provide no long-term prospects for its continuation. Unfortunately, government statistics in much of the region are not reliable enough to draw firm conclusions about what these capital flows are financing.</p>

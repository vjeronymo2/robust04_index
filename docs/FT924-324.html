			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Iraqi clash highlights Gulf volatility THE challenge by President Saddam Hussein on Sunday of the air exclusion zone over southern Iraq, during which one of his fighter aircraft was shot down by an American F-16, serves as a sharp reminder to President-elect Bill Clinton of how volatile the Gulf region remains. Two incursions by Iraqi fighters within an hour on Sunday were the first serious challenges to the allied policing of the no-fly zone since it was imposed four months ago with the aim of protecting the southern Shia population from further attacks by Baghdad. Yesterday Baghdad vowed to avenge the destruction of the aircraft and said it would exact revenge on Mr George Bush, the outgoing US president. Iraq's deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said the country had no obligation under UN resolutions to recognise the no-fly zone in the south. 'Iraq does not recognise the ban imposed on its flights,' he said. President Saddam may have calculated that the threat of a US air strike had diminished during the final days of the Bush administration and that he could afford to test the resolve of the US, Britain and France to keep aircraft based in the Gulf. There have also been recent reports of growing food shortages and rising inflation in Baghdad and President Saddam could be trying to divert local discontent. He will also hope to fuel Gulf tensions provoked by Iran's claims to sovereignty over Abu Musa, close to the Strait of Hormuz, and the Greater and Lesser Tumbs. The United Arab Emirates has taken the issue to the UN. The already widespread concern among Arab countries at the threat of Iraq being, in effect, divided into three would be further fed by the prospect of a more assertive Iran. Iraq's military aircraft are also banned from flying over the north of the country, beyond the 36th parallel, to offer protection to the Kurdish population. Baghdad and other Arab capitals will doubtless contrast the lengths the US and its allies will go to ensure Iraqi compliance and the attitude adopted towards Israel following its rejection of Security Council resolution 799 demanding the return of 415 Palestinians deported from the West Bank and Gaza to southern Lebanon. Iraq has agreed in principle to allow UN guards to escort food convoys into Kurdish areas as well as inspect cargo at checkpoints, a senior UN official said yesterday, Reuter reports from the UN in New York. UN agencies suspended most of their winter relief for Kurds in northern Iraq after aid trucks were bombed or mined earlier this month.</p>

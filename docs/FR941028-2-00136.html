Of the total number of shares authorized, Consolidated allocated 210,348 and 154,268 shares, respectively, to the DRP and ESOP. It is anticipated that 133,251 shares of Common Stock allocated to the ESOP will remain unissued as of December 31, 1994. All shares allocated to the DRP have been issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consolidated proposes to continue the ESOP and, at the option of its Board of Directors (``Board''), distribute to participants either authorized and unissued Common Stock or outstanding Common Stock purchased in the open market. Authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock will be issued whenever additional equity capital is needed by Consolidated. The per share price of original issue Common Stock purchased from Consolidated will be the average of the closing price of Consolidated's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Consolidated tape for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of transfer. Consolidated will use the proceeds from the sale of such shares for general corporate purposes. Whenever additional equity capital is not needed by Consolidated, ESOP shares will be acquired through open market purchases by the ESOP trustees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ESOP is noncontributory on the employee's part and is administered by trustees. No one has the right to vote any shares acquired by the ESOP other than the participants who own such shares. The Board has the right to adjust the number of shares reserved under the ESOP which may be issued in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants' rights under the ESOP in the event of a stock split, reserve stock split, reorganization or similar event with respect to which the Board determines that an equitable adjustment is appropriate. Consolidated requests authority to issue said 133,251 shares, or such shares as may respectively remain unissued at December 31, 1994, until such numbers shall be exhausted, but not beyond December 31, 1999. Consolidated further requests authority to adjust the number and par value (if appropriate) of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the ESOP in the implementation of the anticipation or anti-enlargement of rights provisions of the ESOP. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

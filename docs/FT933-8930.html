			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: CU pleases The market gave an immediate thumbs up to Commercial Union's interim results, with dealers hoisting the share price after the unexpected moves on the dividend front. CU increased its interim dividend from 8.95p to 15.1p, brought forward the payment date and offered shareholders an enhanced scrip dividend alternative worth 22.65p a share. Half-year profits of Pounds 65.5 were well ahead of market expectations which had ranged up to Pounds 60m and compared with a loss of Pounds 23.7m. But it was the moves on the dividend which triggered a sharp rise in CU shares. They moved to a peak 667p immediately following the results before easing back to end a busy session a net 11 higher at 661p. 'It was a beautifully timed move, coming the day after GenAcc maintained their interim payment,' said one marketmaker. Analysts moved quickly to increase their full year forecasts; Morgan Stanley moved up to Pounds 200m for the full-year while BZW upped their expectation from Pounds 175m to Pounds 188m with a dividend forecast of 24.5p.</p>

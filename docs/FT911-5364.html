			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Gorbachev's Japan visit raises island hopes FOUR small islands, with a few thousand inhabitants, some military installations and a lot of fish, have kept relations between the Soviet Union and Japan icily formal since the war. No treaty has been signed since hostilities between them stopped: though not at war, they are not at peace either. Now, with the visit to Japan this week of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet president, the air is pregnant with possibilities. The Kuril Islands stand between the two countries, north-east of Japan and south-west of Siberia. Soviet soldiers seized them in 1945 although Japan has never gives up its claim to the islands, which it calls the Northern Territories. The possibility of the Soviet Union restoring the islands to Japan after 47 years is now being mooted, especially on the Soviet side, where suggestions that Japan might pay a large price to get the islands back is being talked about with some eagerness. In Japan, there is less optimism about the possibility of a settlement although Foreign Ministry officials say they are looking for 'a breakthrough' on the territorial question. The territorial issue apart, there is a widespread - if rather vague - hope in Tokyo that the visit will improve bilateral relations and promote a general easing of tensions in the Asia-Pacific region. 'If any person can bring about any dynamic change in the relationship it can be Mr Gorbachev, who started perestroika,' Mr Taizo Watanabe, Japan's foreign affairs spokesman, said on Friday. Mr Gorbachev's visit which starts tomorrow is the first to Japan by a Soviet leader. If he can resolve the territorial issue, a vast area of co-operation could open up between the two countries. Talk in the Soviet Union is that Japan might pay between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 30bn for the islands. It is not just economic benefits that interest the Soviet side; the issue has become bound up in the conflict between the two giants of the Soviet political scene, Mr Gorbachev and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader. Mr Yeltsin has said the islands shall not pass from Russian hands: at the other side of the political scene, the Soviet military say they are of great strategic importance. Dr Georgy Kunadze, the country's leading expert on the issue and head of the Far East division at the foreign policy think tank IMEMO, cautions against expecting too much. 'He cannot simply go there and 'sell' the Kurils. The Japanese cannot expect it. We have been too proud for too long to suddenly change.' But Dr Kunadze believes the issue can be resolved on the basis of three main elements. First, he believes Mr Gorbachev could revive an offer the Soviet Union made to Japan in 1956. This envisages the return of the islands nearest to the Japanese mainland - the Habomai Group and Shikotan. Further negotiations would take place on the other two, Etorofu and Kunashiri, while relations are normalised. An offer from Mr Gorbachev on these lines could be a starting point, although Japanese officials say agreement would have to be on all four islands. Second, Dr Kunadze believes the Soviet Union should be compensated for the infrastructure built on the islands since the war. A reasonable price, he thinks, might be Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn). Third, credits and loans should also be discussed. However, these should be relatively modest since the capacity for the unreformed Soviet economy to productively use foreign credits is low. A sum of Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn would be enough, he thinks, with perhaps a further Dollars 10bn in loans. Though he is scornful of the rumoured figures, his sums do end up in the Pounds 20bn-Dollars 30bn range which Japanese politicians are reported to have suggested. Soviet and Japanese officials have drafted over 12 separate agreements for Mr Gorbachev and Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese prime minister, to sign. They include Japanese offers to send technological experts to Moscow and to accept Soviet trainees in Japan, plus other forms of aid to Soviet industry. But, without progress on the territorial issue, Tokyo is unlikely to drop its previous refusal to extend government-backed loans and grants.</p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Mayhew move gets muted welcome SIR Patrick Mayhew's ap-pointment as Northern Ireland secretary received a muted welcome in Dublin yesterday - revealing suspicions that he needs to over come in the Irish Republic if 'round-table' talks on Northern Ireland are to resume. Regarded as affable but determined, Sir Patrick had a record as attorney general that soured relations with Dublin. He clashed with the Irish judiciary over the extradition of Father Patrick Ryan, on alleged terrorist offences in 1988, and for not prosecuting members of the security forces accused of operating a 'shoot-to-kill policy'. Sir Patrick will meet his Irish counterparts at an Anglo-Irish conference later this month. In theory that should lead to a suspension of further conferences, allowing inter-party talks on the political future of Northern Ireland to restart. Mr John Major's decision to replace Mr Peter Brooke may not lead to a smooth transition - not only because of Sir Patrick's past rifts with Dublin. Mr Brooke earned as a reputation as a skilled conciliator, adept at keeping Unionist and nationalist politicians at least moving towards the negotiating table. The welcome Unionist MPs gave his appointment of Sir Patrick will only exacerbate nationalist suspicions. Mr Major's decision to replace Mr Brooke probably reflects their differing personalities and political outlook. Mr Brooke was an old-school Tory, uneasy with Mr Major's classless Conservatism and new generation of ministers. Yet Sir Patrick, aged 62, is older than Mr Brooke. Yesterday the Irish government said that it looked forward to working with Sir Patrick, but unofficially there was disquiet. 'I would not have been enamoured by some of his decisions as a lawyer,' said Mr Jim Tunney, the chairman of the ruling Fianna Fail party. 'But law is different from politics, and I would rather wait and see how he performs as a politician.' A spokesman for the opposition Labour party, the sister party of the SDLP in Northern Ireland, said: 'He would not have been our choice. He has a record which makes us uneasy, although the person appointed is less important than a commitment to the talks process.'</p>

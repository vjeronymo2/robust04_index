			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Geng Jun (5105 6511): "Looking Ahead at </F> the `Two Sessions:' Market Economy Will Be the Keynote"]    [Text] Beijing, 2 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Last year,  there were two key events in China's political and economic  process: First, at the first session of the Eighth National  People's Congress [NPC], "the state practices the socialist  market economy" were written for the first time into the PRC  Constitution, the fundamental law of the country. Second, the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee held  late last year formulated the general framework of China's  market economy.    The two points on both ends of the year formed the main  course of China's reform. That is, the ship of China's economy  eventually sailed into the main course of the market economy  after passing the stages of a planned economy, an economy with  planning as the mainstay and market as the complement, and a  planned commodity economy.    On the whole, the current Chinese economic structure remains  in the transitional stage from a planned to a market economy.  In addition, five major reform measures in the taxation and  financial, banking, investment, foreign trade, and modern  enterprise management systems adopted this year will cover and  effect a wide scope of activities to an intensive degreea and  more problems and contradictions in the reforms will arise.  Therefore, some experts expected that the forthcoming second  session of the Eighth NPC would mainly discuss the operation of  the market economy and realistically analyze and settle various  problems in the market economy. This may be different from last  year's NPC session, which just called for "grasping the  opportunity for development" and establisheg the objective of a  market economy.    The deputies to the NPC, who come from the forefront of the  economic work, will pay more attention to the following  questions: How to handle the relationship between the rate of  growth and economic efficiency in the course of development; how  to optimize the environment for fair competition, overcome the  unevenness in regional development, and break local economic  blockades and monopolies in some trades; how to quicken the  process of building up an integrated legal system; how to deal  with the obvious backwardness of the markets for production  factors; how to transform government functions and turn the  participants in market competition into creators of an  environment for fair competition; how to solve such problems as  why large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises lack dynamism  in operation and entering the market; how to strengthen overall  price control and establish various types of risk funds and  reserve systems; and how to maintain the stability of the farm  produce market.    In retrospect, the year since the first session of the  Eighth  NPC was a year recording the enhancement of the overall  marketization degree of the Chinese economy.    The market system has been further maturing. There are now  more than 1,600 wholesale markets for farm produce, more than  1,000 wholesale markets for industrial consumer goods, and some  1,800 wholesale markets for producer goods in the whole country.    Markets for production factors have also emerged. On the  financial market, there are now 85 securities companies and more  than 500 intermediate securities institutions in the whole  country. On the technological market, there are some 2,800  institutions of all types engaged in technology trade, and over  10,000 information institutions of all types. On the labor  force market, there are some 13,000 job placement institutions,  which help some 8 million people find jobs each year. On the  real estate market, there have emerged some 12,000 development  companies.    The market pricing mechanism is also forming, and the  proportion of prices fixed according to state plan has  substantially decreased. Among farm produce and industrial  consumer goods and capital goods, the proportions of prices  being basically formed by market forces separately reached 90  percent and 85 percent. The proportion of products controlled  by the state's mandatory industrial production plans in the  gross industrial output value of the whole country fell to only  4 percent.    The Eighth NPC Standing Committee also created a remarkable  record in the past year as it passed 20 laws, made 13  law-related decisions, and basically scrutinized eight draft  laws. This was the most laws the NPC Standing Committee has  ever deliberated and enacted in a year. The "company law" has  played a role in regulating and standardizing the operation of  1.03 million business companies of all types in the market  economy. The "anti-improper competition law" provides the legal  standards for market behavior.    It is expected that some other subjects will also be  discussed by the deputies at the forthcoming NPC session, but  the experts held that all of them were just problems in the  course of advances and development of the Chinese economy and  were just interludes of the main melody.    Sensibly raising, analyzing, and resolving these problems at  the "two sessions" will enalbe the ship of the Chinese economic  reform to move ahead along the course of the market economy by  braving winds and waves.</p>

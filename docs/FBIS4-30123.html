			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said  Malaysia is not ready to establish diplomatic relations with  Israel, although the latter wants to do so. This was decided by  the Cabinet at its last meeting. He said the prime minister,  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, mentioned Israel's request but  the Cabinet wants to wait and see how sincere Israel is in  adhering to the peace agreement it signed with the Palestine  Liberation Organization before making a decision. Datuk  Abdullah told reporters this at a diplomatic corps night  organized by the National Press Club in Kuala Lumpur.</p>

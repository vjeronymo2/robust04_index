			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Letter: A wilder swing, and luckily up Sir, In the article 'Serious Money' (January 9) a way of beating the Dow developed by a US fund manager, Michael O'Higgins, was described. This involved picking the five stocks with the highest yields and lowest share prices from the Dow's 30 constituents and was reported as having produced annual returns (1973-1991) of 19.4 per cent versus 10.4 per cent from the Dow Jones. When applied to the FT-30 Index for the period 1979-1992 it showed returns of 22 per cent vs 17.5 per cent from the All Share. Of course the explanation is that with a portfolio of only five stocks the amount of diversifiable risk is still significant, ie the higher returns are effectively the reward for higher risk, and the combined returns of the stocks will swing more wildly than that of the larger basket of the full Dow Jones or the All Share index. Luckily they swung upwards so that Michael O'Higgins could write his book and Philip Coggan could write his article] Anthony Walsh, 9 Roebuck Downs, Goatstown Road, Dublin 14Irish Republic</p>

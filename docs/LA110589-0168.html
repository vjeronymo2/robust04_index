			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1989 BOOK PRIZE WINNER: POETRY;  </P> <P> THE LATE SPRING OF DONALD HALL  </P> <P> "Real Life Rock, Top Ten." I read it in the Village Voice last January,  compiled by the music critic Greil Marcus -- a list of heterogeneous items  linked by their energy and their iconoclasm, the characteristics of rock 'n'  roll. And No. 1 (just above Keith Richards live in Oakland) was "Prophecy," a  ranting curse out of 60-year-old Donald Hall's "The One Day," a book-length  poem:  </P> <P>  Your children will wander looting the shopping malls  </P> <P>  for forty years, suffering for your idleness,  </P> <P>  until the last dwarf body rots in a parking lot  </P> <P>  .. the sky will disappear like a scroll rolled up,  </P> <P>  Marcus quotes and compares the prophetic voice to that of the early Dylan, of  Isaiah, of Johnny Rotten, "defining what rock 'n' roll no longer dares to say."  Something about Hall's poetry always has made it timely, a part of the news as  well as of literature.  </P> <P> He started, as do most writers, embedded in the idiom of his time. It was the  1950s, and his early, prize-winning poems were about exile and existential  estrangement. Holding his new-born child in his arms, he addressed it as "my  son, my executioner"; he mourned the decay of rural New Hampshire, where he had  spent this school vacations, and he detailed the dull, familiar features of the  suburbia in which he had been raised. Those almost identical "dark houses  harden into sleep," he wrote, and it was a sleep where he saw no refreshment,  no waking into vigor.  </P> <P> But he was looking for something more. Searching for an imagery equivalent to  the heartland from which we have been exiled, he entered next upon a different  kind of poetry. In "The Long River" he rows into a dark, mysterious interior:  </P> <P>  The musk-ox smells  </P> <P>  in his long head  </P> <P>  my boat coming.  </P> <P>  The musk-ox is both ominous and vital; his appetites have become forgotten in  suburbia. The spondaic phrases give the writing a slowness, a weight, that it  has not had before. And its syllabic form -- Hall was the inventor of syllabics  in our time -- make for a more unpredictable verse-movement than in the earlier  poetry, with which it has little in common.  </P> <P> It was now the '60s, and he moved into different kinds of free verse. "The  Alligator Bride" embodies a kind of jocular surrealism. Such investigations of  the irrational, however, led him eventually to the true sources of the rural  nostalgia that always had haunted him. He quit teaching at Ann Arbor in 1975,  remarried, and moved back to the farmhouse of his maternal grandparents, not as  farmer himself but as a writer who wanted to raise poetry on farmland. And he  succeeded, writing poems that were less elegies for the past than realizations  of it -- about the cart horses and the hen yard, the Holsteins and the ox-cart  man, their lives thick with things. He lifted the recurrent rhythms of the  farming year into the present tense.  </P> <P> His career seemed inconsistent and unpatterned, as Herman Melville's must have  looked during his time, or Shakespeare's. But he has always been consistent in  his subject matter, his poetry being preoccupied with the shared rather than  the exceptional experience, with what we have or could have in common.  </P> <P> Thus "The One Day" consists of the voices of all of us. The poem is in three  parts. The first opens with an aging man daydreaming and smoking in his yellow  chair, "unfit/to work or love." His voice is joined by a woman's but they are  the same voice, though they speak of different lives, and we come to understand  that they have led the same life, in which the promise of fullness has been  answered only by the fact of emptiness. They speak of a self without center, an  existence without revelation or joy. "The world is a bed," they say; that is,  the world has become reduced to a bed of adultery, a bed of insomnia, a bed of  sleep only after pills chased down with whiskey. The voices weave and  alternate, but they speak of the same dead end; of having been herded  unwillingly into a present with no real connection to past or future, a present  in which they find neither rest nor meaning.  </P> <P> It is written in a line based on the Old English accentual line as it was  loosened and revised by Pound, one of the most useful and flexible technical  innovations of the century. The collage and juxtaposition of experience that he  uses also is a modified Poundian method, making possible the economical  inclusion of a great deal of specific heterogeneous material.  </P> <P> For this poem is all detail and circumstance, the one day made up of many  specific days, the one life of many lives, though they lead the speaker into  the same narrow place, at the end of which is only fear. At the end of the  first part, the female voice tells, with a deadly flatness, how she prepares to  give her children pills which will kill them. Then there enters someone whose  identity hovers just out of sight, the way a beekeeper's mask darkens a face,  who picks up a rag doll and starts to demonstrate on it the proper ways to  dismember a child, as one might a dead fowl, by cutting its limbs carefully  into sections.  </P> <P> Though Part One ends thus in nightmare, it has been moderate in tone, that of  someone no longer possessing the energy to direct his or her own life. By  contrast, Part Two, with the title "Four Classic Texts," starts with rage.  "Prophecy," which reminded Greil Marcus of Johnny Rotten, is a curse -- against  our civilization and against life itself. It is succeeded by the rage of  satire, a bitter satire of love and sex and marriage, in "Pastoral". The work  is still a bed, in which "we pull off our clothes like opening junk mail."  "History" follows, rage against the past, and consists of a terrible parody of  what already parodies itself, the list of human destructiveness, and Tiberius  melts into Stalin. The fourth classic text, though, is not like the others:  "Eclogue" replaces their destructive rage with its opposite extreme -- a  visionary certainty, the return to an age of gold through a cyclical process in  which we recapture innocence, "the vector of greed withdraws" and there is a  "restitution of lost things."  </P> <P> We are to make what we will of this middle section. The "Four Classic Texts"  are thrust between Parts One and Three, and we must supply the connection for  ourselves. What I think is implied is that his composite protagonist has been  moved out of the earlier quiet and rational despair into a full-bodied  irrationality, of crazy angers and equally crazy hope, which are at least signs  of energy, of not surrendering to the presence with the darkened face.  </P> <P> So that when in the last part we return to the original speakers, though they  are still old and in the same world, they are changed -- enabled. The brushes  with craziness have released them from their inertia. They still live in the  present, but now they live in it fully. No longer "unfit/to work or love," they  now find joy in both --  </P> <P>  When my body shook again with the body's passion,  </P> <P>  it was impossible only because I expected nothing.  </P> <P>  -- and a proposition is reversed, in a kind of echo of John Donne's "The Sun  Rising": "A bed is the world," inclusive, and receptive to possibilities. The  polysyllabic ironies from earlier in the poem are replaced by praise, not only  of blossoms and old lilacs but of "fried Spam and onions on slices of Wonder  Bread."  </P> <P> What Hall achieves in this third part is an extraordinarily complex  presentation of the grounds for joy, difficult enough to describe at any time,  a joy that has nothing in common with complacency, for it is active,  intelligent and completely aware that it is to be ended by death, which in fact  helps to define it. The rage and satire have been worked off, but the promise  of a cyclical return is in its way kept.  </P> <P>  On the first Sunday of every month we assemble  </P> <P>  molecules of Jesus from their diaspora,  </P> <P> he says, while a few lines farther down:  </P> <P>  When the rain drives on the poppies they hold bright petals to the rain.  </P> <P>  Raindrops recur and disappear, as the molecules of Jesus disappear and recur.  There is one day: Past and future are contained in the present of the one day  as the whole world is contained in the one bed. Everything is present at the  same time:  </P> <P>  The tomcat plays with his mother, sucking and teasing; he cuffs  </P> <P>  his mother's jaw. The tomcat limps home in the bloody  </P> <P>  morning, ear torn. The tomcat sleeps all day  </P> <P>  in a portion of the sun, fur tatty over old scars, pulls  </P> <P>  himself to the saucer of milk, and snores going back  </P> <P>  to sleep, knowing himself the same. The kitten leaps  </P> <P>  in the air, her paws spread like a squirrel's.  </P> <P>  The beauty of this writing is not merely in what it says, that the stages of  our lives are in some way co-existent, but in the way it so actively is what it  says, in the specifics of the cat and in the pacing of those specifics. The joy  and the acceptance are neither glib nor unexamined.  </P> <P> Among his numerous prose books, Hall has written at least one, "Remembering  Poets" (1978), which is of permanent value, not only for its observant memoirs  of Dylan Thomas, Frost, Eliot and Pound but also for the brilliant way he moves  from them into his reflections about the nature of poetry itself. He says:  </P> <P> poetry attempts ... to add old or irrational  </P> <P>  elements to the light of consciousness by  </P> <P>  means of language, which is the instrument of consciousness.  </P> <P>  The poet thus adds unreason to reason, "making a third thing." It seems to me  that this describes well what Hall has done in "The One Day": Mere reason was  combined with mere irrationality and the two in combination produce the refined  and alert awareness, the late spring, of the third part, a life going through  the same processes as a poetry.  </P> <P> And this poem, as a whole, may indeed be seen as the synthesis of a whole  life's work. It is one of those books, like Elizabeth Bishop's last collection,  which alters the way we look at the jumbled contents of the poetic career  preceding it, giving it retrospectively a shape, a pattern, a consistency it  didn't seem to have at the time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Poetry Nominees  </P> <P> A Soldier's Time by R.

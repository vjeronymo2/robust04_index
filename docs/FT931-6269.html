			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Wine export growth steadies SA Brewing earnings at midway SA BREWING, the Australian food and industrial group, yesterday reported a 1.1 per cent increase in interim net profit to ADollars 57.15m (USDollars 39.72m) for the six months to the end of December. The group said strong appliance sales, higher wine exports and lower interest costs offset poor results from beer and packaging operations. Sales increased by 7.3 per cent to ADollars 1.12bn. Mr Ross Wilson, managing director, said the outlook for the second half 'looks reasonably favourable'. Mr Wilson said wine exports were growing strongly. He forecast a significant increase in profits from the US following the rationalisation of the recently-acquired Mor-Flo water heater business. The group's packaging margins came under pressure in the first half following the loss of a contract to supply cartons to Carlton and United Breweries, a subsidiary of Foster's Brewing Group. The loss of the contract was reflected in the beverage and food division's reduced earnings before tax and interest, which fell to ADollars 36.8m, compared to ADollars 43.8m in the comparable period of the previous year. The group said the lower contribution also reflected a fall of 6.3 per cent in the core South Australian beer market during the period, compared with a decline of 4.7 per cent in the national market. SA Brewing said the contribution from the packaging division fell to ADollars 48.6m from ADollars 49.5m before tax and interest costs. The appliance division contrib-uted ADollars 33.8m, compared with ADollars 29.8m. Mr Wilson said the group's balance sheet was strong, and confirmed that the board had considered a number of potential acquisitions. The directors declared an unchanged dividend of 7.75 cents a share, fully franked. SA Brewing shares closed 4 cents higher at ADollars 3.43 on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

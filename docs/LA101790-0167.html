			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'SO VAIN' SIMON PONDERS AGING  </P> <P> Carly Simon's so vain.  </P> <P> The 45-year-old singer said she is trying to "come to terms" with getting older  but acknowledged it has been difficult.  </P> <P> "In five years maybe I won't be so attractive. People won't whistle at me on  the street anymore," she said in an interview for the TV show "Personalities."  </P> <P> "I'm not above having those fears or apprehensions about losing my  attractiveness, or whatever," Simon said. "Even though inside I know that  sexuality is something to do more basically with who you are . . . than how old  you are."  </P> <P> Simon, whose hits include "You're So Vain" and the Oscar-winning "Let the River  Run," said her fear of growing old started when she was about 26.  </P> <P> "Inside me, there's a part of me, a little voice saying, 'Oooh, I wish I was 39  again' or 'I wish I was 25 again,' or whatever," she said.  </P></p>

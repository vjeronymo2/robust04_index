			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / People: Rover Group's launch pad Terry Morgan is leaving the driving seat he has occupied at Land Rover Vehicles for the past three years to become managing director of British Aerospace's Royal Ordnance division. The 42-year-old Morgan, who has been with Land Rover in various roles since 1985, forged his first links with Royal Ordnance during BAe's ownership of Rover Group - not particularly surprising, since Land Rover is almost the definitive light military vehicle. He takes up the job on August 1 and for the first time in his career will not be directly involved in the motor industry. Before joining Land Rover as production director in 1985 he was with Leyland Bus as manufacturing director. His career began with an apprenticeship in Lucas' Girling brakes division. Replacing him as managing director at Land Rover is 36-year-old Ian Robertson, who steps up from purchasing director. Robertson is a Rover group man through and through, joining what was then British Leyland's purchasing department from university in 1979 and subsequently working his way through a variety of positions - from logistics to plant director - across the group. Meanwhile another Rover veteran - of 37 years - Fred Coultas is taking over as managing director of British Motor Industry Heritage Trust, which controls the new motor museum and heritage centre Rover has set up within its Gaydon, Warwickshire, research and development centre. He succeeds Peter Mitchell, who is retiring after getting the centre up and running.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Leading Article: OFT on target IN HIS report to the chancellor on the marketing and sale of investment-linked insurance products, Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, remarks that 'competition can take place most effectively when investors have access to information of the right type and extent, at the right time, and in an understandable form'. It is a measure of the failure of practitioner-based regulation in the retail investment market that it should still be necessary to make such a self-evidently sensible declaration so long after the introduction of the 1986 Financial Services Act. This report, together with a wider-ranging review of the life assurance industry carried out under the 1973 Fair Trading Act, provides a welcome and authoritative statement of good practice in an area where bad practice has been all too common. Under his limited remit to comment on the existing rule books of the industry watchdogs, the Securities and Investments Board and Lautro, Sir Bryan chooses good targets, ranging from inadequate disclosure of surrender values on endowment policies to the absurd practice of projecting returns on the basis of industry-wide costs instead of individual life offices' costs. He is pungent on the failure to reflect differing distribution expenses in prices, and rightly critical of flabby disclosure requirements for independent financial advisers. In his wider report, the director-general is free to move closer to the heart of the matter by addressing the absence of transparency in charges and surrender values. Lack of disclosure has long prevented investors from comparing the insurance industry's policies with a straightforward investment in equities, gilts or the building society. Sir Bryan helpfully provides an illustrative disclosure statement for a 25-year with-profit endowment policy to show how it could be done. It is a form of help that too many insurers would rather be without. The OFT's conclusions will no doubt strengthen the hand of SIB in dealing with its recalcitrant charges. The Treasury should also give the OFT's bandwagon a well-deserved push. But whether the insurers can be persuaded to go along with it is another matter. Many in the industry appear incapable of recognising that the widespread sale of poor products to the wrong people under the cloak of inadequate disclosure is undermining public confidence. The public has no obligation to keep in business an industry that is afraid to reveal the nature of the products it so vigorously peddles. Investors deserve better protection than they have had so far from regulators who have sought consensus at the expense of the consumer interest. The OFT has provided a sound blueprint for a set of rules that would genuinely serve the public interest. If the industry rejects it, the government should recognise that practitioner-based regulation has failed in this area and opt for a tougher, more independent watchdog.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> NAUGHTON HAVING A BALL ACTING  </P> <P> Actor James Naughton, whose life has taken that familiar theatrical tour of  hard work for years only to be declared an overnight success, says acting is as  much fun as baseball.  </P> <P> The 44-year-old performer's characterization of a tough-talking private eye  turned him into a star when the Broadway musical "City of Angels" opened last  week. Naughton, who has a long list of stage and film credits, landed a plum  off-Broadway role as early as 1971 in "Long Day's Journey Into Night" with  Geraldine Fitzgerald and Stacy Keach.  </P> <P> He acts, he says, because "It's a lot of fun. It's the same kind of fun as when  I was a kid. And to be able to continue to do that, it's sort of like playing  baseball. You see these guys who are 40 years old and they're still playing  ball and they say, 'I'm the luckiest man in the world to be able to play this  kids' game for so long and so successfully.' And it's the same with acting."  </P></p>

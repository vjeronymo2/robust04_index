			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gummer calls for further CAP reform FURTHER REFORM of the European Community's common agricultural policy was yesterday urged by Mr John Gummer, the UK agriculture minister. He cited in particular the sugar regime. It was not acceptable that rich countries should so support their agriculture that they destroyed the market for poor countries, Mr Gummer told the Agra Europe Outlook '93 conference in London. 'The sugar regime is one that does huge damage, and this reform is vital,' he said. Other sectors that needed looking at were wine, fruit and vegetables, olive oil, rice, cotton and beef. Mr Gummer also warned farmers that the development of supply controls such as acreage set-aside under last year's CAP reforms would place them under a heavy bureaucratic burden. Farmers would have to supply a great deal of information to qualify for aid under the CAP. 'Supplying this information will be a time consuming task, and the penalties for any mistakes could be severe,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Shrimpers blocking shipping lanes off Texas and Louisiana yielded to traffic  after the Coast Guard agreed to hear their complaints about regulations  intended to protect an endangered species of sea turtle. "If something is not  done, there'll probably be violence," said Marvin Hickman, a shrimper from  Tarpon Springs, Fla. At issue is a Commerce Department rule requiring use of  what the shrimpers say is a cumbersome and costly device to allow sea turtles  to escape the nets. About 200 shrimp boats had crowded the deep-water channel  at Galveston, Tex. About 300 others jammed access to the Port of Corpus  Christi, and smaller ports in both states were blocked.  </P></p>

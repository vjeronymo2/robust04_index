			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, February 15 (TASS) -- Vitaliy Churkin,  special representative of the Russian president and deputy  foreign minister, had a series of meetings here on Monday night  to discuss ways to settle conflicts between the republics of the  former Yugoslavia.    Churkin met in particular with Yashushi Akashi, the U.N.  secretary-general's special representative in the former  Yugoslavia, and General Michael Rose, commander of the U.N.  Force.    "The purpose of my arrival in Zagreb can be formulated in  one  phrase: to secure that there are no air strikes in the area of  Sarajevo. This is a dual task, though. The siege of Sarajevo  must be lifted", Churkin told ITAR-TASS.    Asked what would be Russia's actions if air strikes are not  avoided, Churkin emphasised that "everything will depend on a  specific situation".    "If air strikes are delivered under conditions which we  would  deem unjustified, that would have inevitable consequences for  our relations with the rest of the world," he said, pointing out  that this is his personal point of view.    On Tuesday Churkin is to visit Sarajevo and then return to  Zagreb for a continuation of the talks.</p>

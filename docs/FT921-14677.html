			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Arts: Roll out the 'bloomers' bandwagon - Television There is something endearingly old fashioned about A Time To Dance, Melvyn Bragg's adaptation of his own novel for BBC1. It feels closer to DH Lawrence than to - say - Fay Weldon or Martin Amis, or even Kingsley Amis, come to that. No doubt there are still working class teenagers who flower under the loving care of a devoted teacher. Similarly, bank managers in advanced middle age probably do still find spiritual renewal by lifting up their eyes unto the hills. And it is not unlikely that passionate love does still leap, flame like, across the gaps of age and class which separate such people. Yet writing about all this seems to be out of fashion. By and large Episode 1 made it seem feasible enough, only two scenes stretching the suspension of disbelief to the limit. However enflamed his loins, it seems unlikely that the bank manager would literally chase the teenage girl through a small country town where, presumably, both would be widely recognised. And, however keen to expunge the image of the rapist lodger, it also seems unlikely that the girl would select quite such a chilly day to strip off in the middle of Lakeland and then choose to lie head down on a considerable slope to make love. Despite that the casting - with Ronald Pickup as the bank manager and Dirvla Kirwan as the teenager - is clever enough to sustain the credibility of the relationship, and one was left rather keen to know what happens next, which is more than can be said for an awful lot of television drama serials. ***** The best so far of this year's drama serials written expressly for television are BBC1's Love Hurts by Marks and Gran, who wrote Shine On Harvey Moon; and Tony Marchant's Goodbye Cruel World on BBC2. In the first Zoe Wanamaker plays a businesswoman who takes her talents into the charity business and is pursued by a cockney millionaire played by Adam Faith (more good casting) and in the second Sue Johnston plays a woman suffering from a disease like multiple sclerosis who, with her husband, launches the first charity for sufferers. Experience suggests there will be yet more drama about charities before the year is out. The worst production in this category so far is BBC1's Moon And Son, an unconvincing thriller made worse by a lot of 'new age' mumbo jumbo about dowsing and astrology. ***** What a surprise to find that Gerry Sadowitz, who had been given such a big build up as the new daring comedian - 'He's abusive. You'll hate him' said BBC2 in its billing for the first show in his series The Pall Bearer's Revue  -is, first and foremost, a conjuror. Of course the same was true of Tommy Cooper, and, like Cooper, Sadowitz is well on the way to exploiting his magic solely as a prop for his comedy. Nevertheless, his opening programme scarcely justified the BBC's description of 'outrageous'. On the other hand that word would have been fully deserved by Bill Hicks who, on Channel 4 in the first week of the new year, presented a 60-minute show called Relentless which was more explicit than any comedy I have ever seen on television. A sequence about auto-fellatio (the next step in man's evolution, said Hicks, will include the loss of one spinal vertebra - 'Come on guys, work it out, you all know what I'm talking about') was capped by a gag about his parents commenting on his act: 'You're not still doing that 'suck your own cock' sketch?' Some of Hicks' material would make Lenny Bruce's live act look like the height of circumspection, though much of it is also very funny. ***** At 7.30 on the evening of Sunday December 29, 15 minutes into Auntie's Bloomers, a BBC1 copy of ITV's It'll Be All Right On The Night, I switched on the VCR and walked round the block to get a breath of air and post some letters. I returned saying that the programme must be getting an awfully big rating because, in the odd quiet of the London streets, clear of traffic during that dead period with which the British now mark the winter solstice, great bellows of laughter could be heard rolling out of virtually every house. It turned out that ITV was simultaneously screening a collection of accidents captured on home-video, called You've Been Framed, and since that achieved a rating of 12.06m it was doubtless responsible for some of the laughter. But, sure enough Auntie's Bloomers topped the Christmas ratings with 18.24m - so 30m people were watching television at 7.30 that evening. Just why collections of off-cuts, showing the mistakes and disasters which inevitably overtake actors and broadcasters during the making of programmes, should be quite so popular is a mystery. But that they are popular has been well established by 'It'll Be All Right'. So it was a little surprising to find Terry Wogan, presenter of Auntie's Bloomers quoted in one newspaper as saying of the record ratings 'This demonstrates that rumours of my demise are a little previous' for all the world as though it was the linking sentences that he read off the autocue which attracted the viewers, rather than the sight of Guy Michelmore spilling coffee on his desk seconds before he was due to read the news, or the baby elephant spilling everything on the Blue Peter studio floor. My guess is that programmes of this sort would get the same ratings whether the 'bloomers' were linked by Wogan, Denis Norden, or the car park attendant. Indeed, the worst aspect of such programmes is the desperate and of course unsuccessful straining of the presenters to be as funny as the clips. ***** Having jumped so successfully onto the 'bloomers' bandwagon, BBC1 followed up on Friday with the first in their own regular collection of accidents captured on home video: Caught In The Act. The presenter, Shane Richie, claimed 'Yer all runnin' round the country whippin' out yer hand-helds for me'. A clip showing a toddler poking himself in the eye with a plastic aeroplane was voted by the studio audience to be marginally less amusing than the sight of a black labrador mounting a small white goat. The man who shot the dog/goat video consequently won the holiday in Florida. If in the 1990s even the BBC is going down this road, perhaps this is the decade when television criticism really will cease to be a job for adults. ***** It is hard to imagine a current affairs series specialising in, say, politics or crime which did not have on it an expert in politics or crime, yet the BBC's only serious series devoted to the subject of television itself appears to have no expert on broadcasting. Biteback, screened at the dead hour of 4.25 on Sunday, devoted considerable time this week to an argument springing from the widespread belief not only that advertising is prohibited on the BBC but that you are not even allowed to mention brand names on BBC programmes. At no stage did anybody point out that what Clause 12 of the BBC licence actually says is that the Corporation shall not 'receive money or any valuable consideration' for anything it may broadcast. This, the only clause dealing with advertising, would appear to legitimise all those house-ads for Radio Times and the like, and obviously does not prevent anybody from mentioning Big Macs, let alone Hoover or Biro.</p>

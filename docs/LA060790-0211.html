			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GLASSMAN NAMED TO REPLACE ROSS AS BASEBALL COACH AT SANTA ANA  </P> <P> Bob Glassman, who coached 11 years at Willard Intermediate School in Santa Ana,  has been named to replace Bill Ross as baseball coach at Santa Ana High School.  </P> <P> Glassman, 43, was Ross' assistant this season while continuing as athletic  director at Willard.  </P> <P> He also was an assistant for two years under Herschel Musick at Santa Ana  Valley.  </P> <P> Ross, the dean of the county's baseball coaches, resigned following the 1990  season. He had a 477-235 record in 32 seasons and led Santa Ana to the 1982  Southern Section 3-A division title.  </P> <P> "It's a unique situation to replace a man who was a legend in his own time,"  Glassman said. "I learned a lot from Bill this year as his assistant, and it  will be a challenge replacing him.  </P> <P> "It will be an exciting challenge to move into the Sunset League next season,  and I'm looking forward to playing in the best baseball league in the county."  </P> <P> Glassman developed some top players who went to Santa Ana, including Julio  Vargas, Robbie Johnson, Bob Reimers, Hector Olivares and John Schilling.  </P> <P> Olivares will be Glassman's assistant and Schilling will remain as the school's  pitching coach.  </P> <P> Glassman will remain as athletic director at Willard.

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Defence arm helps Thomson to cut losses THOMSON, the French state-owned electronics group which is negotiating to merge some of its interests with CEA-Industrie, the nuclear energy group, cut its net losses in 1991 to FFr702m (Dollars 125.8m) from FFr2.47bn in 1990. The group, which is the linchpin of France's public sector with extensive interests across the electronics industry, produced a profit in its defence electronics subsidiary, but lost money in its consumer electronics interests, which were hit by a restructuring charge of FFr1.5bn. It succeeded in turning its consolidated loss of FFr1.6bn in 1990 into profits (before payments to minorities) of FFr227m. Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics division, saw its net profits rise from FFr2.17bn to FFr2.35bn on sales which slipped by 5 per cent to FFr35.18bn. The fall in sales was largely due to a reduced contribution from its Al Thakeb contract in the Middle East. The consumer electronics division, Thomson-CE, remained in the red with a net loss of FFr2.48bn on sales which fell by 6 per cent to FFr31.16bn. Thomson Electromenager saw its sales rise by 2 per cent to FFr5.08bn, contributing to group consolidated sales of FFr71.28bn, which fell by 5 per cent during the year.</p>

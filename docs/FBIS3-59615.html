Heerman, </F> chief of Siemens' Oostkamp-based Laboratory for Production  Techniques, and Engineer L. Danneels: "New Structure for  Electrical Appliances"; date and place of interview not given]    [Excerpts] The current structure of electronic  subassemblies (for example, machine controls) is not  recycling-friendly. This is partly due to the fact that an  electrical appliance contains several of the elements in  Mendeleyev's table and, given the minute quantities of each  element, dismantling and recovery is not really profitable.    The research department of Siemens in Oostkamp is  specializing in making processes and production methods more  environmentally-friendly. It has also looked at the structure  of electronic appliances. This led, among other things, to a  new way of constructing electronic subassemblies. This  technique will now also be marketed outside Siemens. M.  Heerman, chief of the Laboratory for Production Techniques of  Siemens in Oostkamp, and Engineer L. Danneels talked about the  new technique.  <H5>  Environmentally-Friendly Production </H5>   [passage omitted outlining changes in environment  legislation  over the past five years] The environmental charges, which have  previously been paid implicitly by the government (or by  nature), are now increasingly being picked up by manufacturers.  Given that this has resulted in the three environmental aspects  -- air, water, and refuse -- gradually becoming the focus of  attention, the realization slowly grew that blithely rotating  the pollution between air, water, refuse, and energy is not an  environmentally-friendly mode of operation. In any event, closer  analysis showed that this method was also unnecessarily  expensive.  <H5>  Think Ecologically </H5>   Materials and energy flows were then examined and an attempt  was made to minimize the total of all the flows. This is taking  place first and foremost in the internal production process.  Within Siemens' organization, Siemens Oostkamp has already  successfully carried out instructions to "make part of the  production process more environmentally friendly," on several  occasions, particularly in German establishments. Making  something more environmentally friendly can be by better  streamlining of production (which means, for example,  eliminating interim storage, and simply doing away with  lubricating steel tools to prevent rusting, only to clean them  again afterwards). Sometimes, it can be achieved by using  different production methods (for example, using sludge-free  techniques such as electrolysis when regenerating treatment  baths).    One essential step in this process is that when new products  and production processes are developed, those responsible should  begin to think in terms of ecological balance sheets: The  environmental impact of the entire process -- from raw material  to end-of-life product. In order to make it possible to prepare  these ecological balance sheets, Siemens Oostkamp has perfected  a software package that can compare the ecological balance  sheets of various production processes. This package is now  being marketed by Siemens Nixdorf. In addition, right from the  product development stage, attention must be paid to building in  a certain level of "recycling potential."  <H5>  Modifying Product Composition </H5>   Under pressure from the legislator, those in product  development have also woken up to the obligation that certain  products have to be taken back for recycling at the end of their  useful life. Returning products was for a time restricted to  packaging (and packaging refuse), but as of January 1994  electrical engineering manufacturers and distributors in Germany  will also have to take back decommissioned products. [passage  omitted on shortening life cycles of consumer electronics  products]    Companies are therefore finding themselves up against a huge  refuse mountain and do not know what to do with it -- dumping is  definitely not a solution the legislator will permit. The only  answer is to break it up and sort it into raw materials which  can be processed together, which is an expensive method of  recycling material. Processing today's electrical appliances  costs 3-4 German marks per kilogram if it is carried out by  specialized, environmentally-conscious reprocessing companies.  If Siemens were to take back all its appliances, that would  mean 200,000 tonnes per year. To be profitable, these recycling  costs have to drop, and this implies only one solution: Change  the raw materials and the structure of the new products released  on to the market so that material recycling becomes possible at  the end of the product's life.  <H5>  `Original' Solution </H5>   Siemens recognized this problem some years ago. Around five  years ago, its Central Research department was therefore given  the task of finding a more recycling-friendly composition for  electrical products. This work was carried out by Siemens  Oostkamp. Its instructions were: "Not just green, but also  blue," which means not only looking at the  environmentally-friendly aspects, but also making sure that the  new production method is cheaper and offers technological  advantages! This led to what is known as the SIL  [Injection-Molded Components with Integrated Conductive Paths].    So what does this involve? A normal electrical appliance is  usually built up of various printed circuits, plug-connected to  a board or independently mounted in a chassis and mutually  linked via connectors and cabling. This is usually surrounded  by a metal shield, so that the entire unit complies with EMC  [electromagnetic compatibility) standards, which is then fitted  with a housing. The components on the boards are usually cooled  using special cooling fins. If this construction method is  examined closely, it is obvious that it is a material-greedy and  expensive (labor-intensive) method. This is due to the  separation of the functions of electronics, cooling, shielding,  substrate, plug, and housing. Using the SIL technique, certain  functions in the housing are integrated.    In the housing, the functions of EMC shielding, heat  removal,  plug function, and conductors between connector pins will be  combined. This has been made possible by the choice of a  strong, heat-resistant, injectable plastic. In addition, a  suitable production method was developed for applying a copper  layer to this plastic, a laser-based process was used to make a  three-dimensional conductor structure from it, and a process was  developed enabling soldering without causing damage.  <H5>  Test Case Proves Viability </H5>   This method is used to build the substrate of a PLC  [programmable logic control] circuit. The initial advantage is  the reduction in components and suppliers. The old construction  required 11 individual components (housing, EMC shielding,  insulation, PCB [printed circuit board] with connectors and heat  removal fins, and several sets of screws and bolts) from various  suppliers, all of which of course had to be transported (also  environmentally-unfriendly). Now, the housing with integrated  pins, holders, and securing fins are all made in one piece,  using the injection molding process. The metallization layer  provides EMC shielding, heat removal, and conductor connections  between the connector pins of the plug connection.    The second advantage is the level of recyclability of the  product. The 11 functions are achieved using only two materials  (plastic and copper), both of which can be recycled.    Advantage number three relates to economics. The production  process is simpler, as a result of the short manufacturing time  and the elimination of many suppliers. The test case also  proves that production itself is clearly cheaper (if sufficient  numbers are made).    The fourth advantage is the extremely fine laser structuring  (approximately 100 micron), which means that the direct  integration of SMD [surface mounted devices] or even bare  integrated circuits or microengineering components is possible.    However, the big disadvantage is that this is all very new  and still in the design phase. All the possibilities have yet  to be "discovered." Prototyping is more difficult: As with a  designer housing, making a model is difficult and  time-consuming. For this application, the model was cut from a  solid block. Siemens Oostkamp hopes that the use of  stereolithography (making pieces from a CAD [computer-aided  design] design using adapted machines) can provide an answer.  Nevertheless, current experience is already teaching that this  method is an ecological alternative to the present,  non-ecological structure. Experience has yet to be gained.    Marketing has started: Siemens Oostkamp is offering its  services to all electronics manufacturers wanting to learn how  to integrate the new method into their products.  <H5>  From Central Research Department to The Outside World </H5>   In the past, every major company had a large research and  development section where technological development took place  and, as a spin-off, improved production techniques were devised.  Laser etching (writing to surfaces of resistances and  capacitors, for instance, using a guided laser beam, which means  the message can flexibly be adapted per component) was one of  the techniques perfected by the Oostkamp plant of Siemens'  Central Research department. Siemens' Central Research also  financed Oostkamp's reorientation toward the development of  environmentally-friendly production techniques, which started  five years ago.    All R&amp;D functions -- the development of both  technologies and  products -- were previously seen as strategic and were developed  within the framework of a centrally controlled research policy.  One company, no matter how large, can no longer afford to  specialize in everything and carry out all the research and  development it requires. Thus, for example, the development of  general production techniques is no longer considered a  component of core business research. For this reason, Siemens'  Central Research department is gradually being slimmed down.  One of the three departments in Germany was closed and  activities in the Oostkamp-based research facility -- which has  already been mentioned above and which was the only foreign  research team in this centralized R&amp;D department -- were  reoriented. Oostkamp is now entering the market as a technical  consultancy agency. The goal is clear: subcontracting for  third parties. Logically speaking, it will enter the field in  which it excels: environmentally-friendly production techniques  for electronic engineering. Activities also include consulting  with respect to process techniques, for example, making chemical  surface techniques more environmentally friendly. These  techniques were demonstrated at the IFEST fair in October.  Oostkamp also wants to help other electronics companies to  develop products and subassemblies using a new,  recycling-friendly method.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Bus companies set for buy-outs The battle for control of Manchester's two main bus companies appeared last night to have been won by the two management buy-out teams. The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority said it had decided to negotiate the sale of Greater Manchester Buses North and GMB South to the employees of each company. The authority has until March 31 to complete negotiations. But Stagecoach Holdings, a private bus company which has made a rival bid for the southern bus company, said it would be considering a legal challenge on the grounds that it had not been treated fairly.</p>

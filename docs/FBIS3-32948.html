			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 Feb (DPA) -- Peruvian  President Alberto Fujimori said today in Santa Fe de Bogota he  expects military justice in his country will enforce drastic  sanctions against those responsible for the disappearance and  assassination of a professor and nine students at La Cantuta  University.    Fujimori held a news conference at the end of his two-day  visit to Colombia and said this case "must be fully  investigated," adding he does not endorse debates on what he  called "form" issues, for example, the controversy unleashed in  his country due to the case being turned over to military  jurisdiction.    The president explained Congress issued a law (that allowed  a  changing of the venue from a civilian court to a military court)  which "must be respected." He added the case, considered one of  the most critical human rights violations in Peru, must be  investigated to locate the culprits.    The disappearance of a university professor and nine  students  occurred in mid-1992, when unidentified individuals, presumably  military, kidnapped the victims. According to journalists'  investigations, the 10 were tortured and buried in a common  grave.</p>

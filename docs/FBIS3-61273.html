			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Arkadiy Volskiy by Vladimir Loktev; place </F> and date not given: "Arkadiy Volskiy: `You May Shrug Us Off, but  You Cannot Shrug Off Reality'"]    [Text] [Loktev] Arkadiy Ivanovich, the results of the  elections to the State Duma for the Civic Union, in which you  are a member of the leadership, have turned out disappointing,  to put it mildly. It would seem that the people, tired of  political extremes, should have supported the Civic Union's  "centrist" position. On top of that, your bloc had the support  of numerous public organizations, including the Federation of  Independent Trade Unions of Russia [FITUR]. So what is the  reason for your poor showing at the elections?    [Volskiy] To be honest, we did not entertain any particular  illusions. And not because we doubted our program. On the  contrary--we firmly believed in our particular motto: "reforms  without shock." It has proven its correctness and vitality over  the past two years. The evidence of that, among other things, is  that our opponents also borrowed many planks from our program,  and even some members of the government began to utter such  words as social protection, state regulation, support for  different forms of ownership. Many understood that reforms  cannot be conducted at the expense of the people's material  well-being, turning them into meek cogs. And, finally, it is  unreasonable to present the "shock therapy" as the sole possible  way of transition to a market.    It appears, however, that we have not been able to gauge  precisely the degree of the public's expectations, the depth of  society's fatigue, and have not been able convincingly to  present the alternative we offered.    I also think that we have not conveyed in a sufficiently  argumented way and convincingly enough our ideas to those who  form public opinion: journalists, politicians, and experts. We  have not exposed the myths about centrism, which sometimes was  portrayed as a sort of camouflaged anti-reformist stance, or  almost as a "bureaucratic fifth column." Of course, such  characterizations--sometimes deliberately dishonest, sometimes  superficial, sometimes naive or conformist, have not added to  our popularity among the voters at a time when they were being  promised that already on 13 December everything would be  different. By the way, that date is long past. What has changed?    [Loktev] With which political parties and coalitions that  have received the majority of votes will the Civic Union  deputies form a bloc in the Duma?    [Volskiy] Civic Union representatives in the Duma, elected  in  single-seat districts, are geared for constructive work. Least  of all would I want to speak about this work in terms of "bloc"  positions, struggle and victories, "storm and attack," because  in the final count among the losers inevitably will be the  people and their interests. We are willing to support and will  support any realistic and substantiated draft laws aimed at  advancement of real reforms beneficial for all Russians who  produce something, regardless of the form of enterprise's  ownership.    Civic Union deputies will not impose confrontation and  intolerance. We want to be consistent to the end and not divide  deputies into "ours" and "not ours," or, God forbid, into  fascists and anti-fascists.    It seems to me that regardless of convictions, the  prevailing  qualities in the Duma should be competency, professionalism, a  high degree of responsibility and understanding of our common  duty to the people and the country. But, of course, our  constructive stance is clearly delineated: stability, justice,  and progress.    [Loktev] Do forgive me, but this triad of terms, while  sounding great, does resemble a populist slogan. What  specifically do you mean by these high-sounding words?    [Volskiy] In our understanding, stability means that the  reforms are weighted and thought through; that we reject "great  leaps," violence, and revolutionary expediency.    Justice is when a majority of the population can live rather  than just survive.    Progress is when Russia is being reborn, not  degenerating--whether in the economic sphere, science, culture,  or education.    Within this rather broad framework, we are ready to  cooperate  with anyone who is imbued with a desire to act for the good of  Russia, of the people of our motherland--not striving to invent  more illusions or loud slogans, or being concerned about their  own benefit. So that our voters would feel real changes for the  better instead of being hoodwinked by empty, unrealistic  promises.    [Loktev] Much has already been said about the "Zhirinovskiy  party's phenomenon," the reasons for LDPR's [Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia] success at the elections. Still, what is your  opinion on the subject?    [Volskiy] I would like you to get me right. I think that the  LDPR's electoral success is a serious alarm bell, first and  foremost for the authorities. The authorities in Russia are  losing authority. Presidential edicts and government decrees are  being ignored.    Banditism has been "ennobled" by calling it "racketeering,"  and these very racketeers in front of everybody, including the  militia, insolently and with impunity engage in shooting,  extortion, robbery, and murder. Law enforcement agencies  passionately register: the chairman of the Rosselkhozbank is  killed in broad daylight; a joint-stock company director is  killed; someone else is killed.... If this continues, Russians  will soon be going from home to work at a run: Attention, this  side of the street is exposed to fire....    And then comes a man who promises to strangle crime by  setting up courts-martial and executing gang leaders on the spot  by firing squad. Well, I guess when the authorities do not sound  alarms in this respect, some voters begin to think that  Zhirinovskiy offers at least some hope.    Let us look at another part of our problems. Have not some  "reformers" fanned up the confrontation and intolerance in the  society, have they not ignored demonstratively a sharp  intensification of social contracts, have they not disregarded  the vital social needs of millions of Russian citizens? Have not  our people been subjected to humiliation? they have been labeled  derogatorily as sharikovs [rabble], lumpens, sovoks ["new Soviet  men"]. And the subjects of this derogatory name-calling are  mostly those who feed the country, nourish it, keep it warm,  those who heal and educate us....    I am convinced that the election results do not provide a  sufficient reason to call someone publicly a fascist and  frighten us with historic parallels. The country has a  president, a Constitution, an office of the procurator general,  judges, and laws.    Personally, I do not believe in the possibility of the  country "going fascist;" in my opinion, our people possess  strong immunity against the brown virus.    [Loktev] Enough about politics. Let us move on to a topic  close to you: industry and production. As is known, Arkadiy  Ivanovich Volskiy is the president of the Russian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [RUIE]. This job by itself  prompts you to "ring all the bells" in connection with the  extremely difficult situation in the economy, submit to the  government proposals capable of at least halting somewhat the  disintegration of key industrial sectors....    [Volskiy] Not a day goes by, probably, without us receiving  yet another piece of alarming news of partial or complete  stoppage of enterprises. Tractor production at the Kirov plant  has been suspended until 1 February; workers have been sent on  an administrative leave. Several hundred K-700 "Kirovets"  tractors are standing, ready for shipment, in the plant's yard,  worth a total of R10 billion. The customers, mostly Russian  agricultural enterprises, cannot take delivery of the products,  because they cannot pay.    The Altaysk, Volgograd, Vladimir, and Lipetsk tractor plants  are idle, as well as the Taganrog combine plant. The Krasnoyarsk  automotive trailer plant, too. Rostselmash is working on an  irregular schedule. The general decline of production in  agricultural and tractor machine building already has reached 30  percent (as compared to last year).    The Gorkiy Auto Works alternately comes to a halt and then  back to life; the assembly line of my home enterprise--the ZIL  [imeni Lenina Auto Works]--moves only four days a week, and even  that only for one shift. Work week has been cut at the VAZ  [Volga Auto Works]. In the middle of December approximately  12,000 plant workers were sent on the administrative leave.    What is lurking behind these separate facts is the specter  of  unemployment, which threatens to materialize within the next few  months into a fully tangible army of the unemployed. Already  now, if we use the International Labor Organization methodology,  3.8 million persons in Russia should be counted as unemployed;  this is 5 percent of the able-bodied population--not 1 percent  (750,000) as official statistics tell us. If we count  potentially unemployed--those not fully employed, people on  administrative leave, and so on--their total number will come to  7.8 million, or slightly more than 10 percent of able-bodied  population.    The RUIE had warned as early as in the summer that unless  urgent measures are worked out, unless the circulatory system of  our industry is revived, in the fall and winter enterprises will  stop, and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of workers,  technicians, and engineers will find themselves on the street.  Our warnings were shrugged off; we were told that inflation was  going down, production was stabilizing, the reform had passed  its critical point, and everything would start improving any  time now. That is, we were sounding all the alarms, but all we  heard in response was that the RUIE was attempting to turn  things back to the command-administrative system and appease the  directors corps. You may shrug us off, but you cannot shrug off  reality.    We did not engage in empty criticism. The RUIE submitted a  score of proposals to both the government and the Supreme  Soviet. For instance, we proposed immediately to begin  implementing targeted programs of retraining those who had lost  their jobs, and start creating additional jobs through the  development of a public works program. We also proposed--and  these proposals are still topical--to work in the direction of  freeing the economy from being overrun by middlemen, especially  speculators.    Speaking of unemployment, we believe that there still is  time  to avert the catastrophe by combining the efforts of the  government, entrepreneurs, and trade unions. In particular, it  is necessary to codify not only in a law, but also in a sort of  an agreement among entrepreneurs, a statute that in changing the  form of ownership, an enterprise's specialization, or even a  bankruptcy, a one-time cutback in the labor force should not  exceed 20 percent of the total.    We also believe it necessary to establish special funds for  assisting the unemployed, their retraining, as well as settling  accounts with those enterprises that owe back wages and pensions.    A natural question comes up: Do these proposals indeed  perhaps lead to a slowdown of reforms or their curtailment? No,  and once again, emphatically no!    You will not find in any RUIE document even a hint at it.  The  Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs has always  supported and will support energetic implementation of economic  reforms. But we have always said, keep saying, and will do so in  the future, that the mechanisms of reform implementation  absolutely have to take into account the specifics of Russia and  our current reality. Otherwise, we will have a sharp rise in  social tension in the country; we will see the number of  opponents of the reforms multiplying, and a threat to the reform  itself.    [Loktev] Right before the new year, A. Chubays, the chairman  of the Russian Federation Committee for the Administration of  State Property, said: The Russian program of privatization has  been fulfilled. And this was not an unsubstantiated  statement--it was supported by impressive figures. Do you agree  with such an appraisal of the privatization process?    [Volskiy] If you look at the figures, it appears to move on  at a speedy pace. In my opinion, however, what is happening in  the sphere of privatization of plants and factories in Russia is  the restoration of the Yugoslav model of "workers  self-management," and in an inferior form, at that.    I believe that privatization methods must be brought closer  to a truly market approach; however, it should be done without  sharp moves, so as not to destroy not only the former socialist  system, but also the future capitalist one. The substance of  privatization measures we offer is in tying it in with the  interests of production, its stabilization and increased  effectiveness. The system of these measures is very extensive;  among them are extending the deadline and the range of use of  the vouchers, making it possible to convert them into  privatization bank deposits to be subsequently used for buying  out land, purchasing apartments, construction and repair of  housing, payment for medical services, and so on; to permit  reciprocal ownership of shares of industrial and trade  enterprises; to stimulate the creation of industrial-financial  groups, including with the participation of supplier enterprises  from near-abroad.    [Loktev] Many specialists in the VPK [military-industrial  complex] believe that a lot has been done wrong in the defense  industry conversion, and that had we continued selling arms at  previous levels, we could have had our own hard currency  lifeline for the reform. In your opinion, will Russia be able to  regain the positions it has lost in the world market of  armaments?    [Volskiy] My personal opinion is as follows: Of course, arms  sales were very lucrative for the former Soviet Union and could  be for Russia as well; it would allow for the attraction of the  means we need so much for modernization and structural  restructuring of the industry. However, as you well understand,  it is extremely difficult to regain lost positions in world  trade--the competitors are not sitting and waiting complacently.  Besides, we should not forget our obligations to the world  community. I think that Russia should not set its interests  against those of maintaining world peace. At the same time, our  diplomacy should urge Russia's partners to adopt the same  approach and act accordingly. It is also necessary to go ahead  with the conversion process, but do it sensibly and in a  thought-through manner. I want to remind you that defense orders  have drooped off by 67 percent, and our Armed Forces are half  their former size. In these circumstances, it is important to  retain the advance positions in science and technology we have  already achieved, and meet the needs of defense with  high-quality and, to the extent possible, the best armaments in  the world. Let us not create another illusion, however, that the  defense industry allegedly is capable of solving all our  economic problems. We cannot avoid a large-scale structural  restructuring and modernization of the entire production base,  including agriculture. And defense production should take its  strictly defined place among all others.    At the same time, the state must understand that, having  created a gigantic defense industry, it has certain obligations  to it and to the people employed there, and has no right to  abandon them to their own devices under the pretext of  noninterference in economic matters. Yes, we need to scale down  defense production, but not destroy the advanced scientific and  technical base. I personally would like to see Russian  automobiles, steel, tires, television sets, and other such items  become as famous in international markets as our tanks,  submachine guns, anti-aircraft missile systems, multiple missile  launchers, and fighter aircraft.    [Loktev] Arkadiy Ivanovich, a last--and as they say,  frontal,  question: If offered, is the RUIE willing to "delegate" its  representatives into the government?    [Volskiy] We are willing to take part in the government, but  naturally, the government that would share our philosophy of  reforms without shocks and unnecessary social costs. We are  ready to undertake most decisive steps and reforms, but on the  principle "Measure seven times before cutting."    I would also like to use this opportunity to wish TRUD  readers our most sincere good wishes and congratulations for the  New Year.</p>

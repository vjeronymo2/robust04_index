			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER THOUGHT QUICKLY AT WRONG END OF GUN  </P> <P> Standing in the middle of a San Diego motel robbery, off-duty Officer Robert  Ray Barr decided he would die if he handed over his wallet. It carried his  Huntington Beach police badge.  </P> <P> So he lied, claiming it was in his car. Then, as a pair of bandits trained a  12-gauge shotgun on him and six other people, Barr managed to toss the wallet  unnoticed under a chair.  </P> <P> But, as he lay on the floor, face down, the bandits persisted. They wanted to  know what was in his back pocket.  </P> <P> He showed them, pulling out a .22-caliber handgun and firing a single round. He  missed, police said Monday, and was wounded twice by the return fire.  </P> <P> "He thought they would kill him if they knew he was a cop," said San Diego  Police Lt. Paul Ybarrando, one of several officers investigating the case.  </P> <P> "It's amazing he wasn't killed," Ybarrando said. "The guy was standing over him  with a shotgun."  </P> <P> Barr, an accident reconstruction expert and 13-year Huntington Beach officer  who turned 43 today, was reported in fair condition Monday in the intensive  care unit of Sharp Memorial Hospital. He suffered leg and arm wounds in the gun  battle, which unfolded late Saturday in the lobby of the Hampton Inn on Kearny  Mesa Road.  </P> <P> Although at least half a dozen people lay sprawled near the officer, no one  else was injured in the exchange.  </P> <P> Ybarrando said Barr "was basically forced into reacting. The wise thing he  intended to do was to be a heck of a good witness after it was all over. But he  had to get involved."  </P> <P> San Diego detectives are investigating the shooting, which occurred about 10:30  p.m. Saturday after the two masked robbers invaded the motel as Barr was  leaving.  </P> <P> Barr, who had spent the day at the San Diego Zoo with his fiancee and two  teen-age daughters, left them in the car and inquired about a room. The inn was  booked, and, as he walked toward the door, two men wearing white masks stormed  into the lobby.  </P> <P> One vaulted over the front counter; the other trained a shotgun on the victims.  The gunman ordered Barr and the others to lie face down on the floor. The  robbers seized the motel's receipts -- police refused to disclose the loss --  as well as the wallets of the desk clerk and the other people in the lobby.  </P> <P> From a half-kneeling position, Ybarrando said, Barr fired one round at the  bandit. He thought he had hit him, but evidence indicates he did not, Ybarrando  said. The gunman fired back at close range, striking Barr once in the leg,  severing an artery. Barr fell face down. The gunman fired again, wounding Barr  in the left arm.  </P> <P> The bandits, described as about 6 feet tall and wearing dark clothing with  white sheets or scarfs cloaking their faces, ran out the front door and hopped  a fence of a neighboring hotel. Ybarrando said no vehicle was seen.  </P> <P> One of Barr's daughters flagged down a passing policeman as Barr's fiancee, a  nurse whom police would not identify, applied a tourniquet to his leg.  </P> <P> Barr underwent surgery Saturday night to repair his arm wounds and nerve damage  to his leg. His condition was upgraded from critical to fair Monday.  </P> <P> The gun Barr fired was not his service revolver, Huntington Beach Police Lt.  Jeff Cope said; officers from that department are armed with larger-caliber  weapons. The department's officers are allowed to carry guns off duty and, in  fact, are expected in their own time to perform as officers of the law if  necessary, Cope said.  </P> <P> "It's not required that an officer carry a gun off duty," Cope said, but "it's  almost an unwritten rule. You almost have to these days."  </P> <P> Cope, who has worked with Barr since Barr joined the department, said that, to  his knowledge, Barr has never been involved in a shooting, on or off duty.  </P> <P> He described Barr as "very well-liked" and mild-mannered.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Blake Fontenay contributed to this story.  </P></p>

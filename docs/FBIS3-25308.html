He said at the General De Wet Training  Grounds in Bloemfontein that he had not only resigned as chief  minister of Venda, but also from the Transitional Executive  Council's subcouncil on defense. He was also no longer an ANC  [African National Congress] candidate for the coming election.  On the alleged poor hygiene at the base, Gen. Ramushwana said  the situation had been caused by Transkei sending too many  soldiers. Many of them had been sent back.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Precious metals falls leave traders 'shell-shocked' 'THE BEARS have really got the bit between their teeth,' commented one gold dealer yesterday as London bullion market prices fell on the back of the overnight plunge on the New York futures markets. No single factor appears to have sparked the retreat. Analysts cited talk of global recession, well-timed producer selling from Australian gold producers and the fall in the stock market in Japan, the biggest platinum consumer. Added to the cocktail was a fall to six-year lows of a Commodities Research Bureau futures index watched widely as an inflation indicator and the easing of tension in South Africa, the biggest platinum producer. Once the ball started rolling on Wednesday in New York, US investors and commodity funds bailed out of the market in a frenzy of selling. Yesterday the London gold market closed at Dollars 338.25 a troy ounce, a fall of Dollars 8.10 and the lowest close for two months. Platinum was fixed at Dollars 351.75, down Dollars 16 and silver closed at 381.5 cents, down 7.5 cents. In late trading both gold futures on Comex and platinum futures on Nymex were showing further heavy losses. The active October platinum contract was down Dollars 7.80 at Dollars 346.50 and the December gold contract was off Dollars 4.50 at Dollars 337.50. Mr Brian Nathan, managing director of Ayrton Metals, said the rout on Wednesday could have been sparked by news that the chairman of General Motors had announced the possibility of further plant closures later this year. 'Fund managers decided not to wait any longer,' he said. Platinum is now widely regarded, like silver, as an industrial metal - automotive exhaust catalysts account for nearly 40 per cent of total platinum consumption. Its fall has taken the gold market with it. Gold's recent rally ended in failure to breach the Dollars 360-a-troy-ounce level, and many analysts believe it is heading back to the recent low of Dollars 335.20, struck in May. 'It looks horrible,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst with Carr Kitkat &amp; Aitken. 'It came down so fast you would be a mug to touch it.' He believes the big commodity funds, which had been beginning to take renewed interest in the gold market, would be put off for at least six months by the speed of the fall. 'There are an awful lot of shell-shocked people out there,' said Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst with Williams de Broe, part of the Banque Bruxelles Lambert group. She believes there is not much support for gold above the level of the recent low. Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch, pointed out that there was no longer anything mystical about gold, which has to be regarded as a commodity like any other. There was no sign of any strong buying on the horizon which could take gold back up, he said, suggesting that the market could touch Dollars 320 or below. 'Dollars 355 looks like the Matterhorn now,' he said. Mr Charles Kernot of Durlacher &amp; Company, stockbrokers, said that, looking at the charts, he 'would not be surprised if gold came back to Dollars 325' in the short term. However he remained bullish about gold in the long term, because he believed that the general world economic malaise would lead to currency devaluations. Mr Neil Carson, marketing director at Johnson Matthey, the world's largest platinum marketing group, stands by the company's May forecast that the price would reach Dollars 400 a troy ounce by the end of the year. 'These dramatic movements can sometimes happen in this month, when there are so few players in the market.' Automotive catalysts used 500,000 troy ounces in 1991, but this year 800,000 troy ounces will be used, Mr Carson said, pointing out that by the end of December every new car in the European Community has to be fitted with a catalyst. 'If the price dropped by Dollars 5 in any other month than August, there would have been heavy buying into the drop,' he suggested. Other observers believe the platinum market will bounce once August is over, but see Dollars 380 as the top level this year - and then only if the world's economic performance improves in the final quarter.</p>

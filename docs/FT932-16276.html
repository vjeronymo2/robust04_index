			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Turkey calls for UN support in Armenia conflict TURKEY yesterday sought the support of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council for a draft resolution calling on Armenia to withdraw from territory taken in recent fighting with Azerbaijan. Turkey has hitherto tried to take an even-handed approach to the conflict between neighbouring Christian Armenia and Azerbaijan, a fellow Moslem state with which it has growing links. However in a move marking a hardening of its position, Ankara yesterday announced it was banning all flights to Armenia which passed through its airspace. Diplomats in Ankara said the worsening conflict seemed certain to derail peace talks in Rome under the auspices of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The latest fighting, with Armenian forces seizing the strategic town of Kelbejer over the weekend, has intensified domestic pressure on the government to move to contain what is seen by Ankara as Armenian aggression. However rather than acting unilaterally, diplomats say Turkey is seeking UN support to end the attacks on 'Azerbaijan's territorial integrity'. Clashes were reported again yesterday along the Azeri border close to the disputed enclave of Nagorno Karabakh, which is populated by ethnic Armenians. Recent Armenian gains have further opened up the strategic Lachin corridor linking Armenia with Karabakh. Azerbaijan said yesterday that its forces had repelled a Armenian attack on the key southern town of Fizuli. Local officials said the Armenian forces were now three miles outside Fizuli, which lies in a narrow strip of Azeri territory separating Nagorno-Karabakh from Iran. Capturing Fizuli would have cemented gains made by Karabakh Armenian forces in a recent offensive and would have brought all of south-western Azerbaijan under Armenian control. The Turkish Foreign Ministry yesterday called in ambassadors of the permanent five to urge immediate UN condemnation of the Armenian offensive which Azeri officials claim has resulted in the loss of 10 per cent of its territory. Armenia claims the latest operation was in response to continual Azeri artillery attack on villages in the disputed enclave. After pressure from both France and the US, countries with large diaspora Armenian communities, Turkey braved domestic criticism to open its rail link with Armenia via Dogu Kapi. Last week, however, Turkey halted all aid convoys to Armenia. Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's prime minister, warned Turkey's patience was running out. Turkish Foreign Ministry officials said policy was under 'hourly review'.</p>

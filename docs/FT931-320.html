			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Low for BM Shares in BM Group, the construction equipment company, fell sharply after a report that it will make a bigger than anticipated loss of at least Pounds 30m this year, against profits of Pounds 34.6m last year. Scottish and Northern institutions were quick off the mark, with many London dealers initially left in the dark, after a story that appeared in early editions of Saturday's Financial Times. That early selling sent the stock tumbling to hit a five-year low of 40 1/2 p before steadying to close 5 down at 42p. Just over a year ago, the shares were trading at around 400p, the company having reported interim profits of Pounds 17m, but went into retreat in June last year following the resignation of the chairman.</p>

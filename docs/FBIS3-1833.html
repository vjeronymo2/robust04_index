			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Chinese Side Has Sincerity, So the British </F> Side Must Not Erect Obstacles"]    [Text] The Chinese side recently agreed to resume the  airport panel meeting to discuss the fourth airport financing  plan proposed by the British side. This shows the Chinese  side's sincerity. The Chinese side has been in favor of  building a new airport in Hong Kong on the condition that the  relevant financial package complies with the Memorandum of  Understanding (MOU).    The meeting will help the two sides exchange information,  study the feasibility of the newly proposed financial package,  and ensure that the financial package agrees with the airport  MOU. The Chinese side has not been given all the materials on  the project or detailed data on the financial package and cannot  afford to hire experts to carry out studies like the Hong Kong  Government, which has great financial strength due to its  enormous revenue. Given this situation, an airport panel  meeting, at which the Chinese side can directly put questions to  the British side and the latter can summit documents and  materials on the feasibility studies, will certainly help judge  whether the fourth financial package follows the principle of  cost efficiency and whether it will leave a heavy financial  burden to Hong Kong people.    Nevertheless, there are still quite a few unclear areas in  the fourth financial package tabled by the Hong Kong Government,  which places obstacles before the meeting.    After announcing that it had formulated the fourth airport  financial package before the Spring Festival, the British side  has launched a propaganda offensive over the last few days,  repeatedly insisting that the debts of the Provisional Airport  Authority (PAA) and the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Corporation  are not government debts and that, as the British Hong Kong  authorities had met the demands of the MOU by increasing  investment, the Chinese side should reach an agreement with the  British side on the "new financial package."    According to press reports, under the new financial package,  the British will increase investment by HK$15 billion [Hong Kong  dollars], but the PAA and the MTR Corporation will still run up  debts as high as HK$28 billion, approximately six times the HK$5  billion stipulated in the MOU. With such a large debt, how can  the new financial package be said to have "complied with MOU  requirements"?    The British side continued to falsely allege that the debts  of the PAA and the MTR Corporation are not part of the  government debt, but such an argument is untenable. Since the  MOU has stipulated that the British Hong Kong Government is  responsible for the airport's core projects, how can the British  side defect responsibility onto the two institutions? Again,  the two institutions are wholly owned by the government, so  their debts must be undertaken and paid by the future Special  Administrative Region (SAR) government after 1997. Just as a  senior Hong Kong Bank economic researcher pointed out: For the  two institutions to take on loans is a matter concerning the  Sino-British agreement. Without sufficient guarantee, the two  institutions are unlikely to get the money they need. Even if  banks agree to extend the loans, they would increase the annual  interest rate to over 10 percent, because the two institutions  would not be able to give security for their debts. Such a high  interest rate would make it impossible for the borrowers to pay  off their debts--though they might be willing to pay the high  interest due to the lack of a sufficient guarantee--and  accordingly would increase the banks' risk. The result would be  that no banks would lend money to the two institutions. This  analysis also reveals that borrowing money in the name of the  MTR Corporation and the new Airport Corporation instead of the  Hong Kong Government contravenes the principle of commercial  operation and also deviates from the principle laid down in the  MOU. If the two sides fail to reach agreement on the financial  arrangements for the new airport, will the PAA and the MTR  Corporation be able to get the money they need?    The British side described the fourth financial package as  the best choice because of the increase in investment, termed it  a generous gift for the Chinese side, and urged the Chinese side  to rapidly accept the offer. This argument is not supported by  facts. As long as one compares the sharp increase in the  construction costs with the small and slow increase in the  British Hong Kong Government's investment, one will realize that  the most important concern is for the airport financial package  to follow the principle of cost effectiveness. If construction  costs are not capped and get out of control, the debt will  continue to grow much faster than investment. In 1991, the  construction costs of the new airport were HK$98 billion. In  March 1992, they increased to 120 billion, and today have  reached 175 billion -- and still no cap has been set on them.  In the first airport financial package, there was an unexpected  "callable equity [huo you fu zhai 2057 2589 6298 0280]" of HK$21  billion and the combined debt of $73 billion to be owed by the  PAA and the MTR Corporation, totaling HK$94 billion. A  financial package with such huge debt was naturally opposed by  the large numbers of Hong Kong people and the Chinese side.  Then the British side, forced to change its tactics, put  forward the second financial package in September 1992. In this  package, the British side demanded that 50 percent of the  proceeds from selling the 62 hectares of land above the airport  railway due the SAR government be injected into the rail plan in  an attempt to use the SAR government's money to help pay the  debt. Even so, the debts of the PAA and the MTR Corporation  were still as staggering as HK$22.9 billion. As the British  side's attempt to appropriate the land premium due the SAR  government was strongly criticized, the British side tabled the  third airport financial package in June 1993. In this financial  package, the British side agreed to plow into the railway plan  its 50 percent share of the land premium from the sale of the 62  hectares and to allocate HK$5 billion from the Hong Kong  government's financial surplus to symbolically increase the  investment, but the debts of the PAA and the MTR Corporation  soared to HK$45 billion, nine times the figure set in the MOU.  In the meantime, the British side was busy providing  appropriations and parceling away the airport project in an  attempt to create a situation of high cost and low returns, and  a huge debt in the future which China would be forced to take  over. In view of this attempt, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office made a firm four-point statement. Sensing that its coy  plan was not going to work, Britain pulled another trick -- the  fourth package. From the zany growth of the airport's  construction costs and the Hong Kong government's symbolic  increase in funding, we can see that the most crucial point in  the airport package is the principle of cost efficiency. If  prices keep rising with no end in sight, the only thing that  will happen is that actual debt will rise alongside the cost.  This will happen despite any agreement between China and  Britain on the financial arrangements. There is no guarantee  that the debt will not keep increasing.    China has always supported the construction of a new airport  to ensure and develop Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and  has consistently insisted that the airport project observe the  principles of cost efficiency and not saddling the future SAR  government with a financial burden. If Britain had followed the  provisions of the MOU, there would have been a financial  arrangement agreement. Britain should have the sincerity to act  in accordance with the MOU and stop its stalling tactics, for  that is the only correct way to solve the airport problem.</p>

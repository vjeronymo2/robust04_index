			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Personal View: How to avoid a slump Britain's humiliating departure from the exchange rate mechanism seems to have left the government bereft of an economic strategy. The prime minister talks of expansionary policies, but the assertion that the country can now benefit from the forced change smacks more of making the best of a bad job than conviction. Notwithstanding yesterday's long-awaited Mansion House speech, the uncertainty remains. Labour, too, has yet to find its voice - partly, perhaps, because of lingering embarrassment about its own past support for the failed policies and partly because its continuing need to seem more papist than the Pope induces an unnecessary degree of caution. The danger is, therefore, that a government short of ideas itself will listen to the only political voices raised on the question of what to do next. The Thatcherite right is in no doubt that massive cuts in public expenditure are now needed, despite the obvious risk that this will simply intensify the recession by encouraging it to feed on itself. Yet there is surely no absence of a coherent strategy with which to extricate Britain from its present predicament. Parallels are never exact, but there is a striking similarity between the present plight - as we pay the price of two years of the ERM - and the recession which accompanied and followed our adherence to the gold standard. The Keynesian remedies then adopted offer a guide to what should now be done. The first step must be to understand and acknowledge the truth about the exchange rate and its impact on Britain's competitiveness. The government must now renounce the self-delusion which led it to believe that, with a massive trade deficit in the middle of a deepening recession, the UK was competitive with the Germans at DM2.95 to the pound. It should assert that the depreciation is not just a happy accident, but is an essential precondition of recovery and that henceforth industry can have the assurance, on which it can safely base its investment plans, that a competitive rate will be maintained. This will enable the government to bring down interest rates much further than it has so far contemplated. Interest rates at 8 per cent are still very high in real terms, and they seem even higher to those who are feeling poorer as a consequence of the savage asset deflation of the past two or three years. Low interest rates and a competitive pound will raise demand for British goods at home and abroad and will stimulate output. That will be reinforced by the third element in the necessary package of measures  - a substantial, counter-cyclical increase in public investment, to build the houses that are needed, provide and restore the infrastructure that has been neglected, and stimulate a productive sector that has been starved of activity. But how, it will be asked, is such an increase to be financed? Surely the public sector borrowing requirement is already spiralling out of control? Is it not necessary to do precisely the opposite of what I propose - to cut spending or raise taxes or both? And if my advice were followed, would not increased public spending inevitably lead to increased borrowing, thus forcing up interest rates and negating the benefits of escaping the exchange rate imperative of keeping interest rates high? The answer to this dilemma is that, in the short term, the government should not attempt to fund the extra spending. After all, in the Thatcher years there was a fivefold increase in the banks' creation of private sector credit, a credit explosion which flowed directly into asset inflation, consumption and imports. Surely a government prepared to preside over that irresponsibility could now essay a modest credit expansion of its own, especially when it would be put to so much more constructive purposes. A deliberate policy of underfunding in the short term would provide a stimulus to industry and keep interest rates down. The current circumstances of high unemployment and low business confidence are exactly those in which a cheap money policy is not only appropriate but could be expected to work. As soon as it did work, and circumstances changed, a change in that policy would also be required. There will be those who cry that monetising the debt in this way would be to take unacceptable risks with inflation. But why should we shy at ghosts? Only ideologues could argue that the UK's most pressing problem is inflation, when it is teetering on the brink of a disastrous slump. When that danger has been averted, there will be time enough to give priority to inflation. And as this package of measures does its work, it will also bring with it a solution to the PSBR problem. The evidence from the 1980s boom is that the revenue is remarkably buoyant when economic activity is at a high level. The most effective solution to the problem of the deficit - and to the problems created by the government's failures and now faced by the whole country - is to end the recession.

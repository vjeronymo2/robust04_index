Before opening fire a grenade was lobbed into the tavern  which did not detonate.    The attack which happened at 11:50 PM followed a similar  pattern to that in Kenilworth, Cape Town, earlier this year when  gunmen lobbed a grenade and opened fire on worshipers in the St  James Church. Eleven people died in that attack.    Three people in the tavern among the about 60 patrons were  killed in the attack while the owner of nearby Machados  restaurant, Jose Cerqueira, was also killed by the attackers  when he tried to return fire.    The area was immediately cordoned off by police and  roadblocks set up as far as George and Port Elizabeth, police  radio control said. Police had also deployed 43 additional  vehicles in the townships to try and locate the getaway vehicle,  a blue Opel Rekord believed to have been stolen in Khayelitsha  at 11PM. Police helicopters were also being deployed.    The grenade was later on Friday morning detonated by police  in the tavern resulting in windows being blown out.    The scene at 4:30AM resembled a shambles. Benches and tables  were piled outside in station road.    The media were not allowed inside the tavern as police were  still busy with investigations, but from the entrance it looked  like the tavern had been hit by a bomb.    A coffee shop, "Down at Marlenes" opposite the tavern had  one  of its windows shattered by bullets. The owner of the Benson  Bistro close to the Heidelberg Tavern, Anita Haupt, said she was  just closing her premises when the attack occurred. "I thought  it was a car backfiring," Ms Haupt said. She said the owners of  the restaurants in the area were getting together to organise  stricter security.    SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] TV news later  reported the registration number of the getaway car as being XA-  20252.</p>

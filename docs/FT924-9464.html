The lavatory seat company was losing money at the time and was being restructured by Mr David Coveney, managing director and leader of the buy-out team. The buy-out was advised by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, and Eversheds Alexander Tatham, the solicitors. 3i, the investment capital provider, has taken Pounds 1m of equity, with County NatWest Ventures and Barclays Development Capital taking Pounds 500,000 each.

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Fraud law faces urgent reform in England THE GOVERNMENT is considering remodelling key aspects of English fraud law along Scottish lines as part of an urgent reform package to solve the problems of complex and unmanageable City trials. This follows widespread criticism of the handling of high profile trials such as Guinness, Blue Arrow and Barlow Clowes which reached their conclusions after many years of costly wrangling. The main reform under consideration is the introduction of a wide-ranging offence of fraud which does not exist under present English law. In Scotland, a charge of fraud may be brought under common law and does not need to be allied to a particular statute as it does in England. However, thoughts of abandoning trial by jury in complex fraud cases, as recommended by the report of the Roskill Fraud Trials Committee, are not being seriously entertained. The government may also enact measures to shorten the length of trials by ensuring that arguments outlined by defendants at pre-trial reviews are adhered to when they reach full trials. The government has been under extreme pressure in recent weeks to come up with a cheaper and quicker way of dealing with serious fraud. The collapse two weeks ago of the second trial arising out of the 1986 Guinness takeover of Distillers was accompanied by a call from the presiding judge for a 'radical solution' to the problems of long fraud cases. The absence of a simple fraud charge means that prosecuting authorities such as the Serious Fraud Office have to identify specific acts such as fraudulent trading, misuse of company funds or false accounting. The indictment in the Blue Arrow trial, which lasted just over a year and cost an estimated Pounds 35m, contained only one charge but was followed by 20 paragraphs of detailed allegations, each of which had to be explained to the jury. Government law officers will need to find a way of framing a simple charge of fraud without having to include complicated and costly specific allegations similar to those in the Blue Arrow indictment to cover the particular circumstances of each case. Mr Justice Henry, the judge in all four Guinness trials, told the jury: 'Once again this case has thrown up the problems of long criminal trials and the appropriateness of our criminal justice system . . . to such long and complex trials.' Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, recently undertook to consider any request from the SFO to allow it to opt for civil instead of criminal proceedings in prosecuting large fraud cases. In civil cases, prosecuting authorities need to establish their case only on a 'balance of probabilities', rather than the more stringent 'beyond reasonable doubt' criterion required in criminal cases. Mr Redwood also agreed to look at any SFO request for greater investigative powers. A move to increase the effectiveness of pre-trial reviews would probably chime well with the views of Lord Roskill, who chaired the three-year inquiry into the conduct of fraud cases which reported in 1986. The former Law Lord argued earlier this month that 'a very firm line' should be taken at preliminary hearings 'so that the issues have been streamlined by the time the case gets to trial.' The Labour party has said it would streamline the role of agencies responsible for dealing with fraud and would consider appointing specialist legal advisers to juries involved in complex cases. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, acknowledged two weeks ago that urgent attention needed to be given to possible changes, while warning there was no easy solution.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Association of Kuwaiti </F> Correspondents; date and place not given]    [Text] Quoting a report by the U.S. Overseas Press Club,  the Cable News Network, CNN, has reported that there are 22  correspondents held in jail in Kuwait as prisoners of  conscience. The Association of Kuwaiti Correspondents, which  was astonished by such a report and its timing, especially as it  was carried by a network that is particular about its sources  and its information, would like to indicate that the information  and figures contained in this report are totally false.    The association would also like to express its deep  disappointment and indignation at the release of such reports on  the State of Kuwait. Through this statement, the association  would like to stress that there is not one single prisoner of  conscience in Kuwait, and that the State of Kuwait is one of the  few countries in the world where there are no prisoners of  conscience.    The truth of the matter, and in order to correct the  information, is that the report carried by CNN, which was  quoting the U.S. Overseas Press Club, concerns those who  collaborated with the authorities of the treacherous Iraqi enemy  during its occupation of the State of Kuwait. Those  collaborators took part in the publication of what was called  AL-NIDA paper. This paper was the mouthpiece of the despotic  Iraqi regime and it expressed its criminal and erroneous  policies and harmed Kuwait's political and diplomatic standing  during the period of the tyrannical occupation. Those  collaborators, which were concerned by the totally false report,  worked for the benefit of the Iraqi enemy occupying the land of  Kuwait and carried out actions aimed at weakening the morale of  the Kuwaiti people and their spirit of resistance by taking part  in the publication of what was called AL-NIDA paper.    Those mentioned in that fabricated report are now in prison  because they collaborated with the Iraqi enemy and not because  of an opinion they wrote in the Kuwaiti press or because of a  viewpoint they expressed in that press. It is worth noting that  all those prisoners are craftsmen and technicians specialized in  printing and maintenance of printing equipment, and that the  majority hold Iraqi and Jordanian citizenships.    As is common knowledge, these people were tried by the  Kuwaiti justice -- which is renowned for its fairness -- for  collaborating with the Iraqi occupying enemy. Their trial was  held in open sessions and in the presence of the international  press, TV stations, news agencies, Red Cross delegates, and  organizations concerned with human rights. The CNN  correspondent was one of those attending those trials. All  legal guarantees were offered to the prisoners concerned during  their trial. Everyone witnessed the impartiality and fairness  of those trials.    The Association of Kuwaiti Correspondents would like to  reaffirm that there are no prisoners of conscience in the State  of Kuwait and it wishes the CNN and the U.S. Overseas Press Club  to check the accuracy of their information before reporting  them. The Association is also totally prepared to cooperate to  clarify any piece of information that any side would like to  verify on the situation of journalists and the press in the  State of Kuwait.</p>

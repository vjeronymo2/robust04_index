			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions - Buyers take over IN A RELATIVELY quiet week, there has been a change in bias from selling to buying. This may reflect the improvement in directors' confidence for the economic outlook. Whether this will be sustained remains to be seen. Shares in Lincat Group, which designs and manufactures commercial catering equipment, have risen steadily since March 1992. That was when Martin Craddock, the chairman and chief executive, bought 15,000 shares at 72p. Last week, John Craddock, the president, sold 250,000 at 148p, reducing his holding to about 1.44m At the end of March, British Polythene Industries' completed successfully a one-for-six rights issue. Rex Stone, the non-executive chairman, has now sold 200,000 shares at 488p to leave him with 550,059 shares. Persimmon, a residential building and development company, has seen its share price rise 30 per cent relative to the FT-SE 100 index over the past three months. Last week, chief executive John White sold 80,000 shares - over half his holding - at prices between 271p and 277p. The directors of Expamet International, the metal products company, have been buying shares since August last year. Dr John Roberts, the chairman, bought 450,000 last week at 53-55p, so increasing his holding to 504,843 shares.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               No of Company                  Sector     Shares      Value     directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Assoc Nursing Servc        Hlth     50,000       105            1 British Polythene          PP&amp;P    200,000       976            1 Croda Intl                 Chem     30,000        82            2 Haggas (John)              Text     16,000        19            1 Kode                       Elcs     20,000        34            1* Lincat                     Misc    250,000       370            1 NFC Variable Voting        Tran      6,000        16            1 Persimmon                  ConC     80,000       219            1 Protean                    EngG      7,000        11            1 Servomex                   Elcs      9,715        26            2 United Newspapers           Med     35,000       208            1* Watmoughs                   Med      8,000        52            1 Whatman                    Hlth      2,100        10            1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aberdeen Trust             OthF      50,00        18            1 Amberley Group             Misc    160,000        43            1 British Assets Tst         InvT     50,000        68            1 Brooke Tool Eng            EngG    150,000        11            2 Elec &amp; Gen Inv Co          InvT     50,000        77            1 Evered Bardon              BMat    130,041        49            1 Expamet                    IndM    450,000       246            1 Hall Engineering           EngG     17,788        33            3 London Forfaiting          OthF    200,000       389            2 MTL                        Elcs     10,000        22            1 Rentokil                   BuSe      9,356        20            1 Smith (WH) A Ord           Stor      2,500        11            1 Smiths Industries          EngA     21,505        76            5 Smith New Court            OthF     35,000        74            2 Spear (JW)                 Misc      4,000        19            1 Sun Alliance               InsC      5,000        16            1 TI Group                   EngG     10,000        30            2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

"Seoul and Beijing have agreed to sign the agreement on  cultural exchanges and are now negotiating details of the  agreement. The agreement is to be initialed in February and is  likely to be signed officially in March," the official said.    "China sent a draft agreement to Seoul and we delivered our  reply, and recently China returned its revised draft. The  drafts of both countries are nearly similar, so the agreement  will be initialed by the end of February," he said.    It usually takes a month from initialing an agreement to its  formal signing, so Seoul and Beijing are expected to sign the  accord formally in March.    "The agreement refers to cooperation in many areas like  culture, art, academics, education and sports and it will serve  as momentum to boost cultural exchanges between Korea and China,  which have shared close cultural exchanges over thousands of  years," the official said.    The agreement stipulates that the two countries set up a  Korea-China cultural joint committee, which will deal with  details on cultural exchanges.    "Once the agreement is signed, the two nations will  undertake  joint projects such as restoration of old buildings in China,"  the official said.    Before the Seventh Century, Koreans controlled a great deal  of Northeastern China, so many Korean cultural assets exist in  the region.</p>

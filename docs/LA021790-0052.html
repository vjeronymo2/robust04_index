			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TENTATIVE DECISION MADE NOT TO PROSECUTE IN  DEATH  </P> <P> Officials in the district attorney's office in Pasadena have made a preliminary  decision not to file criminal charges against five housing project security  employees in connection with a struggle that led to the death of a 28-year-old  man on project grounds last month.  </P> <P> Robert Earl Holloway, a part-time employee of the Pasadena Parks and Recreation  Department, died Jan. 18 after employees of Gold's Security Patrol chased him  through the King's Villages housing project in Pasadena.  </P> <P> He died after he was put in a neck hold during a struggle, the coroner's office  has ruled.  </P> <P> Don Eastman, head deputy district attorney in Pasadena, said his office has  tentatively rejected pressing assault charges against four of the employees and  involuntary manslaughter charges against the fifth -- a dispatcher who  allegedly administered the neck hold.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Eastman notified police of the decision. But after the dead man's  mother urged him to continue investigating, he said he would examine the case  again and issue a final decision on Tuesday.  </P></p>

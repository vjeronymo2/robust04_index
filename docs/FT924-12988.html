			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Travel: In the torn-out heart of Kaliningrad - Giles MacDonogh takes the back route to a Russian outpost 'YOU'RE ON your own from now on if there are any problems with your papers,' said my Polish friend encouragingly. We had arrived at the 'staff' (workers') border crossing from Poland into the Russian province of Kaliningrad, the Russian half of the formerly German East Prussia. The normal crossing is on the Baltic coast, but German coaches were forming queues which could last up to four days. My papers seemed to please the Russians, for they established me as a British businessman looking to cement ties with a province cut off from the rest of Russia by the independence of the Baltic states. My Polish visa identified me as a writer and journalist, but I had prudently put that in my pocket. Crossing from Poland to Russia, the architecture changed little: these were the same Prussian villages that are also found around the Mazurian Lakes on the other side of the divide, only here everything was shabbier, more cluttered: an indication of the large population that was settled here in the post-war years. Within half-an-hour we had reached the outskirts of the old city of Konigsberg, now called Kaliningrad. It is not a pretty sight. A big British raid in the summer of 1944 ripped out the guts of the mediaeval city; when the Russians arrived some six months later they decided to bulldoze virtually everything that remained. Unlike the Poles, the Russians had not the slightest legitimate historical justification for their absorption of this corner of the Reich, and this must have helped them decide to destroy all of the remaining evidence. My first impression of Kaliningrad was of a provincial Russian city filled with crumbling slab-blocks and jerry-built tenements swarming with squaddies in the uniforms of all three services. In Warsaw, Intourist had booked us into the Hotel Patriot, but both my Polish travelling companions were sceptical about its existence. One of them called to a teenager and offered him a few roubles to take us there. The boy got in and off we sped. The hotel keeper eyed us with suspicion. She studied all the documents we could provide, hoping to find some discrepancy. A missing stamp would have given her the right to refuse us access to our rooms. The papers proved authentic, though, and we carried our luggage into the hall where a gaggle of Russian policemen were watching a dubbed Spanish soap opera on TV. On each floor the guardians were engaged in similarly taxing work. We went out to see if we could find anything of the pre-war city. In the main square the statue of Lenin was still in place, for Kaliningrad is the most conservative of Russian cities. Not far away were a few surviving buildings: examples of the heavy Wilhelmine German renaissance revival of the turn of the century. The saddest sight of all was the old city island in the Pregel River with the remains of its red brick gothic cathedral. Old photographs show Konigsberg to have been a largely unspoiled mediaeval town with clusters of ancient buildings round the cathedral and university. Like Paris, it had begun life on an island, but had spread to either side of the river. Now the whole centre had been cleared of buildings and their place taken by a memorial park. All that remained was the roofless hulk of the cathedral and, on the north side, the monument erected in 1924 to mark the bicentenary of the birth of Immanuel Kant. Kant was possibly the only one of Konigsberg's sons to mean something in the Marxist-Leninist scheme of things. There is no memorial to that other great Konigsberger, E T A Hoffmann. Other relics of the past were few and far between. Some of the forts of the early 19th century perimeter wall were still standing, one of them housing a lacklustre amber museum. I was astonished to see that the Russians had neglected to remove two portrait roundels from the facade. They represented Scharnhorst and Gneisenau: the generals credited with the creation of the Prussian general staff. Another pre-war construction is the enormous market. Russians had travelled hundreds of miles to sell off a few old clothes, the family clock or a rusting ship's anchor. A Swedish radio team was interviewing the market people. We got talking. They had been to see a community of ten Germans who, together with a Lutheran pastor, had taken over the old Kreuzkirche and held services there on Sundays. All the Germans had crept back from the Baltic states some 20 years after the mass expulsions of 1945-1947. We spoke to a woman who wanted to sell three dried fish for 75 roubles. My Polish friend teased her, suggesting I wanted the fish. She offered them to me for 70 roubles. Later in a cafe, which sold no coffee, some local boys tossed us half a dried fish to eat with our beer. Dried fish is useful: it provokes a thirst for vodka. We ate that night in the Olstyn restaurant, which is more notable for its atmosphere than its food. Among the dollar-wielding wide boys who were making money out of the decaying Soviet system were collections of wild girls who changed partners with alarming frequency. One in particular never passed our table without hoisting her skirts in greeting. Later she threw a tantrum over the defection of one of her many partners and cleared the table of crockery.</p>

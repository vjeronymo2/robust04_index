			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Japanese government decided to move to aid  Russia in wiping out nuclear weapons. It looks like the two  countries will formally sign an agreement on aid in the  dismantling of nuclear weapons during President Yeltsin's visit  to Japan on 11 October, and a committee geared toward  implementing the aid plan will be started in Tokyo. Furthermore,  cooperation in surveying the problem of radioactive waste  dumping into the ocean and other such support will continue to  steadily expand to Russia. While proceeding with territorial  negotiations, it is essential that the Japanese government,  which takes the route of "expanded equilibrium" as the basis of  its dealings with Russia, makes an expression of aid to Russia  and implements that without any problems. Given that Japan has  no experience in the area of nuclear abolition aid, there is  increasing concern about the success or failure of such an  effort.    The agreement for aid in abolishing nuclear weapons that  President Yeltsin will sign when he comes to Japan is a part of  the voluntary aid to Russia that the government announced at the  G7 meeting in Tokyo last April. On this occasion, Japan is  declaring that it will provide about $100 million in gratuitous  funding to four former-Soviet nations that posses nuclear  weapons--Russia, Ukraine, Byelarus, and Kazakhstan--and is  negotiating separate agreements with the four countries. Russia  will be the first to receive this bilateral aid.    Japan's aid to Russia in the dismantling of nuclear weapons  comes later than other countries such as the U.S. and France,  which are already proceeding with bilaterally based assistance.  The prospect is for the aid plan to be implemented within the  year under a committee jointly created by Japan and Russia.    The main areas in which Japan will provide aid are the  construction of storage facilities for storing and managing  plutonium and other nuclear substances resulting from the  dismantling of nuclear weapons, the elimination of radioactive  pollution around nuclear facilities, and assistance in medical  treatment for radiation injuries. Japan will also send experts  to Russia for technical guidance and will provide needed  equipment such as radioactivity detectors.    Japan's policy is not to participate in the actual  dismantling of nuclear weapons because that would contradict the  "triple nonnuclear principle." Although the areas of assistance  are limited, the government's standpoint, according to a  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) source, is that "there is the  way to make the most of Japan's unique character, because Japan  is second to none when it comes to technology and research on  the safe management and peaceful utilization of nuclear  substances." A nonnuclear country, Japan's promotion of other  countries' peaceful use of nuclear materials "is significant in  that it appeals to a position of contributing to the world's  peace and nuclear nonproliferation."    Furthermore, Japan's technical and financial assistance in  the construction of nuclear storage facilities will also  contribute greatly toward halting Russia's dumping of  radioactive waste into the sea. Japan fears the marine pollution  and the effects on marine life due to the former Soviet Union's  and Russia's dumping of radioactive waste into the sea. Although  Japan wants an immediate stop put to the dumping of liquid  waste, Russia cannot comply with the request because of its lack  of preparedness, such as poorly equipped storage facilities.  Because of that, too, the need to speed up the aid is indicated.    Given such a background, both the Japanese and Russian  governments agree that the aid plan should be implemented soon.  At first, the two governments were expecting that the agreement  would be signed in June. That slipped more than three months  because of the confrontation between the Russian government and  parliament.    The fact is that negotiations between the two countries were  stifled because the Russian parliament showed disaproval in  response to Japan's request to include in the agreement the  removal of tariffs on aid goods. Nevertheless, an MFA source  says that "the prospects for signing the agreement look much  better" because of Yelstin's bold action in dissolving the  parliament on 21 September.    But, even if the agreement is signed, there is still a long  road to implementation. "First, we ascertain what sort of  support can Japan provide that will not overlap with the other  countries already aiding Russia, and what sort of support does  Russia want. Everything will go from there," says an MFA source.  There are high hurdles to overcome before an outline of the  implementation is created, people are selected to carry it out,  and goods are sent.    Another thing that causes great concern is the situation  within Russia. The aid is largely premised on the progress of  Yeltsin's political and economic reforms, but, with the recent  bloody incident, the aid's good cause was damaged, and some  expect the brakes will be applied to the implementation of the  aid. An MFA spokesman says that he "would like to move into  implementing" the $100 million in voluntary aid that was decided  in a supplementary budget last June "in some form or another,  within the fiscal year." However, apparently that will be  affected by the political trends within Russia.</p>

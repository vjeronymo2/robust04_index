			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of Lithuania's parliament, Ceslovas  Jursenas, has expressed approval of the results of an 30 April  meeting between the presidents of Russia and Latvia, Boris  Yeltsin and Guntis Ulmanis.    In an interview with INTERFAX, Jursenas described an  agreement on a deadline for Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia  as "the most important achievement" of the meeting.    He said the accords signed by the two presidents were  "undoubtedly significant" not only for Russia and Latvia but for  the entire Baltic region. Thus, they could help negotiate a  deadline for Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia, he said.    Commenting on last week's reception by Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas of a letter from Yeltsin, Jursenas expressed  the hope that the two presidents' exchange of letters "will help  eliminate moot points and problems in the relations between our  two countries."    But he said he could not understand why Russia unilaterally  suspended agreements that had already been reached. He said  Lithuania takes the position that signed agreements must be  carried out and that other problems, such as that of Russia's  exclave Kaliningrad Region, must be negotiated after or  simultaneously with that. "We understand the interests of  Russia, but Russia must also understand and respect our  interests," he said.</p>

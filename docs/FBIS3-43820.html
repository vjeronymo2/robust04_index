The move opens the way for the PAC to take part in the  April 27 election and for the inclusion of APLA members in a  national peacekeeping force.    Mr Makwetu said the decision had been taken by the PAC's  National Working Committee in the light of the promulgation of  the Electoral Act and decisions reached at its annual conference  in December last year. "The leadership of APLA has started the  process of informing its cadres throughout the country of this  decision," Mr Makwetu said in a statement.    He said the PAC would pursue negotiations with the  government  to reach a mutual cessation of hostilities and to secure amnesty  for APLA cadres in jail and exile. "We will also continue to  negotiate with the regime and other parties to get all the armed  formations in this country, including the South African Defence  Force and the South African Police, under joint control. APLA  will not disband until these goals have been reached." He said  the PAC expected other armed formations to respond in kind.    A unilateral decision had been taken because the government  was dragging out negotiations with the PAC and finding excuses  to continue killing PAC members and raiding its offices, he  said. "Because of our commitment to peace and free and fair  elections, we are taking the regime's excuse and taking the  initiative to create a climate to allow for further  negotiations."    Mr Makwetu said the PAC would register as a political party  and unveil its list of candidates and election manifesto within  weeks. He said he remained confident of substantial support for  the PAC in the elections in spite of opinion polls which give it  little hope in the poll.    Negotiations, in particular on joint control of all armed  formations, would determine whether the PAC would join the  Transitional Executive Council (TEC). However, the TEC Act  stipulates that only TEC members are eligible to have their  soldiers included in a joint peacekeeping force.    The PAC move follows pressure from Tanzania and Zimbabwe on  the PAC to rejoin the constitutional process and a threat by  those countries to act against the PAC if APLA continued to  operate from those territories, formerly supporters of its war  on the South African Government.    Mr Makwetu said he could not rule out any further APLA  attacks as it would take some time before all APLA cadres were  informed of the decision.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Officials play down plan to hive off fraud office Government officials appeared last night to be playing down the significance of the announcement by Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, that he has ordered studies of the scope for hiving off the Serious Fraud Office, Crown Prosecution Service and Treasury Solicitor's Department into executive agencies. Sir Nicholas is understood to have an open mind on the issue and determined not to be rushed on a decision. Officials were keen to stress that the studies were simply part of the government's continuing review of civil service functions announced back in 1988. The studies were condemned by Mr Alistair Darling, Labour City spokesman. He said Sir Nicholas was trying to 'wash his hands' of the SFO. He added: 'There are a number of people in the financial services industry who believe that we need a single enforcement agency. We urgently need an efficient regulatory system to protect London's reput-ation.' The handling of serious fraud is already under review by Mr John Graham, a Treasury official who used to work at the SFO. He is not expected to report before February. The study into the feasibility of making the SFO an executive agency will not begin until Sir Nicholas has had time to assess Mr Graham's report. Doubts about the scope for turning the SFO and CPS into executive agencies centre on the impact it would have on direct ministerial accountability for prosecution policy and decisions. The SFO said yesterday that it was too early to say what effect executive agency status would have on its relationship with the attorney-general - but the lack of direct ministerial accountability was clearly an issue. It pointed out, however, that the SFO already has many of the characteristics of an executive agency - it operates at arm's length from ministers and has to present an annual report to parliament. The new agencies would have to publish framework documents setting performance targets. An in-house team has won by default the contract to provide typing and secretarial services to the Inland Revenue's 58 offices in the south-west region. All the private-sector bidders dropped out. The contract won by Secretarial Typing Services is worth Pounds 12m over five years, with the final two years subject to a range of quality and service performance targets.

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): April durables orders spark brief Dow rally Wall Street AFTER EARLY support from a stronger than expected April durable goods orders report and demand for cyclical stocks, US share prices slipped back from morning highs to leave just a minor improvement on the day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 6.23 up at 3,370.44, having been more than 15 points ahead at one stage. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained a marginal 0.76 at 412.17, while the Nasdaq composite added 1.70 at 577.35. Turnover on the New York SE was a moderate 182m shares. After Tuesday's decline, prompted by concern about the effect on the US economic recovery of higher crude oil prices, yesterday's news of a 1.4 per cent rise in April durable goods orders was a welcome surprise. Although the headline figure disguised underlying weakness in non-transportation goods orders, equity investors were cheered by the data, and there was particularly strong early demand for cyclical stocks, which include transportation issues. The buying soon petered out, however, and trading was subdued for most of the afternoon. Motor manufacturers were boosted by surprisingly strong mid-May car sales, which surged to their highest level since late-December. General Motors rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 39, Ford Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 44 1/8 and Chrysler Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 17 7/8 , all in heavy trading. Energy issues ran into some inevitable profit-taking as investors booked some of Tuesday's gains. Exxon retreated Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 61 7/8 , Mobil Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 65 3/8 , British Petroleum ADRs Dollars 1 to Dollars 59 5/8 , Occidental Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 22 3/8 and Texaco Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 64 5/8 . Control Data advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 13 1/8 in turnover of about 1m shares after stating that it would divide into two separate companies through a spin-off to shareholders. Conner Peripherals dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 on reports that top executives and board members at the disk-drive manufacturer have been selling large amounts of their stock in the company. Syntex dropped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 in active trading in the wake of disappointing fiscal third quarter operating income of Dollars 127.5m, little changed from a year earlier. CML Group climbed Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 on news of third quarter profits from continuing operations of 44 cents a share, more than double the profits earned a year ago. On the Nasdaq market, Corrections Corp plunged Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 5 3/4 after a newspaper reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigations is looking into whether the company bribed officials to win prison contracts. 50-Off Stores lost Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 14 1/2 in turnover of 1.2m shares as investors reacted coldly to first quarter earnings short of analysts' forecasts. Canada TORONTO ended barely changed from the day's opening, although telephone utility shares dipped and oil shares continued to climb. Telephone issues fell on nervousness about an impending regulatory decision on long distance telephone services. The composite index was up only 0.6 at 3,382.9 and rises led falls by just 296 to 276 after volume of 27m shares.</p>

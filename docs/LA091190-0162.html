			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SEN. BIDEN WANTS SPECIFICS FROM SOUTER  </P> <P> Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. said today that Supreme  Court nominee David H. Souter should answer specific questions on abortion and  other politically volatile issues at his confirmation hearings.  </P> <P> "At this fateful moment in our history we have a right to know" the answers to  such questions, said Biden (D-Del.)  </P> <P> .As Judiciary Committee chairman, he will preside over the hearings on Souter's  nomination, scheduled to begin Thursday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the president of the National Organization for Women charged that  Souter's nomination is part of a right-wing campaign to stack the court with  justices hostile to the rights of women and minorities.  </P> <P> NOW President Molly Yard told a news conference that Souter is "almost  Neanderthal" and that his record indicates that he would vote to overturn the  Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, which legalized abortion.  </P> <P> "You're literally talking about women's lives," she said. "That's what's at  stake."  </P> <P> Biden brushed aside any notion that it would be wrong to force a Supreme Court  nominee to give his views on such matters as abortion, civil rights and freedom  of religion that will come before the court.  </P> <P> "All signs point to the need for very extensive, detailed questioning of this  nominee," Biden said.  </P> <P> He said he has not decided yet whether the federal judge from New Hampshire  should be confirmed. But he did acknowledge that "a number of questions have  been raised in my mind."  </P> <P> He called the nomination "the most important business to come before the Senate  this year" and said Souter's impact on the court will linger "long after (Iraqi  President) Saddam Hussein has bitten the dust, long after the current budget  crisis has been replaced by some other fiscal dilemma."  </P></p>

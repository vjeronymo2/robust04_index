			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Jan 25, BNS -- Eleven Estonian MP's in a  statement yesterday expressed their outrage at what they called  insulting statements made to the press by the chief of the  country's defense forces, Major General Aleksander Einseln.    Einseln in his statements recently has called the country's  problem military unit, the Laanemaa volunteer infantry company,  a "political mob" and has driven parallels between the unit and  the Nazi groups in Germany at the beginning of the Hitler era in  early 1930's.    Einseln, an emigre Estonian and retired U.S. army colonel,  who returned to his home country and took over command of the  defense forces last spring, has also been publicly critical of  the Estonian state and people.    The MP's in the statement admit there are lots of problems  of  a complex character waiting to be resolved in Estonia, including  problems in the defense forces and in the sector of the Interior  Ministry.    "But all this cannot and shouldn't serve as basis for any  person in the service of the Estonian state to disdain the  Estonian people and the Estonian state," the MP's say.    The MP's who signed the statement say Einseln must publicly  bring his excuses or an explanation of a possible  misinterpretation of his words by the media.</p>

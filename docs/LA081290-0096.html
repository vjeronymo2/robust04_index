			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'FIRM ACCUSED OF DEPOSIT FRAUD'  </P> <P> I applaud the efforts of the Consumer Protection Unit of the Orange County  district attorney's office in continuing the efforts against landlords who  retain security deposits illegally ("O.C. Rent Firm Is Accused of Deposit  Fraud," Aug. 1).  </P> <P> Your readers should be aware that the Consumer Protection Unit has handled  similar cases in the past.  </P> <P> In 1987, a similar situation was brought to our attention.  </P> <P> The landlord, who had 13 properties throughout Orange County, immediately  corrected the rental agreement and attempted to contact every previous tenant  in the past four years to refund any security deposit due to them. In fact,  about $30,000 in refunds were made.  </P> <P> Because it was impossible to find all of the previous tenants, the landlord  also paid $200,000 to the district attorney's office in a restitution fund in  January.  </P> <P> That money was to be used primarily for the investigation and prosecution of  housing cases, i.e., retaining security deposits illegally, substandard housing  or housing not up to code, and housing discrimination. In addition, the  landlords agree to pay $150,000 in civil penalties to the county.  </P> <P> I was the deputy district attorney who handled that case where there was an  estimated 4,000 violations.  </P> <P> It is my hope that the district attorney's office can establish a hot line for  reporting housing problems and take fast action by using some of the $200,000  in the fund set up for prosecution of housing issues.  </P> <P> Too few tenants know their rights or where to turn for help. Had the district  attorney's office established such a hot line in January, think how many  alleged victims of the Elerding Properties might have been saved.  </P> <P> GAY GEISER-SANDOVAL  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

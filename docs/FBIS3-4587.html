He has also played the role of  spokesman for the North Korean mission because of his  outstanding English.    [Chong Yon-chu] An agreement has finally been reached  through the talks. How do you feel after the settlement?    [Ho Chong] We now can expect a third round of high-level  talks and a package-deal settlement of not only the nuclear  issue but also general issues between the DPRK and the United  States in the third round of talks. In light of this, it is  very fortunate that, although belatedly, the United States  withdrew unfair [pudanghan] preconditions and an agreement was  successfully reached. Now each of us has to exert maximum  efforts so that peace on the Korean peninsula can be achieved  through the package-deal resolution of the abnormal DPRK-U.S.  relations.    [Chong] Why did the talks last longer than expected?    [Ho] Because the United States insisted on unfair  preconditions.    [Chong] What were the preconditions?    [Ho] I cannot tell you concretely. The preconditions were  unacceptable to us.    [Chong] Could you tell me about the contents of the  agreement?    [Ho] The basic contents are as follows: "The DPRK and the  United States, according to the principles of the DPRK-U.S.  joint statement announced on 11 June 1993, have had several  meetings in New York with the aim of exerting joint efforts to  resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue.    Based on the negotiations, the DPRK and the United States  agreed to take the following four measures on 1 March 1994.  First, South Korea and the United States announce the  suspension of the Team Spirit exercise. Second, inspections for  the assurance of the continuity of nuclear safeguards, which was  agreed on 15 February between the DPRK and the International  Atomic Energy Agency, begin on 1 March. Third, a working-level  contact for the North-South exchange of special envoys will  resume in Panmunjom. Fourth, the DPRK and the United States  will hold the third round high-level talks on 21 March 1994 in  Geneva."    [Chong] According to the agreement, a working-level contact  for the North-South exchange of special envoys will resume in  Panmunjom on 1 March.    [Ho] If the South requests a working-level contact, it will  be held immediately on 1 March.    [Chong] There were reports that you would be summoned home.    [Ho] I read from South Korean newspapers that I would soon  leave. As a public official, I would leave if the government  asks so. But I have not received such news.    [Chong] Will you be at the Geneva talks as well?    [Ho] We have to wait and see.</p>

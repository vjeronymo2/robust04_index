Rodriguez, how is the  pacification process developing in the Huallaga  Countersubversive Front under your command?    Rodriguez: Regarding the pacification process, we  can say that it is 90 percent under control in the northern  region (San Martin). This means that the MRTA [Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Movement] and Shining Path [SL] have been almost  totally annihilated. In the southern region (mainly in Tingo  Maria) we are still facing problems with subversion because the  last subversive groups persist in their genocidal venture and  have not surrendered to authorities. However, I can inform you  that the entire area will be completely under control very soon.    Orellana: The legal measures issued by the  government, such as the Repentance Law, have yielded excellent  results in other regions. What was the impact of this  legislation on the antiterrorism struggle?    Rodriguez: Look, initially these measures were  received with some mistrust in the region. People did not  believe they would result in anything positive. It was thought  that the measures' objective was to pressure people. Time has  gone by and these people, I cannot say to what sector they  belong, have realized how mistaken they were. There have been  many terrorists who have voluntarily resorted to the Repentance  Law without any sort of pressure.    When these terrorists presented themselves to the Armed  Forces barracks and units their human rights were respected, and  this attitude also has influenced subversives to resort to this  new law.    Orellana: What other factors have yielded positive  results in the counterterrorist struggle in the Huallaga Front?    Rodriguez: In addition to the Armed Forces'  actions and the legal measures, we can say that citizen  participation has been another fundamental element in winning  the war against terrorism. Their cooperation has been valuable  in the last few years.    In addition, the Armed Forces are actively participating in  this effort and we are constantly engaged in clashes with  terrorist groups with very positive results.    Finally, I must say that psychological operations are also  an  essential part of the war we are currently waging against the SL  and MRTA. In the jungle area, we drop pamphlets from our  airplanes telling terrorists, who have been recruited by  force,xbout the serious mistake they are making by staying with  the terrorists. Many already have abandoned these shelters and  surrendered under the Repentance Law.    Orellana: In the Huallaga Front, there have been  some cases of the involvement of military officers with drug  traffickers. What can you tells us in this regard?    Rodriguez: We have sustained harsh blows from  these bad elements of society who have seriously damaged our  institution. The Peruvian Army will never allow its members to  be involved in this illegal activity.    However, we bear the full responsibility and we fully trust  that this situation will end there. Corruption is not part of  the Armed Forces' institutions.    Orellana: How are you combating drug trafficking  in the Huallaga Front under your command?    Rodriguez: At the present time, our units, our  commands, and the Huallaga Front commander himself are directly  involved in fighting drug trafficking.    We are constantly destroying airfields and the shelters the  drug traffickers build in the more remote jungle areas. We  conduct dragnet operations whenever we have specific information  to capture the ``drug traffickers'' and this is yielding very  good results.    Orellana: This, of course, is forcing drug  traffickers to withdraw to other areas where they are also under  attack.    Rodriguez: Quite so. We are destroying all  illegal activity in this area. This is why drug traffickers are  withdrawing to other areas, where they are being attacked in the  same manner. They will have no way out when we control the  entire region.    We witnessed this when we seized three metric tons of  cocaine  paste some time ago in Manu. We have had access to this  information since January. This is very important for us  because very soon we will eradicate them from the entire San  Martin region, although not entirely.    Orellana: General, how has the respect for human  rights developed in the pacification process?    Rodriguez: We uphold human rights in every aspect  of the word. There are no human rights abuses in this area. If  there have been charges in this regard, they have been from  biased parties uninterested in seeing the Armed Forces working  in the region.    I will give you one example: When we entered Bellavista  within the framework of a military operation that upheld all the  laws in force and that even appointed a special prosecutor,  there were people who reported that the alleged terrorists we  arrested had been allegedly mistreated. All these fabrications  were later denied by the special prosecutor who accompanied the  military operation.    Orellana: Does this mean there is no evidence of  the alleged human rights violations charges that have been  raised?    Rodriguez: No there are not. None of the charges  raised against the Armed Forces' activities in the area have  been proven. Perhaps some may have been very aggressive but this  does not mean that people have deliberately committed abuses  against those arrested in Huallaga.</p>

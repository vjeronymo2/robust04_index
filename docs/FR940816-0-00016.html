			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For international commercial trade (export and re-export), CITES requires certification that parts and derivatives of the species were acquired before June 11, 1992 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that the wood is pre-Convention). Over the last several centuries and especially in this century (until 1970), most guitars (as well as several other fretted musical instruments such as banjos, basses, mandolins, and ukuleles) have been comprised of some to much Brazilian rosewood, and many of these musical instruments are in international commerce. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service reviewed Brazil's proposal to include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dalbergia nigra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (the Brazilian rosewood) in Appendix I. The species occurs naturally only in fragmented populations in remnants of the Mata Atl&acirc;ntica (Atlantic Coast Tropical Rainforest) of Brazil. A substantial amount of new information and data on trade in the wood of this species were received from persons in the music industry. The United States continues to agree that the species in the wild needs strong conservation measures, and did not enter a reservation on the listing of the species in Appendix I. The United States has had experience in the pre-CITES certification of articles (including musical instruments) with elephant ivory, tortoise shell, or hard coral, and will continue to endeavor to make the pre-CITES certification process efficient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procedural Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice simply implements changes in the list of species in the Convention's appendices that have already been approved by the Conference of the Parties at their eighth meeting, and that the United States is bound to accept unless it entered reservations. The Service does not believe that implementation of any of these adopted amendments would be contrary to the interests or laws of the United States. The period of time during which the United States could have entered a reservation on any of these amendments ended on June 10, 1992. The Service did not recommend the entry of any reservations, and none were taken by the United States. Therefore, these amendments to the CITES Appendices have been in effect for the United States since June 11, 1992. This notice brings the information in 50 CFR 23.23(f) into agreement with the current species listings in the CITES appendices. Earlier  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices informed the public about these amendments and provided opportunity for comment on them, and they were included in a public meeting on May 26, 1992 (see the May 11, 1992,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 57 FR 20126). Therefore, the Department of the Interior has determined that good cause exists for making this rule effective upon its date of publication [5 U.S.C. 553(d)]. Accordingly, paragraph (f) of &sect;23.23 of 50 CFR has been amended at the conclusion of this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has determined that amendments to the Convention's appendices, which result from actions of the Parties to the Convention, did not require the preparation of Environmental Assessments as defined under authority of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4347). This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) does not apply to this listing process. This final rule does not contain information-collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An editorial clarification for 50 CFR 23.23(f) under Class Aves (Birds) in the Order Psittaciformes (Parrots, etc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) emphasizes that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Psittacula krameri  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (rose-ringed or ring-necked parakeet) remains in Appendix III and was not included in Appendix II in 1981 at the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This document was prepared by Drs.

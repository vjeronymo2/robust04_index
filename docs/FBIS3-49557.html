			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Lech Walesa by Grzegorz Miecugow; </F> place and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [Miecugow] In connection with the NATO stance  and the final shape of the Partnership for Peace, do you have a  feeling of defeat?    [Walesa] No, I think that my actions have yielded some  results because I think the outcome could have been even worse.  However, I want to say that in my opinion we could have  achieved more. In my opinion we could have gone further, but  the great powers of this world have decided otherwise and we  have to conform to this.    [Miecugow] Do you mean that although more could have been  achieved, the current situation is no fault of ours?    [Walesa] There is no fault on our part, because this was  beyond our reach. I did all I could to make this step somewhat  longer. As a practicing politician, I believe that European  geography should be changed, that European direction and  development should be prejudged now, that uncertainties should  be confronted with visions and concepts. This would be a better  way of dealing with things. Why bet on the unknown?    If European geography expands, it would become clear that a  zone of uncertainty is becoming smaller. But as I have said --  this was not to be. We will have to do much more. We will have  to work more, and we will reach the same objective but much more  slowly, not by leaps but by crawling.    [Miecugow] Have you got a plan for further actions? How do  you want to lead Poland to NATO?    [Walesa] I think that after what I and we have done, the  pressure by nations will be greater. I believe that at the same  time we will have to go back to the past and speak about  international agreements, that they have their consequences. We  did not do this after the year 1939 and this is bad because you  forget about these things today. You tend to remember our  agreements, even the financial ones. Some even have grievances  against us, saying that we are not a solid partner. But I want  to say that those partners were not honest toward us; we also  counted on a different course of events in 1939, but agreements  were broken, commitments were not met, and these are just  consequences.    You have to talk about this, because on an international  scale greater morality is required as far as all these  commitments are concerned. If we fail to do this, then there  will continue to exist temptations to break or to depart from  great agreements. [passage omitted]</p>

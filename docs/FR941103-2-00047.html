Under the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), ERA may request that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement special refund procedures. See Petition for Implementation of Special Refund Procedures, 10 CFR 205.281. These procedures are used to refund monies to those persons who were injured by actual or alleged violations of the DOE price regulations. We have considered ERA's September 17, 1992, request to implement Subpart V procedures with respect to the monies received from Doma Corporation (DOMA) and Don Martin (Martin) and have determined that such procedures are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Petition filed by ERA seeks to implement special refund procedures for monies that were remitted by DOMA and Martin pursuant to Final Remedial Order No. HRO&hyph;0209 (the Order) issued on July 25, 1985, by OHA. Under this Order, DOMA and Martin were found to have violated provisions of the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations during the period November 1973 through June 1977 (the audit period). A total amount of $5,982.32 has been remitted to the DOE. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This Decision and Order sets forth OHA's plan to distribute these funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The alleged violations referred to in this Proposed Decision and Order involve the sales of both crude oil and refined petroleum products. However, in view of the size of the payment and the fact that most of the overcharges relate to crude oil, the OHA has determined that the interests of administrative efficiency would best be served by considering all monies received to be the result of crude oil violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

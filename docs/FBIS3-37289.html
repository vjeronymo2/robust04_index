			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russian Nationalities and Regional Policy Minister  Sergey Shakhray, who has prepared the text of the treaty on the  mutual delegation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan, has  called the document "a great breakthrough in development of  federative relations." In his interview with Interfax he  declared that "for Russia Federation [this] does not mean  weakening of the state but is the sole means to preserve the  nation's territorial integrity."    Shakhray pointed out that laws and Russia's Constitution  have  actually not acted on Tatarstan's territory over the last three  years (the term during which the treaty was being developed).  As he said, this situation could have led to a political crisis.    Shakhray reported that a new method to develop documents had  given impetus to the success of the negotiations. "We were  moving to the text of the basic treaty basing on concrete  agreements. Thanks to this we managed to prepare both the  document itself and mechanisms to implement it," he said. In  Shakhray's opinion, this method makes it possible to sign an  identical treaty with Chechnya as well. At the same time he  underlined that the text of the document to be signed with  Groznyy would differ from the one signed with Tatarstan.    Tatarstan's participation in the elections to Russia's  Federal Assembly is the political result of the treaty, said  Shakhray. "This means recognition of Russian Federation's  sovereignty, its legislation, and Constitution on the part of  the republic," he underlined.    Shakhray does not rule out possibility that other  constituent  members would wish to take the course of agreed relations with  federal bodies of state power. Development of such a process,  to quote Shakhray, corresponds to the country's Constitution  which stipulates that economic and regional "self-tuning of the  federation" should be built with the help of treaties. Shakhray  also underlined that the federal parliament should adopt a  decree on principles of division of objects of responsibility  and authorities to regulate this process.    According to Shakhray, in the future Tatarstan may join the  Federative Treaty in the field of provisions which coincide with  the provisions of the treaty on division of objects of  responsibility and authorities signed on Tuesday.</p>

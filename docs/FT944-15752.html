			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Back to German basics Any sighs of relief in German bond and equity markets at Chancellor Kohl's close run victory last night are likely to prove short-lived; the markets rose strongly last week in anticipation of a coalition victory and investors will soon be turning their attention back to fundamentals. Here, nothing has changed. The German equity market is propped up by expectations of a near-doubling of corporate earnings this year and further substantial profits growth in 1995 and thereafter, but still looks expensive by historical standards. It is yielding 2.5 per cent for this year, which does not look attractive in comparison with yields of just under 7.5 per cent on German government bonds. The outlook for bonds could have changed significantly for the worse had a high-spending, left-leaning coalition taken power. With Kohl re-elected, the government is likely to press ahead with further fiscal tightening but this alone will not persuade the Bundesbank to cut short-term interest rates further. Prudent fiscal policy, in any case, will be no easier to achieve, given the the coalition's thin majority in the Bundestag, and its weakened position in the upper house. In the meantime, the focus will be on the usual factors which determine inflation over the mid-term: the rate of growth in the German economy, the money supply, and the outlook for next year's wage round. In all three cases the Bundesbank has plenty to worry about, despite the fall in headline inflation towards 2 per cent. It will want to see, at the very least, September's data on money supply and industrial production before revising its position on interest rates.</p>

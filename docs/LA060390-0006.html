			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: CAR CULTURE;  </P> <P> BRILLIANT DEDUCTIONS  </P> <P> ARROGANT, PRECISE, keen-witted -- that was Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes.  The movies he and Nigel Bruce (as Dr. Watson) made in the '40s are classics.  </P> <P> But did you know they also had a radio show during World War II? These  wonderful original radio broadcasts -- a great antidote for the commuter blahs  -- have recently been issued on audio cassette (about $10 each).  </P> <P> In "The Iron Box," Holmes and Watson are entrained for Edinburgh on The Flying  Scotsman when Holmes reveals that they are traveling at 53 1/2 miles per hour.  How does he know that? Elementary, my dear Watson. You take your watch and . .  . well, you'll have to tune in to find out. There are more than 20 of these  radio shows now out on audio cassettes (two adventures per tape).  </P> <P> The tapes are available from Simon &amp; Schuster Audioworks; (800) 678-2677.  KEITH LOVE  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Request for Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is also taking the opportunity in this proposal to solicit all available information on product uses of HTMR slag materials derived from K061, K062, and F006, including information that provides responses to the following questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What are the various product uses of HTMR slags that result in placement on the land, and the relative annual volumes of these slags going to each use?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What, if any, historical data are available with regard to the environmental impact from product uses of HTMR slags?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;How are HTMR slags processed and distributed prior to use?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What are the similarities or differences in the physical/chemical properties of HTMR slags and materials that may be used as substitutes ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , blast furnace slags)?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What, if any, toxicity tests have been conducted with the HTMR slag material itself ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , aquatic toxicity tests), and are data from these tests available for review?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What requirements, if any, are needed to ensure that the slag is not used for prohibited uses?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Limited Effect of Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment to &sect;266.20 would effectively prohibit non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slags derived from K061, K062, and F006. Although BDAT standards provide some measure of safety, it is the Agency's intent to further evaluate these uses based on risks posed to human health and the environment and to determine if additional generic exclusion levels should be proposed in the near future. As discussed above, information provided by representatives of the major generator of HTMR slag indicates that the portion of HTMR slags that are currently being processed for non-encapsulated product uses is relatively small (less than 15% of the HTMR slags that are used as waste-derived products). Following the prohibition, this portion of HTMR slags may be used to produce other waste-derived products that are still exempt under &sect;266.20(b). These other uses ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , use as road-base material) are encapsulated uses that appear to present much lower risk to human health and the environment. There also exists a generic exclusion under &sect;261.3(c)(2) that allows for the disposal of HTMR slags in subtitle D units. Finally, if it is not possible to meet the conditions of the exemption or the generic exclusion, the HTMR slags would be subject to full regulation as hazardous wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is not changing the notification, record-keeping and reporting requirements contained in existing regulations for hazardous waste being used to produce products used in a manner constituting disposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is proposing that this rule be effective six months after the date of publication of the final rule. (See RCRA section 3010(a)). The Agency believes that this would provide sufficient time for affected parties to comply with the proposed change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. State Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Applicability of Rule in Authorized States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administer and enforce the RCRA program within the State. Following authorization, EPA retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility. The standards and requirements for authorization are found in 40 CFR part 271.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, a State with final authorization administered its hazardous waste program in lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements no longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could not issue permits for any facilities that the State was authorized to permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority within specified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect in an authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, under RCRA section 3006(g), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by HSWA take effect in authorized States at the same time that they take effect in nonauthorized States. EPA is directed to carry out these requirements and prohibitions in authorized States, including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorization to do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized States in the interim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Effect on State Authorization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA views today's proposed rule as a HSWA regulation. The proposed rule can be viewed as part of the process of establishing land disposal prohibitions and treatment standards for K061, K062, and F006 hazardous wastes. (See 56 FR 41175). The ultimate goal of the land disposal prohibition provisions is to establish standards, ``if any'', which minimize short-term and long-term threats to human health and the environment posed by hazardous waste land disposal. (See RCRA section 3004(m)(1)). In this case, the Agency is uncertain what level of treatment would assure that these threats are minimized when HTMR slag is used in a non-encapsulated manner, and consequently is effectively proposing a prohibition on this type of use. (See 57 FR at 37237, August 18, 1992, interpreting ``if any'' clause in section 3004(m)(1)). Thus, as noted above, EPA will implement today's rule, if finalized, in authorized States until their programs are modified to adopt the new prohibition and the modification is approved by EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposed rule will result in more stringent Federal standards. Section 271.21(e)(2) requires that States that have final authorization must modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and must subsequently submit the modifications to EPA for approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States with authorized RCRA programs may already have requirements similar to those in today's proposed rule. These State regulations have not been assessed against the Federal regulations being proposed today to determine whether they meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State is not authorized to implement these requirements in lieu of EPA until the State program modifications are approved. Of course, States with existing standards could continue to administer and enforce their standards as a matter of State law. In implementing the Federal program, EPA will work with States under agreements to minimize duplication of efforts. In many cases, EPA will be able to defer to the States in their efforts to implement their programs rather than take separate actions under Federal authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Regulatory Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866 (see 58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

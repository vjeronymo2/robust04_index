			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Solidarity leader Lech Walesa predicted that the newly legalized labor movement  will dwindle as it gives rise to splinter groups during the growing political  pluralism in Poland. Speaking at a Rome news conference at the end of a  three-day visit to Italy, he also praised President Bush's proposed aid for  Poland and voiced his support for economic reforms in the Soviet Union. "From  Solidarity, other economic and political organizations will be born," said  Walesa, a strong proponent of pluralism. "Solidarity for the moment is huge,  but it will become smaller with the growth of other organizations."  </P></p>

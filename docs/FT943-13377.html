			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Nuclear privatisation call renewed Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned utility, has revived its plea to be privatised. In a submission to the government's nuclear review yesterday the company said its long-term future could only be secured if it was put on the same commercial footing as other electricity generators. Mr Robin Jeffrey, chief executive, said the government would not provide money to build further nuclear power stations - funds would have to come from the private sector. Although Scottish Nuclear came out in favour of privatisation before its English counterpart, Nuclear Electric, it had appeared to back off because of the practical problems of adapting nuclear power for the private sector. But Mr Jeffrey said yesterday that he felt these problems had now been clearly identified - and could be resolved. His company hoped to be privatised by the end of 1996. Scottish Nuclear is proposing that it be split into two parts. One would contain its closed Hunterston A Magnox station and the associated liabilities, as well as past liabilities for reprocessing fuel from its two active advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs). The financial provisions already made for decommissioning Hunterston A would be put into a segregated fund, which would take over full responsibility for the station. The other part - which would become the company to be privatised - would consist of the two AGR stations and the provisions made for their decommissioning costs. Mr Jeffrey said this company would be able to operate commercially, particularly if the government approved its plan to put spent fuel into a dry store instead of sending it for expensive reprocessing. Mr Jeffrey said he believed the wholesale price of electricity would rise from 2.5p to 3p per unit by the end of the decade as supplies of fossil fuels became tighter. The environmental costs of fossil fuels would also add between 0.4p and 0.8p to each unit. Against this, Scottish Nuclear estimated that it would be able to get its existing costs down to 2.5p a unit this year, with any newly built plant producing at 2.9p. Unlike Nuclear Electric, which wants to build a new nuclear station at Sizewell as soon as possible, Scottish Nuclear has no need for extra capacity until 2011. But Mr Jeffrey suggested that a privatised company might not build a nuclear station: it could build whatever was appropriate.</p>

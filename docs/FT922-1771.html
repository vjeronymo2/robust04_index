			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / International Company News: Euro Disney plans third French leisure complex EURO DISNEY, which has been bombarded by bad publicity since this spring's opening of its Euro Disneyland theme park near Paris, has received the French government's go-ahead to build a second park and has announced plans for a third complex. The group, which has been trying to play down press speculation about poor attendance at Euro Disneyland, plans to open the second park at a cost of FFr18bn (Dollars 3.38bn) in 1996. This park, which will be close to the existing complex at Marne La Vallee to the west of Paris, will adopt a similar theme to the Disney MGM Studios complex at Disneyworld in Florida by including attractions based on the imagery of US movies and the Hollywood film studios. The complex will also house Euro Disney's corporate offices. At one stage Euro Disney had planned to bring forward the schedule for the second park so that it would open in 1995. However, earlier this month it announced it was reverting to the original proposed opening date of 1996. Euro Disney yesterday confirmed that it plans to open a third park, also at Marne La Vallee, provisionally scheduled for opening in the year 2000. This park will adopt the futuristic concept of Epcot, the Disney monument to science and technology, in Florida. Confirmation of plans for the second and third Marne La Vallee parks comes at a time when Euro Disney is anxious to allay concern about the initial response to Euro Disneyland. Earlier this month the group said 1.5m people had visited the complex, by far the most expensive theme park in Europe, since its opening on April 12. However, Euro Disney, which has consistently refused to disclose its own internal targets for the park, also admitted that the pattern of attendance had been erratic with troughs during off-peak periods and that the number of visitors from France was lower than originally expected.</p>

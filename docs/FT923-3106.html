			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Letter: Insurers work with patients to contain charges Sir, Mr Lawrence's letter (September 10) criticised medical insurers for discouraging the patients of hospitals and specialists from approving or querying their charges. He asserted that it was 'in the interests of efficiency' that insurers settle a patient's bills by paying the health care provider rather than the insured person. That is not so. Direct settlement, which was initiated years ago by PPP, was introduced as a service to the subscriber, to minimise the worry to the a patient caused by having to pay large sums himself, be out-of-pocket for a while, and reclaim the money from his insurer. The direct settlement system costs the insurer, in cash flow terms, more money, but that was judged to be worthwhile to give this valuable service to the patient. Despite Mr Lawrence's implication that direct settlement is done without the patient's approval, in most cases it has in fact been done only with his express prior consent. Far from not wanting patients to check their accounts from health care providers, PPP actually states in current literature: 'Please check thoroughly any medical bills to ensure that they accurately reflect the services provided.' We therefore already act in agreement with Mr Lawrence's basic point that insurers need to work with patients in seeking to constrain increasing charges.

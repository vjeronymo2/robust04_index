			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Tuesday [15 February] his officially designated  political bodies handled properly a 10 million yen donation  which he said he accepted in August last year from an  organization formed by Japanese salt wholesalers.    Fujii told reporters that he served as an adviser to the  organization, Enyu-kai, when he was elected as a member of the  House of Councillors in 1977. He left the post in August 1993  when he became finance minister.    Fujii said his two designated political groups accepted the  donation on August 11 as a bonus for his longtime service to the  organization but dealt with the money properly.    Fujii said he has always tried not to confuse his  ministerial  position with accepting such donations, and "to avoid  misunderstanding," he has paid back the money.    The YOMIURI SHIMBUN, the nation's leading national daily,  said it questioned Fujii's office February 4 about the donation  and later learned that the office returned the donation to the  Enyu-kai on February 5.    The Enyu-kai has since returned all the money to the  companies which donated it, the daily said.    Fujii, a longtime adviser to the Association of Salt Dealers  Cooperatives and a former member of the Liberal Democratic  Party, is a member of Shinseito, one of the ruling coalition  parties.    The Enyu-kai office is located in the Tokyo headquarters of  the association.    Salt is sold in Japan under a monopoly operation by the salt  division of Japan Tobacco Inc.    A report from the Tobacco Industries Council has recommended  that the salt monopoly be abolished but such a move would hurt  many small wholesalers who are members of the Enyu-kai, the  YOMIURI said.</p>

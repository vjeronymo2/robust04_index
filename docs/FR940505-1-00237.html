			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Test requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA is proposing to conduct certification and enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing of nonroad heavy-duty engines regulated under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program using the federal nonroad procedures for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrocarbon emission measurement expected to be finalized by May  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30, 1994, except that test fuels would be based on applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California specifications. The eight mode steady state duty-cycle and other test procedures that will be finalized in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national rule for CI engines are proposed here to apply to both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compression-ignition and spark-ignition engines, regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel type. Exhaust hydrocarbon measurements would be quantified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC), or other fuel specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalents. Assembly-line testing would be performed under EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Selective Enforcement Audit testing program as described in 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR part 89 subpart F.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the test procedure being proposed today is a steady-state procedure, it may not result in control designs for nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines that produce the degree of in-use emissions reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected. For example, spark-ignition engines can exhibit very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different emissions characteristics on different test cycles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as cycles with transient operating conditions. The Agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also concerned that the 8-mode test may be inadequate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verifying the compliance of CI engines with the NMHC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards proposed here, as discussed in the May 17, 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationwide nonroad proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of these concerns, the Agency will monitor engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced and certified very carefully to be assured that engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do, in fact, yield proportional in-use emissions reductions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency will also remain alert to the possible use of defeat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices or design approaches that result in non-proportional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions reductions under operating conditions that are outside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the test procedure operating conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Agency is engaged in a program to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterize the in-use operation of nonroad engines. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program will allow EPA to develop representative duty cycles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate the emissions impact of those cycles and determine which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle will best ensure engine designs that will yield the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected level of in-use control. The Agency may change the duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle used to test nonroad engines in a subsequent rulemaking if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency determines that such a change is needed to assure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected emission reductions actually occur in use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers of engines subject to the inherently low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative emissions requirement would submit test results or an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engineering evaluation to demonstrate that the certified vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have inherently low evaporative emissions. Test procedures are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in EPA Clean Fuel Fleet program regulations (58 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11888, March 1, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standards and procedures proposed for enhanced nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavy-duty engines would apply equally to certification and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle recall testing. EPA requests comment on these test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, especially on the use of the steady-state test for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spark ignition engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Inspection &amp; Maintenance (I/M) Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned earlier, EPA is not proposing I/M requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for nonroad engines. Developing a new I/M program for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diverse set of applications involved would be a very difficult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and complex undertaking and would present significant testing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative burdens. However, an in-use testing program (such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as I/M) would allow EPA to reconsider the need to require nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines to be low evaporative and the need for the nonroad engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rebuild requirements. EPA therefore requests comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility and desirability of adopting an I/M program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavy-duty nonroad engines covered under the enhanced in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance program. The I/M program could apply to any or all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad engines over 50 hp sold for use in California's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated FIP areas. The reader is referred to the light-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle I/M discussion (section A.(4) of this appendix) for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detailed discussion of such enhanced vehicle requirements as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic scope, testing, enhanced I/M threshold, manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability, tracking of enhanced I/M test results, threshold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation, data collection, and manufacturer notification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters recommending a nonroad I/M program should comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the proper I/M test for heavy-duty nonroad engines and whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the capabilities for such tests would be needed at every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. They should also comment on what the specifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for such a facility would be and whether any such facility could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handle all types of nonroad equipment. An I/M program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad engines would apply for the full operating life of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Sudan relief airlift halted Rebels gunner have forced the United Nations to halt a relief airlift to the besieged south Sudan city of Juba, where some 300,000 people are short of food, Reuter reports from Kampala. It was the third time in two weeks the flight have been halted by rebel fire. A World Food Programme official, Mr Ben Martinson, said they would not resume until both sides in the eight-year civil war guaranteed their safety. He said three rounds fired by the Sudan People's Liberation Army exploded very close to a chartered Russian Ilyushin cargo plane as it unloaded on Sunday. He said the plane returned to Entebbe, Uganda, with some of the food still on board. Mr Martinson said the UN had flown in 1,080 tonnes of maize and had planned to send a further 1,000 tonnes during the next two weeks. He said food supplies in the refugee-packed city were still inadequate.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Money Markets: German futures fall FUTURES dealers continued to be rather pessimistic about the outlook for German rate cuts yesterday, in spite of last week's unexpected easing in the Bundesbank's discount rate, writes James Blitz. Dealers in German interest rate markets are currently moved by conflicting waves and eddies. On the one hand, good regional figures for consumer price inflation yesterday indicated that German inflation will be a touch lower this month after March's year-on-year figure of 4.2 per cent. However, a good inflation figure appeared to have been priced into the market at the start of yesterday's trading, and the impact of the news was limited. Dealers also said there were reasons for pessimism as trade union leaders across Germany called for steel and engineering workers to vote for all-out strike action in demand for higher wages. Both the threat of strike action and fears over Germany's budget deficit raised concern that the Bundesbank might be forced to slow the pace at which it is reducing rates. The June Euromark contract fell back 5 basis points yest-erday to close at 92.62, one of the lowest levels at which it has been actively traded this year. Although the Bundesbank has taken 100 basis points off three-month money this year, the June contract has not kept pace with the cuts and has come down only 40 basis points since the beginning of January. In the German cash market, call money fell to about 7.60 per cent because of the high level of liquidity. A cut in the Bundesbank's repo rate, currently at around 8.11 per cent, appears certain this week to match the decline in short-term rates. In the sterling cash market, there was a rise in deposit rates after the Bank of England announced a large shortage of Pounds 1.55bn which proved difficult to remove. The overnight rate rose as high as 7.5 per cent before late assistance of Pounds 430m was provided. Three-month money was as high as 6 3/16 per cent before ending at 6 1/16 per cent. Another factor tightening rates was a rise in the cost of temporary liquidity facilities provided by the Bank of England on a weekly basis. The mid-market rate for these facilities was put at 6 1/4 per cent for eight days from a previous 5 29/32 per cent.</p>

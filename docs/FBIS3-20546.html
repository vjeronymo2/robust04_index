Enterprise mergers and acquisitions are a means of foreign trade  reform and a key instrument of accelerating the development of a  socialist market economy by combining the transfer of ownership  rights with the optimization of resource allocation. Last June,  for instance, China Metals Import and Export Corporation merged  with the Siping City Tungsten Molybdenum Materials Company and  in November China Chemical Industrial Import and Export  Corporation merged with the Siping City United Chemical  Industrial Works and Siping City Pharmaceutical Company. Earlier  in January last year, Ningxia Metals Import and Export  Corporation acquired Yinchuan Calcium Carbide Factory.  Reportedly a number of foreign trade enterprises are actively  considering and making plans to merge with or acquire industrial  enterprises.  <H6>  I </H6>   Enterprise mergers and acquisitions are governed by the  "Regulations on Changing the Operating Mechanism of Industrial  Enterprises Owned by the Whole People." Under Article 16, for  example, "Enterprises may acquire other enterprises in  accordance with the principle of voluntary participation and  compensation. The transaction shall be reported to the  government department in charge for record purposes." Article 34  says, "The government may decide that one enterprise shall merge  with another or approve such a merger. In either case, provided  the enterprises in question are owned by the whole people, the  properties may be transferred without compensation. A merger  plan shall be put forward by the government department in charge  or by the enterprises. A merger agreement shall be drawn up  under the auspices of the government department in charge and  after full deliberations by all parties involved. The creditor's  rights and liabilities of the original enterprises shall be  assumed by the enterprise created by the merger." "An enterprise  may acquire other enterprises on its own initiative. Acquisition  is a form of merger with compensation. Enterprise acquisitions  must be approved by the government department in charge. The  creditor's rights and liabilities of the acquired enterprise  shall be assumed by the enterprise that has acquired it." When a  foreign trade enterprise seeks to merge with or acquire an  industrial enterprise, it should proceed in accordance with the  above-mentioned regulations.    1. About Enterprise Mergers    A foreign trade enterprise may merge with an industrial  enterprise with permission. As far as enterprises owned by the  whole people are concerned, a merger may take the form of a  transfer of properties without compensation. A merger plan  should be put forward by the enterprise. A merger agreement  should be drawn up by the two parties after full consultations.  The creditor's rights and liabilities of the merged enterprise  will be assumed by the post-merger foreign trade enterprise in  accordance with the terms in the merger agreement. The merger  between China Metals Corporation and Siping City Tungsten  Molybdenum Materials Company and that between China Industrial  Chemical Corporation and Siping City United Industrial Chemical  Works and Siping City Pharmaceutical Company were processed in  this manner.    2. About Enterprise Acquisitions    Enterprise acquisition is a form of merger with  compensation.  A foreign trade enterprise which decides on its own to acquire  an industrial enterprise should come up with an acquisition  plan. An acquisition agreement should be drawn up by the  acquiring enterprise and the enterprise being acquired after  full discussions. The creditor's rights and liabilities of the  acquired enterprise should be assumed by the foreign trade  enterprise in accordance with the terms of the acquisition  agreement. Ningxia Metals Import and Export Corporation acquired  Yinchuan Calcium Carbide Company in this manner.    3. About the Legal-Person Status of the Enterprise Being  Merged or Acquired    Regardless of whether the case involves the transfer without  compensation of the properties of an enterprise owned by the  whole people or the transfer with compensation of the properties  of a collectively owned enterprise, the original ownership  system shall remain unchanged despite the change in its  affiliation. Also unchanged will be its original independent  legal person status under which it enjoys decision-making  authority in its operations and assumes responsibility for its  own profits and losses. That way we can first avoid putting old  wine in new bottles, which would give rise to a new form of  "eating off the big rice pot." Secondly, we want to fully  mobilize the enthusiasm of both industry and trade. Thirdly, we  can keep the more flexible operating mechanism.  <H6>  II </H6>   True to the spirit of the relevant national regulations, a  foreign trade enterprise should abide by the following basic  principles when it proposes to merge with or acquire an  industrial enterprise:    1. Comply with the principles of mutual voluntary  participation, supplementing one another's strengths, and common  development. Departments in charge should not practice  match-making when the parties involved are reluctant. Practice  proves that forced mergers and acquisitions that ignore  objective conditions and are based solely on subjective wishful  thinking are often counter-productive. A foreign trade  enterprise has its own characteristics. For example, it has good  access to international market information, varied and multiple  commodity marketing channels, and a specialized corps skilled in  handling foreign economic relations and trade. Industrial  enterprises too have features unique to themselves. Most, for  instance, have fixed physical structures, including plants or  land, a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, and a  corps of workers boasting a fairly high technical standard and  practical experience. The two--a foreign trade enterprise and an  industrial enterprise--are able to come together, breaking down  administrative regional barriers and bridging the gap between  different industries, mainly because this form of combination  serves the common economic interests of both trade and industry  and is consistent with the direction of their long-term  development.    2. The foremost responsibility of a foreign trade  enterprise,  which lies at the heart of its work, is to work hard to expand  exports and earn foreign exchange. In seeking to merge with or  acquire an industrial enterprise, a foreign trade enterprise  should abide by the principle that the new enterprise must be  able to increase exports and earn more foreign exchange or do so  after transformation. The foreign trade enterprise must strike a  proper balance between concentrating on its core industry and  diversifying its range of operations, between exporting and  earning foreign exchange, on the one hand, and making a profit,  on the other. It must strive to diversify into a variety of  areas by revolving around its main industry.    3. Take stock of and appraise the assets of merged or  acquired industrial enterprises carefully. Enterprise mergers  and acquisitions in essence mean two parties trading property  rights. Only a comprehensive, fair, and accurate inventory and  appraisal of assets ensures the protection of the legitimate  rights and interests of both parties and prevents the loss of  state or collective properties. In line with the principle of  comprehensiveness, fairness, and accuracy, the state has ruled  that neither departments in charge of state property  administration nor the departments overseeing the industries  concerned should directly engage in the business of inventorying  and appraising state properties. Instead, it should be conducted  by a third party: a property appraisal company, an accounting  firm, or an auditing firm certified by the state to appraise  properties.    4. After taking stock of and appraisal its assets, an  enterprise that is found to have more liabilities than assets in  principle should not be accepted as candidates for merger or  acquisition. In the real world, however, the situation is much  more complicated. We should study each case in earnest and  handle it with caution before making a decision. Some industrial  enterprises may have more liabilities than assets, but they have  development potential. In these cases one should consider their  combination on the basis of voluntary participation.    5. Industrial enterprises that have been merged or acquired  normally should not be given the authority to import and export.  Importing, exporting, and related business activities should be  handled centrally by the foreign trade enterprise. Where such  authority is indeed justified, an application should be made in  accordance with regulations. In the case of industrial  enterprises already authorized to import and export before the  merger or acquisition, such authority should remain intact.    6. The personnel management, appointment and dismissal of  cadres, wages, bonuses and benefits, and social insurance, among  other things, of the industrial enterprise merged or acquired  should be processed in accordance with the appropriate  regulations of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and  Trade or the local government concerned.    The merger and acquisition of industrial enterprises by  foreign trade enterprises is a product of the deepening of  foreign trade reform as well as the road foreign trade  enterprises must travel to achieve industrialization. China's  property rights market has yet to be standardized and the  necessary laws and regulations are less than comprehensive, but  provided we liberate our thinking, seek truth from facts,  research diligently, and experiment boldly, our property rights  market and the body of laws are bound to get better and better  over time, thus making fresh contributions to the deepening of  foreign trade reform.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Truck sales show signs of recovery SALES of new commercial vehicles declined in April by 1.7 per cent, but there are growing signs that demand is recovering in key segments such as trucks and panel vans. While total commercial vehicle sales have been lower than a year ago in three of the past four months, new truck registrations have been staging a modest recovery since mid-1992. New truck registrations have been higher than a year before in nine of the past 10 months. The market remains fragile, but sales in April increased by 11.8 per cent year-on-year while truck registrations in the first four months were 2 per cent higher than a year before. Leyland Daf, the former UK truck market leader, has suffered heavily from its financial collapse in February, with its van sales more than halved in the first four months of the year. Leyland Daf truck sales have also fallen by 19 per cent in an overall market segment that has risen by 2 per cent. The former UK truck market leader has been pushed into third place in the overall truck market behind the Iveco group of Italy, which includes Iveco Ford and Seddon Atkinson, and behind Mercedes-Benz of Germany. In the heavy truck market (above 15 tonnes gross vehicle weight) Volvo and Scania, the Swedish producers, have benefited most from the demise of Leyland Daf. Volvo has taken over for the first time as UK market leader in this segment, while Iveco has also overtaken Leyland Daf. The former Leyland Daf vans operation in Birmingham was rescued from receivership by a management buy-out late last month, while negotiations are also at an advanced stage for a management buy-out of the truck assembly operations in Leyland, Lancashire. Overall UK new commercial vehicle sales in April fell by 1.7 per cent to 16,927 from 17,220 in the same month a year before according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. In the first four months of the year registrations were 4.5 per cent lower than a year before at 67,171. The main weaknesses in sales last month were in the light van, bus and coach, and light four-wheel-drive utility vehicle segments. Registrations of medium and heavy duty vans, which had been hit hard by the demise of Leyland Daf in the early months of the year, began to recover in April with a year-on-year increase of 7.6 per cent. In the light van sector imports have jumped by 76 per cent as a result of General Motors' decision to supply most of its car-derived vans from Portugal. Overall imports captured 40.3 per cent of UK new commercial vehicle sales in the first four months compared with 35.7 per cent a year ago.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-APRIL 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Volume   Volume     Share (%)   Share (%)                                (Units) Change (%) Jan-Apr 93  Jan-Apr 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                  67,171    -4.5       100.0       100.0 Imports                        27,065    +7.9        40.3        35.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                          21,908    -1.0       100.0       100.0 Imports                         7,737   +76.0        35.3        19.8 Ford                           10,362   +15.4        47.3        40.6 Vauxhall (General Motors)       7,128    -3.8        32.5        33.5 Peugeot incl.

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Nippon Housing Loan restructuring stalls THE restructuring of Nippon Housing Loan, Japan's largest home-loan company which faces mounting problem loans, has been stalled by squabbles among its main creditors. Japanese commercial banks have yet to accept restructuring proposals presented by Nippon Housing Loan in June. The country's non-bank fin-ancial institutions, burdened by increasing non-performing loans on property, are turning to the leading banks for help. However, the banks not only face similar problems but are reluctant to assist because they would incur substantial losses on measures such as cutting interest rates on loans. The home-loan companies' problems have shocked creditors. Set up by reputable financial institutions under the direct guidance of the finance ministry, they were seen as non-risk companies. In June, Nippon Housing Loan asked nine commercial banks to cut the rate on loans to 3.25 per cent, equal to the of-ficial discount rate - to maintain outstanding loans at current levels - and to send personnel to aid the restructuring. The company, listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has about an estimated Y1,200bn (Dollars 9.45bn) in non-performing loans. Pre-tax profits for the year to March fell by 87 per cent, while unrealised losses on securities holdings at the year end were Y23.4bn. It is also under investigation for alleged tax evasion on income from stock trading. Japan's eight housing-loan companies increased their exposure to high-risk property-related loans in the years of loose credit in the late-1980s. Nippon Housing Loan was set up in 1971 by nine commercial banks. Sanwa Bank and Sakura Bank, the leading commercial banks, both hold a 4.9 per cent stake. The banks are at odds over which one has the principle responsibility for Nippon Housing Loan. Commercial banks have extended about 23 per cent of its debt totalling some Y2,600bn at the end of March. Sakura had about Y226bn in loans outstanding and Sanwa Y199bn. While some commercial banks may accept Nippon Housing Loans requests, several are opposing unilateral decisions. The commercial banks claim the co-operation of other creditors is essential in the restructuring. Sakura Bank said: 'The problems are so large, it is impossible for just the city banks to carry out the restructuring.' Norinchukin Bank and other agricultural co-operative related financial institutions have Y910bn in loans outstanding, the three long-term credit banks - Industrial Bank of Japan, Long Term Credit Bank, and Nippon Credit Bank - a total of Y280bn, and six trust banks, about Y210bn. Financial institutions aff-iliated with agricultural co-operatives have been large lenders to home-loan companies. Although their loans account for 40 per cent of Nippon Housing Loan's total debt, they are refusing to co-operate with the restructuring plan, claiming that responsibility belongs to banks with direct shareholdings. Nippon Housing Loan reckons it will take more than three years to rebuild itself, providing it receives aid from its creditors. 'Once the real estate market recovers, things will start looking better,' it said.</p>

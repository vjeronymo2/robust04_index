			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / How to barter a massage for didgeridoo expertise Feel the need for a shiatsu massage? That will cost you 15 beaks. Want your flat redecorated? Prepare to shell out 80 beaks, plus materials. How about a didgeridoo lesson? A bargain at 10 beaks. If you are wondering about the exchange rates for the exotic country where 'beaks' are legal tender, look no further than Kingston upon Thames in south London. About 120 residents participate in a Local Exchange and Trading System - or Lets - a community bartering scheme in which members trade services and goods such as gardening, babysitting and even midwifery using credit units. These beaks were named after the local Beacon environmental centre. This week Hounslow council in west London appointed the first full-time development officer with a Pounds 30,000 budget to help start a Lets. Hounslow's scheme will join 200 others around the UK where between 15 and 400 residents have banded together to form alternative economies, particularly in financially disadvantaged areas. The first Lets was set up in Norwich in 1985. In 1990 Letslink, the national co-ordinator of local bartering schemes, was set up by Lets members in Wiltshire and Stroud, Gloucestershire. To start up a Lets a group of people produce a directory of services offered. Each item is priced according to the local unit. In some schemes the unit is linked to an hourly standard. The beak, for example, is worth 10 minutes of labour. Members of the schemes are given cheque books and a central record keeper debits or credits their accounts after each transaction. Ms Liz Shepard, director of Letslink, said: 'There is no interest payable and no payment schedule so you can start at zero and go into debit immediately. All that is required is that everyone in the system has to provide services or goods.' An increasing number of professional services are offered and several businesses accept the barter units for at least some goods. As well as providing economic benefits for those who would otherwise be unable to afford organic vege-tables, massages or childminding, the schemes are said to create community benefits. Ms Beth Wells, co-ordinator of the West Wiltshire Lets, in which she will mow lawns and provide astrological services, said: 'The community spirit is quite incredible. It builds up a sense of trust and sharing.' Defaulting on debt is not generally a problem and debt creation is encouraged. Ms Anne-Marie Mayer, a co-ordinator of the Kingston scheme, said: 'It is actually people with large credits and no debits who let the system down. If people do a lot of work for other people but cannot think of anything they want, it creates a lot of people with large negative balances who then become disinclined to trade.' Most Lets are conducted on a small enough scale to avoid taxes, although businesses and those generating enough income to exceed personal limits are expected to pay taxes. The Inland Revenue, while supporting the bartering schemes, does not want to get paid in beaks, however. It said: 'We want our taxes in sterling. Please do not offer to wash all the windows at Somerset House.'</p>

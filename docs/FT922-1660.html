			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Names set to win demand for EGM A GROUP of Names is to seek an extraordinary general meeting of Lloyd's of London to press for reforms at the insurance market, Richard Lapper writes. One hundred and ten of the market's more than 20,000 Names - the individuals who provide the market's capital - have signed a motion that will be submitted to Lloyd's on Monday, according to Mr Richard Astor, a lawyer who has organised the move. Under the society's rules, Lloyd's must convene the EGM within four to six weeks once it has been requested. The meeting will act as a focus for the anger of Names facing heavy losses, who have been disappointed by this week's decision to reject a bail-out plan to pay for past losses. A minority of Names will bear the brunt of losses of about Pounds 2bn for the 1989 year which Lloyd's will report at its annual meeting on Wednesday. The Names' motion alleges that the council - the Lloyd's governing body - has failed to manage the affairs of Lloyd's properly and to ensure protection of Names.

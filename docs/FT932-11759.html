			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Golf indicator shows Japan's economy is in a fair way: Robert Thomson charts the club membership index THERE is a hint of recovery in money supply growth, and stock prices have risen in recent weeks, but the most positive indication that Japan is finally out of the bunker of recession is a sudden upswing in the Nikkei Golf Membership Index. Golf club memberships had promised the perfect balance for Japanese investors, who were able to watch their membership certificates appreciate rapidly in the late 1980s, the 'bubble era', and be assured of a round of golf on the country's overcrowded courses. The bubble collapsed, and membership prices dropped 64 per cent in three years, a particularly nasty fall for about half the certificate holders who never bothered to play golf and saw the investment as a valuable means of diversifying their government bond and stock portfolios. However, in the past two weeks, the Nikkei golf index has risen just over 4 per cent, and the membership brokers who run the active secondary market in certificates are confident that punters will be rushing back to the course in the hope of making a quick profit. More important, the golf index, an aggregate of memberships at 500 leading clubs, is regarded as a leading indicator of the property market. Mr Paul Heaton, financials specialist at Smith New Court, said trading in the certificates was a 'very useful guide' to the real economy. 'The Japanese property market is extremely illiquid, whereas these certificates are very liquid instruments. The recovery of prices is a good reflection of the remarkable change in economic confidence over the past few weeks,' Mr Heaton said. But the reputation of golf certificates has been tainted by scandal. Owners of the Ibaraki Country Club, near Tokyo, sold 60,000 memberships instead of the promised 1,830, undermining the market, while several brokers have gone bust, and police have found that some greenkeepers are gangsters in disguise. In the hope of encouraging stock market prices, the Finance Ministry has restricted new listings, but about 350 golf courses are under construction and these 'new listings', equal to about 20 per cent of the current total, could overwhelm investor demand. One hope for the 190 brokers is that interest rates have fallen far enough to prompt investors to look for better returns on their money. Mr Hideo Hayashi, general manager of Shinwa Golf Services, a leading broker, said the market had definitely hit bottom, and investors had started buying. But he fears Japanese banks have lost their fondness for the certificates, which have added to their bad loan burdens. 'In the late 1980s, banks would provide around 90 per cent of the value of the certificates, but now they will only lend to 60 or 70 per cent,' he says . Japanese banks consistently argue that they provided funds to no more than 70 per cent of a certificate's value, but it is clear that institutions were lending at far higher levels in the late 1980s. Given that prices at some clubs have fallen by as much as 80 per cent, these banks are hoping that younger Japanese or, perhaps, their own staff quickly develop a passion for the game. A membership certificate, now selling for an average Y20m (Pounds 117,600), had a certain sacredness in Japan because it entitled the holder to claim a share of the club, in theory, a small patch of green on the fairway or, sometimes, an unwanted place in the financial rough. Clubs encouraged members to feel rich, an important attraction for Japanese who do not feel they are wealthy in spite of the country's impressive GNP figures. But clubs which promised the most prestige have brought some of the greatest disappointment. The Gentry Hills Golf Club collapsed, leaving members to fight court battles over ownership. Membership prices at the Classic Golf Club have fallen by 78 per cent, and the Gatsby Golf Club issued 15 times more memberships than promised.</p>

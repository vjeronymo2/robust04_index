			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed DGO (ADB): "Parliament-Agusta: Dehaene Says </F> `Premature Political Decision'"; as released by Brussels BELGA  Database]    [Text] Brussels, 18 Jan (BELGA) -- "By virtue of the  principle of the division of powers, I must, as a member of the  executive authority, abstain from any declaration concerning  this case. Personally, I have confidence in the conclusions of  the special committee and want it to be able to finish its work  completely undisturbed." This was the substance of the reply  the prime minister gave to Parliament on Wednesday [19 January]  in response to a series of questions about the Agusta affair.    Apart from Armand de Decker (PRL) [Liberal Reformation  Party]  and Olivier Maingain (FDF) [French-speaking Front], all the  contributors came from Flemish opposition parties. Herman  Lauwers (VU) [People's Union], Mieke Vogels (Agalev) [Flemish  Greens], Willy Courtois (VLD) [Flemish Liberals and Democrats]  and Francis Van Den Eynde [Flemish Bloc] all called for the  resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Guy Come "in the name of  political ethics."    Such a decision, they insisted, would in no way prejudge the  guilt of the person concerned, but would on the contrary allow  him to defend himself more calmly and make a small contribution  to restoring citizens'confidence in the political world.    "Mr. Come himself deplores and contests the accusations made  against him," Jean-Luc Dehaene replied.    "He feels fully capable of carrying out his ministerial  duties. Taking account of the current position of the legal  procedures and the fundamental principles of our legal system,  it is therefore premature to take a political decision," the  prime minister stated.    During the replies, Herman Lauwers, parliamentary leader of  the VU, told the head of government: "You have just given one  of the most dangerous replies that you could have given for the  future of this country and democracy."</p>

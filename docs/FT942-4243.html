			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Property revaluation leaves 600 Group Pounds 2.5m in the red A loss on a property revaluation pushed the 600 Group, which manufactures and distributes machine tools and materials handling equipment, into a wider deficit last year despite a reduced loss at the operating level. The group, which has undergone a substantial reorganisation, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.5m for the year to March 31 compared with losses of Pounds 2.39m. The result was after a Pounds 1.02m loss on the revaluation of properties. Turnover fell by 2.5 per cent to Pounds 96.7m (Pounds 99.2m), but the decline masked modest signs of improvement in the second half when group sales increased by 15 per cent reflecting improved demand, particularly in North Amer-ica. Professor Michael Wright, chairman, said, 'after five years, during which our performance has been dogged by recession in our major markets, we are beginning to detect clear signs of recovery in demand.' Similarly at the operating level results improved from a first half loss of Pounds 1m to a profit of Pounds 800,000 in the second half producing a reduced full year operating loss, before the property revaluation, of Pounds 157,000 (Pounds 1.26m). Prof Wright said the reduced operating loss reflected a combination of a moderate improvement in demand and the successful launch of new products from the group's machine tool, laser and electro-optic businesses. Net interest costs edged down to Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 1.3m) although net borrowings at the year-end were higher at Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 9m) representing gearing of 22 per cent (16 per cent). Two percentage points of the gearing increase was associated with a Pounds 5.5m reduction in shareholders' funds because of the property revaluation. Losses per share were 6.5p (5.9p). However, the board said it was encouraged by the second half improvement and the final dividend is maintained at 1p, making a reduced total of 1.5p, against 2p.</p>

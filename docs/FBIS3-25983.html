			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Fan Liqing (5400 7787 7230) and Fang Jin (2455 </F> 3866)]    [Text] Beijing, 1 Feb (XINHUA) -- Discussions between  responsible individuals from the Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and Taiwan's Straits Exchange  Foundation [SEF] on implementing the agreements of the "Wang-Gu  talks" were held in Beijing today. ARATS Executive Vice  Chairman Tang Shubei and ARATS Vice Chairman and Secretary  General Zou Zhekai held the first round of talks with SEF Vice  Chairman and Secretary General Jiao Renhe [Chiao Jen-ho] at the  Diaoyutai Guesthouse this afternoon.    Prior to the talks, Tang Shubei noted: Since we successfully  held the "Wang-Gu talks" and signed agreements, the two  organizations have made some progress in implementing the  agreements. During Mr. Jiao Renhe's visit to Beijing, both  sides will exchange views on implementing the agreements. This  is an excellent opportunity. Jiao Renhe also indicated:  According to the "Agreement on Establishing a System of Making  Contacts and Holding Talks Between the Two Organizations" signed  during the "Wang-Gu talks," the vice chairmen or secretaries  general of the two organizations will, in principle, meet and  hold talks once every six months. The time for doing so has  passed. Coordination between the two organizations for  implementing the agreements has been largely good over the past  nine months. During the current talks, we will exchange views  on better implementing the agreements.    After the talks, Tang Shubei and Jiao Renhe gave separate  briefings on the talks and answered reporters' questions. Tang  Shubei said that during today's discussions, he first forwarded  ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan's letter to SEF Chairman Gu Zhenfu  [Ku Chen-fu], in which the former invited the latter to visit  the mainland this year. Afterward, the two sides exchanged  views on progress in implementing the agreements of the "Wang-Gu  talks" over the past six months or so. They also discussed  current conceptual issues affecting progress in discussions on  affairs of a routine nature between the two organizations.    Tang Shubei said: During the discussions, both sides  reiterated that in principle, airplane hijackers should be  repatriated without exception. The framework of the agreement  on repatriating airplane hijackers, reached by the two sides  during their discussions in Taipei, is good. Both sides also  agreed that in handling matters relating to agreements, the two  nongovernmental organizations should follow the principle of  "stressing the nongovernmental and routine nature," eschew  politically sensitive issues, and refrain from imposing their  political demands on each other. This is because the two  organizations are cooperating amid political differences between  the two sides. It takes time to solve these political  differences. Therefore, we should shun politically sensitive  issues.    Tang Shubei said: "Mr. Jiao and I share the feeling that we  should place on our agenda the economic topics specified in the  joint agreements of the 'Wang-Gu talks.' We should hold early  discussions on better protection of Taiwan businessmen's  investments on the mainland, cross-strait joint development of  energy and resources, and scientific and technological  exchanges. With the consent of their leaders, the two  organizations should also jointly hold a meeting on  people-to-people economic exchanges at the earliest possible  date." Regarding economic topics, Jiao Renhe proposed signing  an agreement on protecting Taiwan businessmen's investments.  Tang Shubei indicated: By taking account of Taiwan  businessmen's views and bearing in mind its own actual  conditions, the mainland has drafted the "Law on Protecting the  Investments of Taiwan Compatriots" and forwarded it to the  National People's Congress Standing Committee for examination  and approval. In accordance with the principle of reciprocity  and mutual benefit in cross-strait exchanges, we hope that  Taiwan will lift restrictions banning Taiwan businessmen from  investing on the mainland, initiate cross-strait cooperation in  labor services, and ease restrictions on access to Taiwan for  mainland goods. In the spirit of adopting active measures on  both sides and protecting Taiwan businessmen's rights and  interests, we do not exclude the possibility of the two sides  signing nongovernmental agreements in the future.    During the talks, Jiao Renhe noted: The two organizations  have been in rather close contact over the past year, assisting  each other in solving quite a few difficulties encountered by  people on both sides of the Taiwan strait. Regarding the use  and verification of notarial certificates, the two sides have  exchanged approximately 20,000 notarial certificates. They have  exchanged more than 350,000 letters since registered mail  services were initiated. The scale, range, and level of  cross-strait cultural and educational exchanges are being  expanded and upgraded with each passing day; this is a  heartening sign. The SEF hopes to gradually establish order in  cross-strait people-to-people exchanges on the basis of mutual  respect and cooperation.    The talks this afternoon lasted for two hours.    In the morning, Jiao Renhe and his entourage toured the  Biyun  Temple at Xiangshan and paid homage at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's  cenotaph.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The Japanese economy may  pull out of its prolonged three-year recession if persistent  concerns over the yen's rise and other fresh downward pressures  on the economy prove unfounded, Bank of Japan [BOJ] Governor  Yasushi Mieno said Wednesday [6 April].    "The economy is brighter and close to hitting bottom," the  BOJ chief told a news conference after wrapping up a three-day  quarterly meeting of the central bank's managers of 33 domestic  branches and its three overseas representatives. His comments,  reflecting increased optimism by the regional branch managers  and overseas representatives, indicated a slight change from  recent remarks that more time is needed to see if emerging  bright spots in consumption and production will be sustainable  enough to lift the economy.    Mieno was still cautious about a recovery, though, citing  potential downward factors such as the yen's appreciation amid  the stalled Japan-U.S. trade talks.    The BOJ chief said his view on the economic situation has  "delicately" changed, but reiterated that he will continue to  "carefully watch" recent improvements led by recovering personal  consumption and slightly increasing exports.    Summing up the quarterly meeting of branch managers, Mieno  said the managers confirmed evidence of improved corporate  sentiment. Most of the branch managers attending the meeting  reported that the economy is showing signs of bottoming out.    Mieno said their assessment of the economy "turned brighter  than at the time of the previous meeting," noting that  anticipation of recovery is spreading among corporate managers.    Company leaders, who until recently had been discussing the  timing of the recovery, are now talking about its tempo rather  than its timing, he added.    "The chances are slim for the economy to fall back again,"  Mieno said, brushing aside the possibility of a repeat of the  setback which occurred a year ago. He noted four "stronger  positive factors" which have come to the surface over the past  year.    "Inventory adjustments and corporate restructuring programs  have progressed steadily, and recent macroeconomic measures are  buoying the economy," he said.    "Exports are recovering due to brighter overseas economies  led by the United States, and improvements in domestic economic  activities are spreading," he added.    But Mieno said he wants to carefully monitor to what extent  the book closing by companies for the fiscal year ended March 31  "inflated" economic indicators.    The BOJ chief also said three persistent factors should be  carefully watched -- the yen's appreciation, ongoing labor  cutbacks and continuing balance-sheet adjustments by financial  institutions, noting these may drag the economy down again.    With Japan's current account surplus remaining at a high  level, trade friction with other nations prevails, and a trend  toward a higher yen is dominating foreign exchange trading,  Mieno said. The recent yen-dollar exchange rate of around 104  yen to the U.S. dollar is "severe for exporters," but the latest  round of the yen's appreciation is milder than last year's,  Mieno said.    He noted that the dollar fell from 125 yen to near 100 yen  last year, while its fall in the current round is only from 110  yen late last year to Wednesday's 104 yen level.    Asked about the central bank's stance on the yen's  appreciation in connection with the stalled trade talks with the  United States, Mieno repeated that he desires to see stable  exchange rates reflecting economic fundamentals.    An agreement reached among finance ministers and central  bankers of Group of Seven major industrial nations on their  cooperation to stem wild rate fluctuations is alive, Mieno  added, suggesting his intention to call for reconfirmation of  the accord at a G-7 meeting slated in Washington later this  month.    Considering the recent upward trend in long-term interest  rates led by the United States, Mieno said they are unlikely to  continue rising. He said it is natural for market rates to move  up and down in the near term, but long-term rates will settle  down during the process of adjusting to the state of the economy.    Mieno praised the positive stance taken by financial  insitutions to liquidate bad loans.</p>

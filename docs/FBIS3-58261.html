			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vincenzo Parisi, commander in chief of </F> Italian Police Force, by Giovanni Ruggiero in Rome; date not  given: "`An Attack Launched by Subtle Minds' -- Parisi  Denounces Maneuvers and Denies Charges: I Never Took Money From  Secret Services"]    [Text] "There are subtle minds at work that want to  halt the great transformations that are taking place": Such is  the chief of police's reply to the charges that have led to his  name being entered in the list of those under investigation.  "It is an attempt to interfere in the life of the country," he  explains to AVVENIRE, "and foment distrust in all sectors of  society."    He has run the gauntlet of criticisms and accusations  in the past, remaining steadfast and impassive throughout.  However, this seems to be Police Chief Vincenzo Parisi's  darkest hour. No other issue had ever induced him to hand the  minister his resignation. The list of those under investigation  refers to allegations against him of embezzlement and abetting  crime. Parisi answered our questions cordially. He is  indignant, but he regards himself as extraneous to the  intrigue.    [Ruggiero] Commander Parisi, you knew nothing about all  this?    [Parisi] Nothing at all. I found out toward midnight on 7  January. I had received no notification before then, nothing  whatsoever.    [Ruggiero] You denounce maneuvers against you designed, more  generally, to destabilize the country. Do you lump everything  that is happening together?    [Parisi] I do not include the person who compiled the entry  in the list of investigations, which is a mandatory procedure,  as the Rome public prosecutor has explained: It is a necessary  procedure because entry in the list cannot be avoided, whatever  sort of allegations are made, even when they are obviously  unfounded. Of course, whoever broke the rule of silence,  leaking the news late in the day, has not exactly behaved  impeccably.    [Ruggiero] What we meant by maneuver, however, is everything  that preceded your entry in the list.    [Parisi] Of course, but, rather than a maneuver this could  be  merely the sign of a fairly common strategy of defense:  launching an attack instead of rallying to the defense, attack  as the best form of defense.    [Ruggiero] On whose part?    [Parisi] The people under investigation, those who attack  others violently to bring those others into the limelight rather  than themselves. It is an old trick, and we shall have to see  what practical advantage it gives them. Those who do it are  fishing in troubled waters.    [Ruggiero] The allegations are embezzlement and abetting  crime.    [Parisi] There has been no embezzlement of 3 million lire  because I never took that money. As far as the abetting  allegation is concerned, it is utter rubbish. However, I am at  the examining magistrates' complete disposal to clear up this  second issue; the first has already been dealt with.    [Ruggiero] The atmosphere is becoming uglier and uglier. Is  there a coup in the air?    [Parisi] It is not a matter of coups but of an attempt to  interfere in the life of the republic by creating a murky  climate, rendering it more and more malevolent, and, above all,  sowing the seeds of discontent and increasingly widespread  distrust in all sectors of society.    [Ruggiero] Who might have a vested interest in all this?    [Parisi] A lot of people. All those who want to halt the  course of history.    [Ruggiero] Political forces?    [Parisi] I do not want to identify them. I cannot define  them, even in terms of class allegiance, because I do not have  sufficient information. However, there are interest groups that  would like to halt the course of democracy. They are forces  with links to the criminal world as well, and who are therefore  going all out to hinder the process of renewal.    [Ruggiero] There is no connection between real bombs and  "bombshells" in the figurative sense?    [Parisi] It is difficult to say. Of course, all that has  happened in absolutely correct, orthodox terms to clean things  up has been submerged by a certain type of campaign, and above  all by the misinformation that has been brought in to inflate  everything. It is still happening. These developments are  highly insidious and hint at subtle minds moving within a  well-reasoned and calculated timeframe with the intention of  destabilizing the situation.    [Ruggiero] This would seem to be your darkest hour.    [Parisi] I think that it is the most difficult hour in the  history of Italy. My person is of only modest significance in  comparison with the general interest.    [Ruggiero] All the same, this time you submitted your  resignation.    [Parisi] It was my duty.    [Ruggiero] But you did not do so on a number of other  occasions when you came under violent attack, in the Contrada  affair, for example.    [Parisi] Allow me to say that in that case my role was  entirely institutional, not private, and that the whole matter  was passed on to the magistrates, so it was up to them to draw  their conclusions.    [Ruggiero] But have you never entertained suspicions  regarding the great festering sore in the secret services?    [Parisi] I have no monitoring powers. I left the secret  services seven years ago, and five different directors have  succeeded one another since then; what should I know about what  has been and is happening there? The head of the secret  services does not report to the chief of police: He is entirely  his own master.</p>

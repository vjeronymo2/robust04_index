			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 May (PL) -- Cuban Tourism Minister Osmany  Cienfuegos said today that the Sixth International Hall of  Technology and Products of Tourism Industry, Tecnotour '94,  represents a significant improvement over past fairs.    Ciefuegos dedicated the specialized fair and noted the  presence of more than 600 firms, -- 155 of them local, from 22  countries, including Spain, Canada, Mexico, Italy, and Germany,  which are also the countries whose citizens travel to the island  the most.    The minister said: We hope all tourist and marketing  enterprises will secure service and supply contracts in this  sector of the economy during Tecnotour '94.    The tourism industry is considered strategic in pulling the  island out of the economic crisis it has been facing for more  than four years.    Regarding the presence of foreign firms, Cienfuegos noted  that most of them have relations with Cuba and that the new ones  are trying to establish them.    Shortly after cutting the inaugural ribbon at the exposition  pavilion in this capital's Convention Palace , Cienfuegos and  other representatives of the Cuban Government walked through  part of the 4,680-square meter fair area and spoke with some of  the exhibitors.    He spoke with Eduardo Adam, representative in Cuba of Farma  Venda, an Italian enterprise that occupies approximately 100  square meters of the fair exhibiting cosmetics, clothes,  appliances, and food.    At the fair, foreign visitors have the opportunity to talk,  make contacts, and sign new agreements with Cuban entities.  Czechoslovakia and Costa Rica are the newcomers to this tourist  technology round, which will last until 29 May.    The Latin America countries with the largest number of  exhibitors in Tecnotour '94 are Mexico with nine firms; Chile  with four; Panama with three; Venezuela with two; and Costa  Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Peru with one each.</p>

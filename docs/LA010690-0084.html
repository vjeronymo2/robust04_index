			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELI DENIES THAT HE HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH OUSTED DICTATOR  </P> <P> Mike Harari, the former Israeli intelligence officer said to be the right-hand  man of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, appeared on television here Friday and denied  that he had any connection with the deposed Panamanian strongman.  </P> <P> It was believed to be Harari's first such public appearance since the U.S.  invasion of Panama on Dec. 20.  </P> <P> He told an interviewer that there has been a massive campaign of  "disinformation" against him, but he did not say by whom.  </P> <P> "They said I was Noriega's adviser; I want to say I was not Noriega's adviser,"  he said. "I was not No. 1 or No. 2. Noriega was not my partner, I did not  manage his trade, I did not direct or train his forces, I did not organize his  personal bodyguard. I am simply a private person who deals in commerce."  </P> <P> Last week, U.S. officials reported that American soldiers had captured Harari  in Panama. But Harari said Friday that he slipped out of Panama as the U.S.  invasion was getting under way. He denied that he had been helped by the  Israeli Embassy in Panama or by anyone connected with Israel.  </P> <P> "I am here and not in the company of a blonde woman," he said, alluding to a  report that a mysterious blonde had helped him flee.  </P> <P> Harari is not wanted by law enforcement agents in the United States, but the  new Panamanian government has indicated that it might want to try him in  connection with crimes allegedly committed by Noriega.  </P> <P> Harari, 62, has been photographed in the company of Noriega. A few years ago,  when Noriega visited Israel, Harari accompanied him on a tour of Israeli  military bases, and Harari has served as honorary consul for Panama in Tel  Aviv.  </P></p>

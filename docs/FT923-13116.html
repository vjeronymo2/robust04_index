			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Clinton plays to gallery THE Clinton-Gore ticket, cruising to overwhelming endorsement by the Democratic party this week, played to its strengths yesterday. Mr Clinton's only scheduled public appearance was in front of the Democratic women's political caucus, already potentially swelled by the addition of six women candidates for the Senate, 34 for the House, and, as the prospective nominee said, with the prospect of more to come. The Arkansas governor laid out his feminist credentials. 'I am the grandson of a working woman, the son of a single mother, the husband of a working wife who earns far more than I and the father of a daughter who wants to build space stations in the sky.' He added: 'I have learned that building up women does not diminish men.' Senator Al Gore took his commitment to the environment to a meeting of environmentalists. President Bush's performance at the Rio Earth Summit, which he had also attended, was 'a disgrace'. At the convention, delegates early today approved a statement of policy putting jobs and economic growth at the top of the party's agenda.</p>

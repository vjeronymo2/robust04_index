			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / US welcomes German interest rate cut Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, yesterday welcomed Germany's decision to cut interest rates and called for further rate cuts in Europe to help improve the continent's 'dismal' growth prospects. On the eve of today's meeting of G7 finance ministers in Washington, Mr Bentsen said he wanted to see 'a further commitment to growth' from his colleagues but welcomed progress already made towards looser monetary conditions in Europe and a more expansive budget in Japan.</p>

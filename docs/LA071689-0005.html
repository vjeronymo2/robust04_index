			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: RUNNING OUT OF FUEL?  </P> <P> A just-out book about the making of "Star Trek V" -- by director/co-star  William Shatner, and his daughter, Lisabeth Shatner -- purports to tell the  behind-the-scenes account of "the most spectacular 'Star Trek' movie yet!"  </P> <P> Alas, the book -- "Captain's Log: William Shatner's Personal Account of the  Making of 'Star Trek V' " -- was published by Pocket before the "spectacular"  film's anticipated box office grosses didn't roll in.  </P> <P> In 4 1/2 weeks, "Star Trek V" -- generally panned by the critics -- has to date  grossed less than the previous films -- just $45.7 million and is sputtering  badly. Compare previous screen Treks: "I" totaled $82.2 million; "II," $78.7  million; "III," $76.4 million; and "IV," $109.7 million.  </P> <P> Producer Harve Bennett argued, "You can't make those comparisons -- not  considering that this is the summer of the great (blockbuster) blitz. Relative  to the box office of 'II' and 'III,' we are off just 18%. Being off 18% this  summer is not exactly chopped liver."  </P> <P> As for the critical knocks singling out Shatner's direction: "Listen, I don't  think there's one critic in the world who knows what the (heck) a director  does." Bennett applauded Shatner for "creating a working environment of fun and  energy -- we had a good time."  </P> <P> (As for the possibility of another sequel: "In the words of Spock, 'There are  always possibilities.' ")  </P> <P> According to reps for Shatner, "He is being inundated with scripts to direct."  </P> <P> They declined to specify the inundations. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

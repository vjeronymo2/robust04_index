He stressed the importance of the documents, signed during  his visit to Russia, and made special mention of President  Yeltsin's address to the State Duma. For the first time ever  "CIS member states were given an answer concerning the  priorities of Russia's domestic and foreign policy. Russia is a  great power. We believe in Russia, in its great future. Our  belief is based on the historic roots, without which our today's  friendship and cooperation would be impossible," the Uzbek  president said.    "Russia should be a guarantor of peace and stability in  Central Asia. There will always be two poles in the world, and  we in Uzbekistan are keeping closer to Russia's pole," he  stressed.</p>

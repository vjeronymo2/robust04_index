			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Arts (Openings): Proms A bumper four-hour Prom on Sunday pays tribute to the work of Sir William Glock. In his years as controller of music at the BBC from 1959 to 1972 the adventurous Glock opened up new frontiers at the BBC Proms, bringing in music old and new. His enthusiasms ranged from Josquin to Stockhausen and only a concert of exceptional scope could hope to do justice to them all. The conductors on Sunday include Pierre Boulez, Colin Davis and George Benjamin.</p>

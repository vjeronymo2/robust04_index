			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Charles Clover: "Fury Over Norway's Whaling </F> Defiance"]    [Text] Britain yesterday condemned Norway's decision to  kill 301 minke whales this year in defiance of a worldwide  whaling moratorium.    Norway has given its whalers a quota of 29 more whales than  last year despite International Whaling Commission [IWC] advice  that stocks could tolerate a quota of only one whale, even if  the moratorium was overturned.    The decision, 10 days after the International Whaling  Commission meeting in Mexico, is likely to bring international  condemnation and may bring sanctions from the United States.    Under the quota set by Norway's Labour government, 189  whales  will be killed by the commercial fleet and 112 for research.    Last year Norway declared its first commercial whaling quota  for six years in defiance of the 1986 moratorium and had hoped  to get the moratorium overturned.    A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture said last night  "The government deplores Norway's decision to whale for a  further year particularly in view of the uncertainty there  currently is about the number of minke whales in the North  Atlantic."    At the Mexico meeting the scientific committee of the IWC  took issue with Norway's assertion that there were 86,000 minke  whales in the North East Atlantic The scientific committee said  there were only 50,000.    Greenpeace said that it was appealing to companies to step  up  boycotts of Norwegian fish.    Last year Safeway and Iceland stores imposed boycotts of  Norwegian products.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 19 (AFP) -- Informal contacts are taking  place between the federal military government and opposition  members in an attempt to find a solution to Nigeria's political  crisis, a member of the opposition told AFP Sunday [19 June].    The contacts were being held ahead of a meeting military  ruler General Sani Abacha is expected to hold this week with  traditional monarchs and selected politicians from all parts of  the federation, observers noted.    "We are not opposed to any form of dialogue aimed at  resolving the crisis. Nobody wants the nation to be on fire.  Nobody wants a deadlock or a political logjam," the opposition  member said in a telephone discussion.    He said however that neither the National Democratic  Coalition (Nadeco) nor its affiliated bodies would compromise on  the issues of "actualisation of the verdict" of last June's  annulled presidential election, a quick return to democracy and  restoration of political structures dissolved last November when  Abacha came to power.    "We have told our leaders and representatives to respond to  government offers on quick return to democracy any time they are  made," said the source who asked for anonymity. "Nobody would  refute the efficacy of dialogue...the survival of Nigeria is  paramount to all of us."    While contacts between the two parties are going on, the  government has stated its determination to forge ahead with its  plan to convene a constitutional conference, beginning June 27  in the capital Abuja.    Problems confronting the nation, including those that  threaten its unity, are expected to be discussed at the  conference, scheduled to last three months. The report of the  conference would be submitted to the Provisional Ruling Council  for ratification.</p>

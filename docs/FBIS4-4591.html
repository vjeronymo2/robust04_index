			<p>BFN     [Text] A dissolution of the House is now inevitable if  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai wishes to block the Opposition's  constitution amendment draft approved overwhelmingly by  Parliament at its first reading Thursday.    Coalition sources said the decision by Parliament to endorse  the Opposition draft, strongly criticized for being drafted  hastily from the 1978 constitution, has made a dissolution  unavoidable.    Mr. Chuan is expected to dissolve the Lower House before the  draft passes it third reading if it appears the draft will be  less democratic than the present charter, said one source.    A senior Democrat Party member said the Premier, after the  Government's humiliating defeat in Parliament, sought a meeting  with former prime minister Prem Tinsulanon at his home on  Thursday.    He said Gen. Prem advised the Prime Minister to dissolve the  House in order to avoid an embarrassing defeat.    The Opposition on Thursday managed to recruit Senate support  in pushing through its constitution amendment proposal after the  draft was accept for deliberation less than 24 hours earlier.    The bloc prepared the draft hastily by dusting off the l978  constitution and inserting most of the 26 amendment points  previously agreed to by the 10 political parties making up the  coalition and Opposition.    But the Opposition removed those bills seeking to reduce the  number of senators and their power, apparently to ensure the  support of the Upper House for the bill.    "The Prime Minister will definitely not allow this  disgraceful constitution draft to be put into use," said the  source.    He said a dissolution was among measures discussed by  government whips yesterday.    Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan also hinted at the  possibility of a dissolution because of worries over future  cooperation between the coalition and Upper House.    He said the Senate could vote against a key government bill.    Although he insisted the Senate vote for the Opposition's  constitution draft was not unusual, Mr. Banyat admitted there  could be grave problems if the Upper House should one day voted  against a key government bill involving the distribution of  power, the administration court or taxation.    "If these bills do not get the support of the Senate, we  will  really have to do some heavy thinking," said Mr. Banyat.    Deputy Transport and Communications Minister Charat  Phuachuai  said the extraordinary committee appointed Thursday to  scrutinize the Opposition-sponsored amendment draft was expected  to recommend that the second and third readings be held during  the next House session from May and July.    He said the debate would start another political uproar.    "The draft may be amended in a way so as to become totally  unacceptable to the people," he said.    "Under this scenario, the Prime Minister has only two  political options -- either to resign or dissolve the House. I  am quite confident that after the committee finishes its  scrutiny, there will be a political change in the country."    Mr. Charat said it was widely known the opposition parties  were trying their best to topple the Government.    Fellow Deputy Transport and Communications Minister Phinit  Charusombat said a major change may be inevitable if the  Opposition joins with senators in amending the Constitution to  the extent where it becomes unacceptable to the public.    "The people should monitor developments closely," he said,  but hoped a compromise could be reached.    Democrat Party secretary-general Sanan Kachonprasat ruled  out  any political change in the near future how ever, saying the  party representatives on the scrutiny committee would do their  best to ensure the opposition constitution draft is more  democratic.    "Prime Minister Chuan is not the kind of person who submits  easily to pressure. There is no political reason for the  Premier to dissolve Parliament," he said.    Deputy Government Spokesman Sudarat Keyuraphan said her  Phalang Tham Party may propose a dissolution if the details in  the constitution amendments do not benefit the people.    Democrat MP Niphon Bunyamani said he was confident the Prime  Minister would not allow the opposition amendment draft to be  approved if it was unacceptable to the people.    "I think the Prime Minister will eventually have to return  power to the people by dissolving Parliament as the Government  has far fewer representatives on the scrutiny than Senate and  Opposition combined," he said.    The government whips met yesterday morning and were later  joined by the Prime Minister and the leaders of the other  coalition parties.    Solidarity whip Ekkaphap Phosun said they discussed the call  for a dissolution but thought it would be of no use since the  Senate would not be dissolved as well. The charter amendment  problem would also not have been addressed.    "We confirm the Government will continue to administer the  country. If we cannot amend the charter this time, we will just  resubmit the bills," he said.    "If we dissolve Parliament and the Opposition gets elected  into the House, they will not amend the charter."    Mr. Ekkaphap said Mr. Chuan was asked why Defense Minister  Wichit Sukmak voted with the Opposition Thursday and replied  this showed the charter amendments were not a Government affair  and there had been no lobbying of ministers who are senators.    The matter was left to the conscience of each  parliamentarian.    Earlier, there had been calls from within the Democrat Party  for House Speaker Marut Bunnak to be sacked after be scheduled  the Opposition charter draft and for Gen. Wichit to be ousted  for voting with the Opposition despite being a Cabinet minister.    New Aspiration Party leader Chawalit Yongchaiyut insisted  the  Government had not "lost face" through its defeat in Parliament.  It is the people who will be affected, he said.    The Interior Minister said the Government would continue to  push for the charter amendments.    Democrat MP Alongkon Pholabut said the Senate and Opposition  vote showed disrespect for the people, but there was still time  for them to remedy that during the scrutiny process.    "The power and number of senators constitute a large force  and it goes against the wishes of the people to have senators  hold the majority," he said.</p>

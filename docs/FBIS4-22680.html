			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Khinshteyn: "Presents for Barkashov: </F> He Was Met Not With Empty Hands"]    [Text] At a time when the recent prisoner and accused  Aleksandr Barkashov is carefully hiding from the public in an  undisclosed hospital, his associates in Russian National Unity  [RNYe] are not wasting any time.    As became known to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS [MK] from sources  within RNYe, most of its members were recently made aware of  instructional guidelines from the DSP. On behalf of the Central  Staff, it was explained to the "Nazis" precisely how they should  wage propaganda among the population (it is not accidental that  recent issues of the RUSSKIY PORYADOK party organ appeared in  exactly a size that could be duplicated by Xerox in A4 format)  and how to attract citizens into the party ranks. In particular,  it is stated that it is desirable to make it mandatory for  newcomers to participate in certain combat actions, in order to  link them forever with RNYe. The ideologists call upon people to  resort to any means, so long as they hold onto people who are  already running off in all directions (recently Unity was  abandoned by a very large number of its supporters, and some of  the businessmen who had given money had stopped acting the role  of Maecenas. Rumors are rampant throughout RNYe concerning a  certain businessman who, prior to October, had sponsored the  "idea," but who, after refusing to continue to provide  financing, had been robbed by "unknown" criminals.    The fact that all these indications are coming not from  Barkashov himself forces one to wonder seriously about exactly  who in the RNYe is the main person. It is known that chief of  staff Viktor Krivov, even during the preputsch period, played  far from the last violin in the party. Especially since people  are beginning to hear vague news about a forthcoming  reorganization of Unity. It is not precluded that whereas the  recently one-man leader had been, by definition, the Chief  Associate -- Barkashov, and the Central Staff had subordinated  itself to him, a staff which in turn managed the regional  organizations, now Aleksandr Petrovich will have to coordinate  all his decisions with the staff. In a word, the "Nazis" are  being beset by the very same problems that beset the recent  Supreme Soviet and the president.    Since Barkashov's arrest, the party has already had time to  hold a few underground meetings (as a rule, in secret warehouse  apartments where the RUSSKIY PORYADOK and AL-KODS newspapers are  stored. MK knows, for example, about the existence of a secret  meeting place like this in the area of the Shchukinskaya subway  station), at which meetings it was decided to continue the fight  and to create a commission to investigate the assassination  attempt on their leader. The basic versions that were put forth  were: a) it was the work of the Israeli Beytar militarized  organization; b) it was purely a Mafia action involving money  (the fact that Barkashov's people engage in the protection of  commercial institutions is no secret to anyone); and c) it was  the work of domestic intelligence services. The "investigators"  doubt very much that this was done by competitors from other  fascist parties. Probably they do not want to discredit the  idea. The commission has begun its work and hopes to finish it  before the already healthy Barkashov convokes the next party  rally.    P.S. When this article was being prepared for the press, MK  learned that Aleksandr Petrovich Barkashov had returned home to  his apartment on Ulitsa Vavilova. In a conversation with an MK  correspondent he stated that he would continue to carry out the  fight while remaining the permanent leader of RNYe and, if any  new disturbances occur, his party will participate in them once  again, defending the interests of the Russian people. In  Barkashov's opinion, today the chances of their victory are much  better than they were before October.</p>

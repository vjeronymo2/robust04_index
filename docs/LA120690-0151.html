			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> PANEL BACKS FEES FOR PARKWAY WORK  </P> <P> The city Planning Commission this week endorsed a proposed ordinance that would  establish fees for new developments along Crown Valley Parkway.  </P> <P> Specific amounts were not included in the proposal, which will be discussed at  the City Council's meeting on Monday.  </P> <P> Fees collected under the proposed ordinance would be used to widen the six-lane  parkway, modify traffic signals and build drainage facilities. Also being  considered is improving the parkway's interchange at Interstate 5.  </P> <P> The area affected by the proposed fees is bounded roughly by Via Grande and  Venado Drive to the north, Interstate 5 to the west, Marguerite Parkway to the  east and Crown Valley to the south.  </P> <P> In the last 18 months, developers receiving approvals for projects in this area  were required to agree on an interim basis to new fees, said Clint Sherrod, the  city's director of planning and development.  </P> <P> However, the city must enact the fees by Dec. 31 or those agreements will  become invalid, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Knyazkov report: "Constructive Talks Held. But </F> Differences in Timetable for 14th Army's Withdrawal From  Moldavia [Moldova] Have Remained"]    [Text] Informing readers in yesterday's issue of KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA on the progress of the Russian-Moldavian negotiations, at  which the timetable for the withdrawal of the Russian 14th Army  from the territory of Moldavia was discussed, we presented some  preliminary details. The delegation heads' news conference to a  large extent clarified the sides' positions. According to the  Russian delegation's leader, Vladimir Kitayev, on the basis of  military experts' conclusions and calculations a period of four,  not three, years will be required for the troops' withdrawal.  Russia is prepared to look into the possibility of reducing this  period, but it will be greater than Kishinev [Chisinau] expects  -- the latter considers that the 14th Army should be withdrawn  no later than 1 January 1996. Nevertheless, it was stated at  the news conference that this question has already been resolved  as far as possible, and it is likely that the sides will come to  a final decision at the negotiations' 10th round.    Indeed, not a single document was initialed in the  negotiations' ninth round, but the outward "tardiness" of these  negotiations going back to 8 August 1992 mask an inner tension.    "We do not want the troop withdrawal to be accompanied by  mass actions on the part of Dniester Region inhabitants,  rallies, pickets, and other excesses," Colonel Eduard Vorobyev,  head of the Russian delegation's military side, explained. "We  wish to take all aspects of the problem into account, and I  believe the withdrawal will proceed in an organized manner when  full mutual understanding between the Russian and Moldavian  delegations is reached and the Dniester Region's interests are  taken into consideration to such an extent that the leadership  and the bulk of the population of the Dniester's left bank will  participate in guaranteeing this process."    It is worth reminding readers that since the start of the  negotiations three Russian units have been withdrawn from  Moldavia and 18 have been disbanded on site; also, eight  interstate agreements have been concluded and are being  implemented successfully.</p>

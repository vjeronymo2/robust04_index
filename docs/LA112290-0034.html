			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: '50S DINING PLUS SOME REGIONAL, INTERNATIONAL FAVORITES  </P> <P> Fat Freddy's is a '50s-style diner with a difference. You can get that juicy  hamburger with fries and a thick old-fashioned milkshake.  </P> <P> But the diner also has choices of Southern-fried chicken, veal parmigiana,  blackened catfish and a variety of Mexican favorites.  </P> <P> Complete dinners, which include a garden-fresh salad (with two kinds of grated  cheese and tomatoes) or soup, choice of potato and vegetable, average $5.40.  Fat Freddy's is known for its catfish, which you can get either fried or  blackened for $6.95.  </P> <P> You can't go wrong with the beef and Cheddar sandwich for $5.35: tender strips  of roast beef grilled with cheese and tomatoes on Parmesan cheese-coated  sourdough bread. It's served with french fries.  </P> <P> There's also a good selection of desserts, including a huge banana split  ($4.25) that could easily make a meal by itself.  </P> <P> This is the kind of friendly place where your server is very likely to remember  you. There are jukeboxes at each booth, and the decor will bring back memories  for many. There is also a full-service bar.  </P> <P>  Fat Freddy's, 1571 El Camino Real (just off the Santa Ana Freeway at Red Hill  Avenue), Tustin. Open Sunday through Thursday, 6 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.; Fridays  and Saturdays till 11 p.m. (714) 832-2422. Also at 2949 Fairview Road, Costa  Mesa.

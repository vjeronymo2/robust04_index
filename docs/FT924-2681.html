			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Scotland (5): A certain level of dismay - The water industry IF THE government's proposals to change local government in Scotland by moving towards single-tier authorities look like gaining grudging acceptance, this cannot be said of a possible consequence of these reforms: the privatisation of the Scottish water and sewerage industry. Water and sewerage services in Scotland were not privatised when the English water companies were sold in 1989; they are run by nine regional and the three island councils. As these councils are to be restructured, the Scottish Office believes it will be necessary to come to new arrangements for water. The idea that privatisation should form part of these new arrangements has caused dismay. An opinion poll in The Herald, the Glasgow morning newspaper, found that only 4 per cent of Scots canvassed showed themselves in favour of privatisation. Only 9 per cent of the Conservatives who were asked supported it. Mr Bruce Black, senior deputy secretary at the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, says: 'Scottish people do not like the idea of privatisation. It offends the presbyterian ethic which says that the government should supply essential services. 'They particularly do not like the idea of water privatisation. Water is seen as one of Scotland's abundant resources. 'They have seen what has happened in England. Private water companies have raised the money for investment through higher charges. People who have been unable to meet the charges have been disconnected.' Another argument advanced by the Scottish Office for changing the water and sewerage arrangments is that heavy capital expenditure will be needed over the next 10 to 15 years, to comply with government regulations and EC directives on water standards. These include the Water Supply (Water Quality)(Scotland) regulations 1990, which adopted the standards of the EC directive on the quality of drinking water. The British Government also adopted the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive and the Bathing Water Directive. There is also a need to stop dumping sewerage sludge at sea by 1998. The Scottish Office estimates that meeting these requirements will cost Pounds 2.5bn in Scotland. A further Pounds 2.5bn will be needed for maintenance and upgrading and improving unsatisfactory sewage discharges. The regional councils are investing Pounds 218m a year in capital spending. Professor George Fleming of the department of civil engineering at Strathclyde University says: 'The extra Pounds 5bn will probably mean a doubling of the annual capital spending to over Pounds 400m. Whatever new system is contrived, charges will have to rise.' Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, indicates that he does not want the extra spending to be met by increased public borrowing by local authorities. He argues that more spending on water could mean less spending on other services such as education and health. Last July Mr Lang said he was looking at ways 'in which the private sector might contribute enterprise and investment' to water. This was taken to mean privatisation. Since then, however, the Scottish Office has published a consultation paper called Water and Sewerage in Scotland: Investing For Our Future. It repeats arguments for changing the current arrangements and puts forward eight options - including privatisation, which could involve setting up three companies which would either be floated on the stock exchange or sold off in a trade sale. But there are also proposals for a national water authority which would have a watchdog body similar to the National Rivers Authority in England; a number of joint water boards serving single-tier councils; straightforward transfer from the old councils to the new; and some form of franchising whereby the local authorities, or groups of them, would retain ownership and control of the water and sewerage installations, contracting out operation to private concerns. As with the proposed changes to local government, Mr Lang tries to make it clear that nothing has been definitely decided about water. He says in his foreword: 'The Government will reach a decision on the right way forward in the light of responses to this consultation paper. Until then I intend to keep my options open.' The only certainty is that if the investment required is made, water charges will have to rise. Scots water users now pay an average of Pounds 132 a year for water - though many are unaware of it, because water charge is collected with the poll tax. The average charge in England and Wales is Pounds 177. As the government waits for reaction to come in, the public view appears to be captured by Mr Henry McLeish, a Labour spokesman on Scotland: 'We don't dispute the need for Pounds 5bn investment over 10 to 15 years. We accept that water charges will have to rise to help pay for it. But we don't want the higher charges to swell the profits of private companies. The Treasury should allow the councils to borrow the extra money needed.'</p>

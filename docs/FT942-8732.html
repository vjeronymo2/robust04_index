			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Checklist for pension buyers issued by SIB Checklists to help people thinking of buying personal pensions were published yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, as part of its efforts to improve standards in this area of business. Two factsheets which list questions and issues that potential investors should raise with sales agents or financial advisers will be given wide distribution through outlets such as Citizens' Advice Bureaux and public libraries by the end of the month. They will also be publicised through the Trades Union Congress and the Confederation of British Industry. These organisations are being asked to make their members aware of the checklists. Sample copies have been sent to all members of the National Association of Pension Funds and to all public-sector pension schemes. Some 500,000 have been printed so far. One factsheet covers the position of people who are thinking of opting out of - or not joining - a pension scheme for which they are eligible with an employer. The other deals with people who are thinking of transferring a lump sum from the pension scheme of a former employer. The fact that the regulator is taking these steps directly to try to ensure that customers take well-informed decisions suggests that it doubts whether the life insurance industry can convey this information clearly and effectively to potential customers. The intensive programme that the regulators have undertaken relating to the sale of personal pensions follows a pilot study published last December. This suggested that the vast majority of pensions transfer cases did not meet regulatory requirements. The survey led to widespread public unease about personal pensions business, which appears to have been reflected in the sales of pension transfers in the first three months of this year. More than 500,000 people are estimated to have bought pension transfers, while the number to have opted out of an existing occupational scheme is thought to be much lower. Regulators believe that the guidance has to address both types of investment because a decision to opt out of an occupational scheme may make someone worse off in retirement. Each factsheet focuses first on basic questions for customers to address in considering the pension scheme they might leave. These include finding out whether the scheme is based on final salary or on purchasing particular benefits; and whether they realise that in leaving the scheme they might give up some of the benefits for which they are eligible. It goes on to a checklist of questions which potential investors should make sure their financial adviser has answered. It also advises customers to check what commission they will pay to the sales agent or adviser, and specifically urges them to shop around. The paper dealing with opting out also contains a clear warning that such a decision is highly likely to be a bad one. 'You will nearly always be better off if you stay in, or join, your employer's pension scheme,' it warns. The next stage of the regulatory work on pension transfers will be the issuing of guidance on how to deal with cases where a customer has suffered as a result of following poor advice to transfer or opt out of an employer's scheme. This is due to be published in July.</p>

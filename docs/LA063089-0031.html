			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KCBQ SOLD;  </P> <P> RADIO STATION KCBQ SOLD FOR $23.5 MILLION  </P> <P> Eric Chandler Communications has sold KCBQ AM and FM, better known as Eagle  105, to rapidly growing Adams Communications for $23.5 million, it was  announced Thursday.  </P> <P> Chandler Communications purchased KCBQ for $12.2 million in 1986, and promptly  switched the format from country to the oldies rock 'n' roll of Eagle 105. The  format is simulcast on FM (105.3) and AM (1170).  </P> <P> "We're going to keep the format as is," said Matt Mills, president of Adams'  radio division.  </P> <P> Adams-owned KOOL AM and FM in Phoenix feature oldies rock formats.  </P> <P> "Phoenix has worked out very well for us," Mills said. "We're just real high on  the San Diego market. San Diego is a growth market and we're specializing in  Top 30 markets when possible."  </P> <P> Mills said he did not expect to make any staff changes at the station. Jim  Seemiller, Adams vice president of the Western region, will oversee KCBQ from  his Phoenix office, Mills said.  </P> <P> Founded in 1983 by Stephen Adams, Adams Communications is a national multimedia  company with interests in outdoor advertising, publishing, television and  radio.  </P> <P> The radio division, based in Clearwater, Fla., owns 10 radio stations -- six FM  and four AM -- in Phoenix, Seattle, St. Louis, San Antonio and other mid-sized  markets. Adams owns nine television stations, primarily in smaller markets.  </P> <P> The $23.5-million price is high for San Diego, but not unheard of, considering  the current market for radio stations. Prices have skyrocketed in recent years,  because of federal deregulation and a host of young companies like Adams  bidding for stations.  </P> <P> "We feel we're paying a good premium to get into the market, but that's what  you have to do to get into a good area," Mills said.  </P> <P> Radio stations changing owners is "something that goes on in radio," Eagle 105  General Manager Jeff Apregan said. "Radio stations have become a good  investment."  </P> <P> KCBQ was the Los Angeles-based Chandler's only radio interest.  </P></p>

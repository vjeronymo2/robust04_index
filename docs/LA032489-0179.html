			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ICE CUBE KEEPS COOL, CHILLS CLASH  </P> <P> Rap music, already widely linked in the public mind to gang violence, came  within a heartbeat of another black mark Thursday night when a fight broke out  near the stage during N.W.A.'s concert at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim.  </P> <P> It was an especially delicate moment because N.W.A. is the hot new Los  Angeles-area group whose sometimes X-rated tales about gang violence are  already drawing criticisms from those who feel the records glorify gang  behavior.  </P> <P> As part of the regular precaution for rap shows at the 2,500-seat theater,  security guards held hand metal detection devices against everyone who entered  the building and made women open their purses.  </P> <P> Inside, the atmosphere was calm as the three opening acts served up rap with  varying degrees of effectiveness.  </P> <P> But the intensity level increased dramatically when N.W.A. walked on stage  shortly after 9:30 and soon went into "Gangsta, Gangsta" and "---- tha Police,"  two of the most provocative numbers on the quintet's "Straight Outta Compton"  album.  </P> <P> Midway through the equally graphic "Dopeman," the fight broke out and a chill  of tension swept the hall. Ice Cube, one of the principal N.W.A. writers and  rappers, saw the flurry of activity and was faced with a challenge. Would he  maintain the group's "neutrality" stance or simply ignore what was going on to  appear cool?  </P> <P> In a brave and revealing moment, Ice Cube, 19, stopped the song and used the  microphone to try to combat the potential flare-up. Speaking in the same angry  tone as the song, he shouted: "This ain't (the movie) 'Colors'. . . . You  didn't come to see a fight, you came to see a concert.' "  </P> <P> With the help of security guards, order was quickly restored, although about 40  males later spilled outside, causing nearby Anaheim police to dispatch a dozen  squad cars. The youths then raced away; no arrests were made.  </P> <P> Inside the theater the concert continued uneventfully. Ice-T, who helped  popularize the L.A. gangster rap image, was the evening's headliner, but N.W.A.  was the more galvanizing force. For all its crudeness, the group -- which also  includes Eazy-E, MC Ren, Dr. Dre and D. J. Yella -- exhibits a sense of  artistic spirit and vision.  </P></p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Tighter insider net catches traders out If you were planning a bit of insider dealing in the gilts market, you had better be quick. The new insider dealing regulations, which come into force tomorrow, bring government debt, Eurobonds and derivatives into the net for the first time. They also broaden the definition of inside information, leading some lawyers to say that the equity analyst's job could be changed fundamentally. Yet the new rules are poorly understood in the City. An unscientific survey by the Financial Times suggests that few staff outside City firms' compliance departments have a good grasp of their implications. Some compliance officers appear none too sure. The extent of the confusion is shown in the table. Leading analysts, fund managers and gilts traders were presented with a number of hypothetical situations and asked whether they thought they were legal or illegal under the old and new rules. Three representative sets of answers are shown. Even the experts disagreed, and the 'right' answers in the first two columns represent a rough consensus between the Treasury, the Stock Exchange, City compliance departments and independent lawyers. The Treasury and the Stock Exchange insist that this confusion has been created by 'scaremongering' City lawyers. One official stressed that the new regulations were introduced merely to implement a European Union directive on insider dealing. The government was not trying to outlaw normal City practices or even to improve the poor record of successful prosecutions for insider dealing. But some lawyers believe the new law does have important implications, particularly for equity analysts. One City lawyer said: 'The new regulations seem to put out of bounds a whole mass of unpublished industry information.' This is because it is no longer necessary to show that 'inside information' came from the company whose securities were traded. The information need not relate directly to the security at all. Consider the first example in the table. If your friend in the Treasury tips you off about an interest rate cut and you buy gilts, it will be insider dealing. The information must still have an unambiguous implication for the security's price. A leak of unexpectedly good trade figures, for example, would not count as inside information for dealing in gilts or shares. But if a source in the Russian government tipped you off about a huge new gold discovery in Siberia you would be guilty of insider dealing if you sold gold mining shares - though not gold - in the well-founded expectation that the price would fall when the news broke. In our table the gilts trader got this wrong because he thought the information had to be 'confidential' in some sense. 'It is not as if the Russian government is under an obligation to announce it on Topic,' he objected. The fund manager answered it correctly but then struggled with the questions about retailer X. The first example, where the finance director leaks details of the company's Christmas sales to an analyst, is exactly what the authorities are trying to stamp out. But this 'nudge and wink' from the company has been illegal since 1980. It is the next example that is affected by the new rules. Here, the insider dealer buys shares in X after its quoted rival Y says that its own Christmas sales have been good. Legal under the old provision, this will be outlawed from tomorrow. What really baffled the fund manager was the next answer. If the information comes from private rival Z rather than publicly-quoted competitor Y it would not be insider dealing to buy shares in X. He said: 'That's completely bizarre. I don't see why it should be different just because it's a private company. And surely it should be the same as the tip-off about the Russian gold mine.' But disagreement over the final example, the so-called 'star analyst' problem, is changing the way City firms operate. The Treasury and the Stock Exchange insist that prior knowledge of a price-sensitive stock recommendation from a star analyst is not inside information as long as the recommendation itself is not based on unpublished information. But some lawyers disagree. They believe that the new legislation would outlaw the practice of 'front-running' - where a firm's market-makers buy or sell stock ahead of its analyst's recommendation going public. Though illegal in the US, this is common practice in the City. In a memo to staff on the new regulations a leading securities house says: 'The position regarding market-makers changing their book as a result of an as yet unpublished analysts's recommendation is still unclear and should be avoided.'</p>

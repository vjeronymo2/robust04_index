			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Maastricht worries upset European markets UNCERTAINTY over the prospects for economic and monetary union continued to upset the European government bond markets yesterday, with high-yielding markets seeing the worst falls. Some dealers are waiting for Ireland's referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on Thursday, which is expected to yield a vote in favour of ratification. Since Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty, investors have flocked to the safety of the D-Mark bloc. However, German government bonds ended lower yesterday as poor inflation data proved a disappointment to the market. The cost of living in the former West Germany rose by a revised 0.4 per cent in May, giving a year-on-year rise of 4.6 per cent. Preliminary figures had suggested a month-on-month rise of 0.3 per cent. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.20 and slipped to 88.06 in the early afternoon, ending at around 88.07. THE UK government bond market fell back by nearly half a point due to the combination of funding worries, poor trade figures, and the general decline in the European bond markets. The Bank of England is due to announce details of its next gilt auction today. It has already indicated that it will sell between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 3bn of stock in the 2007-2012 maturity range, but today's announcement will contain the exact amount and maturity of the auction issue. With the forthcoming auction already overhanging the market, some dealers were taken by surprise when the Bank announced on Friday that a Pounds 500m tranche of the 4 1/8 per cent index-linked stock due 2030 would be available for sale with effect from today. 'Most of the focus at the moment is on new issuance and funding,' said one trader, adding that the market will be waiting for the release today of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) figures for May. Traders said that against the background of supply worries, yesterday's trade figures did not help market sentiment. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell over half a point from 116 7/16 to 115 27/32 by late afternoon. THE JAPANESE government bond market opened on a firm note yesterday after Friday's US inflation figures raised hopes that the Federal Reserve might ease short-term interest rates. Dealers said the combination of a firmer US Treasury bond market and a stronger yen helped to buoy the Japanese bond market, which closed slightly higher on the day. Most investor interest focused on short-dated rather than the longer-maturity bond issues. The benchmark No 129 issue opened with a yield of 5.48 per cent, moved to 5.495 per cent and closed at the highest level of the day yielding 5.475 per cent. Volumes were relatively light with only Y244bn traded in the No 129 bond. US TREASURY prices were little changed yesterday in very quiet trading. By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/32 at 101 21/32 , yielding 7.848 per cent, while the two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/16 , yielding 5.005 per cent. The market appears to have given up almost all hope of another interest rate cut after the Federal Reserve's decision last week not to ease monetary policy in the wake of disappointing retail sales data and good inflation numbers. The likelihood that rates will stay where they are, coupled with the absence of important economic data, explained the lethargic session yester-day. The only news out yesterday was 10-day auto sales for early June. The figures, showing that the annual rate rose during the period from between 6.2m and 6.3m units to 6.5m units, drew no reaction from investors.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Midland's dark horse On the surface, Lloyds' proposed bid for Midland should have been a knock-out. But although its initial value was just over the top market estimates of Midland's worth, the target's price was remarkably slow to respond. By yesterday's close it was still 12 per cent below the 447p level where the Lloyds offer had settled. That hardly suggests investors believe Lloyds will win its looming battle with the competition authorities. Were it to succeed, the deal would look attractive even at this heady price. HSBC cannot point to Pounds 700m in cost savings through rationalisation - though it must be a source of shame to British clearing banks that their industry is carrying so much fat. The deal would involve a hefty goodwill write-off, and there would be a Pounds 550m restructuring charge. But the merged entity would still have a tier 1 capital ratio of over 5 per cent even before touching Lloyds' Pounds 900m of surplus provisions for Third World debt. But the competition policy issue is serious, even though the debate will be highly political and the outcome can only be guessed at. Lloyds' argument that consumers will benefit from orderly rationalisation in an over-supplied market may be readily appreciated - though not automatically accepted - by those familiar with the industry. It looks less convincing to a general public worried about redundancies and small businesses. But Lloyds has already succeeded in making its rival look even less generous than before. Lloyds' offer may not represent a realistic valuation of Midland, if it turns out to be based on an anti-competitive strategy. But that will not necessarily stop Midland shareholders holding out for more from HSBC, which is thus on the spot. Any increase would be significantly dilutive even if it could be built into the existing structure. HSBC cannot offer more equity without upsetting its share price. There are already doubts about the market's ability to digest its loan stock. Straight cash might upset China. Midland's closing price yesterday was also marginally below the HSBC offer. There is still a chance it may remain independent after all.</p>

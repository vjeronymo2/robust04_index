			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: 'President Yeltsin does not have supporters. He has hostages' LIKE the western leaders backing President Yeltsin and his reforms, many Russians feel that there is little choice but to support him for fear of the alternatives. As Mr Mikhail Leontiev, a leading Russian economics commentator, observes wryly: 'Yeltsin does not have supporters but hostages. He puts one in a situation where one has no choice but to support him.' The question now is whether new western help spearheaded yesterday by President Clinton and to be pursued by the Group of Seven in Tokyo can boost support for Mr Yeltsin in an April 25 referendum. The answer is that it probably cannot hurt. Most people interviewed yesterday at Moscow's Kiev railway station, around the street stalls and kiosks which are the most visible consequence of market reforms so far, welcomed western assistance, if it was made more effective. 'Humanitarian aid only ends up in these kiosks where the hoods in leather coats make money out of it,' claimed Mrs Liudmila Konstantinova, a retired engineer on a pension of Rbs8,500 a month. But she added that Mr Yeltsin still needed some sort of help 'because he's not managing on his own'. 'Help is always good. The question is how to use it. We need investment in specific regions and businesses,' said Mr Albert Koplinsky, a factory worker. Mr Yuri Feldman, who has a computer programming business, suggested that the west send managers to Russian enterprises 'to teach us how to work properly'. Natasha, an atomic engineering student from Obninsk, had mixed feelings about aid but would vote for the president. 'On the one hand, if we could have avoided getting into this mess, we would not need help. But since people don't want to work hard, we are finding it difficult to get out of this ourselves.' A minority were resolutely opposed to western help. Expressing indignation about the rubbish and dirt surrounding the street sellers, Galina, an accountant, said she had lost faith in Mr Yeltsin. 'Before going to a market economy, we should have prepared for it. I feel terrible that we are now so poor we need help.' Another woman said: 'The only kind of help we need is our own. We've got to force people to work hard and put all the goods which are now on the streets into the (state) shops.' But Nikolai, standing behind a table laden with plugs, screwdrivers, and electrical wire, expressed full support for Mr Yeltsin. 'If the Communists come back, they won't even let us breathe. I supply things that people need, more cheaply than in the shops. What's wrong with that?'</p>

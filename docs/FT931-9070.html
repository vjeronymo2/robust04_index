			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Paribas banks on a clear break in the storm clouds - Alice Rawsthorn examines the tasks facing the bank's chairman Rue d'Antin, in the banking district of Paris, is clouded by Paribas' troubles. The bank, still reeling from the shock of posting its first ever loss, in 1991, is licking its wounds after another bruising year during which the problems of the French economic slowdown were aggravated by the scandal over the discovery of FFr1bn (Dollars 178m) of off-balance sheet dealings at its associate, Ciments Francais. Mr Andre Levy-Lang, the urbane investment banker who has chaired Paribas since 1990, faces the task of clearing away the debris from the Ciments Francais debacle and completing the process of restructuring his company. 'We had a tough time in 1992 and 1993 will be another difficult year,' he said. 'But most of our problems are due to short term factors. We must keep a long term perspective.' When Mr Levy-Lang first became chairman his chief challenge was to hammer out a long term structure for Paribas' labyrinthine mass of banking activities and industrial investments. Mr Levy-Lang has made some changes by pruning Paribas' portfolio of industrial investments and rationalising its retail banking operations outside France. Paribas is now composed of four divisions: Banque Paribas, the investment bank which is one of the few French institutions to be a serious player in the international marketplace Compagnie Bancaire, the specialised financing company with a strong presence in property Credit du Nord, the French retail banking network, and A portfolio of industrial investments including stakes in 200 companies. If all had gone according to plan Mr Levy-Lang would now be concentrating on strategic issues such as introducing Banque Paribas' new international structure and encouraging cross-referals between the three banking businesses. These issues are being addressed but he has also faced the further challenge of repairing the damage caused by the economic squeeze. All Paribas' banking businesses have been affected by the impact of high French interest rates, which has dried up demand for credit and recently produced steep increases in borrowing costs. Meanwhile, Credit du Nord and Compagnie Bancaire have had to make hefty provisions on their exposure to the depressed property markets both in France and the UK. As a result the group went into the red in 1991, with a net loss of FFr184m after provisions of FFr9.5bn. It clawed back into the black last year with provisional net profits of FFr900m, but the 'recovery' was mainly due to asset sales and Paribas still had to make provisions of FFr7.8bn. But the real trauma of 1992 was the discovery that Ciments Francais - a French cement company in which Paribas had sold control but was still a significant shareholder - had made hefty losses on its off-balance sheet dealings. Mr Pierre Conso, the cement company's chairman, has since resigned but it plunged into the red with an estimated net loss of FFr1bn last year. Paribas was left in the acutely embarrasing position of having to repay FFr500m of the FFr6bn received earlier last year for selling control of Ciments Francais to Italcementi of Italy. Its share of Ciments Francais losses for 1992, estimated at FFr500m, will wipe out the remaining profit from the sale. Despite the scandal, Mr Levy-Lang maintains that Ciments Francais was still 'a very profitable investment for us over the years'. But the fiasco acts as an apt illustration of the pitfalls of Paribas' strategy of taking sizeable stakes in industrial companies as a long term investor, generally without exerting managerial control. Mr Levy-Lang accepts that such a scenario could happen again. 'What can you do if the managers of a company are lying to the board and the auditors?' he said. However, he is still committed to continuing to develop Paribas' industrial portfolio with further investments in the future. He is also keen to return to the more mundane business of engineering Paribas' recovery. Like most French bankers he suspects that the market has stabilised, although the commercial property sector will remain fragile for a few more years. Paribas is now concentrating on improving productivity mainly by pooling specific areas of activity such as cheque processing for the three banking businesses and custodial functions for Credit du Nord and Banque Paribas. The group is expected to increase profits this year, albeit slowly, with Morgan Stanley forecasting modest growth from FFr900m to FFr1.2bn. 'We're still a few years away from producing the kind of profits I would like to see,' said Mr Levy-Lang. 'It won't happen overnight, but we'll get there.'</p>

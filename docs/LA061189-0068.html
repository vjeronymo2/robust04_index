			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES  </P> <P> Both Time and Newsweek, meanwhile, gave surprisingly generous coverage to Paul  Bartel's "Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills," which opened  nationwide on only one screen. The reason: neither newsweekly could get an  early "Star Trek 5" screening to make the deadline for last week's editions.  Bartel's little picture "got lucky," Corliss explained.  </P> <P> Like David Ansen at Newsweek, Corliss liked the sex comedy "pretty much." John  M. Wilson  </P></p>

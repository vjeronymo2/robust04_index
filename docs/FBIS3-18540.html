Cigarettes and beer will be more expensive. In a year tax on  cigarettes will be at the EU [European Union] level, and in  three years beer will reach EU tax levels.

Border  controls will be replaced by checks on exporters abroad and  special certificates.    The trade unions will have influence on EU legislation  through collective agreements in Sweden.    Security policy. There are no legal obstacles to Sweden and  the EU having a common foreign and security policy, Sweden  states in a declaration.

Sweden wants five votes in the Council of Ministers, while the  EU wants to give four. Sweden wants 25 seats in the European  Parliament, while the EU wants to give 21.    Import quotas on clothes will be reintroduced. The EU has  promised that quotas will correspond to today's level of  imports, but clothes prices could rise.

However, the EU has undertaken to review its own  regulations.    Financial support for Norrland will be replaced by the EU's  support to mountain agriculture and normal agricultural support  for disadvantaged regions. In addition the provinces concerned  can receive environmental support and money from the structural  fund for agricultural areas.    The freedom of information principle will remain.

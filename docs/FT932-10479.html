			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Letter: Schools must be subject to short external tests Sir, Professor Paul Black's letter ('Effective learning and accuracy in school tests', May 4), written in reply to my article on testing (April 29), convinces me I was right to call the Black Report on Assessment and Training (the TGAT Report as it is known) 'utopian'. Prof Black writes that 'short external tests are likely to give unreliable results'. This is simply not true. However reliability is defined, many standardised number and literacy tests have very high reliability ratings. There is always bound to be a small element of misclassification. But has Prof Black thought of comparing the reliability of standardised tests with the variability of 'classroom assessments by teachers', and the cost in terms of external audit of controlling such variability? Prof Black's second argument that 'short and apparently simple' tests cannot measure all 'important outcomes of learning' is correct. But would he not agree that many important outcomes of learning cannot and should not be tested? Would he not accept the conclusion of Alison Wolf of the Institute of Education, University of London, in her paper Assessment Issues and Problems in a Criterion-Based System, that criterion-referencing, of which he has been an ardent champion, leads to 'atomised objectives in a forest of verbiage'? Isn't that what has happened to the government's tests? My conclusion stands: let teachers test as they please, according to Prof Black's principles if they wish. But let there be 'short external tests' to measure the performance of schools. Robert Skidelsky, Social Market Foundation, 20 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1 9AA</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The authority citation for part 16 is revised to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 5 U.S.C. 552(a); 42 U.S.C. 3535(d). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 16.15 is amended by adding new paragraphs (c) and (d) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;16.15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Specific exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) The system of records entitled ``HUD/PIH&hyph;1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' consists in part of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes. Relevant records will be used by appropriate Federal, state or local agencies charged with the responsibility for investigating or prosecuting violations of law. Therefore, to the extent that information in the system falls within the coverage of subsection (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the system is exempt from the requirements of the following subsections of the Privacy Act, for the reasons stated below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) From subsection (c)(3) because release of an accounting of disclosures to an individual who may be the subject of an investigation could reveal the nature and scope of the investigation and could result in the altering or destruction of evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, and other evasive actions that could impede or compromise the investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) From subsection (d)(1) because release of the records to an individual who may become or has become the subject of an investigation could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, reveal the identity of confidential sources, or reveal sensitive investigative techniques and procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) From subsection (d)(2) because amendment or correction of the records could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, or could impose an impossible administrative and investigative burden by requiring the office that maintains the records to continuously retrograde its verifications of tenant eligibility attempting to resolve questions of accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine relevance or necessity of information in pre-investigative early stages. The value of such information is a question of judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to an investigation. In addition, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, or investigators, may obtain information concerning the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, or investigators, should retain this information because it may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and provide leads for other law enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining the evidence, information may be provided which relates to matters incidental to the main purpose of the inquiry or investigation but which may be pertinent to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The system of records entitled ``HUD/PIH&hyph;1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' consists in part of material that may be used for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment or Federal contracts, the release of which would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. Therefore, to the extent that information in this system falls within the coverage of subsection (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), the system is exempt from the requirements of the following subsection of the Privacy Act, for the reasons stated below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) From subsection (d)(1) because release would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise of confidentiality. Revealing the identity of a confidential source could impede future cooperation by sources, and could result in harassment or harm to such sources. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Henry G.

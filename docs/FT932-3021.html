			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / HJ Heinz moves to cut costs worldwide HJ HEINZ, the US food group, yesterday announced a range of cost-cutting moves, involving an 8 per cent reduction in its worldwide workforce of 35,500 and a cut in its UK operations. The company will take a Dollars 192m (Pounds 124m) pre-tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings to pay for the shake-up. Heinz's chairman, Mr Tony O'Reilly, claimed the latest restructuring charge would help Heinz speed up productivity improvements, and concentrate a three-year rationalisation programme into 12 months. Analysts, however, saw the action as further evidence of the pressures which the intensely-competitive retail sector is putting on the big consumer product companies. 'All the food companies are responding to the pressure by accelerating this sort of restructuring,' said Mr Les Pugh at Salomon Brothers in New York, noting that the anticipated operational efficiencies were not expected to bring much additional earnings growth. Specific changes include: shifts in manufacturing capacity between Canada and US; a reduction in operations in the UK, Italy, and in the Ore-Ida division; a cut of about 30 per cent, or 240 jobs, at a plant south of Melbourne, Australia; the consolidation of North American sales service functions in one Pittsburgh-based operation; and a merging of the US administrative back-up for Heinz Pet Products and Starkist, the tuna business. The charge meant that operating profits in the final three months of Heinz's financial year to April 28, fell to Dollars 54.8m, compared with Dollars 230.5m a year ago, on sales of Dollars 2.03bn (up from Dollars 1.87bn). For the full year, operating profits were down from Dollars 1.11bn to Dollars 860.9m, with sales rising from Dollars 6.58bn to Dollars 7.1bn. The cost-cutting will be spread across Heinz operations worldwide and, although the company declined to put a firm figure on the potential jobs losses, could prune the workforce by up to 3,000. At the end of its 1992 financial year, Heinz had 35,500 employees. The fourth-quarter operating profit of Dollars 54.8m translated into an after-tax surplus of Dollars 69.7m, compared with Dollars 145.7m a year ago. For the 12 months, Heinz' net profits stood at Dollars 396.3m, after a Dollars 133.6m charge for the adoption of the new accounting standard on post-retirement benefits. In 1991-2, the figure was Dollars 638.3m.</p>

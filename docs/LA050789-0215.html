			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIRING OF EX-GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CITED;  </P> <P> LINCOLN S&amp;L OWNER BUYS INFLUENCE, CRITICS CHARGE  </P> <P> It was November, 1985, and Charlie Keating was perturbed.  </P> <P> His company had bought Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine less than 2 years  earlier, and federal regulators were trying to curtail his use of new state and  federal laws that gave him wide discretion to invest S&amp;L money -- mainly  customer deposits -- in an array of ventures.  </P> <P> It was then that Keating offered a high-paying job to Edwin J. Gray, the  nation's top S&amp;L regulator at the time. Gray turned the job down flat. A  year later, he characterized it as a brazen attempt to "buy me out."  </P> <P> Others were not as quick to reject Keating's overtures. Since purchasing  Lincoln in 1984, the Phoenix financier has hired or retained at least a  half-dozen former state and federal government officials, including the head of  a regulatory team that was examining the thrift. Five years ago, he even  retained prominent economist Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the President's  Council of Economic Advisers who is now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.  </P> <P> Those hirings have become a major issue in the controversy surrounding Charles  H. Keating Jr., chairman of American Continental Corp.  </P> <P> On April 13, the Phoenix holding company filed for protection from creditors in  federal bankruptcy court. The next day, Lincoln was seized by regulators, who  claimed that the thrift was engaging in unsafe and unsound business practices.  </P> <P> Critics claim that Keating has used his political connections and financial  resources to buy influence in government circles. By contributing hundreds of  thousands of dollars to elected officials and by hiring former state and  federal agency officials to represent him, Keating kept regulators at bay while  he mismanaged Lincoln's assets for his own benefit, critics allege.  </P> <P> While the migration of government workers to positions in private industry is  not unique to American Continental, "I'm seeing this pattern in a very great  extreme with Lincoln," said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., industry consultant.  </P> <P> In the words of one federal regulator in San Francisco, "Keating stands in a  league of his own" when it comes to seeking political influence.  </P> <P> Whether it has worked is subject to debate.  </P> <P> "If he's trying to buy influence, he's wasted his money," said Roger Martin,  one of the three members of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in Washington,  which oversees the nation's federally insured savings and loans. Martin said  he's never encountered any "political interference" as a board member.  </P> <P> While Keating's campaign contributions may have gained him access to elected  politicians, his employment decisions have not been based on political  considerations, an American Continental spokesman said.  </P> <P> "That is absolutely not the intent at all," said Mark M. Connally, the  spokesman. Connally is the son of former Texas Gov. John B. Connally, whose  unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 was  managed by Keating at one point.  </P> <P> For instance, Connally said that Greenspan was retained at the suggestion of a  New York law firm that American Continental had retained to fight proposed  restrictions on the ability of thrifts to make direct investments in real  estate. The law firm decided it needed an expert to render an opinion on the  economic damage the restrictions would cause, he said, and Keating was not  trying to capitalize on Greenspan's political prominence.  </P> <P> Joseph Coyne, a Federal Reserve Board spokesman, said Greenspan was not in  government service at the time and was retained by Arthur L. Liman, the lawyer  handling the matter for American Continental.  </P> <P> Keating's political connections are being scrutinized as part of a lawsuit  recently filed on behalf of 22,000 bondholders who may have lost more than $250  million they invested in debt securities issued by American Continental.  </P> <P> The suit claims that Keating and other directors and officers of American  Continental perpetrated a "massive fraud" on unsuspecting, unsophisticated  investors. Many had gone to Lincoln offices with the intention of placing their  savings in insured certificates of deposits, but they were persuaded instead to  buy uninsured bonds issued by American Continental, the suit claims.  </P> <P> Connally said the company "absolutely denies" that it defrauded the  bondholders.  </P> <P> The suit is aimed at directors and officers, and the lawyers and accountants  who advised them. It is being handled by two of the lawyers who won more than  $70 million from advisers to convicted San Diego swindler J. David Dominelli,  who bilked millions of dollars from investors.  </P> <P> Keating and his cohorts, the suit alleges, tried to "cover their tracks and buy  extra time" over the last 5 years by hiring or retaining former government  officials who could use their connections to keep American Continental  operating while the company sold more bonds.  </P> <P> "Without the assistance of these and other paid professionals, the  multimillion-dollar scheme alleged in this complaint would not have been  possible," the suit states.  </P> <P> The lawsuit names only one former government official -- Franklin Tom -- as a  defendant.  </P> <P> Tom was commissioner of the California Department of Corporations when American  Continental obtained approval for a $200-million bond offering in December,  1986. After leaving office in March, 1987, he returned to private practice with  the Los Angeles law firm of Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara &amp; Samuelian.  </P> <P> In that capacity, he represented American Continental before the Department of  Corporations, which was then headed by his former assistant, Christine Bender.  She also had worked at the Los Angeles law firm, which is named as a defendant  in the suit.  </P> <P> "There are rules that govern the conduct of former state employees. Suffice it  to say, I did not breach any of those rules," Tom said.  </P> <P> "I have long represented clients at the Department of Corporations," he said.  "Certainly, my having spent 4 years as commissioner enhanced my technical  capability for later representing clients before the department. So it seems  perfectly in order for me to do so."  </P> <P> Tom said he had not been served with the lawsuit and could not comment on it.  </P> <P> Other government officials hired or retained by Keating are not named as  defendants in the suit. Except for Greenspan, the lawsuit identifies them only  by their former positions. But Ronald Rus of Orange and Joseph W. Cotchett of  Burlingame, the lawyers handling the suit, acknowledged that they are:  </P> <P> * Lawrence Taggart, former commissioner of the California Department of Savings  and Loan. On behalf of American Continental, Taggart lobbied state and federal  lawmakers in an effort to kill restrictions on new powers that allowed S&amp;Ls  to make direct investments in real estate ventures such as hotels, office  buildings and residential developments.  </P> <P> * John Rousselot, former U.S. congressman from San Gabriel who tried to buy  Lincoln before regulators seized it. After leaving the presidency of an  industry trade group last year, Rousselot was retained by American Continental  as a consultant to help with industry relations and to find a buyer for  Lincoln. Rousselot acknowledged that Keating -- like other Rousselot clients --  expected him to provide access and exercise influence with government  officials.  </P> <P> * A. Melvin McDonald, a former U.S. attorney in Phoenix. Since leaving his post  in 1985, McDonald has handled legal work for American Continental, including an  investigation into alleged leaks by regulators about confidential information  on the condition of Lincoln. McDonald said Keating is "absolutely not" using  him for any political purposes and called him the "most decent man I know."  </P> <P> * Joseph Kotrys, head of a 1986 examination team from the Federal Home Loan  Bank of San Francisco. Regulators in Washington threw out the team's report on  Lincoln after it was completed in 1988 and stripped the San Francisco office of  its supervisory responsibility for Lincoln. It is unclear what Kotrys' role in  the audit had to do with Washington's action. Kotrys, who now works for Lincoln  in Irvine handling regulatory compliance matters, said he approached Keating  for a job last year, long after he had finished his part of the examination. He  denied he was hired to exert influence with regulators, maintaining he had been  "too low on the totem pole" to have much clout.  </P> <P> The lawsuit also claims that one of the officials who helped buy time for  American Continental was a "former administrative assistant" to a U.S. senator,  an apparent reference to James Grogan, an American Continental staff lawyer who  is named as a defendant.  </P> <P> But Grogan's clout is questionable. He was never an administrative assistant.  While in college, he worked as an intern for 5 months in 1975 in U.S. Sen. John  Glenn's Washington office and later as an intern in one of the Democrat's Ohio  offices.  </P> <P> The suit also contends that Keating "enlisted the active assistance and  intervention of many public officeholders."  </P> <P> Those officeholders included five U.S. senators who met with regulators in  April, 1987, to question a lengthy regulatory examination of Lincoln's books.  The group consisted of Sens. Glenn, Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), John McCain  (R-Ariz.), Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich).  </P> <P> All five senators are from states in which American Continental and Lincoln  operate. The five had received more than $300,000 in campaign contributions  from Keating, his family and American and Lincoln executives.  </P> <P> Riegle later returned the $76,000 he had been given, saying at the time that he  wanted to avoid the appearance of a conflict since he was about to become  chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. The other senators, or their aides,  have said that they saw no potential conflicts and were simply helping a  constituent. McCain, however, has expressed concern that the meeting might  foster the appearance of impropriety.  </P> <P> Keating also used his political influence to propose or support friends for top  regulatory appointments. Connally said Keating pushed for the appointment of  Atlanta lawyer Lee H. Hinkel Jr. to one of two seats on the three-member  Federal Home Loan Bank Board in 1986. He also endorsed the nomination of George  J. Benston, then a University of Rochester (N.Y.) finance professor, for the  other seat.  </P> <P> Hinkel was appointed in the fall of 1986 by President Ronald Reagan, even  though he had acknowledged receiving $61.9 million in loans from Lincoln for  his real estate company. But he quit in early 1987 amid conflict-of-interest  charges after voting for a change in the real estate investment rules for  S&amp;Ls. Regulators said Lincoln would have benefited from the change, which  was rejected.  </P> <P> Benston's nomination was withdrawn. He had used funds from Keating to conduct  research on the S&amp;L industry, and concluded that the direct investments in  real estate that Keating favored were not the cause of the wave of S&amp;L  failures.  </P> <P> Keating also turned at times to the private sector to hire people in sensitive  positions, the lawsuit claims.  </P> <P> Last spring, Keating recruited Jack Atchison from the national accounting firm  of Arthur Young &amp; Co., then the company's independent auditor. Atchison was  the partner in charge of American Continental's account. Several months after  hiring Atchison, the company fired Arthur Young in a dispute over how to  account for a stock swap. Atchison, Arthur Young and two other major accounting  firms used by the company -- Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Touche, Ross &amp;  Co. -- also are named as defendants in the lawsuit.  </P> <P> Connally said none of the people identified in the suit were hired or retained  for political reasons.  </P> <P> American Continental already had retained the Parker Milliken firm before Tom  returned to his old firm from the Department of Corporations.  </P> <P> After leaving his government post, Taggart joined an old friend in a company  partially owned by Lincoln. Since his views were similar to Keating's, he was  "a natural" for American Continental to hire in the fight to maintain the rules  on direct investments, Connally said.  </P> <P> Keating's involvement with Greenspan and Benston arose from that same lobbying  effort. The New York law firm retained Greenspan as an expert on the economic  validity of the restrictions that regulators wanted to adopt. The law firm also  brought in Benston to do an economic study that resulted in a monograph  opposing the restrictions and validating the new powers.  </P> <P> Connally said that Kotrys and Atchison came to Keating looking for a job  because of their dissatisfaction with their previous jobs. Keating did not lure  them into the company, he said.  </P> <P> "We can't stop people from saying what they want to say," Connally said. "But  Charlie Keating was not buying influence."  </P></p>

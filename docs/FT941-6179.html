			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Fears grow over revival of Super 301 President Bill Clinton yesterday said he was still considering whether or not to issue an executive order to resurrect Super 301, a controversial trade measure designed to build pressure on 'unfair traders'. The renewal would be specifically targeted towards Japan to force it to open its markets. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokesman. said: 'Super 301 is an option, but no final decision has been made.' News reports yesterday that the president had decided to reinstate the provision were 'premature,' she said. On Capitol Hill there were reports that the president would move today after a meeting with his economic advisers yesterday. The administration has been debating renewal since the Clinton-Hosokawa summit last month when the two sides failed to agree on US demands for 'objective indicators' to measure import penetration in Japan. There is strong opposition to the renewal by the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management and the Budget. Sentiment from other senior officials ranges from unenthusiastic about Super 301 to frustration over the US-Japan stalemate and willingness to try any viable alternative. Many trade analysts believe Super 301 is more feared than effective because it has so many loopholes which the president can use to avoid imposing sanctions. 'There is nothing super about Super 301 except the rhetoric it evokes,' said Mr Tom Bayard, deputy director of the Institute for International Economics. The measure requires the trade representative to identify unfair traders and the 'priority' unfair practices to be eliminated during up to 18 months of talks. Super 301 was employed reluctantly by Mrs Carla Hills, the then US trade representative, in 1989 and 1990. Only three countries were singled out as 'unfair traders' - Japan, Brazil and India. Of the six 'priority practices' targeted for negotiation and possible sanctions under Super 301, four were resolved relatively successfully, Mr Bayard said. None of them resulted in sanctions. Three of those were with Japan which has since then increased imports of US supercomputers, wood products and satellites. India, designated as an unfair trader for its closed insurance industry and trade related investment practices, refused to negotiate. Brazil has done away with its quantitative import restrictions, but credit can be given to a change of governments as well as Super 301. According to Mr Bayard, Super 301's partial success rate is no better than that of Section 301, another form of unilateral pressure the US employs to open markets.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS  </P> <P> "Why are you sitting on the roof of the garage?" the Formidable Companion  asked.  </P> <P> "Trying to keep the alligators at an arm's length," we said.  </P> <P> She fixed us with a stare. Some explanation was clearly in order.  </P> <P> "Haven't you looked around, lately?" we said. "The world is going to  h-e-double-hockey-sticks in a handbasket."  </P> <P> "Always has, always will be," she said.  </P> <P> She was going to have to do better than that. We told her about Mr. Turner, our  next-door neighbor, sicking his pet on us that very morning. That was the last  straw.  </P> <P> "But it's a cat," she said.  </P> <P> "Not just a cat," we said. "A 17-pound irate tabby."  </P> <P> "Come down now," she said.  </P> <P> We told her to send up our easy chair. We were going to be here for a while.  </P> <P> "Give us one good reason to come down," we said. "Just one." It was growing  cold, but we still had a desire to be wooed in some way.  </P> <P> Because, she said, some part of us is still a child who would enjoy the Oakland  Ballet performing "The Nutcracker" at Smothers Theatre at Pepperdine University  in Malibu. Showtimes are 2 and 7 p.m. today, and admission is $22. For  information call (213) 456-4522.  </P> <P> Because, she said, when the world seems that serious a couple of  nyuk-nyuk-nyuks are in order, and the Three Stooges will be honored at a 60th  anniversary celebration at the Improv, 8162 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, at 7  p.m. Wednesday. Admission is free. For information call (213) 659-6400.  </P> <P> And because we wouldn't be up on the roof of the garage if we didn't care, and  Caring for Babies with AIDS will hold its fourth annual fund-raising walk at  Santa Monica Boulevard and Palm Drive in Beverly Hills, today at 8 a.m. A $15  donation is asked. For information call (213) 931-9828.  </P> <P> She had us. And so we came down for all those reasons, and the most important  one. Her. R.D.  </P></p>

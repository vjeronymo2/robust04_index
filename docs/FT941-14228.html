			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Milk board may sell two offshoots The Milk Marketing Board could be forced to hive off its artificial insemination section and its milk testing business to get government approval for its plans to transform itself into a farmers' co-operative. Genus, which provides advice and semen for breeding dairy cattle, could be floated off as an unlisted company or made into a government body. The business had a turnover last year of Pounds 35m with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4m. However, the future of National Milk Records is more problematic because it is closely integrated with the board's daily activities, according to Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive. He will head Milk Marque, as the new co-operative will be known, when the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales is opened to competition later this year. Mr Dare said: 'It would be quite a headache to split it off.' The flotation of Dairy Crest, the board's processing division, has been delayed from next month to June or July because of government objections over plans to reorganise the board. Options for separating both Genus and National Milk Records are under review. The board must decide by Monday whether to hive off both business units to satisfy government concerns about its dominant position in the market. Mr Dare will meet officials from the agriculture ministry on Monday to complete changes to plans for turning the board into Milk Marque. Government queries over the board's plans have delayed the introduction of competition into the milk market from April to either the beginning of August or October. Mr Dare said: 'I want to be able to prove that a properly managed and properly financed farmers' co-op can succeed. We have to get it right now.' Mr Dare has agreed with the government that the new body will have a capital base of Pounds 37.5m excluding Genus and National Milk Records. Apart from their future, all of the government's misgivings over the reorganisation have been cleared up, he said.</p>

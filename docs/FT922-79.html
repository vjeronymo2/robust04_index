			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / US states clear to curb abortion THE US Supreme Court yesterday gave state governments broad powers to restrict abortions but, by a 5-4 vote, stopped short of overturning its historic 1973 decision which gave women the right to terminate pregnancies. The decision to uphold most of the abortion limits in a Pennsylvania law was immediately denounced by both pro- and anti-abortion groups, who had been massing around the Supreme Court building during the past week. Pro-life forces condemned the court's failure to overturn Roe vs Wade, the decision which legalised abortion nationwide, and concentrated their fire on Justice David Souter, who had been appointed by President George Bush, an abortion opponent. In a departure from usual practice, Justice Souter spoke from the bench. 'To overrule (Roe) would subvert the court's legitimacy beyond any reasonable question,' he said. 'If the court were undermined, the country would also be.' This left in doubt the widespread assumption that the court, now composed overwhelmingly of conservative appointees, will eventually overturn Roe. As had been expected, four of the nine-member court - Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Byron White, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas - wanted an outright overturn of Roe. Justices Souter, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy staked out a middle ground, adopting a new test for abortion regulation. This would allow states to legislate restrictions which do not provide an 'absolute obstacle or severe limitation on the abortion decision'. The court then approved the following provisions in the Pennsylvania law: that women seeking abortions must be told about foetal development and abortion alternatives and must then wait 24 hours before the abortion; doctors must keep detailed abortion records; and unmarried girls, under 18, supported by their parents, must get the consent of one of their parents or a state judge. A provision requiring women to tell husbands about abortion plans was struck down.</p>

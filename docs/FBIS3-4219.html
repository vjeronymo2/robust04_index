			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tad Stoner] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong builders yesterday refused en masse to  tender for the latest Provisional Airport Authority (PAA)  contract. The tendering "strike" has thrown more than 100 other  bids due in the next few months into doubt. The move threatens  a Chek Lap Kok construction timetable already under severe  pressure, and could further increase the cost of the  multibillion-dollar project.    Failing to respond to a noon deadline yesterday for  construction of a temporary ferry pier, builders said new  contract conditions imposed on contractors by the PAA  "collectively push us over the line". The PAA hit back later in  the day, saying that similar conditions had been accepted  previously by other contractors, and that builders'  organisations had been briefed last year on PAA demands. "All  of them who prequalified (to tenders bids) have come in knowing  the conditions for the contracts," a PAA spokeswoman, Norma  Fung, said.    Peter Lam, president of the Hong Kong Construction  Association, representing the builders in the dispute, argued  the latest PAA documents were the first examined by his  organisation, and that it had subsequently recommended its 350  members "not take up" the terms sought by the PAA. He hoped  that the airport authority might agree to a compromise in the  near future. "They'll have to decide," he said. "They set out  conditions in which there are areas that are beyond our control.  Time is pressing, and we have suggested that it would be best  if we can come to some agreement."    The dispute centres on a series of potentially costly  obligations that make builders responsible for delays, design  changes, price rises in labour and materials and any damage  resulting from events such as ground settlement. Payments may  be withheld if the PAA judges work to be inadequate, the right  to arbitration is limited and project managers, normally  independent, will be paid by the authority. Builders say such  responsibilities are usually shared with the client, and that  without changes in the PAA's terms, tens of billions of dollars  in construction work could be stymied. "The result (of  yesterday's tender) speaks for itself," a construction-industry  source said. "The PAA has said they are not going to change the  terms," the source said. We'll just have to wait and see."    The next deadline is Thursday, when bids are due for  construction of temporary accommodation for workers at the Chek  Lap Kok site. "Some of these contracts can be delayed and some  cannot. Some are more important than others," Lam said. He  said that disruptions in early projects would affect later,  larger ones. He said it was "quite true" that without a  temporary ferry pier, materials and labour for the airport  terminal foundations could not be moved onto the island, and  that construction would be impeded without workers'  accommodation. "You'll have to ask the PAA about any delays,"  Lam said. "I'm sure it will boost costs, but if no one is going  to work for them, then the airport won't get built at all, and  if the airport has to be built, then something has to happen."  The PAA's Fung said that construction remained on schedule for  the moment.    Both Lam and Fung denied the situation was a stalemate.  "They said that some of the things made sense and that they  would be happy to look at them," Lam said. Fung said the  authority would seek talks with other airport employers. "As  the authority's conditions are generally consistent with those  of other airport core programme employers such as the government  and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation, it will be talking to  them before taking a final decision on the way forward," she  said.</p>

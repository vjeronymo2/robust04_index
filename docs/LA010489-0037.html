			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTO INSURANCE CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Although the automobile insurance companies profess to be seeking to hold down  costs, my recent experience indicates the contrary. The approach utilized by my  insurance company is structured to unnecessarily encourage higher repair costs  and thus "justify" higher insurance premiums and correspondingly greater  profits. The process needs to be changed if insurance costs are to be cut.  </P> <P> The higher than required expenditures result from the way the repair work is  authorized. After a recent accident, two bids of $1,100 and $1,000 were  obtained for repairing the damage to my vehicle. The company's adjuster  authorized $1,495. The company's instructions called for the insured (myself)  to take the adjuster's authorization to the repair shop, a mistake. The repair  shop then magically found additional work that had to be done which escalated  the cost up to the amount authorized, $1,494 in my case. Inasmuch as I knew my  insurance rates were going to go up because of the accident and not because of  an expenditure related to the cost of repairing my car, and the company  reimburses 100% of costs over the deductible, there was no motivation to keep  costs in line. The result is that those insured by the company are going to be  asked to indirectly pay for nearly $500 in unnecessary repair costs in the form  of higher premiums.  </P> <P> Had my insurance company structured its rates and reimbursement schedule to  provide for the insured to pay a percentage of the costs in addition to the  deductible, as is typically the case for most medical insurance, all parties  would have been better motivated to keep costs in line. The insurance companies  need to realize that unless they encourage cost savings, the pressure to  dictate an arbitrary premium reduction will continue unabated.  </P> <P> MICHAEL N.

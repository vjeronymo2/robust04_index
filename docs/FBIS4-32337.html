			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "r": "Whom Did Citizens of the Slovak Republic </F> Trust at the Beginning of June 1994?]    [Text] Bratislava--The group of citizens who do not trust  any figure on our political scene has grown again--from 25  percent in April to 42 percent at the beginning of June. The  first three places in the ranking of trustworthiness have been  occupied throughout this period by the same  politicians--Vladimir Meciar, Michal Kovac, and Jozef Moravcik.  This transpires from a public opinion survey conducted by the  Slovak Statistical Office at the beginning of June.    The survey ascertained considerable differences in the level  of confidence in political personalities between the residents  of Bratislava and the residents of other regions in Slovakia,  especially regarding the top places in the ranking. At the  beginning of June, 31 percent of Bratislava residents did not  trust any politician, which is 11 percent below the all-Slovak  average.    (The table below includes only the names of politicians who  were trusted by more than 2 percent of respondents in June.  Each respondent could name, at his own discretion, up to three  figures, which is why the sum total exceeds 100.)    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Trust of Slovak Republic Citizensin Politicians(in percent)                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Apr 94            |May 94            |Jun 94            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vladimir Meciar   |26                |20                |22                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Michal Kovac      |25                |18                |14                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jozef Moravcik    |25                |19                |13                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Peter Weiss       |13                |13                |8                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ivan Gasparovic   |8                 |10                |8                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jan Carnogursky   |4                 |6                 |4                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jozef Prokes      |5                 |3                 |4                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vojtech Bugar     |3                 |3                 |4                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Roman Kovac       |7                 |4                 |3                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mikulas Dzurinda  |2                 |3                 |3                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Brigita Schmogner-|--                |1                 |2                 |  |ova               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Milan Knazko      |1                 |2                 |2                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jan Luptak        |1                 |1                 |2                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |No one            |25                |35                |42                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      [Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 21 June on page  3 carries a 400-word TA SR report on the above survey, which  includes the following passage on the structure of supporters of  the three top-ranking politicians: ``Vladimir Meciar continues  to enjoy the greatest trust among Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS] sympathizers (68 percent of whom trust him), in  the group of citizens over 50 (28 percent), among blue-collar  workers (29 percent), and in central Slovakia (28 percent).    ``President Michal Kovac is a politician who enjoys the  stable trust of, in particular, Christian Democratic Movement  (30 percent) and Democratic Union [DU] (28 percent)  sympathizers, citizens of Hungarian nationality (28 percent),  university-educated people (20 percent), and Bratislava  residents (23 percent).    ``Also, citizens who trust Jozef Moravcik represent a more  or  less stable group in terms of their social and demographic  makeup.

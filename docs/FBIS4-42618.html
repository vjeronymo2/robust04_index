			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Olivier Alsteens and Luc Delfosse: "Shaky Seats </F> and a Prime Minister on the Move"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Goodbye Jean-Luc, We Were Fond  of You    A sixth poll section was devoted to the future of Jean-Luc  Dehaene and, as the cherry on the cake, to his possible  appointment as head of the European Commission to replace  Jacques Delors.    Is such promotion really a good idea?    Don't know is the response of 23 percent of French-speakers  and 24 percent of the Flemish.    A perfect balance (33 percent) between the north and south  of  the country for those who believe it would "be a good thing for  Europe."    Just 19 percent of French-speakers and 24 percent of the  Flemish believe this move by the prime minister "would be a bad  thing for Europe."    And the consequences for Belgium? Eighteen percent of  French-speakers and almost twice as many Flemish believe the  appointment would be good for Belgium and respectively 17  percent and 22 percent believe the contrary.    How should we interpret these results?    We could cheerfully assume that 18 percent of  French-speakers  and 33 percent of the Flemish believe that Belgium will be  better defended at European level. Whereas 17 percent and 22  percent believe the opposite. We should bear in mind, however,  that of the respondents who answered the two questions, 75  percent of those who said that it would be "a good thing for  Belgium" believe that it would also be good for Europe. The  other 25 percent see it as "a bad thing for Europe." We can  assume that the latter are not committed supporters of the prime  minister and that he should, in a way, "go anywhere as long as  he goes."    But there is another way of reading the figures. Eighteen  percent of French-speakers and 33 percent of the Flemish are  delighted at the prospect of Jean-Luc Dehaene's departure. Or,  on the contrary, 82 percent of French-speakers will regret his  departure, as will 67 percent of the Flemish. When we said he  was popular.</p>

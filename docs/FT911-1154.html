			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Borrowers tap high-yield sectors A SPREAD of deals in high-yield currencies was launched in the international bond market yesterday, as borrowers hurried to place paper before the US Treasury bond auctions, which began yesterday, and this week's European public holidays. Credit Local, the French local authority funding vehicle, was the latest borrower to tap the developing lira sector of the market, with a L150bn deal, lead managed by Instituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino. It offered five-year paper carrying a coupon of 12.2 per cent. The fees structure caused several leading firms to decline to participate. Full fees of 15 basis points were said to be inadequate return on capital. Even so, demand from institutional investors proved strong and the deal traded above its fixed re-offer price of 100.25. Yorkshire Building Society became the third UK building society to tap the sterling floating rate note sector since issuance was reopened in April. Yorkshire added a fungible Pounds 100m to its outstanding Pounds 100m issue maturing in 1994. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew handled the issue as a bought deal, charging full fees of 10 basis points. The fee structure pleased firms which had argued for higher underwriting fees in the fragile sector. Several houses had declined to participate in the two earlier deals, for the Woolwich and Cheltenham and Gloucester building societies because the underwriting fees, at four basis points and eight basis points respectively, were seen as not compensating the risk. In the Australian dollar sector, the Western Australian Treasury Corporation made a debut ADollars 100m seven-year issue lead-managed by Hambros. The paper carries a coupon of 12 per cent and was priced at 101.80. It found easy placement with investors attracted by the triple-A rated, sovereign name. However, for other natural Australian dollar borrowers the Euromarket looks increasingly expensive. Yesterday, for example, GECC placed ADollars 100m of bonds in the US market, with a coupon of 10 3/4 per cent and an issue price of par.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Banc One plan on assets approved US REGULATORS yesterday granted permission for Banc One, the Ohio-based super-regional banking group, to take over Dollars 1bn of assets from seven failed banks in the state of New Hampshire. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the agency which insures deposits in US banks, agreed to a proposal from Banc One that its management and consulting subsidiary administer and liquidate two separate asset pools. The pools are made up primarily of the banks' classified assets, repossessed real estate, subsidiaries and unwanted premises. The FDIC has acted as receiver since the banks failed in October last year. Under the terms of the agreement, the Banc One unit will attempt to recover as much as possible from the pool over five years while minimising costs. During that period, the FDIC will pay the expenses of managing and servicing the assets.</p>
